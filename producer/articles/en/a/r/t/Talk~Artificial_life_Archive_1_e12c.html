<p>In the first sentence, "human-made analogs"; shouldn't it be "analogues". I'm not too sure though.</p>
<p>There is nothing (I know of) that says that artificial (read intelligent) life cannot be a result of a neural net, artificial or not, either simulated in programmes or physically laid out. I did not add the neural network reference, but I don't see why you are dismissing it out of hand. Could you explain your position a bit more fully? - Reigh</p>
<p>Ehr. I dont agree with that! Life does not have to be intelligent - intelligence does not have to be incorporated into life. An neural network does not create children, instead it augments itself. Neural networks dosnt have any need for any incoming energy (food), and could therefor not be considerd to be alive in the TRADITIONAL meaning. A neural network is a mind without a body - that is no life, it is just an mind. what <i>exactly</i> is life? (i dont belive in life) - <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmaffy_ff49.html" title="User:Smaffy">smaffy</a></p>
<p>First of all the fact that something does not have children does not mean that the element is not alive. Also from historical reasons, Neural Nets ARE part of the Artificial Life research. Neural Nets articles are a tool used by people in Artificial Life, and often a medium of research. Articles on Neural Nets, are part of an Artificial Life conference. So, I put it back. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_speroni_516d.html" title="User:Pietro speroni">Pietro</a></p>

<p>The phrase <i>particularly well defined</i> doesn't make sense to me in:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The field is particularly well defined by the tools it uses"</li>
</ul>
<p>Could we just say</p>
<ul>
<li>"The field uses" ...</li>
<li>"The field is defined by the tools it uses", or</li>
<li>"The field is associated with tools it uses"</li>

<p>Quick request... can someone knowledgeable disambiguate the "<a href="../../../r/e/v/Reversible.html" title="Reversible">reversible</a>" link in "Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were reversible" under the 1970s-1980s section? It is not obvious to me whether it means reversible like a physical process or like a mathematical function, so it's not trivial for a random person to be able to disambiguate it themselves from the link.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Error: Free University of Brussels termite simulation?</span></h2>
<p>I've been researching the termite simulation that was done by the Free University of Brussels, and according to everything that I've found, the simulation consisted of creating differential equations to model the the construction of termite mounds, not "They wrote a script describing the behavior of termites, then modified the environment and watched the way that the simulated, script-driven insects reacted" as stated in the article.</p>
<p>The paper I'm referring to is "A model for the emergence of pillars, walls and royal chambers in termite nests" located at <a href="http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/4H8ACMVWRN4RW1L4FATN/Contributions/Y/T/P/U/YTPU13GT3GUX75TC.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/4H8ACMVWRN4RW1L4FATN/Contributions/Y/T/P/U/YTPU13GT3GUX75TC.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/4H8ACMVWRN4RW1L4FATN/Contributions/Y/T/P/U/YTPU13GT3GUX75TC.pdf</a></p>
<p>In the discussion section at the end of the paper, under "Limitations of the model", it states:</p>
<p>2. Given its formulation in partial differential equations, the model cannot accurately describe individual behaviour.</p>
<p>This would suggest that there is an error in the Wikipedia entry. However, given that this is an entry which has been copied verbatim to and from several online encyclopedias, I'll put this up for discussion before trying to change anything.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Group behaviour self-optimisation system creates soccer players specializations</span></h2>
<p>Could anyone please write an article about application of step-by-step group behaviour self-optimization (neuron) algorithms to the football (soccer) game emulation?</p>
<p>I read somewhere that an institute carried out such research/experiment (in UK, USA, or in Russia), by creating a field, two gates, virtual ball and two groups of agents (two teams), and the basic rules of goal scoring and accounting (there was no arbiter agent). It was quite a while ago, so I can not remember whether I explain the experiment precisely.</p>
<p>At the time of firts turn, all players/agents had no specialisations and did not "know" how to behave themselves. All of them were given multiple chaotiс movement impulses until a ball was somehow crossing one of the gate lines. Winning team of agents was "learning" their experience, adjusting their behaviour pattern (neuron chain reaction), while the losing team discarded their actions in the game as unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After many, many turns of such learning and "evolution", not only virtual teams of agents became experienced in winning matches and scoaring goals. Both teams' agents were naturally gaining specialisations, that were created consciously by human for the current version of football (soccer): 1) Goalkeeper, 2) Defense players, 3) Midfielders, 4) Offense players.</p>
<p>Since I can not find through search systems original source/insitution of this research, I would like to ask people from the community for help. (By DenisRS, 7th August, 2005.)</p>
<p>(Of course, I did not mean any robotic football competitions and championships; I meant strictly virtual computer programmed self-organization system experiment.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Seperation and rewriting</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that there are two areas that are trying to be conveyed by the same article. The main article describes the history of what I would term software AL. Things like cellular autonoma, etc.</p>
<p>Then the "see also" links to what I would call engineering AL. This would involve physically creating a new life form, robotics, etc.</p>
<p>I think the article should be split and expanded along those two paths.</p>
<p>I don't think software AL should follow a chronological organization. Perhaps start with a more standard outline of the different techniques in the field. Cellular autonoma, theoretical biology, agent based models, etc., moving into the chronological history much later.</p>
<p>There really aren't any encyclopedic articles on artificial life on the internet that I think are of high quality, a concerted effort of pulling from different sites to provide a high quality introduction I think would be a worthwhile goal.</p>

<dd>I too am not particularly happy with the present layout. But before splitting it I would suggest to migrate the information about each main researcher in its own page. Like this it seems like a summary of a book on artificial life. Also many of those researchers have made contributions in other fields, so it would make sense to give them their stand alone page, and just link there, if necessary. We could just add a list of scientist per discipline, in case. Once this is done, the history will feel much lighter, and we can consider (if, and in case) how to split.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 18:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know that I like the idea of a list, at least not <b>just</b> a list, as I think that's part of what the current problem is with the current page (too many lists).

<dd>About the division, there are a number of ways to split this article. Personally I think the most natural one would be between strong alife, and weak alife. But then strong alife means anything that tries to recreate life. As such some CA would be there, some wet alife would be there too. On the other hand robotics would be not so much there, since robots are generally understood as just trying to implement one aspect of life (like motion, or sensor/decision) and not the most basic feature, like: self healing; metabolism; evolution...--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 18:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Strong and weak Alife as far as I understand is more a behind-the-scenes motivation than an actual difference between methods. CA could quite easily be either strong or weak alife simply by how the scientist/hobbyist views it, so I don't think it's a practical method for splitting the article. I think making the page into something similar to the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> or <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> pages would be optimal. --<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumsgil_39ea.html" title="User:Numsgil">Numsgil</a> 19:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am really weary about a division in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, or in any way that too close mirrors other divisions in science. AL has often been a point for scientist of different disciplines to meet, and this should be represented in the way in which the page is presented. Natural sub parts (but not apartition) are in general seen as: wet, weak, strong, robotics, ac (artificial chemistries, who already have their page), ca (who have their page), agent based models, tierra models, language models. Some of those mirror science division: wet-biology and chemistry; language models-linguistic; robotics-engineeristic and other. The whole field have an incredible amount of cross pollination between subfields. Any division would make the topic more superficial. Also consider how there are many pages on internet way more complex or longer than this.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 05:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure, but I don't think you're understanding what I'm meaning (assuming you're replying to me). I mean that the layout of this page should be similar to the layout of the biology and physics pages, ie: a prepatory article designed to introduce lay people to more specific sections of the category. --<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumsgil_39ea.html" title="User:Numsgil">Numsgil</a> 05:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aha! Yes, now I understand, yes I do agree totally that we should strive for that! Also there is a cool quote form (I think) von Neuman who sais that he thinks nothing can be intelligent if it is not alive (or similar). The quote helped move the interest from AI to AL. I see if I can dig it.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 05:56, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Addendum</b>: please read the section above on possible copyright violation, in this page. I was quite right about the sources and format of the historical section.

<dd>Doesn't Catherine above say that she herself wrote the article, and that the other site was probably copying from her? --<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumsgil_39ea.html" title="User:Numsgil">Numsgil</a> 05:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>she does. Said that copyright covers also summaries [<a href="http://www.whatiscopyright.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whatiscopyright.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], yet this is still not the reason why I was wondering if we should take it off. More like the sensation that the whole part did not resonate at all with what you want from the general page of a field. If you look at other fields they do have the history, but in a separate page. And still this history in a scientist by scientist way seems too detailed, and missing the general breath we should give to this article. An historical part made up of what were the challenges, and the general aims seems more appropriate. As I said, this seems taken from a journalistic book about the subject. Not from an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 05:56, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opinion of Biologists</span></h2>
<p>It is not correct to say that the field of Artificial Life has "has not generally received much attention from biologists." The fact is that Eörs Szathmáry, a close associate (and seeming heir apparent of Maynard-Smith) is one such biologist who regularly attends academic conferences related to the field.</p>

<dd>“One reason why we find it so hard to understand the development of form may be that we do not make machines that develop: often we understand biological phenomena only when we have invented machines with similar properties … and we do not make ‘embryo’ machines”.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition in intro</span></h2>
<p>I think the recent additions to the intro are too specific and give an inaccurate summary of the field: <i>"...evolving software that is more alive than a virus. Theoretically later it will become intelligent life [Strong AI]."</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Much a-life does not require "evolving software" — swarm intelligence, cellular automata, etc. ("evolution" is a loaded word in this context and should be avoided if the actual mechanism or analog of evolution is not intended)</li>
<li>Is the (biological) virus threshold of "more alive" widely accepted?</li>
<li>Without a reference, the "Theoretically later..." sentence seems like speculation.</li>
</ol>

<p>While there may be a few exceptions, most life is made of existing life. If patterns replicate in cellular automata, and they dont adapt, they're only a virus. If they do adapt, then some of them are better than others and those are kept while others are discarded, and thats evolution. Of course they dont have to be discarded, but thats just chaos, not life.</p>
<p>"Theoretically later" is supposed to be speculation because we have no facts about the future, but its obvious thats the direction its going, to merge with Strong AI.</p>
<p>About the 2 Strong AI links. All Strong AI is Strong ALife, but not all Strong ALife is Strong AI. Maybe I shouldnt have added the second link. But is there a closer synonym?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The difinition of life</span></h2>
<p>There is a great theoretical book which adresses the definition of life. If anyone is interested, it's called "The principles of life" by Tibor Ganti.</p>
