<dd>It is customary to wait a fair amount of time after an AFD ends with a "keep" result before renominating. See <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#If you disagree with the consensus</a>. While there is no "official" period of time that must elapse before a renomination is made, many people consider a period of six months to be a minimum. A renomination made within a few months of the original AFD is likely to be closed early as a "speedy keep". There is no policy or guideline that a user may not inform other users of an ongoing AFD. On the contrary, there are several <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProjects</a> and notice boards designed to inform users of, among other things, AFDs on articles that may interest them. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 22:26, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am pretty aware of the rules and contrary to some heated opinions I am not a troll. I will renominate only if I decide that the vote was skewed by Pascuale. His position that all of us voting here are voting just besause "we like or don't like it" is deplorable. Unlike those who "like it", I provided serious arguments why these pages are wrong place. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:31, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>NOTE: It is only fair to warn long-time users and contributors to a certain page that that page has come under attack. This is not skewing the vote, as I had no idea how those users would actually vote. Surely, we don't want an article's fate to be decided by people who have just stumbled into it for the first time and didn't like it! The users and contributors I warned are in no way "my colleagues" any more than any other Wikipedia users, but are indeed users who have repeatedly contributed to that page. (And, in any case, at least eight "Keep" votes so far are from users I have not contacted and whose names I have never heard, while at least one that I contacted -- <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Aecis</a> -- has voted the other way. Check my user contributions for confirmation.) I am in no way "the main opponent" here. I simply consider myself responsible because I unwittingly alerted this attacker to the existence of these pages, which he has then IMMEDIATELY nominated for deletion. Is this not troll behavior?

<dd>I'd like to offer a little unsolicited advice to both aggrieved parties and hope it is taken in the spirit it is given. (With love, kindness, and pixie dust) I have often gotten into a tizzy over <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">certain</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">articles</a> and as a result, have come to the conclusion that the emotional expenditure is <b>just not worth it</b>.</dd>
<dd>It's not worth raising your blood pressure, or upsetting you, or ruining your evening. It's not worth ruining your digestion, or your after-dinner cocktail, your birthday, or whatever is happening in your <b>real</b> life. Don't let the users' behavior on the Wikipedia get to you. Because it doesn't matter.</dd>
<dd>That's right - it doesn't <b>really</b> matter, that much, does it? I would hate to lose this information to the Wiktionary, but really, what does it matter? If you think it SHOULD be in the Wiktionary, and it stays in the Wikipedia - what difference does that make to your life? You might never have run across it. Take this pent up frustration and go for a run, or volunteer at a hospital, or hug your kids. Do something worthwhile and uncontroversial.</dd>
<dd>Once again, I hope not to get too preachy, but I think we often escalate conflicts just because we're in conflict, not for substantive reasons. At least, that's what I do. All the best to both of you. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanlovejoy_4999.html" title="User:Danlovejoy">Danlovejoy</a> 13:45, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He's entitled to his opinion that this information is more appropriate at Wiktionary than here--he never claimed the information isn't useful, merely that it's in the wrong place. The information will be just as usable by linguists, historians, toponymists, and other social scientists at Wiktionary as it is here. Mikka has done nothing warranting censure or banning from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 17:53, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Angr, by "Johnny-come-lately" I meant "Johnny-come-lately" to these particular lists. It is obvious that <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikka</a> has just stumbled into these lists. He first made some remarks the other day on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_a1b6.html" title="Talk:List of European regions with alternative names">Talk:List of European regions with alternative names</a>, denigrating and ridiculing that particular list. I explained to him that that list closely parallels others, such as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a>, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_cities_with_alternative_names_c059.html" title="List of European cities with alternative names">List of European cities with alternative names</a>, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, all of which he was not aware of, and so what does he do? He turns around and advocates for the deletion of all these pages, whose existence he has just become aware of. Maybe I am not a very bold Wikipedia contributor, but I would never even think of doing something like that. And, yes, I do find this behavior extremely objectionable and censurable. Frankly, I am amazed that you fail to see how inconsiderate this is. To me, it would be as if someone with no interest in linguistic reconstruction should argue for the deletion of your <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Celtic_language_a609.html" title="Proto-Celtic language">Proto-Celtic language</a> article. I think it's truly insane! And, furthermore, it is idiotic to buttress this kind of argumentation by ridiculing the notion that someone just might want to know what Zimbabwe is called in Finnish (see below). Should I be ashamed if I wanted to look up all the names Zimbabwe has in as many languages as has been possible to collect in one place by Wikipedia users? Please tell me: Should I be ashamed? I stand by my above comment. I think it is extremely called-for. And as for the Wiktionary, personally, I never use it. And I truly doubt anyone would ever look up Zimbabwe in the Wiktionary. One final thing, Angr: You just added the Bân-lâm, Breton, Esperanto, Lojban, and Japanese names for <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_e62e.html" title="Basque Country">Basque Country</a> to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a> for the simple reason that the same names already appeared in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a>, and now you don't have the guts to break a lance for these lists which are being threatened by a wolf in sheep's clothing (namely, a vandal camouflaged as a serious Wikipedia contributor). In fact, you seem to be taking his side! I am very disappointed in you. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:07, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not taking any sides in this particular discussion; you may have noticed I haven't voted. (Incidentally, neither have you, technically.) I was defending his right to make the AFD, not supporting the AFD itself. Yes, I am still editing these lists because there is a good chance they will be kept. Yes, I have found these lists to be very interesting, and have been quite active in editing them. Nevertheless I can also see that what they cover is really more Wiktionary's jurisdiction than Wikipedia's. If <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Celtic_language_a609.html" title="Proto-Celtic language">Proto-Celtic language</a> were to be deleted, the information would be completely lost, because there's nowhere else to put it. This information will <i>not</i> be lost if this AFD results in a delete; it will just be transferred to Wiktionary. You say you don't use Wiktionary; that's easily enough remedied: just go to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">wikt:Main Page</a> and sign up. Finally, making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against the nominator of an AFD is not going to win people over to want to support your side. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 21:50, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Angr, if I haven't voted, I guess it's because I don't know how to. Where do I send in my ballot? And as for you, I know full well that you have repeatedly contributed to these lists and do find them useful, except that now you suddenly seem to have such little interest in them that you can't bring yourself to take sides. I am sorry, but that's what Pontius Pilate did. And, by the way, I am not making any <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> here. I am being very objective. If you read carefully what I wrote, you will see that I am simply reporting facts. To someone who just came across this AFD, it may not be apparent that its nominator had just stumbled into all these lists and, having found them of no use to himself, and having repeatedly ridiculed them and their users, promptly filed a petition to delete them. This is simply an abuse and if you don't recognize it, then I simply don't understand how your mind works or what you're doing to protect the Wikipedia content. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 22:18, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To vote, all you have to do is type "<b>keep</b>" or "<b>delete</b>" and a brief summary of your reason, anywhere on this page. I do still have an interest in this information, but I'm willing to entertain the suggestion that it's more appropriate at Wiktionary than Wikipedia. Calling Mikka "a vandal camouflaged as a serious Wikipedia contributor" is most certainly a personal attack. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 07:02, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I beg to disagree, Angr. Words, as you know, have objective meanings after all. To me, "vandal" is someone who wishes to destroy something without rhyme or reason, in this particular case, with barely any knowledge or familiarity with the object of his vandalism. You seem to think I am using words as expletives or gratuitous accusations. I am not. I am trying to offer an objective assessment of what's going on here and now. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 15:47, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maintainability isn't an issue; Wikipedia is just as easy to maintain as Wiktionary. Easier, probably, because there are more people at Wikipedia to keep an eye on things.

<dd>Did you have a chance to look at the page I listed for comparison? The maintainaability '<b>is</b> most definitely the issue. Also, wiktionary is a good place to talk about etymologies of the names. As for more people, don't forget there is also more articles. I contributed about hundred geographical articles (towns, rivers, mountains, etc.) and edited may not less than a thousand ones, and only recently I stumbled upon these lists. I immediately noticed their usefulness and <b>invisiblity</b> at the same time. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:11, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Belarussian wikipedia is a playground of belarussian russophobic nationalists with archaic ideas to roll back the Russian influence in Belarussian language. I even don't bother to contribute there. "Ангельшчына" is a colloquial term, loosely translated as "land of Englishmen", a standard Slavic construction, and indeed is in informal use, but no way it is the name oif the country. Just try to google "Ангельшчына" (185) vs "Англiя" (44,900). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:11, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Zimbabwe part is an polemic fugure in the context that the missing List of historical country names would be of encyclopedic value, rather than of dictionary value, and hence is relevant to wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:34, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Don't blame me, EDM. I did not pick this fight. I would never nominate for deletion a page, adding a broad reference to several other similar pages (which someone else has since removed), within MINUTES of becoming aware of their existence, and proposing what? The dispersal of compact information among hundreds, indeed thousands, of wiktionary pages! Imagine, for example, clicking Angrapa -- a river listed in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a> -- in the wiktionary to find that its name is <b>Angrapa</b> (Russian), <b>Węgorapa</b> (Polish)! This is what is being proposed here. If this is not lunacy, I don't know what is.

<li><b>Neutral</b>, but I just want to say that I have had many a conversation with Mikkalai, and have always found him very polite, reasonable and helpful - a Good Wikipedian, in short. While I do think that it is all right to inform people who have worked on an article about its deletion, the way Pasquale did it is completely inappropriate - at least on <a href="../../../a/v/a/User_talk%7EAvala_8e78.html" title="User talk:Avala">Avala</a>'s talk page (which is how I found out about it) he wrote that the articles <i>have come under attack by a certain <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikka</a>, who, having just stumbled into all these lists, having found them of little use to himself, and having repeatedly ridiculed them and their users, has then promptly filed a petition to delete the lists in question</i>. I don't think that people "informed" in such a way will vote fairly, so either their votes should not count, or Mikkalai should be allowed to repeat the vote after less than six months, without such interference. By the way, I'd probably voted <i>keep</i> had this not happen in such a way. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

If it is the tone, I truly do offer my humblest apologies for offending your sensibilities. If it is the substance of it, then, I am sorry, with all due respect, I stand by what I wrote to the letter, because that is EXACTLY what happened. And what good is your opinion, anyway, if it is affected by perception rather than substance?
