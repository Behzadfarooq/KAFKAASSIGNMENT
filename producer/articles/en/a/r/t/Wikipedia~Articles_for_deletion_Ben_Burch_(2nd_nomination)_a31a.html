EDIT: After reading the talk page for the article, being mentioned in Salon as well as a source for published books seems to reach levels of notability that I can't disagree with.

<dd>Whats wrong? Ben Burch, by his own statements attests that he is not notable. He just doesn’t fit the bill for those important enough to be listed in a encyclopedia. Given his accomplishments to-date will he be remembered in 100 years? What about another benchmark... if I asked 10,000 people on the street who "Ben Burch" was, would any of them know anything? Maybe Mr. Burch will become one of the most influential people of the 21st century. But we can't judge the articles worthiness on "maybes."

<dd>You're right. Burch is pretty much an unknown outside a small group of people. I would guess that most on DU and the opposing website CU know about him and his website. There is a minority that have heard of him on FR. However, one of the criteria to determine whether to keep an article or not is whether they contribute regularly in a publication that reaches 5000+ individuals. I would argue that that number is too low, but AVN's circulation number of 40,000 and that he contributes monthly qualifies him.--<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinOne4TheGipper_5997.html" title="User:WinOne4TheGipper">WinOne4TheGipper</a> 22:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
