<p>Started out as a vanity article by "Vonbluvens" himself, but has since been turned into a mug slinging match between his friends and foes on blogs and forums. Definately not notable enough for an encyclopedia. He made local media ONCE, but that hardly makes one noteworthy enough for an encyclopedia entry.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_Movement_%28United_States%29_66fd.html" title="National Socialist Movement (United States)">National Socialist Movement (United States)</a>. Not noteworthy enough for a separate article. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:18, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>Keep</s>. Vonbluvens is a well-known figure in the field, hosting a long-time internet radio show. Given the fluid nature of fringe politics (he's now feuding with the VNN, with whom he formerly worked) Vonbluvens may not stay attached to the NSM which makes merging with that article is problematic. The story made more than the local media, and he is considered important by websites that watch neo-Nazis. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for informing me. Given that I'm privately no fan of the white supremacist movement I'm rather pleased to learn about its fractiousness. However my standards as an editor remain unbiased: he <i>is</i> part of the larger organization. His greatest claim to outside media attention happened years ago when his wife hung a swastika flag inside their family home day care center. In no context would that merit a separate biographic article. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 01:29, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I really see this as marginal. He may not be notable enough, but I'm bothered by what looks like a nomination to delete being based on the controversy over the article. I'd like to see more discussion before I vote. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 01:32, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may not have noticed that the controversy is centered around the inclusion of non-encyclopediac information, which is what this request for deletion is based upon. Almost none of the information presented as "fact" is verifiable by any trusted source. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> even goes so far as to rely on blogs and forums as authorative encylopediac sources. Being subject to "controversy" should not prevent this Afd from equal consideration. 196.207.45.254 06:46, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FYIBlogs and forums are listed in the external links section, but have not been used as sources, to the best of my knowledge, except as sources for themselves (i.e. that Vonbluvens posts to those sites). -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 07:06, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apply uniform standards for noteworthiness regardless of whether I agree with the subject. I have voted for the deletion of individual veteran memorials, which pains me because I am a war veteran myself. Here I see evidence that the organization is notable but the individual insufficiently so. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:08, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Actually VonBluvens has made the news on more than one occassion including being kicked out of a neighbourhood watch organization for his nazi beliefs. His hosting a numbe of media shows as well as frequent clashes with fellow white supremicists has made him a well known and notateble figure in the neo nazi arena. 14211022732 15 Nov 2005 <small>(142.110.227.32 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.110.227.32.html" title="User talk:142.110.227.32">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.110.227.32_1c89.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.110.227.32">contribs</a>))</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> VonBluvens has been a noteworthy player in the neo nazi movement for about 8 years. I think he warrents an entry. And as willmcw states he may not stay with the NSM. VonBluvens has a history of making enemies and burning bridges (NIM, VNN, Hal Turner) so it is a real posibility he may split with the NSM. Thus the article should not be merged. 15 Nov 2005 <small>(198.53.150.56 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.53.150.56_57cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.53.150.56">contribs</a>))</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This vote originally was supposedly signed by 142.110.227.32 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.110.227.32.html" title="User talk:142.110.227.32">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.110.227.32_1c89.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.110.227.32">contribs</a>), although the history shows that the editor was 198.53.150.56 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.53.150.56_57cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.53.150.56">contribs</a>).

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_Movement_%28United_States%29_66fd.html" title="National Socialist Movement (United States)">National Socialist Movement (United States)</a>. Not notable enough for seperate entry but can be mentioned on the NSM page. 196.207.45.254 16:01, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> seems interesting enough.
