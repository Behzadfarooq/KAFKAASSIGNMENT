<p>This looks like a school. The article lacks any notable references and even has no references or links at all!! It seems vanity to me. I do not think we keep articles about every high school. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBeralighthand_0b55.html" title="User:Beralighthand">Beralighthand</a> 14:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC) <small>user's 3rd edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Beralighthand" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Beralighthand" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></small></p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Beralighthand, High Schools are notable. Also on a side note, you have not been on Wikipedia long be sure you know what you are doing before you nominate, in fact you only started editing today. A user should have more Wikipedia experience before nominating anything for AfD. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 14:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> says, "Anyone except blocked users is welcome to participate in nominating articles for deletion or discussion of existing nominations".

<li>It should, but unfortunately is not, this is an example where a new user nominated an article before fully knowing the criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 14:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Absolutely agree with Agent; see also <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. It is also altogether likely that a user who properly nominates an article for deletion on the day he arrives is somewhat familiar with the project from his having contributed anonymously/under a different account, such that the ascription of the term <i>new user</i> (especially where intended derisively) is inappropriate. In any case, the question of the notability of secondary schools is probably well-settled (notwithstanding that some, as I, disagree with a categorical rule, as evidenced by some users' supporting <i>delete</i>), but it's eminently unlikely that even a longtime user who doesn't frequent AfD would be cognizant of the relevant history, and, so, where a nomination is sincerely essayed (with encyclopedic purpose in mind), it seems better to advise than to upbraid the nominator, especially where an AfD isn't particularly disruptive; our discussing an issue a bit more isn't harmful. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There <i>is</i> an overwhelming predecent established over the past 2 years where not a single, verifiable high school article has been excised from wikipedia. Remember, this is a discussion. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenji64_138b.html" title="User:Benji64">Benji64</a> never said he was stating a "policy", he was giving the rationale behind his vote - which is that there is a clear precedent that high school articles are not deleted through the deletion processes on Wikipedia. Stating that no high schools are deleted is not "proof by repeated assertion", it is a <b>fact</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> clearly shows the results since January of 2005 (as I am sure you are well aware). I would also like to note, since you referred to it another AfD discussion, that <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_High_schools_938a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/High schools">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/High schools</a> includes many nominations from the year 2004 which ARE NOT high schools (despite the title) and that the great majority of high schools which are listed on that page that were indeed deleted have since been re-created and in some cases survived subsequent AfD discussions. With all due respect, the only "proof by repeated assertion" that I see in this context is that you have stated mulitple times that it isn't true that high schools are not deleted, however as the record shows, high school articles are indeed not deleted through deletion processes on wikipedia (obviously hoax, copyvio or non-verifiable schools notwithstanding).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom and Dpbsmith (I also agree with Benji that (blindly) keeping all school articles is, ahem, bs, but disagree that we are bound by any "precedent"). There is no inherent notability for schools. Each school article ought to be judged on its <i>own</i> merits.
