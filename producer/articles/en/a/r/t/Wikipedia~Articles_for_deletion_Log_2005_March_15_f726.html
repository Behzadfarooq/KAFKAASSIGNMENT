<li><b>Delete</b> Vanity Page Article created by Daniel C.Boyer in Dec.2003 to promote his friend, the surrealist Pierre Petiot the author of, "Surrealism and the Machine", a theoretical essay that is supported only by Boyer and his friends(also vanity mention of another Boyer friend, Richard Genovese).

<li>The <b>Merge</b> vote appears to be the most appropriate from the feedback on here.

<li>An article would be nice, but a stub stating the obvious (that Christian poetry is poetry with a Christian theme) is not, and neither is a list of Christian poets considering the ubiquity of Christan mythology in pre-contemporary European/American art. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:10, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't quite follow you. What is unfair here? Did you see me voting three times for this article? Sorry but I really don't get it. I hold that the topic even as rewritten is unencyclopedic, hence my vote. As it stands it is turning into a 'list of poets who use reference to Christain mythology' which is not informative since that applies to almost every western poet. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:25, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If I understand deletion policy correctly, then the new article is <i>not up for deletion</i> right now. The old VfD was resolved when it was speedy deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Local sporting organizations are notable. Particularly so ones in major towns like this.</i> Add to that the fact that Ballarat is right at the heart of one of the world's major cricketing centres. The BCA is big enough to have hosted international matches (Ballarat played against the touring England team in 1933 - possibly the most infamous cricket tour of all time). Ballarat has hosted full international matches as recently as the 1990s.

<li>There have been many country towns that have hosted international touring matches, however the overseas sides that play these matches are usually not the first XI and the matches are not regarded as Test standard (England sides that play these matches are often always called MCC rather than England to denote that fact). Ballarat has never hosted a Test match. I'm looking at a map of Victoria and I dont understand your comment that Ballarat is "at the heart of one of the world's major cricketing centres" - if it was Ballarat it would standing in the middle of the MCG or SCG and that is physically impossible. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:25, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ballarat is not a minor village. It is the second-largest city in the state of Victoria - a "village" of 90,000 people. And cricket is the major sport of the area.The equivalent in the UK, for instance, would be a sports club of the stature of, say, Leicester City football club.

<p>Ryan Bodenhamer is not vain, he is a very humble man tucked into the ozark mountains near decaturville missouri. he and his can of beans named jim notoriously vandalize local villas. the adventures of ryan bodenhamer and jim can be purchased for a flat fee of $1,000,000,000,000,000,000. you can contact him by walking out your front door and shouting his name followed by meaningless spanish gibberish and at least 5 obsceneties in random order. also you must have a can of beans in memory of jims fallen spirit. by the way jim died. if you have tried to contact him please log under this that you have.</p>

<li>The book itself doesn't score much in the way of notoriety, lacking any kind of critical review, and it seems to be more a novella published in a Mexican periodical than a book.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just noticed an article with slightly more comment at Muertos_inc�modos. Whether or not that stub is worth hanging on to or listing on VfD I'm not entirely sure, but if nothing else this article needs redirected there.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes another comment. I did some research on the subject and expanded the article at Muertos_inc�modos. Seems it did generate some interest in Mexico, and I think it is more than worthy of keeping, as long as we redirect this rather pointless stub to the more comprehensive entry.

<p>Incomplete nomination from the 9th of March. Appears to be a neologism of no consequence--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 05:03, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This discussion, of what the name is for the decade from '00 to '09 is, came up at the start of the 20th century and again at the start of the 21st. Various words ("aughties", "noughties", "oughties", "oh-ties", and even "naughties") were suggested. If this is a neologism, it's one that's over 100 years old at this point, making it only the second oldest such "neologism" that I've encountered this week. ☺ The article title is of course the phonetic spelling of "oughties" by someone who has obviously never seen the word written down. ☺ The discussion of the difficulty in coming up for an equivalent of "the sixties" and the various words propounded is of course a quite proper topic for an encyclopaedia article, and one that I think to be encyclopaedia-worthy. The difficulty is, of course: What does one call the article? <b>Keep</b>, <b>Rename</b> to names for 00-09 decades, then <b>Merge</b> the naming section of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a> to here. For decoration and flavour, add <i>redirect</i>s for all of the other common names to names for 00-09 decades. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:22, 2005 Mar 15 (UTC)</li>
<li>I haven't heard this referred to as "Awties" before, but I have seen references to the "Oughts".

<p>Not made in vanity, possibly not made by him at all. Very well known in the Melbourne music community. Awesome person, and partly responsible for helping restore live music after political changes. These votes have been made by people who don't live in Melbourne, and don't understand that this guy does alot. Very Worthy of a Wikipedia entry<br />

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a general information base. We have an article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sesame_Street_characters_bee8.html" title="List of Sesame Street characters">List of Sesame Street characters</a>, which lists them alphabetically. This is exactly the same list, with the addition of one item of data (date of last appearance), and a different sort. How many different sorts of the same basic data are we going to have? Each separately, and manually maintained, and therefore out of sync. How about: by date of first appearance, by number of appearances, by total length in minutes of appearances, by color, by height, by name of voice actor who played them, etc, etc. It is stupid. If somebody wants to create an online database of muppets and their appearances, and let people query it in all manner of wondrous ways, he can do it. He can even put a link to it in the appropriate Wikipedia articles.

<li><i>Note: 83.116.212.140 (page author) removed the VfD notice from his page. Replaced now.</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> FF main article is already 37k, re-merging the bestiary wouldn't be a good idea. With at least 15 or more unique games already, the series has plenty enough unique creatures to warrant an article. Tonberry, for example, has 23,000 Google hits just on its own. Final Fantasy has 5,640,000 hits, plus many more if we count abbreviations like FFX, FFVII, etc... so the subject is far too extensive and notable to cram into just one 32K article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:53, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Those aren't raw stats; they're lists of which creatures appear in which games. Also, this list can't possibly be <i>anywhere</i> near complete; I remember getting a poster with my copy of FF for the NES which listed more monsters <i>for that game alone</i> than what already appear on this list. A well-done list of this sort would probably be interesting to at least a few people, but the problem is creating a <i>complete</i> and <i>non-ugly</i> list. Leaning towards Delete, but no vote for now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 15:17, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>They aren't stats, but the games in the series in which said creature appears. That said, like many fantasy RPGs, FF contains a wide selection of generic mythological monsters, and as such this list is rather pointless. <b>Weak delete</b> unless changed to an article rather than a list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:17, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Ryan Estrada was the first (and to my knowledge only one) to do a 48 and 72 hour comic. He started the idea of extending the time of the 24 hour comic but still making it a good read. I wrote the article and do not personally know the guy. I understand I'm allowed to vote(?) In any case, I consider the fact that he expanded upon the 24-hour comics idea to be the reason for notablity. With a 168 hour comic looming in the distance, I honestly don't understand how you can say this isn't notable. -- <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.43.239.251.html" title="User:217.43.239.251">217.43.239.251</a> 01:55, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. 498 Google hits for "ryan estrada", and of course not all of which can be assumed to point to this particular Ryan Estrada. I don't see how extending the time period of someone else's idea makes someone particularly notable.

<li>I am just a fan, through his website (don't know him personally, no). [edit: Anyway, I tried to edit it a bit further. Any better?] I maybe agree that extending the idea of the 24 hour comic to 48 hours or even 72 hours may not have been enough in itself to merit a place in an online encyclopedia. However, extending it to such crazy degrees - 168 pages to be drawn in 168 consecutive hours - does seem worthy of note to anyone interested in comics. The reason I am aware of his adventures is simply because of his website. Who knows what even crazier limits will be reached? He is the person that started this extension and this extension of the 24-hour comic has the potential to develop into something altogether different.217.43.239.201 21:06, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC) <i>217.43.239.201 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.43.239.201_5c65.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.43.239.201">contribs</a>)'s only edits are to the article and this VfD.</i></li>

<li>If by 'vanity' you mean it may have been himself writing, then no. I made the original essay and (I think) all edits so far.

<li><b>Keep</b> There's plenty of individuals on Wikipedia that are not exactly world famous; remember Estrada was first mentioned here in an article on the rant website "the Acts of Gord", itself not exactly front page&lt;/a&gt; of the Times material.

<dl>
<dd>Not to hop on a soapbox, but we may want to rethink what we mean by "notable" in this, the age of the internet. When every oddity and guy on the street can present his thoughts, information, and craft to literally every human being with an uncensored internet connection, then even an outwardly oddball or fringe website may well have a considerable influence, and just as importantly for our purposes, a considerable audience. Wikipedia entries on similar subjects, other webcomics for example, are "famous" or "notable" only within thier respective communities, and have received little to no mainstream attention, yet their presence here goes unchallenged. I find it hard to understand why this case is different.</dd>

<li>I'm not sure if this is proper form or not, but there are a few more accomplishments that may be relevant:
<ul>
<li>In March 2000, I made a <a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/89.html" class="external text" title="http://www.advogato.org/article/89.html" rel="nofollow">patent grant</a> of my patent portfolio to the GPL community. This step was considered by some to be a <a href="http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/prc/2003-March/002315.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/prc/2003-March/002315.html" rel="nofollow">good example</a>, and may have been precedent for IBM's subsequent <a href="http://www.ibm.com/news/us/en/2005/01/patents.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ibm.com/news/us/en/2005/01/patents.html" rel="nofollow">patent grant in January 2005</a>.</li>
<li>I have not only written a number of papers on innovations in halftoning technology, but the algorithms are used in <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimp-Print_62ac.html" title="Gimp-Print">Gimp-Print</a>, as well as by several commercial customers.</li>
<li>I did a significant amount of early work on the anonymous <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remailer.html" title="Remailer">remailer</a> network, including writing an early client (premail) and developing the first automated statistics-gathering tool.</li>
<li>I submitted a <a href="http://www.petting-zoo.net/~deadbeef/archive/340.html" class="external text" title="http://www.petting-zoo.net/~deadbeef/archive/340.html" rel="nofollow">Commodities Jurisdiction Request</a> for the "RSA in 4 lines of perl" t-shirt, which played a small but notable part in the ultimately successful effort to relax crypto export regulations.</li>
<li>I am at present the only other significant contributor of theorems to <a href="http://metamath.org/" class="external text" title="http://metamath.org/" rel="nofollow">Metamath</a> aside from its original author. Metamath is considered one of the <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/" rel="nofollow">Seventeen Provers of the World</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a fair amount of ongoing work which is not yet encyclopedic (including my current PhD research on splines, my design work on a <a href="http://ghilbert.org/" class="external text" title="http://ghilbert.org/" rel="nofollow">next-generation Metamath</a>, and some <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/" class="external text" title="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/" rel="nofollow">font designs</a> in the queue, but my hope is that as this work progresses it will justify the continuing evolution of a wikipedia page. --<a href="../../../r/a/p/User%7ERaph_Levien_7785.html" title="User:Raph Levien">Raph Levien</a> 06:58, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, of course I didn't mean that any character played by Emma Thompson is encyclopedic. I meant that this particular character in Harry Potter was played by a big hollywood actress, and was therefore obviously notable.

<li>I'm sure you don't mean that every single character played by a major Hollywood star deserves an article - e.g. if someone created an article for the characters played by George Clooney or John Travolta in Thin Red Line, it would be a deserved deletion case. Notable actors, notable film, but clearly not notable characters (since they're just cameos).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Ok, this is getting ridiculous. Yes, this character was only mentioned in passing in Chamber of Secrets, BUT, as the article goes on to say, becomes a significant character in the book Order of the Phoenix. Therefore, your nomination is misleading, to say the least. I don't know which possibility disturbs me more: 1). That you didn't bother to read the whole article before listing it for VfD... or 2). That you did read the whole article and deliberately left out the facts so as to mislead people into voting to delete. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:01, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am one of the original creators of this page. I can vouch that George Kevgas does indeed spend most of this day searching Wikipedia. He also carry's an unique bit of notability around Seton Hall University's Campus. If anyone has ever heard of <a href="http://www.thefacebook.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thefacebook.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> which is a online directory that connects social groups at colleges and universitys, under this Seton Hall group there is actually a George Kevgas fan club. George Kevgas himself did not created the page. It is not Vanity. Once again I was one of the original authors of the page. If anyone has any questions I urge you to contact me at my office at <a href="http://www.mccarter.com" class="external text" title="http://www.mccarter.com" rel="nofollow">McCarter &amp; English, LLP</a> in Newark, NJ. My email is EMCKEOWN@MCCARTER.COM I urge you all not to vote to delete this page. It is not vanity since George Kevgas himself did not create it. Mr. Kevgas is someone who many people love and admire at Seton Hall University. Thank you. -- Doc13mets</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Being the unwilling subject of this article, I would wholeheartedly agree that the subect is not notable. The page was made by classmates of mine at Seton Hall, namely those two preceeding users who have voted to keep the article. In addition, while not explicit, it could be construed as a personal attack; some of the statements, while sounding vaguely neutral, are actually meant as inside jokes at my expense to then be enjoyed by themselves and others who might know me. I would argue that they do indeed have excess spare time on their hands to be creating encyclopedic articles about a mundane undergraduate student. I have already removed the elements of the article that were the primary sources of my disparagement, but did not wish to completely blank the page. I suggest deleting this article at the earliest possible convenience and would like to apologize for these individuals' inability to fill their spare time with more productive activities. Please refer any questions through my Wikipedia account. --<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellenica_3598.html" title="User:Hellenica">hellenica</a> 10:08, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you look at the history of the page, Mr. Kevgas in and of himself edits it, suggesting that he doesn't want the page to deleted, just that he wants to obfuscate the facts contained herein. -- <i>Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystache_ac31.html" title="User:Mystache">Mystache</a></i>

<li>I must also once again note this page was not made in vain and did not have any inside jokes. I asked Mr. Kevgas today to tell me what inside jokes were in it, he had no response. Just because you think an article does not have any notibility does not mean thats true. Mr. Kevgas is an extreamly humble human being and would not ever want such an honor bestowed upon himself. He is not only known throught-out the Seton Hall Community as practically a living legend, but he is also known in many other schools involved with their own particular Model United Nations programs and these people have never even met him! I have gone to conferences and mentioned George's name and people have come up to me and said "You know George Kevgas?" "I hear George Kevgas is an author is it true?" He honestly is a living legend around the Model United Nations Circuit and that does encompass a large group of people. George has inspired many "MUNers". George Kevgas is a humble person, but a large portion of people do believe he belongs in Wikipedia, if you doubt that, I challenge you to come to Seton Hall's Campus one day and see for your self. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc13mets_3c68.html" title="User:Doc13mets">Doc13mets</a> 22:15, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would like now to quote some exact phrases in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia’s policy’s</a>. “If you are reasonably significant, someone will create an article about you sooner or later”. There are many of us that feel Kevgas should have a Wikipedia article. I have talked to many people and they are even willing to start a petition if that would help the cause, just let me know where to send it. Many people do believe Mr. Kevgas is ineed <i>reasonably</i> significant. I would ask unless you yourself are heavily involved in the North East Model United Nations Circuit to not comment on this matter. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc13mets_3c68.html" title="User:Doc13mets">Doc13mets</a> 22:27, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable. Doc13mets, it is ridiculous to say that only people in a realm just barely notable in its own right can judge the notability of this.

<li>Well, I'm pretty sure I know how this vote is going to turn out, but to put this in a better perspective for our two objectors: If we look at the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, we can all agree that they deserve an article as a notable group.

<li>Good point, but I must object to the fact that I highly doubt a boy scout from say North Jersey is actually known as far away as Montreal, Quebec. Mr. Kevgas does hold this stature.
