<ul>
<li><b>Prominent?</b> You're only saying they're prominent because the article says so. The article could say they invented punk in 1981. The article could say anything. They played a kind of music that several thousand bands had been playing for years by the time they were formed and they apparently played in Houston and Los Angeles. Any band from Milwaukee can play a show in Chicago sooner or later, but that does not make them notable. There is no outstanding reason to have an (unsourced) article on them, especially one using weasel words like "highly sought after" and "prominent." -<a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a>·<a href="../../../k/o/a/User_talk%7EKoavf_18ee.html" title="User talk:Koavf">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Koavf_fde1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Koavf">C</a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Koavf_292b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Koavf">M</a> 17:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>An article must assert the notability of its subject. That's what the editor did when writing the article. Now, sources must be provided, and I assume they will be. The time you spent marking this article up with improper tags and creating an AfD could have been used to contact the original author of the article and let him/her know it needed sources. Is "prominent" a weasel word? Because I got it from one of the criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Your <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">inability to stay cool</a> makes me wonder if there is another agenda here that might render this a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> nomination. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'll ignore the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria because it's <i>possible</i> they pass (there are some vague statements that get them past - while I see no evidence of prominence, there is a reference to some kind of tour - instead, I'll focus on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, notably, I can't find any reputable sources about the band whatsoever. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What to do? Obviously, their work was pre-internet. A google search of the name turns up a lot of auctions for their records. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can always look for books in your local library, or search through their microfiche. It may be the case that articles that are otherwise viable are excluded by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because they just scratched notability long ago - but this is the price we must pay to have an encyclopaedia, rather than a steaming heap of spam. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question/Comment</b> - Can anyone make sense of the following? The <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00032/cah-00032.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00032/cah-00032.html" rel="nofollow">University of Texas</a> site has some info on Volumatix, but I can't quite figure out what it is or how to cite it. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 22:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These are the archives of the Soap Creek Saloon, a venue in Austin. Business records, photos, posters, that sort of thing. It appears that Volumatix is one of the bands who appeared at that venue. The page is a listing of the contents of the archive and how it is organized, and what subjects are contained in each box, though there is no way of knowing what specific material or how much they have under each subject. My guess is that judging from the number of different bands listed for each box, the amount of individual material on each band is fairly small, perhaps just a poster or some business paperwork. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Allmusic entry may be a source of notability, but lack of Allmusic entry is NOT a reason for deletion. Did you look at those 73 ghits? What did they say? Anything about the hits indicate notability or non-notability? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a reason to delete if there is no evidence of notability provided. The google hits were record sales stores, myspace, message boards, etc. Nothing to indictate notability. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, those hits were playlists on radio stations, sites for venues the band played, and record auctions where their work is fetching high prices. Does THAT speak to you? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm a <i>graduate student</i> and even I don't consider $10-$15 a high price for a record. Which is what all the eBay ones are selling for <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:59, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not really, sorry. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. We can't write encyclopedia articles based on playlists and record auctions. Who is this band? Why are they important? Who did they influence? These questions aren't answered by playlists and auctions. I'm not crusading to keep them out, but if someone can't come up with a single reliable, encyclopedia worthy source about this band, they shouldn't be in Wikipedia. It's not like American rock bands are some obscure topic that has only been examined by a handful of people. Come up with one mention in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, one mention in a Rough Guide, something significant from some source, then we'll talk. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, I'm not going to try to sway anyone any which way, but I just want this post to establish my position. To be honest, I'm shocked and repulsed by Koavf's behavior towards me. He tagged this article for speedy deletion, which it clearly is not. From <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>, "An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject (can be speedily deleted). If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AfD instead." The reason for speedy deletion is so that you can eliminate blantant crap that is just pure nonsense or doesn't make an attempt to make the subject notable. Koavf thinks that not meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is suddenly a reason for speedy deletion, the reason that this isn't true is because it's very difficult and completely agaisnt consensus (which Wikipedia is founded upon) to just delete something since it doesn't appear to be "notable." Speedy Deletions are meant for something that everyone can agree without reservation that it's terrible and not even remotely encylopedic. This article <b>does</b> stress the importance of the subjet and attempts to show how it meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. To be honest, I'm leaning towards a week keep based upon the context of the article and the new links that were revealed. Also, using allmusic.com, shouldn't be our one stop source for music, like Amazon being our one stop source for literature. It appears the attempt of meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, is in the touring, opening acts, and record label. But, back to my original point: This article was not speedible and if you want to see more on this issue please see the article's talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and add sources. Just because a 20-years-defunct band has little internet prescence doesn't mean we need to give up on it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This has nothing to do with the lack of internet presence and everything to do with the lack of any sources at all. If there are sources to add, then add them. We shouldn't create articles and then hope there is information to back them up somewhere down the line. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nothing in LexisNexis, nothing searching music journals, music publications, music criticism databases, or record company catalogs.
