<li><b>Keep</b>. I have slightly expanded the article. I disagree about <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but find it dificult to assert notability in the article without increasing 'vanity' quotient. CPDL has appeared prominently in the <i>Choral Journal</i> (<a href="../../../a/c/d/ACDA_9748.html" title="ACDA">ACDA</a>), <i>Computing in Musicology</i> (CCARH), and a MusicNetwork workshop. over 10,000 choral musicians use it every day. It is an interwiki-linked site (<a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="choralwiki:Main_Page">ChoralWiki</a>). It appears to be the most used choral website (according to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a>). Any hints on improving the article?

<li><small><b>Keep</b> or <b>delete all free sheet music archive articles and change the {{ChoralWiki}} template.</b> I am of the opinion that a free resource which has helped so many people make music and is accessed by people across the globe deserves a place in this encyclopedia. ChoralWiki is more popular than any other free sheet music archive so if you're gonna delete this page, you'll have to delete the rest (Mutopia, Free Sheet Music Archive, etc) as well.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have today contributed a bit to the article and will try to make more improvements to it.

<li><b>Response to Request</b> I note that the site is officially endorsed by a link on official sites (maintained as a university, not merely a page of a student) of the Northern Illinois University School of Music (cf.: &lt;<a href="http://www.niu.edu/Music/links.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.niu.edu/Music/links.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.niu.edu/Music/links.shtml</a>&gt;), and Kent State University (cf.: &lt;<a href="http://dept.kent.edu/music/choral/links.html" class="external free" title="http://dept.kent.edu/music/choral/links.html" rel="nofollow">http://dept.kent.edu/music/choral/links.html</a>&gt;); I submit that the inclusion of these links on official sites meets the criterion 1, "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.", specifically under the sub-point "This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms,...".

<li><b>Keep</b> I have today contributed over 150 free vocal scores to it. A major University will be using one of my scores to perform a Baroque Opera this fall. I have emails from Choral directors in remote places, such as South Africa praising CPDL's contributions. It is certainly worth pointing out this resource to Wikipedia readers. It should also be noted that CPDL has a better claim to being listed than does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClassicalArchives" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClassicalArchives" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClassicalArchives</a> which is a commercial siteUser:johnhenryfowler2 11:13, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> In principle, <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choral_Public_Domain_Library_d3f8.html" title="Choral Public Domain Library">Choral Public Domain Library</a> is the equivalent of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Gutenberg_b9aa.html" title="Project Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a> in the domain of vocal music. It thus has an extremely large potential range, from sung texts dating before 1,000 C.E. in the collection, through the predominantly vocal music of the late mediæval period and Renaissance, up to works offered as public domain and composed in the 20th and 21st centuries. So basic is the voice to musical expression that virtually every notable composer has provided works capable of representation on the site, and the vast majority of music composed before 1700 would be suitable for eventual inclusion, provided copyright issues (similar to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Gutenberg_b9aa.html" title="Project Gutenberg">PG</a>) are met. Moreover the site clearly invites contributions from volunteers (again, <a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/User:Philip_Legge" class="extiw" title="choralwiki:User:Philip_Legge">I myself</a> am a contributor of CPDL editions) to improve its comprehensiveness in all vocal genres (although there is a historical bias towards sacred music), with a long term aim of complete editions of major composers as would be found in university or public library reserve collections. I disagree with <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">Man in Black</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choral_Public_Domain_Library_d3f8.html" title="Choral Public Domain Library">CPDL</a> certainly meets the foremost criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, however the article as it stands is a stub and would benefit from major expansion. Other articles concerning similar <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain_resources.html" title="Public domain resources">public domain resources</a> should provide a model for this. <span style="color:#00cc00;">Philip Legge</span> <sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Phi1ip_722a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Phi1ip">@</a></sub> 01:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><small><b>Keep</b> This is a collection which the founders and Wikipedia can be proud of. The article is developing nicely, and day by day its content is expanded. It is the most important resource of choral music and it would be a shame if it had to be moved to another place on the web as it is a vast work of hundreds of contributors. However, I agree that content could be improved, but the site has developed so much since it became ChoralWiki that we can see the goal it aims at.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> it passed deletion before and there is evidence of massive sock puppetry in this second AFD. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 22:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The links pages of NIU and KSU predate the date of the rfd discussion, and should have been taken to account in that discussion. That they were not is incontrovertible evidence that the vote to delete was in error because of insufficient research on the part of those voting for deletion. The sites which list CPDL also list Werner Icking Music Archive, which also has a page, but which has not been nominated for deletion. How does one delete one, but not the other? ÞorsHammer 22:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Interested parties</b> not sockpuppets. As I stated above, I am a contributor to CPDL and an infrequent occasional contributor to Wikipedia, however I use both sites regularly as an "end-user". Wikipedia is the best site of its kind (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_information.html" title="Freedom of information">free</a> encyclopedia), and CPDL is the best site of its kind (free vocal music). The site may not be unique (other sites offer free sheet music) but it is certainly one of the most notable. <span style="color:#00cc00;">Philip Legge</span> <sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Phi1ip_722a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Phi1ip">@</a></sub> 03:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't see the point of those who support deletion. Is there a pressure from the direction of music publishers? Does CPDL hurt anyone?Jay_m 9:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
