<p>Redfern Oval is the former home ground of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Sydney_Rabbitohs_ffd9.html" title="South Sydney Rabbitohs">South Sydney Rabbitohs</a>. They were tenants there from the 1940s till the late 1980s and played a couple of home games there in 1996. Redfern Oval has one grandstand named the reg cope stand and is surrounded by hills and terraced seating. It was hoped that redfern oval would be re-developed as a suitable home ground for the bunnies, but mayor clover moore stood in and vetoed this in favour of a training and community venue which would not meet nrl standards. Construction of this venue will start in mid 2007. It is widely hoped by many south sydney fans that when souths can become stable and their crowds begin to rise that a second re-deveolpment will take place allowing souths to once again play out of their spiritual home.</p>

<p>Mellified Man refers to a topical and oral medicinal substance from ancient Arabia.</p>
<p>To create a mellified man, an aging man would begin a strict diet of honey until he began to excrete pure honey. After death, the man would be entombed in a coffin filled with honey which was sealed for a century.</p>
<p>When the coffin was unsealed the contents were applied topically or ingested to cure a variety of illnesses and complaints.</p>

<b>Anette Vedvik</b> (born [date unknown] in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamar.html" title="Hamar">Hamar</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>), is a Norwegian <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop.html" title="Pop">pop</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> musician. While her older titles have a somewhat more <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospel</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> influence, the more recent songs are from a more general positive attitude with a jazzy tune.</p>
<p>After a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a> heard her sing, he offered her a free recording, which became the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">album</a> ‚ÄòMy deliverance‚Äô. The first day after the release of the album Anette got an email from producer <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Peacock_e4c8.html" title="Charlie Peacock">Charlie Peacock</a>, inviting her to <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville.html" title="Nashville">Nashville</a> to meet the president of the company. A few weeks later she got another invitation to meet another record company in Nashville that was interested in her music. However, by then she had already moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to attend the Recording Artist Program at the Musician's Institute.</p>
<p>Anette lived in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> for 7 months and extended her musical talent. A good confirm on her musical improvement and work in this program was the "Best Project 2003" award that she received at the graduation ceremony. Under a performance she had at the school during the year, an A&amp;R from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Sony Music, Columbia</a>, became aware of her, and was interested in putting her on one of America's most popular shows.</p>
<p>Anette Vedvik came home from <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> in March 2003 and has since then worked with her music, by writing new songs, having concerts all over Norway, and by recording a single and also a music-video for it. In addition to this, she toured the Southern States of America spring 2004. During those 10 weeks she performed at about 20 different venues across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>The music that Anette writes, regularly gets attention for its distinctive characteristics and quality, but not least has the music been received well because of her voice which accompanies it. Often people categories her music as a mix between pop, jazz and funk. Through her music, Anette wants to give people inspiration to seek the fundamental values and to see the positive aspects of life. Recently she has just released a new album "This is life". On this record, Anette sings about different important aspects of every day life that all people can relate to.</p>
<p><br />
As of 2006, she has released two albums:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>My deliverance</i> (2002)</li>
<li><i>This is Life</i> (2006)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lie with me is a drama movie that came out in 2005 starring Eric Balfour and Lauren Lee Smith. The movie has been cited as daring and provocative, as well as trashy and insubstantial. The actors spend most of the movie naked and having sex that doesn't look simulated. Canadian director Clement Virgo has cited his desire to portray a message of how lonely today's young adults are in our sex-saturated world. This is attempted with an opening scene of a young woman, Leila, masturbating to pornography, and no substantial dialog until ten minutes into the movie. The movie proceeds with graphic scenes of a steamy sexual affair and no satisfactory resolution. The movie is unrated and also stars Polly Shannon and Michael Facciolo.</p>

<p>Hanna Riedner [January 27th, 1505 - August 30th, 1600] was a vicious pirate who murdered millions of pour souls throught Europe and the Caribbean. Her early childhood was a terrible one, with her parents both being murdered by Black Beard and then being raped by his entire pirate crew. She then became a wench, being sold to six different husbands in the span of six years. Tired of this, she shot up the entire town and built a boat with the burning wood from their houses.</p>

<p>Hanna was easily the most feared pirate in the seven seas, although nobody knew her name, and she was virtually undocumented for her entire life. Children wrote stories about the scary, terrible pirate who killed their parents and then made them wash the decks of her boat, which she named "The Redhead." Her first mate, a brutal girl by the name of Kirsten Hagen, would then toss random, unsuspecting members off the side to Davy Jones' locker. Kirsten disappeared just months after the last child, Emily Rosenberger, disappeared from her town in Germany. Germany then became owned by Hanna, who sold it for rum; she is traced to the creator or alcoholism.</p>

<p>Hanna died alone, with the exception of her parrot-cat hybrid, Charles, aka Chuck (who created heroin). It is rumored she now sails on the Flying Dutchman, and takes unsuspecting sailors down and likes to turn them into starfish. She and Davy go way back, and you can see Hanna in the film "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," which is now in theatres. She is always in the background, and in one scene, she's completely naked. Watch for it. It's really good.</p>

<p>Dar√≠o Torren naci√≥ el 22 de Agosto de 1981, en Caballito, Buenos Aires. Comenz√≥ su carrera como m√∫sico incursionando en el √°mbito del rock, pero no sin antes participar de varios telecomerciales de zapatillas y ropa en la televisi√≥n argentina. Su discografia comprende desde "Peligro" hasta "Hippismo Incursionado" en 1999 y en el 2004 respectivamente. Para este a√±o (2006) planea hacer un compilado de su discograf√≠a completa, con temas nuevos totalmente in√©ditos.</p>
<p><br />
Dar√≠o, un considerable Don Juan para muchas argentinas, tuvo un sinfin de amor√≠os con mujeres que terminaron en dramas, pero hasta el d√≠a de hoy no sali√≥ con ninguna celebridad. Finalmente confes√≥ su homosexualidad en Mayo del 2004, terminando finalmente con los chismes que propon√≠an que sal√≠a con actrices como Celeste Cid, quien desminti√≥ esto hace tiempo.</p>
<p>Actualmente adem√°s de estar preparando su √∫ltimo disco, se encuentra trabajando con Zaramella, realizando la m√∫sica de nuevos cortos para la Fundaci√≥n Huesped, nuevamente.</p>

<p>The small beachside suburb of Kananook is located within the larger suburb of Seaford on the Mornington Peninsula, approximately 38km south of the Melbourne CBD. Its boundaries are comprised of to the west by the Seaford foreshore beach and Nepean highway, to the north by Seaford road, to the east by Wells road and south by Overton road. The suburb contains its own railway station, primary school, football club and reserve, tennis club and courts, retirement village, canoe ramp and the Kananook Creek Nature Reserve with several walking tracks. It is approximately 10 minutes walk to Seaford village shops to the north and about 20 minutes walk to the Frankston CBD to the south. As the demand for coastal living in Melbourne has gained in premuim over the last few years, property prices have risen sharply in the suburb of Kananook. The local city council is Frankston and the combined population of Kananook and Seaford in 2006 was approximately 16000 people with Kananook residents making up less than an estimated third of the total inhabitants.</p>

<p>Kananook 3198 The small beachside suburb of Kananook is located within the larger suburb of Seaford on the Mornington Peninsula, approximately 38km south of the Melbourne CBD. Its boundaries are comprised of to the west by the Seaford foreshore beach and Nepean highway, to the north by Seaford road, to the east by Wells road and south by Overton road. The suburb contains its own railway station, primary school, football club and reserve, tennis club and courts, retirement village, canoe ramp and the Kananook Creek Nature Reserve with several walking tracks. It is approximately 10 minutes walk to Seaford village shops to the north and about 20 minutes walk to the Frankston CBD to the south. As the demand for coastal living in Melbourne has gained in premuim over the last few years, property prices have risen sharply in the suburb of Kananook. The local city council is Frankston and the combined population of Kananook and Seaford in 2006 was approximately 16000 people with Kananook residents making up less than an estimated third of the total inhabitants.</p>

<p>Liquid gasoline fuel when heated to a temperature sufficient enough to throughly vaporize the fuel will take on the consistancy and white mist like apparance of vaporized propane or butane fuel and will burn in internal combustion engines as cleanly and completely as propane or butane fuel while also producing a significant increase in engine fuel effeciency and economy due to the higher BTU content of gasoline over either butane or propane. This technology has been around for over 70 years and was most notably first introduced by Canadian, Charles Pogue in the 1930s with his patents,(#2,026,798 and #1,997,497) issued by the US and Canadian Patent offices in 1935. When a vapor carburation system is operating properly, a standard gasoline engines' smog control device is no longer necessary because by properly preheating gasoline prior to injection or carburation into the engines' intake manifold, the exhaust gasses exhausting from the internal combustion engine are very similar to in smell and as clean as exhaust gasses from a propane powered vehicles exhaust pipe.</p>

The East German equivalent of the primary school and high school was the ten-year polytechnical school, for children six to sixteen. It was a very progressive school and students went to school six days a week. On Saturdays there were around four hours of lessons.</p>
<p>Polytechnical schools focused strongly on science, mathematics, geography, astronomy, chemistry, sport as well as practical work [Werken- works or PA = Produktive Arbeit- productive work], and until the tenth year there was little opportunity to deviate from either of these. The East German government considered these subjects to be of key importance to a fast growing, industrial country like East Germany and to give the young people of East Germany the best key and preparation for post-seondary education.</p>
<p>Special emphasis was also placed on learning Russian, as the GDR was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Also available [fakultativ] were English and French. A majority of students had little motivation for Russian, and achievements were generally poor; few students reached fluency. In spite of the state-proclaimed friendship with the USSR, there were few opportunities for student exchanges and for experiencing the pleasure of communicating in the other's language. Appreciated by parents were the so-called head notes like behavior, industriousness, order, cooperation combined with a short teacher's essay about the student's character, success or progress often from a socialistic point of view.</p>
<p>From the seventh year onwards, students visited a factory, a power house or a farm one day per week, depending on their location. At either of these places, the student would work alongside regular employees.</p>
<p>There were annual championships on various subjects with the winners receiving prizes. The Russian language and mathematics championships were very prestigious and competitive as well as regular championchips in sport, called Spartakiade [from the word Spartacus ].</p>

<p>The Farewell Reason started to play in summer 2001 after their former band Implicite (melodic punkrock) split-up. Igor, Franjo and Boris wanted to start something new, something completely different. They were inspired by the hardcore bands from the early nineties, so they wanted to start a band with different name, a different style, they wanted to express their selves, their thoughts, feelings, emotions‚Ä¶ After a couple of months of playing they decided they want to play their first show so they needed a name for the band. The Farewell Reason was born. They played their first show with Nikad and Apfuken on 19th of October 2001 in legendary "Pub" in their home town ƒåakovec, Croatia.</p>
<p>In winter of 2001/2002 TFR recorded first demo CD-R called "Nothing is over‚Ä¶" . It was recorded in a D.I.Y. way, the quality was pretty shitty but they didn't care. In 2002 they promoted that first demo and played more than 20 shows in Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. After that, they decided that they need one more guitar player so Tomislav Pintariƒá joined the band. His first show with The Farewell Reason was in Zagreb in Attack with Off Minor and Radio Free Isaac. They worked on new songs and in autumn of 2004 recorded a material for their split LP with their friends from Outre. The record was finally released in October of 2005 after a lot of delays and all the other stuff on Good Samaritan Records. Right now the band is working on their new songs and they are promoting this new record. The tape release of that split LP is out on Brand New Place Records and Dirty Harry Punks.</p>
<p>The current line up is: Igor Bistroviƒá (guitars, vocals) Tomislav Pintariƒá (guitars) Franjo Filo (bass, vocals) Boris Strahija (drums)</p>
<p>If we talk about the music that they play, well you can call it emotional hardcore, you can call it punk or hardcore, screamo‚Ä¶ they don¬¥ t care. They play what they like and what they feel and that¬¥ s actually it. Lyrics are mostly personal and about the people they live with, about people that they care about and things that surround us. If you want to contact them or discuss with them about something feel free to write, feel free to talk to them after the show, they will appreciate it and if you want them to play in your basement, or living room or your local club they will be your friends forever. Have a nice day, hugs &amp; kisses...</p>

<p>Dominic has been playing the acoustic drum kit for about 7 years. He was musicaly raised playing the electric guitar in garage setting modern progressive bands. spitting out the same 4 power chords over and over again. His musical influences continued to be scattered across the board of anything that was seen on TV, or heard in movies. His musical taste now, was brought to him at a later age. For a week, he spent at a weekend at a friends house, who was a blues musician for about 15+ years. They had built a relationship that was required to introduce himself to music outside the mainstream. After meeting his electric blues/rock "mentor", he was sent on his way to a positive early musical path. he was scattered from band to band, playing guitar in electric muddy blues bands. "My musical career hasn't exceeded much more than playing a few local venues around seattle, and opening for a few well known bands such as Death Cab for Cutie and Pennywise".</p>
<p>His wanting to persue percussion was brought by nothing more than banging around on band mates drum sets. After realizing that within hours, he had developed the same skill that drummers around him had taken months to do, i was led to purchase my first drum kit. It was a mixed kit, all silver, with a blue snare drum and one blank cymbol. "In my first year of owning a drum set i had spent hours at a time playing along to my headphones with some of the most raw classic blues/Rock bands and artists such as Buddy Guy, Jimi Hendrix, Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin and more."</p>
<p>It was only later, that he had learned to develop his sound from "highly influential drummers and drum style's such as John Bonhoms "Big foot" triplets, Mitch Mitchells active back beat sections, and Keith moons intricit bass dividing snare grace notes."</p>

<p>To "play it by ear" is an idiom which means to play a piece of music through hearing alone. It may also be used in a more general sense and apply to any action one take in an extemporaneous manner. So just as playing music by ear does not involve following written notes, playing it by ear in general does not involve following a preconcieved strategy.</p>

<p>The Academy of the Holy Names is a Catholic, independent co-educational elementary school and a college preparatory school for young women, sponsored by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. It is the oldest school in the Tampa Bay area and has operated for the past 126 years</p>
<p><br />
History of AHN</p>
<p>On July 17, 1881, two Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary arrived from Key West to open a two-room school house in a blacksmith shop on Zack Street in Tampa. Thirty-five pupils were enrolled initially, but by the end of the first academic year, their numbers had increased to 70 day scholars and two resident students.</p>
<p>By April 1889, the site of the school was moved to a two-story building at the corner of Franklin and Harrison Streets.</p>
<p>In 1891, the late Bishop John Moore, second Bishop of St. Augustine, purchased property on Twiggs Street where a larger school, which served the community for 34 years, was built.</p>
<p>By 1926, further growth necessitated larger accommodations, and the school was moved to temporary quarters on Central Avenue while the present building on Bayshore Boulevard was under construction. Bishop Barry, Bishop of St. Augustine, laid the cornerstone in 1928, and Florida's Governor-elect Carlton spoke at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The following September saw the opening of the new school, but financial difficulties halted building progress before the structure was completed. However, with increasing enrollment, growth of the school continued; the building was completed; and by 1952, two new school wings were added, along with the chapel and auditorium.</p>
<p>A separate boys division for grades one through eight was established in 1962, and in 1970 a kindergarten was added. Today the staff of Sisters and their lay associates instruct over 870 students in the coeducational elementary division and the high school for young women.</p>
<p>The school's centenary was celebrated during the 1980-81 school year. At that time an historic marker was unveiled in front of the school on Bayshore Boulevard to commemorate 100 years of service of the Sisters of the Holy Names on Florida's West Coast.</p>

<p>"Another Day" was a 1994 single by Danish <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a> artist <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whigfield.html" title="Whigfield">Whigfield</a> (aka Sannie Carlson). Its lyrics talk about a woman who can't stand living with her cheating (and presumably abusive) husband/boyfriend for "another day". Not as big as "Saturday Night", it did manage to become a minor dance hit and become a single. The single is available on <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> for $7.92.</p>

<p>A noisy hardcore band formed in 2000 to promote head banging. Vancouver, WA's Scarlet Theater and Hazel Dell Grange were the developing homes of Vancouver's Hardcore scene. "We are Christian so it just made sense to focus our lyrics on bringing peace and happiness among our friends... if you came to a show we felt it was an opportunity to help you have a better day... and to go bonkers." -Jerry. Brutal Fight put out a CD called, "Our Merciful Father" that came out on Strikefirst Records in 2005. "We are constantly pushing ourselves as musicians to become a completely stupid band. Not Zappa or Melvins stupid, we're talking a whole new level." Cody.</p>

<p>Stenmin is the evil mystic that corrupts the mentally fragile Palance Buckannah, and convinces him to disband the Border Legion. Stenmin is discovered in his treachery by Menion Leah, and is also found to be the man who abducted Shirl Ravenlock. Upon being found out, Stenmin stabs Palance Buckannah, and manages to escape with only a broken shoulder. Later, during the seige of Tyrsis, he leads a secret assault through the tunnels under Tyrsis, but is again foiled by Menion Leah, with the help of the Dwarf, Hendel. Hendel is killed during the assault, and Stenmin again attempts to escape- this time to be decapitated by Menion Leah as he flees up the stairs from the dungeon.</p>

<p>Louise Bennett was born on September 7, 1919. She was a Jamaican poet and activist. From Kingston, Jamaica Louise Bennett remains a household name in Jamaica, a "Living Legend" and a cultural icon. She received her education from Ebenezer and Calabar Elementary Schools, St. Simon‚Äôs College, Excelsior College, Friends College (Highgate).</p>
<p>Although she lived in Toronto, Canada for the last decade she still receives the homage of the expatriate West Indian community in the north as well as a large Canadian following.</p>
<p>She was described as Jamaica's leading comedienne, as the "only poet who has really hit the truth about her society through its own language", and as an important contributor to her country of "valid social documents reflecting the way Jamaicans think and feel and live‚Äù Through her poems in Jamaican patois, she raised the dialect of the Jamaican folk to an art level which is acceptable to and appreciated by all in Jamaica.</p>
<p>In her poems she was able to capture all the spontaneity of the expression of Jamaicans' joys and sorrows, their ready, poignant and even wicked wit, their religion and their philosophy of life. Her first dialect poem was written when she was fourteen years old. A British Council Scholarship took her to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where she studied in the late 1940‚Äôs.</p>
<p>Bennett not only had a scholarship to attend the academy but she auditioned and won a scholarship. After graduation she worked with repertory companies in Coventry, Huddersfield and Amersham as well as in intimate revues all over England. On her return to Jamaica she taught drama to youth and adult groups both in social welfare agencies and for the University of the West Indies Extra Mural Department.</p>
<p>She lectured extensively in the United States and the United Kingdom on Jamaican folklore and music and represented Jamaica all over the world. She married Eric Winston Coverley in 1954 (who died in 2002) and has one stepson and several adopted children. She enjoys Theatre, Movies and Auction sales.</p>
<p>Her contribution to Jamaican cultural life was such that she was honored with the M.B.E., the Norman Manley Award for Excellence (in the field of Arts), the Order of Jamaica (1974) the Institute of Jamaica's Musgrave Silver and Gold Medals for distinguished eminence in the field of Arts and Culture, and in 1983 the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of the West Indies. In September 1988 her composition "You're going home now", won a nomination from the Academy of Canadian Cinema ad Television, for the best original song in the movie "Milk and Honey."</p>
<p>In 1998 she received the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters from York University, Toronto, Canada. The Jamaica Government also appointed her Cultural Ambassador at Large for Jamaica. On Jamaica‚Äôs independence day 2001, Bennett-Coverley was appointed as a Member of the Order of Merit for her distinguished contribution to the development of the Arts and Culture.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-28_b6d7.html" title="Edit section: German Christmas Traditions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">German Christmas Traditions</span></h2>
<p>One of the most famous German Christmas traditions is the Christmas tree, or Weihnachtsbaum. The word tannenbaum means fir tree in German, and because a fir tree is the most common and most traditional Christmas tree, the words have become synonymous. In Germany, the traditions associated with the tree vary somewhat from American traditions. In Germany, the family does not decorate the tree together. It is usually done by one parent, most often the mother, while the father occupies the children. In fact, the children are not even allowed to see the tree until midday on Christmas day. The tree is decorated with candy, tinsel, lights, and special glass ornaments, each of which represent something. Some examples are a rabbit, which stands for hope, and a teapot, which stands for hospitality. These ornaments (there are twelve in total) are a traditional wedding gift to German couples. Glass ornaments came from Germany, and are still a major export of the country. The Christmas tree is believed to have originated in Germany, and has Pagen origins (Robson). According to Robson, the Germanic tribes in Germany worshipped the fir tree, because while all the other trees and plants seemed to die during the winter, the fir tree stayed green. They would cut off boughs and hang them in and around their houses to ward off evil spirits. In an effort to Christianize the Pagans, missionaries used the tree as a symbol for Christmas. The first Christmas trees were undecorated, and the tradition of putting lights or candles on the tree had been credited to Martin Luther, around 1500. The story goes that one Christmas Eve he was out walking, and he was struck by the beauty of a small fir tree, covered in snow and glistening in the moon light. When he got home, he set up a small fir tree in his house to share the story with his family, and decorated it with candles, which he lit the candles in honor of Christ‚Äôs birth (Robson). Another familiar Christmas tradition that is observed in Germany is Santa Claus, also known as Weihnactsmann or Christkindl, depending on where you come from. In Germany, Santa is not thought to be a ‚Äújolly old elf,‚Äù but the Christ Child. German children write him a letter, but not to ask him for gifts; the meaning is more religious. Children also get a visit from Saint Nikolaus on December sixth, his feast day. He leaves a gift for each child in a shoe or on a plate (Porter), unless they have been bad. In that case, his partner, Knecht Ruprecht, will leave twigs or coal in the shoes. Gifts from family members are exchanged on Christmas Eve, instead of Christmas Day, due to an old concept of the next day beginning at sunset instead of at midnight. The period leading up to Christmas is Advent. In Germany, both Advent wreathes and Advent calendars are common. Many children have day by day Advent calendars, with little bits of chocolate for each day. --<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.72.html" title="User:205.188.116.72">205.188.116.72</a> 21:24, 27 July 2006 (UTC)The idea of Advent wreathes is another tradition thought to have originated in Germany. The German Advent wreathe has five candles, usually four red and one white. One red candle is lit for each Sunday in Advent, and the white candle is lit on Christmas day. It is a great honor to light the candles, and when a child is allowed to do it, it is a sign of their maturity or good behavior. Food is an important part of the German Christmas celebration. As in the United States, a family meal is eaten on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Some traditional foods eaten by the Germans for Christmas dinner are some kind of pork as opposed to the ‚ÄúChristmas goose,‚Äù a cake called Stollen, which has lots of fruits in it, and, of course, beer or cider. A shared tradition in both the United States and Germany is the making of gingerbread houses, called Lebkuchenhaus. German gingerbread houses tend to be more ornate then American ones, with people spending entire days making them, but the ideas are the same. Germans are also big on Christmas cookies, and gingerbread is actually a German food. Cookies in Christmas shapes, such as trees and angels, are the most popular. Many Christmas traditions that people consider ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù actually originated in Germany. Christmas trees, Advent wreathes and calendars, and many foods are all an important part of the German Christmas celebration.</p>

<p>The D.Rangers consist of five distinct talents: impassioned frontman Jaxon Haldane (vocals, banjo, saw); former blues-kid-prodigy Chris Saywell (acoustic guitar); Aaron Goss (mandolin, background vocals) who adds a little fire to the mix with his unique and intense playing style; Tom Fodey (bass, background vocals) who lays down rock solid lines on the previously mentioned home-made "muck bucket" bass and adds sweet harmony singing; and Don Zueff (fiddle, background vocals) who is the newest member of the band, but whose work with the band reveals his thirty-plus years of professional experience in groups like RCA recording artists Prairie Dog and the Chicken Flat String Band.</p>

<p>The young and multidisciplinary field of health literacy emerged from two expert groups; physicians and other health providers and health educators, and Adult Basic Education (ABE) and English as Second Language (ESL) practitioners. Physicians are a source of groundbreaking patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live. (See the links at WorldEd <a href="http://www.worlded.org/us/health/lincs" class="external free" title="http://www.worlded.org/us/health/lincs" rel="nofollow">http://www.worlded.org/us/health/lincs</a>, and ‚ÄúA Selection of Health Literacy Articles and Research‚Äù published by Partnership for Clear Health Communication: <a href="http://www.askme3.org/pdfs/bibliography.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.askme3.org/pdfs/bibliography.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.askme3.org/pdfs/bibliography.pdf</a>.)</p>
<p>The biomedical and psychological approach to health literacy dominant in the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking, or ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù from, low health literacy, assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy, and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological approaches to health.</p>
<p>A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to understand scientific concepts, content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; and knowledge and use of community capital and resources, as well as using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making (Nutbeam, 2000; Ratzan, 2001; Zarcadoolas, Pleasant, &amp; Greer, 2002).</p>
<p>This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life (Zarcadoolas, Pleasant, &amp; Greer, 2006).</p>
<p>Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:</p>
<pre>
    fundamental literacy, 
    scientific literacy, 
    civic literacy, and 
    cultural literacy. 
</pre>
<p>Skills in one domain can contribute to developing literacy skill in another domain, and competencies in one area can compensate for a lack of competencies in another.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stressed that health literacy skills are not only a problem of the public. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health professionals) can also have poor health literacy skills; most often captured by a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.</p>
