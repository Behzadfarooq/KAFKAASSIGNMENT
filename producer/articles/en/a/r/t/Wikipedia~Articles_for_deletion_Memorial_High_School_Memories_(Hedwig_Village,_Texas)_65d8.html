<li><b>comment</b> This article does not and will not include "things made up in school one day". Everything in the article is a real event that actually occurred at the school. Memorial is the most notable high school in the Houston-metro area, in the same vein as Laguna Beach High School is to Orange County. The Wikipedia community seems content with having content regarding the California high school; why are other areas not afforded the same privilege? <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.113.14.172.html" title="User:137.113.14.172">137.113.14.172</a> 22:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> My issue with this article is whether it is encyclopedic - I have no problem with articles about schools, but that is not what this is, it is a collection of high-school students' memories, and explicitly stats that it "should not be used as a reference source for factual information regarding Memorial High School". With regard to "Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day", maybe I shouldn't have cited that policy, but in my view Wikipedia is also not for thing that happened in school one day unless those events are notable. If you want to have a website for your high school memories, there are many places that will host such content, often for free, but Wikipedia is not one of them. If there are other "hish school memories" articles like this one then in my view those should also be deleted, I nominated this after seeing it in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 23:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>As an avid wikipedia user, i do not think that this article should be deleted. It is the chronicles of the 2005 graduating class at memorial high school, and includes real information and events. I know of many previous and current students at memorial high school who find this page to be an interesting, informative, ENCYCLOPEDIC, read. I find it insulting that editors at Wikipedia find this harmless and INFORMATIVE content delete-worthy, but find it in their hearts to host hundreds of articles chronicling different Pornography stars and the different types of current porn. If Milf Hunter can have an article on Wikipedia, why can't Memorial High Schools 2005 graduating class? - hawkril324 (<a href="../../../h/a/w/User_talk%7EHawkril324_a4f7.html" title="User talk:Hawkril324">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_hawkril324_cc2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/hawkril324">contribs</a>)</li>

<li><b>My Stance</b> Memorial High School is reputed to be one of the best public high schools in the country. The school is prominant in its community because it promotes the idea of original thought. This article does nothing other then attempt to show the true culture inside a memorial high school classroom, the experiences inside a class as it relates to the high school, and memories therein. I feel that if i was looking for a high school for my children, a site like this would be greatly benificial. Oftentimes, it is hard to find the nature of a community, especially if you are on the outside coming in. If someone were looking whether or not to enroll their students in a high school, magazine rankings and other national highschool rankings are too broad to suit the specific needs of that individual. The job of wiki-pedia is to allow the exchange of information to happen silmutaniously inside this network of fact finding individuals. If the comments included in this article were in fact false, and not condusive to a fact finding mission, it will be immediately edited by others, as such is the nature of wiki-pedia. I dont see any reason this article should not be included, and i dont see that it poses any threat whatsoever to the general wiki-pedia community as a whole. Many who come and look here will find the website to be very helpful, nastoglic, and often times amusing. There is nothing wrong with merging fact and fun, it can be done in a responsible manner that will endorse the community of Memorial, wiki-pedia, and all parties affected by it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.17.52.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.17.52.96_ae96.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.17.52.96">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Despite the personal vendetta that Mr. Pinkham seems to have against memorial wikipedia pages(he has tried to get two shut down)<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, this page is without a doubt encyclopedic; it gives information regarding events and characteristics of Memorial High School. Shutting it down would go agianst everything Wikipedia stands for, regardless of the ideas of a few misguided individuals(see above). Even if it only services a few hundred people a year, i doubt that a wikipedia page on the Pornography star Brittney Skye services more. (I'm not going to make the obvious joke...).

<dd><b>Additional comment</b> And if this article by some miracle stays, I'm starting an article about memories from MY high school days, including Mr. Hector (who swore a lot, but was a nice guy), Mrs. Weiselberg (total bitch), and one of my classmates, Brandon, whose seemed to only say "DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT!!!" for our whole senior year. Seriously, none of this is notable. There is a place for this kind of stuff, but not here. -- <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicAD_bfdb.html" title="User:SonicAD">SonicAD</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonicAD_f5e8.html" title="User talk:SonicAD">talk</a>) 04:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment:</b> It saddens me that none of you went to a particularly outstanding high school.

<dd>It has nothing to do with envy. I loved my high school, great teachers for the most part, great people, great times, etc. That's not the point though, it's simply about how notable and verifiable this information is. The fact that a student often yells out "Penis!" in class is not notable in any way, unless it's someone who him or herself is notable (in which case it could be mentioned in said person's own article, if it's somehow relevant). The best thing to do is make your own website, even your own wiki. You can make your own rules there, but this page doesn't meet Wikipedia's rules.-- <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicAD_bfdb.html" title="User:SonicAD">SonicAD</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonicAD_f5e8.html" title="User talk:SonicAD">talk</a>) 05:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
