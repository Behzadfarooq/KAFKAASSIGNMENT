<p>This article needs to be simplified, and all approaches need to lead to 2/3, including qualitative approach. As mentioned on talk page, just because there are only 2 cards it can be, this does not mean that both are equally likely. And it really needs a text book source somewhere. oh and I suggest adding the experimental approach as a reasonable 3rd way.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 00:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also, note that Morse gave a suitable definition for ordered pair which covers the case of classes: redefine <i>(x,y)</i> as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/6/1/161bea6021067158fe5c66783c28a420.png" alt="(x \times \{0\}) \cup (y \times \{1\})" /> (where the cartesian products are defined in terms of the usual Kuratowski pair.

<dd>True. But it fails in MKU or NBGU (U = <a href="../../../u/r/e/Urelement.html" title="Urelement">urelements</a>), as you have a different definition of ordered pairs of objects which may be urelemnts or sets, and of objects which may be sets or classes. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 01:13, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for noticing and correcting the blunder re injection/bijection; I can easily make this mistake since I identify functions with their graphs and so do not customarily use the codomain, and I might not have noticed...

<p>Please consult with me about the nature of the fix you want to put in (I wrote the axiomatization in the current article). von Neumann does have historical priority for this form of set theory, and his axiom which conflates Replacement and Global Choice (what I call "Limitation of Size") is worth presenting (though admittedly rather weird); but I'm perfectly happy to see a more familiar form presented as an alternative (in my notes I talk about the possibility of an alternative formulation closer to the usual Replacement axiom). I would like to see both formulations in the article rather than have an argument about it... <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandall_Holmes_3178.html" title="User:Randall Holmes">Randall Holmes</a> 17:08, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS: I'm quite confident that there are things wrong with that article (including the parts I wrote), but I do think that von Neumann's axiom should appear in it, at least as an alternative. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandall_Holmes_3178.html" title="User:Randall Holmes">Randall Holmes</a> 17:13, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about writing it in as an alternative (leaving mine alone temporarily), and then I'll look at it and (assuming that I like your mother's set of axioms, which I probably will; I'll look for her book in our library) I'll try to add a treatment of von Neumann's axiom suited to your mother's set, at which point my development (which has no special authority) could be eliminated. Does your mother's set include a finite axiomatization of class comprehension (if it didn't, that would be a reason to keep my treatment, or to adapt my finite axiomatization section to your mother's axioms)? <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandall_Holmes_3178.html" title="User:Randall Holmes">Randall Holmes</a> 20:21, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Quantity in mathematics</span></h2>
<p>Arthur, thanks for comments regarding <i>quantity in mathematics</i> in the article on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>. Some responses have been made on the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Talk%7EQuantity_eb5e.html" title="Talk:Quantity">talk</a> page under the <i>points to be addressed</i> section, which are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>As for Arthur's comment regarding a line status: it must be clar the every line is a limited length, which belong to a fundamental quantity (as measure) along with mass, time period and temperature.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Concerning scalars, vectore and tensors, they are first of all variable quantities (variables assuming a set of values) that can be resolved into components; although other properties can be added up as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you make any sense of this? I cannot.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a>:</p>
<p><i>Mathematics is often defined as the study of topics such as <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>, structure, space, and change. Another view, held by many mathematicians, is that mathematics is the body of knowledge justified by deductive reasoning, starting from axioms and definitions.</i></p>
<p>I take this to imply two views: (i) that mathematics is concerned with studying abstract properties of quantity, structure, space and change (all of which pertain to the empirical world); and (ii) that mathematics is concerned with the formal study of abstract entities (e.g. logicism). I have serious reservations about defining such concepts as scalars and vectors literally as <i>being</i> quantities. Input would be appreciated. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolon_0029.html" title="User:Holon">Holon</a> 01:58, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arthur, I am as annoyed of this troll as everybody else here, but I think it would be better to handle him correctly, and avoid unnecessary provocations. Wasn't your last revert a bit too much?

<dd>I think <b>my</b> last revert was in scope, as the question asked was why he was banned from ja.wikipedia.com, and a plausibly authoritative answer was removed in favor of speculation.

<dd>Nearly. I still don't consider the policy necessary, but I said would conditionally <u>abstain</u> if your condition was met <i>and</i> all improper (i.e., those in which the content itself would not be deleted, even from userspace) speedy deletions and out-of-process deletions were reverted — and (a new condition) all improper subst'ing was changed to subst as {{userbox}} rather than as raw HTML, at least at the user's option. It's possible that this last condition might not require a change in policy from the modified proposal, so I'm not insisting on the last clause, but first reverting the out-of-process deletions and subst'ing <i>is</i> a requirement. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 01:56, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree -- however, there may be a real field there, somewhere. Chaos theory, as currently described, only discusses systems with some various of quasi-periodic or pseudo-periodic orbits.

<p>I appreciate it. For some reason, several people here who ought to know better feel that because we disagree with them, nobody is obliged either to be civil to us or to assume good faith on our part. For over four years, I've edited articles and had little interest in Wikipedia politics. Suddenly people who have come only in the last 18 months are claiming to speak for and defend the entire Wikipedian culture whilst engaging in very un-Wikipedian acts. The last two months have been for me a tour of the dark underbelly of Wikipedian leadership. Opposing this proposed userbox ban- its assumptions, its impacts, its mechanisms, its corruptions- unfortunately may be the most important thing we do here for a while.

<p>Arthur Rubin, I created these redirects to fix an issue with some pages that parsed dates using the {{CURRENTDAY}} variable in conjuction with a numeric single digit date. for double digit dates (e.g. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">04-05</a> ) it works but for (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../0/4/-/04-5.html" title="04-5">04-5</a>) it fails.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Game</span></h2>
<p>People play The Game for number of reasons. Personally, I find it interesting to see what causes people to think of The Game, and hence lose. Sometimes these will be obvious causes, such as talking about other games, but at other times the reasons will be completely abstract. Various associations also build up. For example, if I lose for whatever reason and happen to be looking at the words "Arthur Rubin", then the next time I see those words I might lose. The more it happens the stronger the association becomes. It is sometimes difficult for players to pinpoint the exact thought process that lead to their loss. The Game is efectively an arbitrary thought that can be used to investigate memory and association.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marijuana Wiki</span></h2>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I see that you are a pro-Cannabis Wikipedian so I hope this will be of some interest to you.</p>
<p>I've started a Marijuana wiki (aka The Sticky Wiki) which I think you might be interested in. I'm hoping you can help me get started with this project. Whereas lots of articles about weed get speedy-deleted on Wikipedia, they would be totally cool over at MarijuanaWiki. But really I want the site to be more of a marijuana community than merely an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>To give you an example, I want to have city guides about where to score, find pot-friendly cafes, marijuana events, and what represents a good price in that city. Etc. (You can check out the featured article: "Toronto" to see what I mean). I also want to have grow diaries and marijuana blogs. All in all, basically more communal than encyclopedic.</p>
<p>I am in need of admins/moderators, and people experienced with MediaWiki to help build policy, categories, and templates, etc. If you'd be interested in helping me with this project, the URL is <a href="http://marijuana.relately.com/" class="external text" title="http://marijuana.relately.com/" rel="nofollow">MarijuanaWiki</a></p>

<p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p>Its me again. I have another alternative that I feel should be acceptable for you (with regards to the 10526.... article). I can create a page on "k-parasitic numbers" (see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A092697" class="external free" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A092697" rel="nofollow">http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A092697</a> and <a href="http://www.michael-kreil.de/html/mathematik.html" class="external free" title="http://www.michael-kreil.de/html/mathematik.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.michael-kreil.de/html/mathematik.html</a> for reference) and redirect all the included numbers to that article. All the interesting properties of individual numbers can be discussed there.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I remember sending you a communication about my intention of making article on k-parasitic numbers. That way, it will become a part of the article and as a whole belong to a class of article that is notable. Had you replied earlier, I would have already blanked the article and made it a redirect.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal remarks</span></h2>
<p>Re your comment on the p-adic numbers page, I think a better use for you time and abilities might be to write more articles on subjects you know. In the last month, I've turned some stubs on important, sometimes central, topics into real articles: <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_number_field.html" title="Algebraic number field">algebraic number field</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_curve.html" title="Algebraic curve">algebraic curve</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model.html" title="Poincaré disk model">Poincaré disk model</a>, and for less important topics, a slew of special cuves, for instance. I've started other articles, adding all of the content: <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperboloid_model.html" title="Hyperboloid model">hyperboloid model</a>, <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klein_model.html" title="Klein model">Klein model</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valuation_ring.html" title="Valuation ring">valuation ring</a>. For this I get a suggestion that perhaps I should be Wiki-stalked. With all due respect, I don't think you've done more during that period; I don't see any substantial expansions or new article creations. Why, then, do you feel impelled to make personal remarks? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 06:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the three articles I mentioned, I see substantial errors in your revisions or positions, and the Wikipedia concensus seems to agree. Perhaps <i>you</i> should stick to subjects you know, and leave those subjects in which you have peripheral knowledge to <b>those</b> experts. I'm more of a mathematical generalist, at this point, although I made significant revisions in <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory_ce2d.html" title="Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory">von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</a>, which you would see in the talk page.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the apology, but I'm afraid your claim to see "substantial errors" (which you have not explained) sounds like it is probably nonsense.

<dd>For the p-adics, the primary error is the assertion that anyone other than yourself uses your preferred notation.

In fact, to the extent there is a standard notation, that's it; or either that or giving a mod p^n reduction. No one uses right-to-left in serious work, it's all something people use when trying to explain the p-adics. No one uses my notation either, but I not only didn't I say they did, I said it was <b>not</b> standard notation in the article you are objecting to. And anyway, this isn't a math error, even if I'm wrong, and you can find a research article using right-to-left!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">La Jolla</span></h2>
<p>Just curious why you would prefer an article name for a place that is totally non-standard. <i>Nobody</i> (outside of a handful of Wiki editors) refers to communities like La Jolla as {community, city, state}. The primary principle for naming in Wikipedia is to use "the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things" See: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a>. This is why New Yorkers won't accept <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York, New York</a> (they insist on the more common, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. This is also why <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> is <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, and not Manhattan, New York City, New York.

<dd>Specific problems with the article:</dd>
<dd>1. Title of article
<dl>
<dd>A. No one is going to look for it under that name. Perhaps "Types of errors (statistics)", but a better title could be found. Furthermore, the count is wrong, as many of the "errors of the 4th kind" are distinct and incompatible, so there really shouldn't even be a trace of an article with this name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. Errors of the 3rd and 4th kind
<dl>
<dd>A. You have at least the following distinct errors of the 3rd kind
<dl>
<dd>1. Providing the right answer to the wrong question</dd>
<dd>2. choosing the test falsely to suit the significance of the sample</dd>
<dd>3. correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for the wrong reason</dd>
<dd>4. incorrect decision of direction following a rejected two-tailed test of hypothesis</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>B. and 3 distinct errors of the 4th kind
<dl>
<dd>1. the error of giving the wrong answer to the wrong question.</dd>
<dd>2. solving the right problem too late.</dd>
<dd>3. the incorrect interpretation of a correctly rejected hypothesis</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The errors of the 3rd kind could be unified, by careful choice of definitions, (although that unification might be <a href="../../../o/r/i/WP%7EOriginal_Research_47d3.html" title="WP:Original Research">WP:Original Research</a>), but not those of the 4th kind.</dd>
<dd>For what it's worth, my father (Herman Rubin) proposes a number of different errors, most of which fall into the category of chosing the hypothesis after looking at the data. That doesn't match any of the errors mentioned in the article, but it's still an error.</dd>
<dd>You've written an excellent article. If you chose a plausible title and do not try to count the errors (only the errors of the 1st and 2nd kind are at all standarized), it might even become a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">Wikipedia:Featured article</a>. Also, an article unifying the errors of the first and second kind seems an excellent idea; my expository skills are not up to the task, but there could easily be such an article. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 07:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your explanation and guidance. I agree with your view that types I &amp; II can only really be understood in terms of one another; and that is why I decided to merge them.</dd>
<dd>Another pertinent issue is that a wide range of the literature in the social sciences are now referring to "type I errors" and "type II errors" without the slightest explanation of the terms (and I have also seen something like "and, of course, this is an error of the second kind" without any explanation at all of what such a thing might be).</dd>
<dd>So, on the basis that Wiki will often be a place of first reference for many non-experts, I felt (and still feel) that the article should be "elastic" enough to stretch just a little way from the more precise statistical usage in relation to the first two categories only, in order to allow them to understand the evolution of the notion of rejecting something that should have been accepted and the notion of accepting something that should have been rejected.</dd>
<dd>A third issue is that, in relation to my academic studies (relating to aspects of thought experiments) I made a wide range of enquiries some 18 months ago amongst mathematicians and statisticians that I knew, and even one actuarial acquaintance (and, also, they asked amongst their friends and colleagues), and none of them knew where the terms came from. It took me some time to unearth the original Neyman and Pearson sources; and, as a consequence of that trouble, I am also certain that the article must contain accurate references to their work.</dd>
<dd>In relation to the other two categories, I'll take some quiet time to ponder on your astute comments and valuable feed-back and come up with a possible solution (maybe it will take a day or two) and, once I have determined some way to cover that sort of information in a precise way, I will immediately "run it past you" (assuming that is OK with you).</dd>
<dd>Finally, in relation to the title. . . I was never really happy with what I chose; however I thought it better to choose something, and then get on with writing. You have made me understand that I must be more careful in future.</dd>
<dd>I am flat out with a number of tasks at the moment, including my studies, and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Best to you (and "Thanks" once more)<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindsay658_d7de.html" title="User:Lindsay658">Lindsay658</a> 08:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arthur Rubin and Septentrionalis. I have thought long and hard about the comments from both of you.</dd>
<dd>Upon reflection, I have formed the view that despite the fact that (as you, Arthur Rubin, so correctly remarked) the type III errors and, especially the type IV errors, have no real connexion with those things that are included within the first and second types, it is a simple matter of fact that many people can be led to think that they do (i.e., on the basis of their appearance in various sorts of literature); and, therefore, they do need to have some sort of information presented about them (just on the basis that many people think that they belong to the same class), even if that information is simply to say that they are not "standard" to the extent that the first two are.</dd>
<dd>I suppose, too, it is also correct to say that, whilst the III and the IV have no connexion of any sort with the I &amp; II pair, they certainly are "associated" in the minds of many people (by that, I mean those people who have encountered the notions of either a "type III error" or a "type IV error" in their reading).</dd>
<dd>As a consequence of these ruminations, I have decided that the information about the so-called type III errors and type IV errors
<dl>
<dd>(a) should remain there (on the basis that the information contains important material relating to the sources of the notions), and</dd>
<dd>(b) should be treated in a different way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>namely, that they should be presented in the spirit of being the consequences of various people hoping to leap upon an already well-established band-wagon, and allowing that band-wagon to become a presentation vehicle for whatever notion they wish to make known to the world at large.</dd>
<dd>Given all of that, this is what I am proposing:</dd>
<dd>(1) Rename the page "Type I and type II errors".</dd>
<dd>(2) At the head of the article only list the first two sorts of error (and, therefore, relegating any reference to a third and fourth sort of error to a later section (see (3) below).</dd>
<dd>(3) Amagamate the current sections of "Type III" and "Type IV" errors into a single section entitled "Proposals for further extension", with some introductory remarks to the effect that whilst they may, indeed be referring to "errors", they are errors of a different nature from the mirror images of types I &amp; II.</dd>
<dd>(4) Amalgamate most of current footnote 8 into the text of the "Null hypothesis" section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope that this meets your approval, Best to both of you<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindsay658_d7de.html" title="User:Lindsay658">Lindsay658</a> 01:34, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 12:50, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, it does seem that I will need some guidance about how straighten out the double redirects as Septentrionalis suggested; I have no idea how to go about it.</dd>
<dd>Another thing, given that the entire page now looks rather neat and tidy, is there some way that the physical size of the mathematical formulae in the "false negative rate" and "false positive rate" can be reduced?

<p>Hi Arthur.

<p>Hey Arthur, good luck on your RfA. Looks like it's going well. In any case, I noticed that there is a RfM pending on the Armando/Daily Kos discussion and you added yourself as a party.

<p>Yes, I debated putting the years back in, and can do quickly if you think it's a good idea (I was there primarily to deal with the month links). However for the 20th/21st C there will be eventually entries for almost every year, so the value of the links seem limited. Post about 2050 (?) the years redirect to centuries an millenia anyway.

<p>Hi Arthur. Just a note. I read on <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarl-H_03b6.html" title="User talk:Karl-H">User talk:Karl-H</a> about the issues with this editor, but I feel that when reverting his contributions, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integral_equation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66035594" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integral_equation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66035594" rel="nofollow">here</a>, one better use the old style revert rather than the rollback button. Adding an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summary.html" title="Edit summary">edit summary</a> may make it clear why you reverted, and the user may feel less upset about it (the admin rollback is usually associated with vandalism reversion).</p>

<p>Hello Arthur, I've been editing the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Intelligence_0923.html" title="Universal Intelligence">Universal Intelligence</a> page and I've discovered that its used in conjunction with artificial intelligence. This <a href="http://www.vetta.org/documents/Benelearn-UniversalIntelligence-Talk.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vetta.org/documents/Benelearn-UniversalIntelligence-Talk.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> website (page 13) has a mathmatical formula which I would like to include in the AI subsection on the UI page but I don't know how to put it in. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated, unless you think the formula is complete bonkers. (I have no idea if it is or isn't)&#160;:) Thanks--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughgr_00b8.html" title="User:Hughgr">Hughgr</a> 18:40, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The formula would seem a reasonable measure of "problem-solving ability", which might be considered a measure of intelligence. However, it can't actually be <b>calculated</b> for at least three reasons:
<ul>
<li>As noted on page 12, <i>K</i>(<i>μ</i>) depends on the specific Turing machine <i>U</i>.</li>
<li><s>As there are potentially 2^<i>n</i> strings of length <i>n</i>, the sum may diverge</s>. OOPS, I missed <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefix_code.html" title="Prefix code">prefix</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Turing_machine_dd3d.html" title="Universal Turing machine">universal Turing machine</a>. It may still not numerically converge, as in <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/4/f/64f8a6c3f02887935565115c22c1060d.png" alt="\sum_n \frac{1}{n \ln^2 n}" /></li>
<li>The function, itself, is not <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computable_function.html" title="Computable function">computable</a>. See our article on <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolmogorov_complexity.html" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a> for an explanation of <i>why</i> <i>K</i>(<i>μ</i>) is not computable. (And those are for finite strings. This is more complicated, as it appears to be a (computable) <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real.html" title="Real">real</a>-valued function.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, if you want to include the formula, I see no difficulty in defining
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/4/0/34023df7160bca0a5bd20fc67c858358.png" alt="\Upsilon (\pi)=\sum_{\mu \in E}{2^{-K(\mu)}V_\mu^\pi}" /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>where <i>E</i> is the set of all payoff/outcome functions (see page 11) (loosely speaking), π is a "universal" strategy, <i>K</i> is the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolmogorov_complexity.html" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>, and (page 9)
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/e/7/be7344e8208c75106a5426fcaf066f50.png" alt="V_\mu^\pi = \mathbf{E} \left ( \sum_{i=1}^\infty r_i \right )" /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(the expected payoff with environment μ and strategy π, if you don't want include that formula.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for page 8, getting the sequence from μ and strategy π, the appropriate concepts are probably in <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom_of_determinacy.html" title="Axiom of determinacy">axiom of determinacy</a>. <i>They should be, anyway.</i></dd>

<p>Rubin There isn't any schools there it is a blank page I was just trying to at least add someting so it doen't look so bad.

<p>Hello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:</p>
<p>"The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a>. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) 17:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)."</p>
<p>I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes?</p>
<p>I ask, of course, because you are a "relatively famous Wikipedian" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

<dd>Actually, I <i>meant</i> there was no such "intractable paradox" described (or mentioned, in sufficient detail to identify it) in the article; and that a paradox being "intractable" is (in almost all cases) a conclusion showing lack of imagination. (The only exceptions are in mathematics, where a paradox may be <b>provably</b> intractable.) See, for example the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraviolet_catastrophe.html" title="Ultraviolet catastrophe">ultraviolet catastrophe</a> for a physical paradox which could not be resolved within classical physics, requiring quantum physics to resolve it. Would you call that "intractable", or say that quantum physics is "a level above the paradox"? I'm requesting clarification, here, as well. As for CTMU — well, I'll wait for your reply to this question. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:59, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> The question of whether one mathematical (or observational) structure stands in a certain relationship to another, or whether, given a structure and a set of relational constraints formulated with respect thereto, another structure satisfying those constraints can be generated or identified in polynomial time (in a number of steps expressible as as a polynomial function of the total number of structural elements), is not the question I'm asking here...although this question can easily be related to the questions that I <i>am</i> asking.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For present purposes, we might as well define an "intractable (scientific) paradox" as an apparent inconsistency which is agreed to exist by experts in the relevant field(s) of science, but which those experts have failed to conclusively and consensually resolve despite their protracted efforts to do so. (Such an inconsistency can be any of several kinds.) The question of whether such paradoxes owe to a "lack of imagination" on the parts of the experts "in almost all cases" is thus really about the creative competence of those experts. But although it would be possible to justify some fairly negative judgments along those lines, that's still not the question I'm asking here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The questions I'm asking here are (1) given such an inconsistency, can you resolve it without a metalanguage of the theory or theories (and data sets) which generate it, and (2) if you own that such a metalanguage is required, is this metalanguage - i.e., a language sufficient for the full expression of the interpretative mapping M:T&lt;--&gt;U, where T stands for a (scientific) theory and U stands for the observable universe of that theory - <i>necessarily</i> scientific in nature? That is, in and of itself, does such a metalanguage necessarily involve observational applications of the scientific method (as opposed to the axiomatic method)?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You go on to discuss the UV catastrophe. As we all know, the UV catastrophe was "resolved" by the quantization of light, ultimately leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, there remains a problem with quantum mechanics: the formalism observably corresponds to reality only at limited junctures. The questions of if and how <i>the rest of it</i> corresponds to observable reality remain matters of widespread confusion, and have led to several conflicting interpretations of QM which are necessarily expressed in a "philosophical" metalanguage of QM (which can itself be cast as a metalanguage of classical mechanics). If one of these interpretations is ever refined to the extent that it can generate new falsifiable predictions, it will become "scientific". But until then, we're stuck with philosophical (observationally unfalsifiable) interpretations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have already identified "imagination" as important in the resolution of scientifc paradoxes. This alone casts doubt on the notion that there exists any algorithm generating a valid resolution in every case. However, you still seem to believe that there <i>is</i> a set of principles which can be used to conclusively <i>identify</i> such resolutions once they are given, and more generally, to quickly and superficially distinguish between valid and invalid resolutions. Prior to encountering you, the Hillman agent, and certain others here at Wikipedia, I hadn't known of any such principles. I am therefore asking you to share these principles - as opposed to the biases, hunches, rules of thumb, and other voodoo on which others have relied - with the rest of world.</dd>

<dd>I get the feeling that we're not speaking the same (meta-)language. But, to try to reply to your point on the metalanguage — <i>why</i> does "a metalanguage of the theory or theories..." <i>help</i>? In other words, given such an inconsistency, can you resolve it <i>with</i><s>out</s> a metalanguage of the theory or theories (and data sets) which generate it.... — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 21:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, we'd <i>better</i> be speaking the same metalanguage, because only one kind of metalanguage is capable of coherently expressing the distinctions between science and pseudoscience, science and the philosophy of science, and physics and metaphysics. Those who can't speak it have nothing to go on but conjecture and personal bias regarding those distinctions. As a mathematician, you must already know this.</dd>

<dd>Regarding how such a metalanguage - a "theory of theories" - can help, that's simple: it can address the nature of the <i>general</i> correspondence between theories and observations. This correspondence, which is normatively described by the scientific method, is a requisite of science; without it, no scientific theory could describe or predict its universe to any extent whatsoever. Therefore, because science exists, the correspondence is real, and is subject to analysis as a source of potentially valuable information regarding science, its methodology, and ultimately, its content. The metalanguage in question is just an elaboration of this correspondence, and the theory which forms the topic of the article which you helped to delete is an advanced description of that metalanguage.</dd>

<dd>Remember, no scientist, mathematician, or philosopher needs to solve everything up in detail in one paper. The PCID paper cited in the CTMU article considers very simple operations, implementing them very directly in order to produce a new kind of theoretical structure. Frankly, no one who has read and understood it is likely to argue about that. I am therefore left to assume that you either did not read the material cited in the article, or that you did read some small part of it but failed to understand it.</dd>

<dd>I've answered every question you've asked, and as well as I need to, without mentioning those particular words (which, as far as I know, were considerably predated by the CTMU). Irreducible and specified complexity were mentioned in the PCID paper as elements not of the CTMU, but only of ID theory, probably as a gesture to the readers of that journal. By no stretch of the imagination does this make the CTMU equivalent to "ID theory". In fact, the CTMU was explicitly presented as a framework for the simultaneous interpretation of strong but ambiguously-related scientific theories <i>including the theory of evolution</i>. This framework "resolves intractable paradoxes of science" because it jointly quantizes such theories in the sparest, most general, and most background-free way possible, with no need for Christian Fundamentalism or any other body of religious belief or doctrine.</dd>

<dd>As those who have read and understood the PCID paper are well aware, the CTMU is based on a profound degree of closure and thus exhibits an unprecedented degree of structural autonomy. But even if that weren't the case, professional scientists and mathematicians, and NPOV-conscious Wikipedia editors and administrators, are not supposed to make knee-jerk judgments triggered by mere academic no-no's like "intelligent design". Rather, they are expected to make and formulate their judgments with care, accuracy, and neutrality.</dd>

<p>In the current version of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfinite_number.html" title="Transfinite number">Transfinite number</a>, it says "The continuum hypothesis states that there are no intermediate cardinal numbers between aleph-null and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinality_of_the_continuum.html" title="Cardinality of the continuum">cardinality of the continuum</a> (the set of real numbers): that is to say, aleph-one is the cardinality of the set of real numbers.".

<p>Hello, Mr. Rubin. Did you look at the extensive discussion of the source for the forum moderation technique before doing your latest revert? I urge you to consider that a professional lexicographer cites this very definition in his online slang dictionary. Will points out that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says to be careful when citing an expert in a field on something then the citation has not been overseen by someone else, but there is a modicum of oversight in this case, and the guideline does not say that one mustn't cite it. What I frankly don't understand about all this is that there seems to be an effort here to wipe out a definition of the word that is clearly in use, by trying to find excuses to disallow any source that may be found.

<dd>No, the splat definition was <b>still</b> there, listed second, as it is no longer the one most commonly used. It had the Jargon File still listed, and a demonstration of how it looks.

That you can't see a dispute seems grounds for blocking, as well, as it's clear to all others. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><code>That [I] can't see a dispute seems grounds for blocking, as well, as it's clear to all others.</code> Interesting... And not fixing double redircets is not disruption, that's a technical oversight. Again, interesting theories, but wrong. I've yet to hear an admin voice an opinion on this. Simply because a user places an ANI notice does not provide you with a license to wheel war. Not to mention that you did not even respond to that ANI notice before starting to wheel war. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 14:50, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>For something as uncontentious and obscure as Unicode redirects—or most any redirect for that matter, deletion review is just a waste of time. As in this case, it was just an error, easily fixable. Even if it weren't, I don't think anyone deleting them has some sort of agenda with regard to Unicode redirects. It is only a matter for pointing out the error on the user's talk page. Really, for anything like this, that is the first stop and deletion review is only necessary when people are being obstinate. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 04:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arthur; you and I have debated on the 9/11 pages. But that's not what I'm writing about here. On one of the AfD pages you mentioned your "scribblings". But I see no mention of them on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rubin_108b.html" title="Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a>. If you'd like to list those here I'd be happy to paste them onto the page. Also, I noticed that you worked on <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory_ce2d.html" title="Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory">Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</a>. I'd never heard of it. When I took set theory in the 90s I remembered suffering much <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_dissonance.html" title="Cognitive dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> from the very beginning because of the concept of using an axiom schema. Apparently the NBG obviates that need at the expense of being a "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_extension.html" title="Conservative extension">conservative extension</a>" of ZFC. I haven't studied conservative extensions so I don't know if using one is "too liberal"; thus my question: do mathematicians use NBG widely in place of ZFC? <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaimiddleton_a602.html" title="User:Kaimiddleton">Kaimiddleton</a> 22:29, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could give you a list of my publications, or put it on one of my web sites, but it would just be my word, so it couldn't be added on that basis, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I can check to see if any of the journals have online indicies. Probably best would be for me to create a subpage of my user page with my publications, and see which of them can be verified. Alternativly, someone with access to the <a href="http://www.ams.org/mr-database" class="external text" title="http://www.ams.org/mr-database" rel="nofollow">Math Reviews database</a> or a <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citation_index.html" title="Citation index">citation index</a> could look me up, and I could confirm which of the A. Rubin's and Arthur Rubin's listed there are me. (This last might have the additional advantage that the 2 papers in which I participated, but never received final publication information, might be located. Hint: My middle initial is "L", as there seem to be a few papers by Arthur H. Rubin.)</dd>
<dd>As for NBG (which I've usually seen as vNBG, but I haven't been active in the field for some time), there are advantages and disadvantages. As it's a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_extension.html" title="Conservative extension">conservative extension</a> (the definition in our article is adequate, but only if you consider NBG as a two-sorted system, which is not technically necessary), it doesn't really matter. But some analyses benefit from the finite set of axioms of NBG, while other analyses benefit from the fact that any theorem of ZF follows from a finite set of the axioms of ZF, and that any finite set of the axioms of ZF has a countable model as seen from that model of ZF. Many of the "transfer" results of D. Pincus (see, for example, the references in <a href="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~jer/Papers/KW-AC-MC.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~jer/Papers/KW-AC-MC.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.purdue.edu/~jer/Papers/KW-AC-MC.pdf</a> and other papers of my late mother) work better in ZF than in vNBG.</dd>

<p>Hello Nice to see that some new faces have recently become interested in commenting on the article. However, I am interested to know how you became involved with the page? It would seem that someone came along and changed the title without any discussion. Then someone started a debate about a different title. A number of people I have never seen comment on a Harry Potter page then opposed the proposed further move. This is quite extraordinary attention for a HP page.</p>
<p>No one has yet explained the grounds for changing the page from its original title. Can you explain why this was done? It was also done by someone who had never edited the page before and was pretty inexperienced. A justification was given, but not explained. Then an anon deleted the debate. Also very strange. Why would anyone do this? Sounded like someone wanted to avoid discussion. While I do not think it likely that people would have opposed the page title change if it is satifactorily explained, this has still not been done. I do not see how any change of title can be discussed or considered unless someone explains why it needed to be moved in the first place. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 08:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's <i>right</i> with the caption? On my screen, your version went for 5 lines.

<p>Why is five lines "carried away"? The TOC for the article includes a total of 29 major and minor sections, thus runs for 29 lines. On my screen, the 360px-wide image covers about 7 lines; even if the image is hung <i>under</i> the introduction, that leaves about 16 lines of white space below it. As it is, with the image top right, there's even more of this vast visual desert going to waste. Why should this be empty?</p>
<p>I wrote that caption for <a href="../../../p/i/-/Image%7EPi-unrolled.gif_87e7.html" title="Image:Pi-unrolled.gif">Image:Pi-unrolled.gif</a>'s upcoming appearance on Main Page. It is substantially the same length as other FP captions. It covers important bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we construct the number line and why</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The exceptional nature of the operation of "unrolling"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The nature of the number found, π</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A common, everyday, real-world example of the illustration</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if you're able to cover all these bases in fewer words, I hope you will do so.

<dd>I think it (the caption) is ugly. Perhaps the information should be in the body somewhere, but captions should be short.

<p>Text is ugly? Or text is only ugly when it's a caption? Why should captions be short? They certainly shouldn't be very long but I think the paragraph is quite middle-sized. My rationale for putting the caption there does not depend on the image's FP status; it's simply that promotion prompted me to write a better caption. If you can further improve on it, please do so.</p>
<p>A lot is going on in that image -- by design. The four points I mentioned above are all relevant to the image; three to the image alone. What purpose will it serve to put the image one place and its explanation in another?

<p>I take your point about the local nature of toll-free directory assistance. I'll surely qualify that on reinsertion.</p>
<p>I think the whole problem with count vs volume began when the image was inserted under "count"; it's really a demonstration in terms of volume -- SI or not. The image alone does seem to lean toward counted unit cubes but then the little snippet of text was added about a cubic meter. I probably didn't make things any better; I'll try again.

<p>I saw your comments on my talk page. Sorry if I lost my cool temporarily, but I'm afraid that sometimes it seems as if a small group of editors, angry at their failed attempt to delete the Heim Theory page, are determined to infect it with their anti-Heim POV. I hope you also warned some of these sore losers when their arrogance poked throguh. Somewhere, unfortunately I can't find it right now, two of them were talking about deleting pages associated with Heim-theory such as Selector Calculus (so it might be they who deleted this and redirected it to difference operator), referring to Heim Theory 'metastasing' over wikipedia. This was a grossly improper, insulting way of referring to Heim Theory - equating it with a cancer.

However, the modern papers building on his work bring it up to the standards of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fringe_science.html" title="Fringe science">fringe science</a> (at least according to the reports of those who have read them.) I'm afraid I haven't been watching the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">Heim theory</a> article closely as of late, but the removal of the space driver speculation seems a significant improvement. I believe I <i>could</i> follow the papers if they were translated into English (as I have a PhD in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> from <a href="../../../c/a/l/CalTech_6949.html" title="CalTech">CalTech</a>, and took a number of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">GR</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">QM</a> courses there), but I really don't have the time to confirm whether his derivations are correct.

<p>Could you please have a look at that article. I am particularly concerned about the recently inserted picture of the Mandelbrot set. See my remark on the talk page. Although models of computation over the reals have been developed (e.g. by Smale, Shub, Blum and others) Kolomogorov complexity as dealt in this article concerns objects which are explictly encoded by finite bitstrings (<b>Remark</b>: what an encoding is for elements of a class of objects, is itself not entirely trivial. I think of an encoding as analogous to a chart on manifold; here two charts φ ψ are equivalent iff the overlap function φ ψ<sup>-1</sup> belongs to some computational class such as <b>PT</b>.) In any case, I don't see how one can consider a class subsets of the plane large enough to include the Mandelbrot set as being encoded by finite bitstrings. I am aware that some very special classes iteratively defined fractals can be encoded by finite bitsrings, but it's not clear to me how that applies here.</p>

<p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p>Major cities are not my topic I am the physiscal chemist, but I do care about science. I do not think that the Loughborough view of the world is so scientific and should be presented as such in wikipedia. I tried to politely point out a major and significant shortcoming in their approach: cities that grew from multiple centers like the Triangle -my current abode-, the Colorado Front range and -dare I say my hometown- the Netherlands Randstad are simply not treated fairly. The article should at least be honest about the fact that other approaches are quite possible but all that gets censored away. Can we ask for arbitration or so. I am usually at nl: not here (I dont like it here because I always run into this kind of bias)</p>

<dd>We can try for arbitration; IMHO, it's generally slow enough that you could check in daily and not lose too much. However, your "multiple center" (or centre) argument wasn't taken from a reference (as far as I know), so cannot be placed in the article. It can, however, be placed in the talk page for discussion, which I did, even though <a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElk_Salmon_d84f.html" title="User:Elk Salmon">User:Elk Salmon</a> seems to think that GaWC is the only published analysis.

<dd>I thank you Arthur, although I am somewhat dismayed at your interpretation of 'taken from reference'. This way the most patent nonsense can be protected from any critique. This makes wikipedia decidely anti-scientific. In science any logical argument is allowed. Besides: I have nothing against putting the GaWC list in the article, but it at least deserves a remark about the procedure followed in it. I quote the list itself as proof: it treats Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague as separate entities. The 7 million people who live there all know that they live in a thing called Randstad.

<dd>Sorry about the delay. Unless you claim your website has the stature of the <a href="../../../o/n/-/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences_ebe3.html" title="On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences">OEIS</a>, it shouldn't be listed in <i>all</i> number sequence or property articles.

<dd>Probably not automatically; we've rejected some properties as "uninteresting" in the past. You could create a script for your user page to create the articles, but I would advise against doing it "automatically" — if, for no other reason, to ensure that we don't have the article under a different name. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OIES has been around for 40 years, my number gossip is only 7 years of work, (and I am working full-time with something else and I am a single mother). So, it is a long way ahead for me to create an On-line Encyclopedia of Integers matching in stature the OEIS. But this is what I am doing. OIES is a great website and I use it a lot, but it is not targeted to provide information about specific integers, and my website does. As by the guidelines, I can't put the link to my website in wiki. Thus, I am asking you to add the link where you think it is appropriate. I trust your judgement. You can find my resume on my personal website: <a href="http://www.tanyakhovanova.com" class="external free" title="http://www.tanyakhovanova.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tanyakhovanova.com</a> .

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Logic-systems</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, but a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic-system.html" title="Logic-system">Logic-system</a> is from logic. Indeed, it is from the area now called universal logic. It is a generalization of a Formal Theory as you might read the definition in Mendelson's book. Published results appear in the 2001 paper in the references. Another paper using logic-systems will appear in a few days in the journal Logica Universalis. More are in the works. It is shown there that a general logic-systems is equivalent to a consequence operator. Depending upon usage one can now use a general logic-system or a finite conseqeunce operator as representing a universal logic. Indeed, the lattice theoretic properties of the set of all finite consequence operators defined on a language have interesting set-theoretic logic-system properties. The language L is not considered as a formal language. Now, it was Tarski in 1931 who introduced the notion of universal logic via consequence operators when he defined the consequence operator. As to General Intelligent Design, I'll wait until there are at least 10 publications that use the material or reference it. At the moment, there are only four.

It's minor, but there were a couple of things that struck me:</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauvoir.html" title="Beauvoir">Beauvoir</a>, you stated "The exact target is a content dispute, which shouldn't be discussed here." However, when RFD was renamed "Redirects for discussion", one of the reasons given was that it should be a place people could take redirects they weren't sure what should be done with. It wasn't meant to be a dispute resolution mechanism, but support cases like this one (someone who wasn't sure what should be done). Typically, we close those as "re-targeted".</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyde_Frog_ac31.html" title="Clyde Frog">Clyde Frog</a>, you stated "moot, being created as an article". However, <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyde_Frog_ac31.html" title="Clyde Frog">Clyde Frog</a> wasn't actually the nominated redirect. <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyde_frog.html" title="Clyde frog">Clyde frog</a> was as I stated in my comment. The nominator mislabeled the heading. When you closed the discussion, you left the RFD tag on the redirect. Somebody did remove it the day after you closed it.</p>

<p>Arthur, please review my recent edits to the Langan bio and let me know if you think I have done anything to violate NPOV.

<dd>The rearrangement is just wrong. That he's a fellow of ISCID <i>must</i> precede the reference to the paper published by ISCID, or the <b>fact</b> that ISCID is an ID front (I mean, was created by ID advocates&#160;:) ) would be given undue weight.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Langan Article</span></h2>
<p>It's heartening to learn that you have a high IQ (although I would expect such given your degree and accomplishments). Perhaps you can examine one section of the Langan article and give me your considered opinion.</p>
<p>The opening sentence describes Langan as an "intelligent design advocate" and uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=90054583&amp;oldid=90052224" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=90054583&amp;oldid=90052224" rel="nofollow">this quote</a> as a reference for support. I think the quote is actually good, but does not support the statement that Langan is an ID advocate. It is more of an indicator of Langan's balanced position on the topic of ID - evolution. As such, I think it is good in the article but the designation "intelligent design advocate" ought to be removed or changed to better reflect Langan's position. What do you think? --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 19:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. Isn't that asking me to make an original synthesis of information? No?</dd>
<dd>Well, that quote alone, without further interpretation through CTMU or other philosphical constructs, is consistent either any of the following interpretations:
<ol>
<li>A modified <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropic_principle.html" title="Anthropic principle">anthropic principle</a> (if there weren't intelligent life in the <i>this</i> universe, we wouldn't be here to discuss it) and that the universe must contain "intelligence" in order to produce intelligent life, or</li>
<li>A redefinition of the term "intelligence" to state that a universe which "solves problems" must be "intelligent",</li>
<li>with his being an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a> advocate.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I just can't tell. From what I remember from reading the CTMU paper, I lean toward #3 with a hint of #2, but I could easily be wrong. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:58, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. My take on reading Langan is that his position is largely 1 &amp; 2. It's POV to depict him in a particular way that is not consistent with the position he takes in his writings. That's what's being done in his bio. This is especially true in light of the fact that the ID buzzwords have been conflated with creationism and used to paint people as creationists, or evolution-deniers, and dismiss their ideas. Langan makes very clear in his writing that he supports the concept of evolution (although it is not in itself explanatory in the complete sense). I hope you can step back and evaluate the changes that I suggest in the future in an open manner (maybe even make some of your own) in an effort to maintain NPOV in that article. --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 20:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're wrong in part. The mathematics of ID makes no sense, so it would be MHO (and the stated opinions of some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) that ID is a cover for creationism.

<p>Whether or not ID is a cover for creationism or the mathematics of ID makes sense to you or anyone else really has nothing to do with Langan and the CTMU. The CTMU as a "cover" for ID is nonsense! I have read all of Langan's published writings at length and he is very cautious regarding ID. He has never endorsed it and totally avoids the politics. He took advantage of ISCID's open-minded offer of publishing his work and I believe that is the extent of their relationship. Please bear that in mind. --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 16:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Arthur - I am looking for your advice here.

As I understand it, warnings should not be removed from talk pages.

<dd>It's been established that removing talk page warnings is not <i>necessarily</i> in violation of WP policy, I'm afraid. (See the discussion on the deletion of the warning template <i>about</i> removing warnings.)

<p>Arthur - if you're going to lecture people about failing to assume good faith, you should really refrain from edit summaries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=90760431&amp;oldid=90750421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Michael_Langan&amp;diff=90760431&amp;oldid=90750421" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.

Either DrL is Langan's wife, and thus she has a valid opinion (which should be restricted to the talk page) <i>or</i> she isn't, in which case she is just a pov-pushing edit warrior, who is editing against consensus.

<p>Mr. Rubin: Sorry to see you get caught in the middle of the lobbying efforts by the protagonist(s) of the article on Mr. Langan. However, violations of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAutobiography_1f61.html" title="WP:Autobiography">WP:Autobiography</a>, by an apparent husband-and-wife team engaged in attempting to control the content of the husband's WP article, require mention of who the participating parties are in order to identify what the relevant issue is. These WP users appear to have a conflict of interest, and a "warning" by either of those parties for me to desist from mentioning either of them is not, in my judgment, a genuine warning based on any actual violation of WP policy. It is instead simply a lobbying attempt by one of the involved users. That is why I removed it from my talk page.

<p>I regret to inform you that Werdnabot has trashed your talk page at 13 December 2006. See difference:</p>

<p>Werdna was fixing a bug caused by changes in underlying library routines. When he ran the new version, it changed all the ampersands to ampersand-"amp"-semicolons on all pages it touched (i.e. "&amp;" to "&amp;" (edit to see this)). He then ran a program to revert all those changes. But some of us (including you) had had our pages editted since and it did not revert them. But it did revert in your archive file.</p>
<p>The result of this was that eight section of your talk have been removed but do not appear in your archive and many other parts of your talk page have the screwed up ampersands. I tried to "undo" Werdnabot's bad edit, but the "undo" failed due to conflicting intermediate edits. By the way, Werdnabot has done another archive job (correctly this time) since the bad one. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have learned from other kind users (DGG) what to do when an entry needs more help from the community to flesh it out and where the notability guidelines are for my American Biographies project.

<dd>I replied on the AfD pages, but it would be better if you kept the articles in user-space (as subpages of your user page) until such time as you've added indications of notablility.

<p>Hey, I was just wonding what you meant by "wikipedia etiquette". According to the rules for talk, formatting other comments is allowed as long as you don't change the actual comment. Putting the comments in categories based on what they're talking about seemed like the right thing to do. The way it is now you have to jump back and forth to figure out who's talking to who and about what. What you did just doesn't make sense to me, shouldn't there be an attempt to make the talk page more readable as long as no person has their comment changed? <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFintler_e8de.html" title="User:Fintler">fintler</a> 00:45, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with royalty, ship names, and highways, but how is "the most common name" unknown or difficult to determine for settlements?

<dd>I think that's what we're arguing about, rather than the disambiguation question. In the case of major cities, it may be that they are normally referred to by the short-name (as you've been arguing), but, even within California, the <i>city</i> of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Forest%2C_California_3ac5.html" title="Lake Forest, California">Lake Forest</a> is probably better known as <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Toro%2C_California_96d5.html" title="El Toro, California">El Toro, California</a>.

<dd>Of course there are <i>exceptions</i> for which the most common name is difficult to determine, like your Lake Forest/El Toro example, but surely you're not contending that that is the case for most settlements? By the way, I don't think I've ever heard <i>anyone</i> refer to El Toro as <i>El Toro, California</i>. They may do that out of the state, but surely the vast majority of references to El Toro are made within California where it is rarely qualified with the state. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 21:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to the "Secretary of the Commonwealth"'s site, DBAs are registered with the city or town.

Several editors have complained about the poor sources (or outright lack of sources). DrOliver, a plastic surgeon who had Maxwell as a teacher, wrote this article. I do think it is a 'fluff' piece, but that aside, it is badly written and unsourced. I acknowledge a general dislike for the author, but that does not negate Wikipedia guidelines. DrOliver has had months to add sources, but he continually reverts. This last time, I copied and listed the sources from the article, on the talk page. You can see for yourself how valid these are. At least 3 admins have commented on the sources, but they all left. Meanwhile, Droliver continues to revert. Is there nothing that can be done? I have asked him to simply correct the sources, and add another source (A high school student would fail if he writes a paper stating that X is "known for" or made "significant contribution to" where the only source is a marketing catalog of a company with whom the subject had a contract).

<dd>I couldn't resist. The CA decision was "proper", based on the plain meaning of the statute. That said, it would not be the first time that Congress poorly drafted a bill. The ruling is also consistent with precedent. Logically, it makes no sense that a "reposter" of libel would be immune, but a primary publication would not be immune. The effect is the same. Regardless, until or unless the US Supreme Court hears the case, the ruling is both "right" and "proper."Jance 14:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant <b>morally</b> improper, as it immunizes a class of people making defamatory ocmments. I thought they had misinterpreted 230, as well, but "user" is sufficiently ambiguous to cover true publishers (as opposed to republishers, such as Ilena), making it a plausible interpretation that any defamatory comment <i>only</i> posted on the Internet is immune from prosecution for libel.

<dl>
<dd>Robert, what is 'appropriate' here is sometimes a moving target.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re the decision, SCOTUS has stated that the bar for proving defamation is high when it comes to a defendant that is a public figure, and when the statements are of public interest. Like all public figures, Barrett has "thrust himself in the limelight" so to speak. And, of course, opinion is not defamation. It would be very difficult to prove defamation here, even absent Section 230. In fact, the only statement that was arguably defamatory was the one against Polevnoy, and not Barrett. While I am not sure how I personally feel about outright immunity, I do not find the decision "morally" improper. Even this conservative Court is protective of the First Amendment. That does not mean I condone IR's inflammatory and outrageous statements. It does mean that under the circumstances, they are not actionable. Jance 01:31, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What is <b>morally</b> proper about a private person naming individuals as "quacks", and setting out to destroy them? That is exactly what Barrett is doing, by his own admission. I did not realize this until recently; I assumed he only criticized certain types (or all) "alternative medicine" which seems reasonable to me. <i>But who decides what individual should be targeted and held up to public ridicule?</i> Who determines what individual should have his license jeopardized and career destroyed? Is that the province of a single (and private) "quackbuster" and his employees? Barrett has annointed himself judge, jury and executioner. In all seriousness, the NCAHF (and by extension, Barrett) argued in court that he should not only be given the investigative powers of a district attorney, but he should be given more power than a DA, in court. Even a DA must prove his case. Barrett argued that he should only have to make an allegation, and force the defendant to prove his "innocence". Not even a DA has that much power. In medicine, the burden of proof is on the one making the medical claim. In court, the burden of proof is rightfully on the plaintiff/prosecutor - not the defendant. At least in the US, we do not have a feudal system (yet).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The more I think about this, the more alarming it seems. Yes, I think Hulda Clark is a quack, and should probably be in prison, instead of Tiijuana, fleecing cancer victims. So yes, I think it is a public service to expose someone like that. But what about one less "quackish" than she?? Where does Barrett draw the line? And why would we give him the power to make that decision? I don't care if he is a retired psychiatrist. I don't care if he is board certified in 17 specialties. He has not been appointed a judge or jury. This is what also so alarmed the <i>King Bio</i> court, when dismissing Barrett's charges of "false advertising" and "unfair business practices":</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>"The logical end-point of Plaintiff’s burden-shifting argument would be to permit anyone with the requisite filing fee to walk into any court in any state in the Union and file a lawsuit against any business, casting the burden on that defendant to prove that it was not violating the law. Such an approach, this Court finds, would itself be unfair."</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>What if Barrett et al make a mistake? How does he then go back and fix a person's livelihood and life? Whether or not Barrett has been sued is irrelevant. Not many of us would care to think of ourselves as "unscientific". Maybe Barrett is given a pass because he is a medical doctor and MDs still are put on pedestals. (I have no such illusions about MDs!) Barrett may especially appeal to those of us with a mathematical or scientific education. That is where, I think, we need to be careful. This is not a question of truth (or consistency). It is a question of fundamental fairness.Jance 02:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest you block both these users if you do anything. I found this when I saw LUCPOL's 3rr "report". Both users have violated 3RR on multiple articles in a rather large scale edit war.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Barrett again</span></h2>
<p>Shame about the amount of time being wasted on the articles related to this person. I am beginning to wonder if some users should be banned from editing Barrett related articles? Possibly a blanket statement from arbcom along the lines of anyone within one/two degrees of freedom to Barrett should recuse themselves from Barrett related pages. The bickering is clearly from a subjective perspective and wastes huge amounts of time. This is not unprecedented since a similar ban was handed out to three different users on the Jonathon Srafati article. In that case three different users were banned from editing the article (but not banned from wikipoedia).

If she would only collaborate with editors of opposing POV (as required here), used good sources, and made articles better, it would be an entirely different matter.

<dd>Shot, do you think this is constructive criticism? If Ilena said that, she would be jumped on for attacking. I do not think your making such comments is any better. It seems to me this article is polarized - Fyslee, you, Curtis, Ronz on one side and Ilena, L'clast, and Levine on the other. I don't see a whole lot of difference in the failure to negotiate or establish NPOV. If people get banned from this article, then I suspect it should be about 7 editors. I have watched Ilena comments and I don't condone them. I don't much like some of her edits. But then I am shocked to see the Barrett sympathizers be equally as aggressive in POV editing. I have yet seen any one of you try to negotiate. No wonder the article is as contentious as it is. And if you prefer I 'but out', I will be happy to do so. It is a waste of time. I also don't like to see a few ganged up on, and this is exactly what it is beginning to look like. I did not think so at first, but now I am beginning to see her frustration.

<dd>Not that I want to argue this out here on Arthurs Talk page (sorry Arthur) but now I share Ronz' and Fyslee's frustration, I never used to, until I began to see non-notable pieces of trivia develop a life of their own and I'clast presenting him/herself as the final arbitrator of discussion, on anything to do with Barrett. I am not a Barrett sympathiser, however I won't allow the POV and SOAPBOX sops to turn these particular articles into a long spew piece on whatever POV they are articulating. You will note, I don't stop the critism of Barrett (et.al) <i>within</i> reason and wiki <i>guildlines</i>. Wiki has excellent examples of how Barrett, NCAHF and QW should appear, and they don't which is testimate to the PUSHPOV expertise of what you call the "non Barrett sympathizers" (to use a name). Either we wikify or we pander to those who are wikivandels. If this makes me non-neutral in your eyes, so be it.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 12:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"final arbitrator", how flattering. I have entered each QW-related article very reluctantly, avoiding them for months, precisely because they were clearly such adverse, hagiographic timesinks. I hope that you are not attributing wikivandal to me. FYI, at one time I would have been counted as a Barrett supporter, perhaps before you were born. The degrees, decades, applied research and legal/political/corporate experiences have somewhat shifted my views on the scientific accuracy and probity of QW, etc. I still read QW bios, a good starting point for an in-depth view of any personality covered, including muck raking; I do consider the source &amp; pov very carefully. I can count on QW, etc. to explore any negatives and then some. I feel sorry for the average readers who have less knowledge &amp; experience trying to make timely sense out of the modern medical-pharmaceutical complex and its fellow travellers.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 23:53, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do not like the idea of disparaging wiki editors. Period. I see it all to often, whether I feel it is "justified" or not. A better approach is to criticize the edits. I haven't noted criticism from (Shot) of Barrett, but if I missed it, it won't b e the first time I have ever missed anything. A controversial subject should be identified as controversial. Reliable resources should be used as sources. I do not agree with some of the edits by "Barrett critics". I also do not think some of the "Barrett sympathizers" should delete properly sourced relevant information. That has occurred - I am thinking of Curtis, offhand. I will also note that Fyslee put that back. Jance 03:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We need help on NCAHF. Curtis is reproducing (badly, I might add) entire webpages. I have summarized and added proper formating. I have asked him what specific points that are important that are left out of summary. He is not willing to discuss this. He is belligerant, and an edit war has ensued. I need the help of some rational editors here. Heck, I even suggested we ask Dr. Barrett! Jance 20:12, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm involved, albeit as a generally pro-Barrett editor. I may not block. Has he violated 3RR in <i>re</i>-adding the information 4 times? If not, I'm afraid normal, slow channels, are the way to go. Sorry. Do you want to suggest that Ilena edit it down?! — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 20:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, more like a dozen times. I won't revert anymore. Go take a look at what he has added, just on one section. He had half a dozen or more sections this long, in this style of writing. I have to actually work today. Please take a look at the article -it would be 100 pages long with what Curtis has added. By the time you look at it, my guess is that he will have reverted the whole thing back. If you have any suggestions as to an admin that would help sort this out, it would be much appreciated.Jance 20:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Jance 20:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Now Curtis followed me to the "Breast Implant" article, and is in another edit war. He has reverted twice and I expect he will again. Even the most ardent fan of implants would not agree that there is "No" evidence of harm. This is ridiculous. This user needs to be banned.Jance 00:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, he has received two 3RR warnings.</dd>

<p>RE my comment about IR on the AN/I (too many TLAs). Yes, possibly a limited public figure. However, since the articles have stated the court's decisions unambiguously, Curtis' statement on its face demonstrates "actual knowledge of falsity" and "reckless disregard for the truth." Therefore, I believe that this would meet the standard for even a public figure. It is clearly libel. Of course, nothing is clearly anything until a court rules on it. Not that it matters now. The real issue is what is going on at NCAHF now. I have backed off and now Curtis is attacking Ronz. I would rather let Ronz or someone else file an An/I. I thought I had filed an An/I. Shows how much I know of the processes here! Jance 04:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I may just give this one up, and let someone else deal with Curtis. I have spent the entire day on it. I have no doubt that he will transfer his wrath to others, as he is already doing to Ronz.Jance 04:34, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
