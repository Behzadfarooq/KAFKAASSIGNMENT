<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article has not reliable sources is filled with POV and is basically pro homosexual. I suggest delete the thing or at least merge it with the main article. Most of it has no refs. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 14:17, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Topic has been written about by several authors, commented on extensively on TV, and written about in newsmagazines. It was made a separate article long ago because it was too long &amp; too focussed for inclusion in main article. Improve article rather than delete it. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 15:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps a better article would be Personal Life of Abraham Lincoln. This would also include his depression &amp; his family life - also topics about which much has appeared in print &amp; media. This article would be a place to begin from --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 21:38, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The point made above would be fine but those issues aren't disputed. His sexuality is, and as always when the issue of possible bisexuality or homosexuality arises with an historical figure, those objecting to it demand infinitely greater detailing and citations than heterosexual speculation. The scenario always goes like this: (a) someone inserts the claim (b) claim disputed and citation demanded (c) citation provided (d) single citation disputed as slim evidence and claim deleted (e) claim inserted with addition citations (f) detailed and referenced claim now disputed as imbalancing the article (g) article split off (h) split off article now claimed to be unnecessary. Rinse and repeat. In other words, it's impossible to placate bigots, because they only operate on a policy of absolute denial. The split off article is the best compromise to provide detailing of the possibility of Lincoln's bisexuality, given that even the mere suggestion of such will never be accepted, or indeed tolerated, by some, and further, because Lincoln's relationships were of a complexity that requires length to properly detail their context for both sides.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> None of that really matters. The topic of this article was not created by one Wikipedian and one Wikipedian isn't the only source for the claim that Lincoln may have been homosexual. The article has a number of citations that show a number of authors have made this claim. Whether the claim is true or false is somewhat immaterial to whether this article should be kept. There is clearly some debate on the issue amongst a number of notable scholarly sources and this is a topic that is noteworthy enough to stay. In any case, the article does not claim that Lincoln was in fact homosexual. The conclusion it seems to draw, insofar as it draws any conclusions, is that he might have been homosexual or bisexual, but probably was not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerDeathRobot_f4ad.html" title="User:KillerDeathRobot">KillerDeathRobot</a> 19:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see why an entire article on this subject is warranted. A paragraph under the primary Lincoln article would suffice. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R. Hercules</a> 06:30, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> when that was tried, one paragraph became 2 became 7. The topic is one discussed in several books &amp; articles &amp; is not easliy confined to one paragraph.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article has potential as an extensive topic. It is perhaps too extensive to be merged with <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s main article and requires independence due to its controversial nature. Though it is controversial, it <u>does</u> have a number of reputable sources and I feel this is a definite <b>keep</b> with room for improvement (as do all articles on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 05:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's been a great deal of speculation as to Abraham Lincoln's sexuality for a while, and whenever a large publisher releases a book that mentions it, it gets nation wide coverage. For me, that does establish the notability of the subject. I don't see the article as being POV. There's (at least in some of the sections) mention of the arguments as to why some of the "evidence" doesn't show him being gay. This is the sort of subject that I can see people looking up in Wikipedia the next time a book that mentions the subject comes out (no pun intended). --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 04:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article deals primarily with the debate over Lincoln's secuality. That debate is academically notable as the article makes abundently clear. Whether in fact Lincoln was actually gay, straight, or bi is almost completly besides the point. Claims that this should be deleted or merged because we can never conclusively prove anything in this debate also miss the point. If that was the standard of notability, then almost all articles on history, anthropology, archeology etc (at least the interesting ones) should be deleted. Indeed, almost any article involving competing claims and contravsial subjects would need to be deleted. Wikipedia does not require that issues be settled. Only that they be verifiable. The material in this article cites crediable secondary sources in a notable controversy. It also discusss criticisms and alternative interpretations. This is fair game for a stand alone Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 05:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per KillerdeathRobot and others above. The topic is a subject of scholarly debate (Just the same as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>) and whether or not it's true does not matter (Just like with ID--and who would argue that <i>they</i> have an agenda?) as long as the article is sourced per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The article is not perfect but it certainly not grounds for delete. As a side note, I do like the suggestion to rename to Personal life of Abraham Lincoln for the reasons mentioned by JimWae. Not only would that lessen the claims of an <i>agenda</i> behind it, it would open the article up to other relevant details of Abe's life. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:35, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Obvious Delete</b> What's next on Wikipedia, we write articles called, "Food preferences of Abraham Lincoln" and people vote to keep based on how well sourced it is? There's no reason or purpose to such stuff. It might be enjoyable to speculate whether or not Lincoln enjoyed cherry pie more than apple pie, but really, an encyclopedic article on such a preference? Hey, did he prefer white socks or black socks? Obvious POV fork and complete nonsense. Let's not let idle minds with lot's of free time for historical speculation ruin a perfectly good encyclopedia.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 11:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If several books and numerous scholarly articles and a number of symposia were available that dealt with "Food preferences of Abraham Lincoln", then yes we should have such an article. I personally happen to have a strong interst in food and culture. But those materials aren't there and so neither is the article. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> and others may feel this is trival. They are welcome to their POV. But there is sufficent debate, controversy, and documentation to warrent the inclusion of this article. Regarding, the title, I think it should remain as is. It accurate reflects the issue, without sensationalizing it. Would people really be happier with an 'Abe was gay' kind of thing? <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 15:59, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
