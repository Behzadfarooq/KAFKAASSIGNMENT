<li><b>Whoah, slow down</b> before we do a kneejerk 'it's a church -delete' ('ditto' etc.), let's do some thinking. Probably individual religious congregations are not <i>per se</i> notable (although since we keep even the smallest school, that's perhaps a little strange). However, the nominator here doesn't seem to have read the article: 'makes no claim to notability' - actually it does. 1) 'Megachurch' suggests <i>very</i> large - let's investigates that. (I've found one claim it's the 3rd largest AOG chuch in (Australia/the world) - but the source isn't good) . 2) Employs 50 staff - <i>if</i> that's verifiable then it <i>certainly would</i> be notable - given that most local churches employ 1-2, it would be larger than a small denomination. The nomination is frankly erronious.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 18:47, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I could be wrong. However, the article currently states that the church is "large" and gives a "see also" reference to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a> (as opposed to stating that this church <i>is</i> a megachurch), but doesn't indicate how large the congregation is. By contrast, the article on <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a> (an undisputed megachurch) says they have 17,000 to 20,000 people in attendance each week. However, having 50 people on staff would indeed be consistent with Garden City Christian Church being a very large church. I will reconsider the nomination if the article is improved during the AfD period. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are wrong. And since the article asserts (and did when you nominated it) that it has 50 staff and runs a college, you nomination seems to indicate you didn't read the article. If the assertions arn't verified then you should have marked if for verification, or tried to verify it yourself - no nominated it for 'no asserion of notability' when it has one.

<dd>The church I go to used to have a "College of Life" every spring: essentially, a series of evening Sunday-school classes taught by the pastor or by volunteers from the congregation. It had no academic credentials and issued no degrees. If this church operates a genuine institution of higher education, it probably is notable enough. The statement in the article didn't necessarily get there, though. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 11:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I'm not sure why we need articles on churches because they do churchy things like missions, teaching, etc. Obviously this is a very large and active church, but the article doesn't actually say much about it, and that's a problem.

<li>The comment is invalid anyway - we don't delete things because their claims have not been verif<b>ied</b> (although they have here) we delete things because, after much research, they are found unverifi<b>able.</b> At any rate, we've shown this place has an accredited college with 7 staff and an on-line catalogued library - that is extremely rare, if not unique amoungst churches. We've shown a good number of other staff, pastors, and 'department heads' (alhough the '50' claim may not be verifiable - and should probably be removed). I have to say, given that there is a string of keep votes for even the smallest little school, the tone of this debate, the extremely high thresholds being set, the disingenuous claim of 'no assertion of notability' (that missed the claims to a college and 50 staff), the demands that everything be verified now (without the voter trying themselves), leads me to suspect some element of bias is at play. I suspect that any other voluntary sector body claiming as many employees and activities wouldn't even have been debates. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 15:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I accused no single editor of anything. No doubt there are some voting for deletion that would vote for the deletion of any school or other organisation of a simmilar size - that's fine. What is not fine is applying standads here that are not applied elsewhere. The need for verification is not usually a deletion criterion - the inability to verify is. But, the existence of this as a megachurch with a lot of staff and a college was verified from the outset.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 15:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is what <i>you</i> say. I have seen no evidence that this is a megachurch, and I'm not even sure that the definition of a "megachurch" has been properly determined.

<dd>Personally, I've no use for the term megachurch, since it is too vauge. But we have verified that this church 1) had 2,000 attendenting in the 1980's 2) employs <i>at least</i> ten named individuals in its pastoral staff, some of whom are 'department heads' (unless their website is lying - which is hardly likely) 3) is strong enough to establish a college offering accredited degrees - employing six teaching staff and librarian who maintains a on-line catalogued theological library. Yup, I'd like us to get better sources and clearer information, we should work on that to improve the article. We should either remove or mark as unreferenced the stuff we can't verify. But why consider deleting it? It isn't a hoax, and we can at least be sure that it is an extraordinary church.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I know the church in question - it is nearby here in Brisbane. I can attest to its status as a "megachurch" (going by the definition on the wiki page here) and the church numbers haven't declined since the 1980's, so it's still up there. There are a few media articles around that I may be able to get a hold on to help the article regarding facts and things like that. <a href="../../../j/a/e/User%7EJaems_6eb2.html" title="User:Jaems">Jaems</a> 03:25, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Importance and megachurches and all that aside, where's the non-trivial third-party commentary on this church? The only thing that anyone has scrounged up is an off-hand one-sentence mention in someone's thesis. If we can't do better than that, then we should leave this link red until someone actually has some sourceable content. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't get this. Forget the thesis then. This church clearly exists - that's verifiable. Its website indicates a lot of staff - that <i>incredibly</i> unlikely to be lying.

<dd>There was a significant spread in Brisbane's Courier-Mail last year sometime with some interesting notes. If that was found and referenced, would it change anybody's vote? <a href="../../../j/a/e/User%7EJaems_6eb2.html" title="User:Jaems">Jaems</a> 09:53, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone who is interested and in Brisbane should head down to their library then and find some references. If the church is notable they shouldn't be too hard to find. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 12:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
