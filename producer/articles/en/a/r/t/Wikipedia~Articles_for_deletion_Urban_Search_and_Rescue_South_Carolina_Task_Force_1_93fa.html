<li>I can appreciate your observation, however, all of the FEMA task forces are sponsored by localities or universities (Texas) and South Carolina's task force is one of the first to be declared necessary by <b>state</b> law (SC Law, Chapter 49, Section 23-49-10). Also, as one of the founding members of the State Urban Search and Rescue Alliance, which is a grass-roots organization with over 40 member states and Puerto Rico, this increases notability (especially as the inception of this organization happened as a meeting between South Carolina and New Jersey Task Force leaders). I also added references to non-TF sites to prove notability since this was all first posted. I am quickly learning. But thanks for the input.--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> 23:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Didn't he just do that? Look at the references provided. The team was created by an act of the South Carolina State Legislature, and is a founding member of SUSAR. What more do you want?

<dd>That's significant, but he did more than that. He showed that the group actually exists, and that the group was deployed to a national emergency: <i>SC-TF1 was one of the first state urban search and rescue resources to be deployed into <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Tammany_Parish_21ca.html" title="St. Tammany Parish">St. Tammany Parish</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Bernard_Parish_6b05.html" title="St. Bernard Parish">St. Bernard Parish</a>, Louisiana, after <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in September, 2005.</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 01:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove

<dd>If what he's provided so far isn't enough (link to Title 23-49-10 and the WJWJ TV coverage of the deployment to Katrina), then I hope <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> can provide more. Otherwise, I guess we'll have to wait until SCTF-1 goes on more deployments or gets more press coverage.

<li><b>Delete</b> until such time as the non-FEMA SAR teams have greater notability. FEMA only underwrites a limited number of these as part of the national callup system, other municipalities that want one have to self-fund or operate on a contract basis (layman's interpretation &amp; terminology here), limiting non-local deployments and thus notability. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can appreciate that observation as well; because of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, any asset that meets the requirements of the requesting state can deploy to that emergency and therefore, this state team (which was formed by legal mandate) can cross state lines to answer that request. The FEMA system underwrites those 28 FEMA teams, but there are over 40 states that are now members of the State Urban Search and Rescue Alliance, some of which have teams that meet the proposed NIMS typing requirements for task forces, and some who don't. If anything, this team does not respond to "local" incidents, because of the tiered response system; first the incident is handled by the local jurisdiction, then regional teams are summoned, then state, then federal. There are cases when the incident escalates quickly (a la Katrina) when federalization early on might have been more beneficial, but regardless, emergencies are supposed to follow that chain of events. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> 23:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why would anyone want to delete a state USAR team? State sponsorship isn't enough? You have to be a federal team to be notable enough for the wikipedia? That's shocking to me. SCFT1 was deployed after Katrina and did a hell of a good job. I need to read the deletion policy and see what the problem is, but I think you should reconsider. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 22:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>
<li>Here's what it says in <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a>: Non-commercial organizations: 1. Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source. <i>SCTF-1 has been deployed on a national emergency (one of the worst in US history) and this is easily verifiable.</i> 2. Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability is established through reliable and verifiable sources. However, chapter information is welcome for inclusion into wikipedia in list articles as long as only verifiable information is included. <i>SCTF-1 is a state USAR team, and not a chapter of a different organization.</i> 3. Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found. <i>By definition, state is not local.</i> It seems to me that your decision to delete SCTF1 is arbitrary and against the clear text meaning found in <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a>. I don't see the rationale, except perhaps a poor understanding of what FEMA is and what national v. state responsibilities are. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 22:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<li>You're actually referring to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, not <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a>, which here, doesn't enter into the debate. CORP also states the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if:
<dl>
<dd>It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company, corporation, organization, or group, or of the product's or service's manufacturer or vendor, itself, and reliable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The stipulation per the non-commercial guideline therein still applies per said guideline. We still need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> proof of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> - and a piece of law doesn't prove that this particular USAR group is notable, it just proves that there is legislation calling for the implementation of the group. I'd also like to point out that <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">lawyering</a> isn't going to help prove notability, which is, per the nomination, what is at question. If you can prove notability, you will change my mind. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My mistake, although <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp%2C_my_article_got_nominated_for_deletion%21_315c.html" title="Wikipedia:Help, my article got nominated for deletion!">Wikipedia:Help, my article got nominated for deletion!</a> does specifically link to <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a> which specifically links to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. These guidelines are confusing to new editors, and it seems a bit disingenuous to suggest that I'm lawyering when I make a good faith effort to read up on the process. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 01:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</dd>

<li>Unfortunately, when I was writing this, I couldn't pull up some of these links and used the FEMA team templates thinking that those were sufficient enough to get those articles published. Thanks to all of you who have helped make this a good article. It's a learning experience, but even if the article doesn't get published, the links you all have been digging up are going to prove very useful. As it is, in a few weeks I will be speaking to the SUSAR group (all 40 states attending) and will talk to them about this and how to get involved.--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> 20:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
