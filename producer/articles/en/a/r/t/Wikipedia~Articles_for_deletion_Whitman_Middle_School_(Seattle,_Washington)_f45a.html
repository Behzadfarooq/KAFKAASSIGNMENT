<li>Sorry, I forgot that people of your intelligence level need everything spelled out for them. Most of these stubs are nothing more than a soapbox or a directory entry with a link, typically originated by people at the institution in question, a "non-topic" in that they are of absolutely no interest to anyone outside their immediate community, and the "such a minor branch" speaks for itself — thus because one school "does not stand out", it happily fulfils several deletion criteria. Did I also mention that they also fail the key pillar of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 19:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article says nothing of the school's history. It says nothing of community involvement, notable staff or students, or alumni.

<dd>Agreeing with the above, but for slightly different reasons. 'Policy' isn't a reason to keep, as policy is in the end what the community consensus decides it will be. But consensus has consistantly shown that schools will not be deleted. Whatever individuals may prefer (and, if really pushed, I'd probably vote delete) this is the position. We have a defacto policy - accept it. Game over. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:04, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It may appear to be nitpicking, but I'd point out that consensus does not decide policy. Many decisions are made on Wikipedia by consensus, and some policies can be changed by consensus, but some are not. <i>No personal attacks</i>, for instance, which does not enjoy consensus support, is nevertheless official policy and we cannot ignore it with impunity. NPOV has been explicitly described by Jimbo Wales as "non-negotiable". Moreover, where a dozen or so editors decide to do something, this doesn't constitute a consensus. There is at most a grudging acceptance of deletion nominations that do not give adequate policy backing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It should also be noted that a significent number of schools, including the vast majority below high school level, come up no consensus, not keep; the lower ones often with a simple majority for deletion. Although Schoolwatch, for some reason, makes no distinction between these, the difference is significent--repeating the same vote a thousand times on a thousand different articles still can't turn a no-consensus result into a consensus. Certainly, while there are some policies that cannot be challenged even by consensus, there is no policy that should be decided by a <i>minority</i>. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 17:06, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well put, but irrelevant. There is no consensus to delete schools - so the schools will stay - and 10,000 more will come. You can keep testing that fact, or lammenting that fact, but there it is. Eventually it will be accepted. I may not like it, you may not like it, but there it stands. Of course, people have a perfect right to bang their head off walls, and perhaps I've been wrong to try to dissuade them, but sooner or later they have to realise that the head hurts and the wall doesn't really care.

<dd>Saying that there is no consensus to keep schools is superficially true, but objectively false. There is a consensus that, excepting speedy deletions which are normally decided by one or at most two persons, we will keep all articles unless there's a consensus to delete them. Thus school articles that have been kept have been kept by consensus. We don't use AfD to decide whether there's a consensus to keep a particular article; such a consensus may form but it's of no significance. The article is still kept if the debate forms no consensus at all. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is not an AfD precedent. It just happens to be the case that since April 2005, there has been a concentrated effort to disrupt AfD, and put a category of articles beyond deletion. Moreover, it can't be a real precedent. If it were, it would be reversed pretty quickly, as any measure which effectively exempts a group of articles from the deletion process without any real reason to do so would make for a dangerous precedent. Articles such as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> are not exempt from deletion. Anyone may nominate it if they feel so inclined, they just might find the article kept with overwhelming, <i>real</i> consensus, as opposed to the junkies who think that the current state of affairs is anything like a consensus. I say junkies, because anyone who <i>seriously</i> believes that 51% is a mandate needs to tell me what they're taking so we can all get some. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 20:53, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Family Altar Christian School and several others would disagree with that statement. The fact is there is no preceedent that has been concretely set. And preceedent is not consensus which is what we need to ultimately achieve. I think revisiting <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> to make some progress like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> did would be the most constructive thing to do.

<li>I am of the opinion it quite frankly doesn't matter to most of those voting "keep" on these articles what the subject or the contents are. The equation is quite simple. School=keep. Such an equation is utterly immune to reason, and no modification to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> will change it. Until those who take such a tack can appreciate that school articles must meet the same criteria of notability and excellence as ALL OTHER ARTICLES do, any attempt to achieve a consensus is doomed. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:04, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no general criterion of either notability or excellence in our deletion policy. The idea that there are such general criteria is a fiction. Articles on schools are no different from other articles, and as a matter of practice the debates involving those articles are closed in precisely the same manner, by the same set of closers, as other AfD debates. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>While there may be no formal recognition of notability asan inclusion criterion, there certainly is a fe facto one. Your experience at AfD must surely have shown you that. Moreover, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> uses the word unabashedly in its descriptions of what is eligible for AfD and what is not. There will also soon be a poll opened to measure support for notability to be introduced as a formal criterion. I agree with you that school AfDs are closed in the same manner as all other articles and I don't have an issue with that. The big bone in my craw is how school articles are treated by those who vote. Articles appearing before AfD are, I have to assume (I may be wrong), <i>read</i> by people before votes are cast. In the case of school articles, however, it seems to me that a number of supporters simply vote "keep" because it's a school, and no matter how pathetic the article is, they are unwilling to cast a delete vote, or even refrain from voting. All I am asking is that if we must accept school articles (And I have come to that acceptance), let us at least assure that they are good articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
