<p>I am a Canbourne student, and studied for almost 10 years, have all my books and good grades, I just do not think It's fair to say that the University is a degree mill without having any proof of that. Also, the contents in this articles are very prejudice for everyone like myself that have studied at the University. —Dinandes de Souza Dinossauro 16:24, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like some proof that this is a real university.

<li><b><s>Week</s> keep</b> with the condition of a <b>rewrite</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has been periodically attacked by whitewashing or blanking vandals. This is an obvious diploma mill, and the reason the nominator wants to have it deleted is the fact that it is portrayed as such in the article, and that this article gets high Google ranking. It claims to be a British university, but appears to be operating illegally in the UK (possibly catering more to American and other foreign students), has no legal right to award academic degrees in the UK, and it has stolen a significant part of its website content from the website of a real (if obscure) British university.

<li>DELETION</li>
</ul>
<p>Well everybody is talking about the Canbourne University, once again, does anybody has any proof against the University&#160;? And again It's not politically correct to accuse without any proof, if the University was really a fraudulent university, why the UK or Us government did not closed down the University&#160;? It is really easy to go out and accuse all you may think that is not correct, but without any proof I can not really proof anything, Do I&#160;? I could go and put up an website, perhaps saying that the Wikipedia is a fraudulent site, based on the following: Wikipedia can be altered by any individual. I have registered with Florida state and got approved for my CPA, now If was fraudulent, the Florida state should not refused me? For me that is ridiculous.

They even told me that I could register their diplomas with any UK Consulate in order to be legal outside the UK.
