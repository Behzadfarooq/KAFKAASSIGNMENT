<li>Roberta Wenocur, along with Elaine Zanutto and a handful of others, is one of the very few women in mathematics/science/statistics. She has verifiable achievements -- just check the references. We female mathematicians are underpaid, unsung, and mistreated; our research is stolen by men.. Now a bio of one of us is to be deleted?

<li><b>Comment</b>- If this is a "vanity article", so are some about men in mathematics, too. How abour R.M. Dudley, Mark Pinsky, Don Knuth -- all great mathematicians, and the articles deserve to be there. If this is a "vanity article", why not wipe out all articles about the men, too? And the few women, too? I wanted to add bios on other female (and male) mathematicians, but are they all "vanity" articles. I already voted "keep", so this is just a comment. I will quit Wikipedia forever and there will be no more bios on any mathematician, scientist, or statistician from me again...you are not well-informed about mathematics, science, and statistics, or else you are a bunch of bullies who want to control Wikipedia. So, I was planning to write a bio on Paul Halpern (physicist and author), James Pierce (bioinformaticist), Linda Zhao (statistician), and others, but you would call them "vanity articles". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathStatWoman_4206.html" title="User:MathStatWoman">MathStatWoman</a> 18:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Someone could take a shot at it while the AfD is still open and that could influence the outcome of the AfD - that's certainly happened with other articles that initially looked like deletes.

<li><b>Please stay on topic</b>. Whether or not women are under-represented in math does not matter for our purposes. Just having a job (even if that job is "mathematician") is nowhere near enough to warrant an article. However, clearly some academics are of encyclopedic significance. I don't see enough here to decide either way, yet- the article needs serious improvement. I wish we'd given it time to improve without the pressure of Afd, but that ship has sailed. <s>My opinion is <b>keep</b> for now to give the article time to develop- if later we're still not satisfied of the verifiable significance of this person, we could delete it then. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:53, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</s> Upon further thought, we need demonstrable notability now in order to keep the article now.

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> This is a violation of Wikipedia policy (e.g., <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>) as it is nothing other than a personal page. Does anybody search for this person? Does anybody search Google for this person? Who would want to know what her dissertation is? Has she significantly contributed to the field? There's nothing wrong with having articles on women, but that fact is irrelevant. The question is whether this article provides good information about an encyclopedic topic.

<ul>
<li>No offence, but this seems to be a combination of mis-reading and unsupported assertion. She is <i>not</i> currently in-charge of a notable organization. The article seems to indicate that at one time (by implication over a decade ago) she was "second in command" to the Executive Director of <a href="../../../s/i/a/SIAM_8c87.html" title="SIAM">SIAM</a>. This role is not defined; certainly "assistant to the Executive Director" would be notable (see my notes on the Talk page. There is no evidence that any of the "Awards" are particularly notable, or that any of her publications are "significant and well-known", etc., etc. Speaking as someone who hit the wall with college calculus, I applaud her as a successful mathematician, academic, and contributor to human knowledge, but that does not require an encyclopedic article. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I searched on ISI Web of Knowledge (author finder, RS Wenocur); this showed just 3 papers, only one of which was cited more than once - her paper in DISCRETE MATHEMATICS 33 (3): 313-318 1981 is given as having 45 citations which is a very strong showing for this field. However, I don't see a strong case for notability as a mathematician. No doubt she's a good mathematician, but I really think we have to be very parsimonious with biographies of living people. Yes there are relatively few female mathematicians, and in a few years there might be rather few male biologists; an article on gender and mathematics might be interesting, and maybe that's the way to address this as an issue <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 14:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
