<p>Originally prodded by Snacky with the reason "This article is almost entirely composed of unverifiable original research, and it appears to be primarily a vehicle for spamming Michael E. Thomas's webpage." Prod removed by author, nominated for AfD by Snacky.

<p>The technology isn't apparent and there are references to the technology at the bottom of the page. I suggest Snacky study the technology. This nanotechnology is cutting edge and not easily understood by the layman.user:holoman 3 July 2006</p>

<p>2nd request - Please delete my technology from your website. I again read a rewrite that is inaccurate. I do not want my technology misused and misunderstood by the imcompetent scientist rewriting something they have ZERO understanding as it shows in their writings.holoman</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, to holoman.

Anyone is now entitled to make any (legal) use of it they like, and you are no longer in a position to assert copyright or other intellectual property rights over it. I should also point out that threatening legal action is grounds for your indefinite suspension from Wikipedia, per <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a>.

<li>No copyright or other rights have been granted in writing or released. You need to study US copyright and patents laws. This is exactly my point. This website continually provides misinformation and inaccuracy to the public. Your not serving the scientific or public with the dissemination of wrongful information, facts, and theories. And the wikipedia staff of writers definitely have no integrity or honor.holoman</li>

Terms like "popular inversion" (where <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_inversion.html" title="Population inversion">population inversion</a> was meant) in Holoman's draft do not inspire confidence in his accusations or his claim to be the person who developed any part of this technology, but I was careful to flag my rewrite for verification and expert review in case there were parts I'd misinterpreted regardless. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:21, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Update: My most recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Photon_induced_electric_field_poling&amp;oldid=62133259" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Photon_induced_electric_field_poling&amp;oldid=62133259" rel="nofollow">rewrite</a> was checked against the references and should be accurate. I work in an optics lab; as far as I can tell from the reference content, I have sufficient expertise to confirm my rewrite's accuracy. Several of User:Holoman's statements, especially in his original version, were just plain incorrect. His rewritten version of my first rewrite was better, but not much. Detailed discussion is at <a href="../../../p/h/o/Talk%7EPhoton_induced_electric_field_poling_6b52.html" title="Talk:Photon induced electric field poling">Talk:Photon induced electric field poling</a>. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:55, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oooh. I just read the above. FWIW, I support Christopher Thomas'es re-write. The original posted by User:Holoman was gibberish, and used incorrect terminology juxtaposed in non-sensical ways. The article, as it currently stands, appears to make sense and to be a coherent description of a process that might possiblly work.<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:57, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd certainly hope it works, given that it's been published about&#160;:). This actually turns out to be a phenomenon I'd been meaning to track down for a while (read a popular press article about some form of electro-optic effect being used to "freeze" holographic fringe patterns into a storage medium for later interrogation, but had long-since forgotten the details when I needed to look it up again). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 02:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; its not gibberish and seems to make physical sense, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. First sentence needs work, as it seems to start describing a solar panel. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:06, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
