<p>I am the author of that article and I don't know what the problem is. You don't like that I've introduced the site and what its trying to do? Would you like 3 paragaphs of garbage explanation? I am only quoting my source of those slogans by providing the link to the page I got them from.</p>
<p>As for the copyright of the slogans I was with the understanding that by sharing that I was allowed to share them here provided I credited the author?</p>
<p>If you dont like the article I would welcome any suggestions on how to improve it. But I do wonder if I'll actually get any.</p>
<p>EDIT: I have looked at a few other articles and I think I see what you guys want it to be more like. I will rewrite it this evening. BUT DONT YOU DARE DELETE IT! Xanthor 22:20, 8 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>

<p>A special thank you to --Bachrach44 for sharing with me the guidelines found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">[WP:WEB</a>]</p>
<p>Given these guidelines it would seem that any webpage that has not already achieved fame would not meet the criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p>My only problem with this, and I understand its about keeping the Wiki up to quality standards, is that in fact the mylovingmemory.com website is the first to allow the general public to upload photos to create a digital collage. Although it does share a similarity to the milliondollarhomepage in the way it offers pixels for photos - the two sites are nothing alike. The milliondollarhomepage does not offer any content, only links. The Mylovingmemory website is the first to approach digital art collages in this manner and in fact their efforts are a historic moment and should be recognized.</p>
<p>Addditionally, the guidelines do not speak to uniqueness of content or public interactivity. Most "collage art" is done by a single artist on a static canvas. This site is creating digital collages by allowing public interaction on a changing canvas.</p>
<p>In short, I did not come here to post about "yet another nuke site" and attempt to include something as common as that. This website is unique. It is the only one I know of that does it and it is doing it as a project in philanthrophy. Exceptions should be made. Xanthor 00:41, 9 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>

<dd>Comment. I have reviewed the new page. The basis for my delete is unchanged. The issue is not the text. The Web site is not notable, and Wikipedia is not for promoting new things.

<p><b>KEEP</b> it is not advertising. I sell advertising for a living - thats not it. Obina said its not the text .. so to point to advertising and then refer to what Obina said makes no sense. You are all very discouraging and I will spend no more time about this except to send an email to this websites founder.</p>
<p>The internets version of a time capsule wants accepted by the internets version of an encylopeida. Its that simple. Xanthor 20:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not "The internets version of a time capsule". It's <i>your</i> version of a time capsule. It would have to be pretty noteworthy indeed to be the internet's version of anything. May sites over the years have offered people a place to put images, reflections, confessions...all kinds of things. I think you overestimate the uniqueness and the novelty of your project, but even if you are right, it has to make some kind of impact before it is notable enough to be treated here. Your site hasn't even <i>launched</i> yet. There are thousands and thousands of projects out there that are just getting started and looking for recognition. Wikipedia is not here to help you promote your project. People have tried to explain this to you and point you toward Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion of websites, but for some reason you don't want to listen. This isn't personal--several people have gone out of their way to wish you and your project well--but the fact is, you're trying to use this place as something it's not. There are all kinds of ways to promote a new site; Wikipedia is something else. Best of luck with your project; may it prosper and evolve into something worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 23:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Rodii for taking the time to do more than vote. I do understand what people are saying and I freely admit that I dont like it&#160;:-) On that note I do want to say that _I HAVE_ noticed all the well wishes that I have recieved and I thank you all very much for them. I don't want to appear ungrateful. They were noticed.. and even encouraging!&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I do want to say that I have scoured the net to purposly try and find someone who is taking photos from real lives and making collages and neo-impressionistic art out of them ... and they're just arent any sites that I have found. Yes there are memorial sites and yes there are many many photo galleries... but they arent "creating" any new works from the photos that are shared. This is the uniqueness that I think I have with the site. I would love for anyone to show me a site that is already doing something similar... but only because I have spent a good amount of time trying to find one myself. It's a true internet first... and .... as time progresses it is getting harder and harder to be able to make that claim.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all my well wishers. Truth be told I realized yesterday after reading the guidelines that I probably wouldent change your policy and I accepted it then... but I had to try. I too wish everyone well even though I did not get the reception I had hoped for. Xanthor 23:42, 9 January 2006 (UTC)Xanthor</p>
