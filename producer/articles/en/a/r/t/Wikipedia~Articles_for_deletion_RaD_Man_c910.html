	    <p><b>RaD Man</b> was proposed for deletion. This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion. This page is no longer live. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.</p>
<p>13 votes delete, 9 to keep, 1 to merge/redirect. 1 vote, by <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrushnd_b261.html" title="User:Guybrushnd">User:Guybrushnd</a>, was disregarded as likely sock puppet, due to limited and questionable edit history—I have concluded that all other alleged sock puppets are ostensibly valid votes.</p>
<p>This tally amounts to 14 votes to 9 against having <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man">RaD Man</a> as an independent article, nearly a 2/3 consensus, but only 13 to 10 for deleting the content entirely. I believe this logically calls for merging and redirection, but only one vote suggested where. Another solution may be to continue the listing, so that the decision of where to merge may be discussed, and additional votes may be added. As I was one of the voters in such a close VfD, I will decline to personally enact a resolution. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:46, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I confirm <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a>'s tally of votes. In addition, I must admit that <a href="../../../e/t/o/User%7EEto_4e34.html" title="User:Eto">User:Eto</a>'s contribution history is suspicious having come into existence the same day as this discussion was initiated. (The time-stamps are ambiguous, perhaps as a result of timezones.) In addition, his edits (at least as a logged in user) stopped two days later with a high proportion of edits to VfD discussions.</dd>

<dd>However, even if <a href="../../../e/t/o/User%7EEto_4e34.html" title="User:Eto">User:Eto</a>'s vote is discounted, the final tally fails to reach the necessary consensus for deletion. By default, the article is kept.</dd>

<li>Delete: Let's say he's the #1 figure in an underground movement. Ok. It's an <i>underground</i> movement. I.e. it is a movement where people don't use their real names, where the people don't document their work.

<li>Reply to Comment: What do you mean by encyclopaedic? If you mean capable of being described in an encylopaedic fashion - which is what I take it to mean - then he will be as encyclopaedic in 5 years time or in 1000 years time as he is now. If you mean notable enough to be in an encyclopaedia then I've got to disagree with you. We really don't know who will be notable in 5 years time. Wikipedia has plenty of people who may be less notable in 5 years time than they are now. But that's fine because Wikipedia is a database - nice and easy to edit - let's take a risk and include him now and if in 5 years time his notability has waned then he can be deleted in a trice.--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomheaton_3b83.html" title="User:Tomheaton">Tomheaton</a> 20:46, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>I mean notable enough to be in an encyclopedia. You're right that it's difficult to tell what subjects from the present will be notable in the future, but that doesn't excuse us from the responsibility to write articles only on things that will be. Better to wait a few years until we're sure that a subject deserves an article than to rush into writing an article on a subject that turns out to be nonnotable. We're <i>building</i> an encyclopedia here, not maintaining a list of the latest fads. Just because an internet-based encyclopedia <i>can</i> have nonce information inserted and removed rapidly doesn't mean that it <i>should</i>, nor indeed that it <i>will</i>, in practice. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka"></a>—<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka">Triskaideka</a> 21:03, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, albeit with reluctance arising from my distaste for being on the same side as some of the completely inappropriate comments offered above. I don't agree with the idea of waiting a few years to see if this subject area becomes notable. I'm fine with documenting ephemera for historical purposes. It would be nice to have ready online access to, say, fads of the 1920s. My first inclination was to agree with <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> about merge &amp; redirect, but it seems that RaD Man (whom I'd never heard of until I saw this listing) has some activities outside ACiD that are worth noting.
