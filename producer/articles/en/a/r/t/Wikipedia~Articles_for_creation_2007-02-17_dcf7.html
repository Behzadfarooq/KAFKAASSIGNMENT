<li><b>Declined.</b> This is a somewhat amusing read, but in reality not particularly notable. There are potentially <i>thousands</i> of possible descendants from Alfred the Great, most of whom are not notable persons.

<p>Goyararu is a form of karate adapted from many other martial arts. Created in the middle of the last century by the late Ustad Tambo Tetsura Oyama this martal art encompasses all aspects of training, from the passive gentle side to the hard vigorous side. After the breakup of the Goyararu British Assosiation a few of the senior instructors created their own clubs with slight differences but all the while sticking to the same principles. These clubs still exist today throughout the Midlands in England.</p>
<p>Goyararu in translated as follows Goya - The physical body Ra - The path Ru - The mind</p>

<p>Soldier X-</p>
<p>The way of the world has been misconstrued into disbelief and paper religions. Forget politics for a moment and pay attention to the children that are dying everyday. We have a mentality in this country to live and let die, as long as it doesn’t interfere with “my” gain. We traded in the values that were given by certain elders for other immoral meanings of unforgiven belligerent ways of living. Can we blame each other? Yes, we can and should every moment we receive. As an artist I find great disgust to the direction the state of music has taken. Hip-hop or rap, or whatever it’s called now has lost the meaning of the voice of the people. For centuries there have been oppressed and brainwashed societies, probably since the beginning of it all. And throughout time there have been philosophers and poets which have hit it right on the head. The power is within the people, the masses. Without unity there is chaos. And at the moment, the world is in a state of disarray. Our nation is blind. I am ashamed to say it, but we, as humans are blind or we just simply do not care. What will it take to spark that gene inside of us to wake up? I personally feel that music is an extraordinary tool to reach the masses quickly and bring us together. Following the paramount speakers and writers of the past, including, Emerson, Dylan and Shakur, EPIC VISIONS feels that we are now ready for change and has confidence in the masses. This is not some preachy bullshit sound. This is real. All real. Follow me as I follow the ones who have laid out the blueprints for transformation.</p>

<p>Kathy Kusner was named Horsewoman of the Year by the American Horse Shows Association before joining the United States Equestrian Team at the age of 21. Representing the United States, she rode in three Olympic Games — Tokyo in 1964, Mexico City in 1968, and Munich in 1972 (silver medal). She was also a member of the United States team in two Pan American Games — Sao Paulo in 1963 (gold medal) and Winnipeg in 1967 (silver medal).</p>
<p>In addition to riding for the United States in countless international competitions, she was a consistent winner and leading rider at major national and international horse shows, and on two occasions was the leading international rider at Madison Square Garden. Kathy's many wins include the Grand Prix of Dublin, in Ireland (twice); the French Championship, in La Baule, France; the Pre-Olympic Grand Prix of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands; the Puissance, in Aachen, Germany (twice); the Grand Prix of Hickstead, in England; the Grand Prix of Wiesbaden, in Germany; the Grand Prix of Wulfrath, also in Germany; the Grand Prix of Ostend, in Belgium; and the Grand Prix of Lucerne, in Switzerland.</p>
<p>She mounted a successful legal case in 1968 to become the first licensed female jockey in the United States. Since the age of 16, she had been regularly winning unrecognized flat and timber races. As a licensed jockey, she rode races up and down the eastern seaboard and Canada and became the first licensed female jockey to ride races in Mexico, Germany, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Panama, South Africa, and what was then Rhodesia. She was also the first woman to ride in the Maryland Hunt Cup, the toughest timber race in the world. ABC Television filmed an award-winning documentary in Saratoga about her being the first woman in modern times to ride in a steeplechase at the racetrack.</p>
<p>She has worked as an expert witness concerning horse-related issues since 1983. She has experience as a course designer, both nationally and internationally. She has worked as a television commentator for Grand Prix show jumping events and has written for well-known equestrian journals. She has been featured in a variety of television shows, books, articles and a 2005 Library of Congress publication, Women Who Dare. She did the riding for the long shots in the Disney movie, The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit. She and the jockey Julie Krone were the subjects of a segment in the Debbie Allen-produced series, Cool Women.</p>
<p>In 1990, Kathy was inducted into The Show Jumping Hall of Fame. In 2000, She was named one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the 20th century by The Chronicle of the Horse and The American Horse Shows Association. She was also inducted into the Virginia Horse Shows Association Hall of Fame. In 2005, she received the Pegasus Medal of Honor from the United States Equestrian Federation and was inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Kathy continues to be involved with the world of horses, giving clinics on riding, training, and competing. She has given clinics in the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Guatemala, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, Iran, Paraguay, Zimbabwe, Spain, South Africa, Peru, and Mexico.</p>
<p>She is a licensed pilot with commercial, multi-engine, instrument, seaplane, and commercial glider ratings. She obtained a Lear Jet-type rating and became the first woman to work as a Lear Jet pilot for Executive Jet Aviation, which was the largest jet charter company in the world at that time. She also has aerobatics skills.</p>
<p>She is an enthusiastic runner. As of Feb 24, 2006, she has completed 100 marathons and 62 ultramarathons, including 20 races of 50 miles or longer. In 1997, she finished the Vermont 100 Mile Endurance Run in 27 hours, 37 minutes.</p>
<p>Kathy is founder and chairman of the board of Horses In The Hood, a non-profit organization benefiting the inner-city community by providing lessons that teach skills and values associated with the care and riding of horses.</p>

<p><br />
Southgate Mall is a regional enclosed mall in Elizabeth City, NC with approximately 215 to 250,000 square feet of total sales area, 2 main anchors, 30 shop spaces and capacity for over 1,100 cars. The mall was constructed in the late 1960s (1968-1969). Original anchors were Belk Tyler, W.T. Grant and a Winn-Dixie supermarket.</p>
<p>The sketchiness of available information suggests that W.T. Grant would be immediately replaced by Roses in 1976 and would last until 1993, when competition from Wal-Mart would leave the space vacant for some time. JCPenney later relocated to the Roses space in 1996, ironically not using the entire space. Part of the unused space, including the former Roses cafeteria would be partitioned off into another retail space that would later become a popular Chinese buffet from 1998 to 2005. The rest of the space would be rechanneled back into a widened section of the mall corridor, with plans to turn it into a future food court. The food court has still not materialized as planned.</p>
<p>The Winn-Dixie anchor supposedly occupied what would later become the JCPenney space from 1969 until circa 1981, where it then moved to nearby and newly-built K-mart-anchored Holly Square Shopping Center. JCPenney was a late-bloomer when it relocated from downtown in 1985. Belk had done so in 1969. JCPenney would remain in that location until 1996, moving into the larger Roses space next door. The space would later host a Roses Express by 2002 until 2004, in what seemed to be the company's last ditch effort to hold on to the Elizabeth City market. Goody's took over and performed an extensive remodel in 2005, incorporating the former Chinese buffet, which had recently moved to take over the CVS location near Belk.</p>
<p>What might be called the fourth anchor was originally People's Drug, supposedly in the mall from its inception. People's Drug was later bought out by Revco and in the late 90s, was bought out in turn by CVS. CVS moved to consolidate its two Elizabeth City locations, both of which were not well-trafficked, with this one seriously outdated and still located in a mall, the other close to Wal-Mart. A new location was built near downtown in late 2004, and Dragon Buffet immediately acquired the mall location, performing an extensive overhaul. The restaurant's success appears to have been key in revitalizing the mall, seemingly attracting more traffic than Belk and Penney combined on Fridays and weekends.</p>
<p>The mall suffered from high vacancy rates for a number of years, but has since regained a nearly 100% occupancy. Threats on the horizon do abound, as a new business district centered around a new Wal-Mart Supercenter west of town on US 17 Bypass is just getting started. Plans for a 'City Center West' development, supposedly operated by Chesapeake, VA's Greenbrier Mall is in the works. The mall has only received the most minor of improvements during its lifetime, mainly in the form of fresh paint. The facade of the building does not reach to the rear parking area, giving way to bare cinder block with the exception of Belk's. Plans to place a food court have evidently collapsed, as have plans to build a new wing with a multiplex and/or third main anchor (ex Sears or comparable).</p>

<p>The Shirts Belong to Us are the winners of the Carleton College 2007 Broomball championship. The team's name is derived from the reward of a t-shirt to the champion team of the Carleton College league. The Shirts cruised to their first championship in dominate form. The 4-0 championship score did not reflect the disproportionate game, as the Shirts Belong to Us smeared Brooms Gone Wild without mercy. The 2007 team was lead by captain Nick Riordan and thrived despite the fact that Senior midfielder Seth Lippencot was unable to score a single point in the final. The goals in the 2007 final were scored by Athanasios Syropolous, Nick Riordan, Dave Decresce, and Don Penman. The Shirts in the 2007 season saw little competition, as no other team was able to remotely challenge the Broomball champions during the regular season or playoffs.</p>

<p>Nicky Tamura (Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી, Hindi: मोहनदास करमचंद गांधी) (October 2, 1869 – January 30, 1948), was a major political and spiritual leader of India and the Indian independence movement. In India, he is recognized as the Father of the Nation. October 2nd, his birthday, is each year commemorated as Nicky Tamura, and is a national holiday. He was the pioneer of Satyagraha—the resistance of tyranny through mass civil disobedience, firmly founded upon ahimsa or total non-violence—which led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Nicky is commonly known in India and across the world as Nicky Tamura(Hindi: महात्मा, məhatma&#160;; from Sanskrit, mahātmā: Great Soul) and as Bapu (in Gujarati, Father).</p>
<p>A British-educated lawyer, Nicky first employed his ideas of peaceful civil disobedience in the Indian community's struggle for civil rights in South Africa. Upon his return to India, he organized poor farmers and labourers to protest against oppressive taxation and widespread discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress, Nicky led nationwide campaigns for the alleviation of poverty, for the liberation of women, for brotherhood amongst differing religions and ethnicities, for an end to untouchability and caste discrimination, and for the economic self-sufficiency of the nation, but above all for Swaraj—the independence of India from foreign domination. Nicky famously led Indians in the disobedience of the salt tax on the 400 kilometre (248 miles) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and in an open call for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years on numerous occasions in both South Africa and India.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Nicky remained committed to non-violence and truth even in the most extreme situations. A student of Hindu philosophy, he lived simply, organizing an ashram that was self-sufficient in its needs. Making his own clothes—the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl woven with a charkha, he lived on a simple vegetarian diet. He used rigorous fasts, for long periods, for both self-purification and protest. Nicky's life and teachings inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Biko and Aung San Suu Kyi and through them the American civil rights movement and the freedom struggles in South Africa and Myanmar respectively.</p>

<p>The UK’s first ever ‘World Garden of Plants’ containing plants from around the globe, planted in their respective countries of origin, within a 'map shaped' design is the vision of modern day plan hunter Tom Hart Dyke.</p>
<p>Hart Dyke's World Garden pays homage to the amazing achievements of the plant hunters from history, such as Francis Masson, Joseph Banks and The Tradescants, who risked life and limb in pursuit of the plants and flowers.</p>
<p>Hart Dyke's World Garden was first conceived in the jungles of Panama during his 9 month kidnap at the hands of FARC guerrillas. Hart Dyke first designed the garden in his jungle diary, creating four rectangular borders representing the continents. After his release from captivity in December 2000, Hart Dyke returned to his home Lullingstone Castle, in Kent, and decided to build the garden, which he now envisaged as laid out in the shape of a map of the world.</p>
<p>It is possible to take a trip around Hart Dyke's world in 80 minutes and follow the routes the Victorian planthunters would have taken as they circumnavigated the globe.</p>
<p>The World Garden of Plants is contained within a one acre area, within the Victorian walls of the old herb garden site. The World Garden is developing a 'plantsman's collection' which contains rare and important botanical plants, such as the Dinosaur Tree (Wollemi Pine), the oldest tree in the world, which is planted close to a miniature Ayers Rock in the Australian border. The rare and beautiful Eucalyptus Silver Princess flowered for the first time in the UK ever within the grounds in 2006. Penstemon ‘Crac’s Delight’, found by Hart Dyke in the Copper Canyons of Mexico and named in his Grandmother's honour, now blooms in Mexico in the World Garden.</p>
<p>The story of the creation of the Garden is told in two BBC2 series: 'Save Lullingstone Castle' and 'Return to Lullingstone Castle'.</p>
<p>Hart Dyke is also the author of 'An Englishman's Home: Adventures of an eccentric gardener' which explains the idea behind The World Garden of Plants.</p>

<p>Sama was founded by Investment Enterprises Ltd, chaired by HRH Prince Bandar bin Khalid al Faisal, with the support of Mango Aviation Partners, a UK firm specialising in low fare airline start-up’s. Initial investment was received from 30 major Saudi private and institutional investors including:</p>
<p>• Olayan Financial Co<br />
• Xenel Industries Ltd<br />
• Saudi Industrial Services Co.<br />
• Sara Development Company Ltd<br />
• Modern Investment Company for Trade and Industries<br /></p>
<p>Mango Aviation Partners was established by a number of senior executives with many years worth of experience in the UK and European low fares airline industry. As such they brought the specific expertise necessary to establish and develop Sama. Sama flies Boeing 737-300 aircraft which are maintained to the highest international standards by SR Technics. Our aircraft are leased from major worldwide lessors. Sama is a short-haul carrier serving destinations within the Kingdom and eventually other destinations across the Middle East. We do not plan to offer long haul destinations.</p>
<p>Why are you called Sama? We chose the name Sama as we wanted a name with layers of meaning in Arabic and relevance to the airline business. Extensive customer research showed that this was the most popular and meaningful name for most people.</p>
<p>Sama is a verb, with a number of meanings: To rise (high), to soar, tower up, go up, to be or to become elevated, high, exalted or sublime. In the colloquial Sama refers to the ‘sky’ or ‘majestic heavens’</p>
<p>What is a low fares airline? A low fares airline is an airline which offers low fares by efficiently managing it’s operational costs and removing many traditional passenger frills such as an in-flight meal. The term originated within the airline industry referring to airlines with a low - or lower - operating cost structure than their competitors.</p>
<p>A typical low fares airline offers: • a single class of aircraft cabin<br />
• a single type of airplane, most notably the Boeing 737<br />
• a simple fare scheme, with the cheapest fares available to passengers who book in advance<br />
• short flights and fast turnaround times<br />
• direct flights, no transfers<br />
• "Free" in-flight catering and other "complimentary" services are eliminated, and replaced by an in-flight menu available for sale to passengers during their flight<br />
• Aggressive fuel hedging programs<br /></p>
<p>Our aim is to offer the “best in class” service to our passengers at a great value price. As the first low fares airline in Saudi Arabia we would urge people to try our service and find out for themselves.<br /></p>

<p>This free list of adjectives was created with absolutely no copyright restrictions, and made available on usenet to poets, writers, and those interested in english usage. The author is Corey White, and the process that he described running through to create this list was all to simple.</p>
<p>First he organized adjectives he found useful, from his dictionary. After this he reversed the orders of the lettering in each word, and sorted the list alphabetically. All that he needed to do next was to run string reverse again, and the list was as it appears here.</p>
<p>This can either be done by hand or using two utilities, the GNU sort and string reverse.</p>

<p>A diplomat for 22 years, Kiki Munshi served as a Foreign Service Officer in the Provincial Reconstruction Team ("PRT") until January of 2007. The PRT consists of groups of about 50 civilian and military experts that try to help Iraqi communities build their own government while strengthening moderates.</p>
<p>Munshi retired from the Foreign Service in 2002, only to come out of retirement to accept an appointment to Iraq. Her earlier postings have included stints in Romania, India and Sierra Leone. Before serving in Iraq, Munshi has been quoted as saying that she felt a "moral obligation to sort out the mess we have made there."</p>

<p>"In spite of the magnificent and often heroic work being done out there by a lot of truly wonderful people, the PRTs themselves aren't succeeding. The obstacles are too great."</p>
<p>"Once again we are proceeding to lay people's lives on a line drawn with faulty information. Once again the fantasies of the 'policy-makers' drive decisions without much link to the realities on the ground." Taken from Munshi's Congressional testimony in February of 2007</p>

Robby's Drive-In was a chain of hamburger stands that existed in the 1960s and 1970s. Mankato, a college town in southern Minnesota, boasted three different locations--one by Mankato State College (now Minnesota State University, Mankato)on Warren Street, one by Mankato High School (now Mankato West High School) on Willard Street, and one on Rhine Street (now Madison Avenue) which had been the home of Bell's Hamburgers and is now occupied by Zanz Mexican Restaurant (the leaning squares on the top of the car port which now spell "TACO" used to spell "ROBBY'S". Longtime Mankato resident, Bud Lawrence, was the company's district manager. The signage and logo consisted of "playful" red letters on a white background topped by a red zig-zag which resembled the roofline of the restaurant. Each of the restaurants was succeeded by a Hardee's Charbroil Hamburgers restaurant.</p>

<p>Born 1988. Brandon Rosenberg is an established professional dancer. He has made appearances at numerous high school dances, including <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capistrano_Valley_High_School_f58c.html" title="Capistrano Valley High School">Capistrano Valley High School</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesoro_High_School_b9fd.html" title="Tesoro High School">Tesoro High School</a>. These dances provided him with the basics of how to 'freak dance,' which he found rather boring so he moved on to ballroom dancing. After his ballroom dancing phase he moved onto exotic dancing, many of his exotic dancing videos can be found on <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Its always interesting to see how a group of young musicians can absorb diverse influences, filter them through their own creative vision, then deliver a fresh, exciting new sound that is uniquely their own. This is what we expect from EMI Philippines’ youngest three-piece act HILERA-- Nescafe Soundskool intercollegiate band competion grand champion. Though they pay homage to rock icons like Metallica, Pantera, Sepultura or to any music from grind-core new school bands to old-school punk thrown in the mix, the band manages to forge its own identity with a hard-rocking self-titled debut set unlike anything else in OPM rock.Its always interesting to see how a group of young musicians can absorb diverse influences, filter them through their own creative vision, then deliver a fresh, exciting new sound that is uniquely their own. This is what we expect from EMI Philippines’ youngest three-piece act HILERA-- Nescafe Soundskool intercollegiate band competion grand champion. Though they pay homage to rock icons like Metallica, Pantera, Sepultura or to any music from grind-core new school bands to old-school punk thrown in the mix, the band manages to forge its own identity with a hard-rocking self-titled debut set unlike anything else in OPM rock.</p>
<p>Nescafe Soundskool is an inter-collegiate band competition that toured over 100 top universities and colleges in the Metro Manila in search for music’s next big thing. And as the grand champion, Hilera was officially welcomed to the professional music industry with a contract with EMI Philippines. Hilera is composed of brothers Chris (vocalist) and Bobby (drums) Padilla and Ivan Garcia (bass).</p>
<p>Winning was already an honor for the young band and scoring a contract deal with EMI Phils. have definitely paved their way to join the roster of local rock titans such as Bamboo, Sugarfree, Hale, Sandwich, Slapshock and Urbandub. This could very well catapult the once unknown band from Kalayaan University to stardom.</p>
<p>“This is really an honor for us to be taken under EMI Music. As a young band, our talents are still raw, but we’re eager to learn about the business. With EMI Philippines taking us under their wing, we are excited about the promise of the band to not only grow musically, but professionally as well,” said Chris Padilla, Hilera’s lead singer.</p>
<p>Hilera cites as an inspiration a huge variety of musical influences—from the OPM sounds of Bamboo to the punk anthems of The Clash, Rancid and The Living End to the hard hitting metal of Sepultura and Slayer to J-pop sounds of Tokyo Jihen. During the finals night of the Nescafe Soundskool competition, Hilera rocked the stadium and won new fans with songs springing from their collective talents.</p>
<p>But winning became difficult for the band. They joined the first eliminations representing Kalayaan College and went home empty handed. For a band whose experiences are scarce, their hopes became radiant when they were asked to compete as the wild card. The show for the band goes on. Singing an original composition called “Sungrass” written by Chris, the vocalist himself, Hilera made it to the finals and impressed a crowd with their unique perk of punk-ish taste for young Filipinos at the Philippine Sports Commission in Pasig. Ivan added. “I once said to myself… if we’re not going to win this, we’re still going to continue what we love doing. We love playing music and that’s why we got in to this thing in the first place. And we definitely enjoy making music together as a band.</p>
<p>The band started December 2004, when Chris, 21, and Ivan, 20, have been playing together for over a year in different bands and finally decided to finally get serious to what they started as a hobby and form a band. But after a while, both had a hard time searching for a drummer who could stay and get serious with them too. And so Bobby-- only 17 then—entered the band even though he is still starting to become an expert of the craft. His bandmates guided him and worked on his skill all the way to the band’s feat for what they believe a passion for music.</p>
<p>The band’s songs for their self-titled album are written mostly by Chris. He shared “I wrote most of the songs on the upcoming album, but Ivan writes too and so does Bob. Sometimes real life inspires me sometimes the ceiling or just plain nothing, we just want to write good melody for the songs.</p>
<p>First single culled from the self-titled Hilera album is RHYME WITHOUT REASON which is currently hitting NU107 daily countdown as to have the no. 1 seat after three weeks. From the title itself, the song’s author Chris defines it as “It’s about being stuck for no reason… and you have to conform for no reason.” RHYME WITHOUT REASON will soon be accompanied by a music video that will introduce the band to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Asked why the band’s name Hilera, Chris explained “We wanted a Filipino name to represent the band, and it was catchy at the same time. To relate the band’s name to the music, it’s like a command.”</p>
<p>Chris is taking up BS Psychology at Dominican College, Ivan Garcia taking up Business Management at Kalayaan College while Bobby Garcia is still on his fourth year Highschool at Community of Learners.</p>
<p>And for them, Hilera is a mindset that they bound next to our rock heroes, either they become famous or not…it really doesn’t matter at all.</p>

<p>The band’s songs for their self-titled album are written mostly by Chris. He shared “I wrote most of the songs on the upcoming album, but Ivan writes too and so does Bob. Sometimes real life inspires me sometimes the ceiling or just plain nothing, we just want to write good melody for the songs.</p>
<p>First single culled from the self-titled Hilera album is RHYME WITHOUT REASON which is currently hitting NU107 daily countdown as to have the no. 1 seat after three weeks. From the title itself, the song’s author Chris defines it as “It’s about being stuck for no reason… and you have to conform for no reason.” RHYME WITHOUT REASON will soon be accompanied by a music video that will introduce the band to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Asked why the band’s name Hilera, Chris explained “We wanted a Filipino name to represent the band, and it was catchy at the same time. To relate the band’s name to the music, it’s like a command.”</p>
<p>Chris is taking up BS Psychology at Dominican College, Ivan Garcia taking up Business Management at Kalayaan College while Bobby Garcia is still on his fourth year Highschool at Community of Learners.</p>
<p>And for them, Hilera is a mindset that they bound next to our rock heroes, either they become famous or not…it really doesn’t matter at all.</p>
