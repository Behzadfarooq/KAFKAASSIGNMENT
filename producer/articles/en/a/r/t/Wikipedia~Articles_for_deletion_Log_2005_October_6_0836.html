<p>Tagged as a speedy, which IMO it was not (not nonsense, and makes a claim of notability). But the claim is not made in a verifiable way, the only link is to the site of the person written about, and there is no <b>good</b> indication of notability. A google search turns up several people named "David Orr" but none seem to be this person. <b>Delete</b> unless verifiable evidence of natability is provided. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:29, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(From Author), I do have proof of these awards, I just need to scan the actual certificates into my computer to put onto either my site/ wikipedia. And yes a google search comes up with plenty of people named David Orr, because there is more than one person with my name. In fact, doing a google search on a lot of these topics is probably not the best way to determine if an article is valid or not, because google only displays websites if they are added to its server to crawl. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MrMaestro (<a href="../../../m/r/m/User_talk%7EMrMaestro_ff82.html" title="User talk:MrMaestro">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MrMaestro_5755.html" title="Special:Contributions/MrMaestro">contribs</a>)  19:39, 5 October 2005.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We don't need certificate scans, just add mention of the names, locations, and dates of the awards. That will let anyone interested verify this info. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:57, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And we wouldn't be reduced to a google search if you provided verifiable citations of what you have done that is notable, and when and where you did it. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The author of the article states "yes a google search comes up with plenty of people named David Orr, because there is more than one person with my name." This causes concern because we have a policy guideline <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> which states "Most often, vanity edits are edits about the editors themselves, their close relatives or their personal associates. While an article about a little-known company, say, should not automatically be taken as a vanity article, it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner or employee of or an investor in the company; likewise, an article about a little-known musician or band should preferably not be by the musician, a member, or a manager, roadie, groupie, etc. Articles on very little-known subjects are often of debatable value for our readers, so if you write a new article on one it is particularly important to express the facts in a neutral way and as much as possible to cite sources that are credible, neutral, and independent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As explained below, vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance is (whether or not defined by <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>)." Importance is determined against guidelines outlined in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7Emusic_156a.html" title="WP:music">WP:music</a> for musicians and the article does not establish notability against these guidelines. However, you are welcome to put them on your user page. Welcome to Wikipedia, by the way. I vote to <b>Userfy</b> if that is the author's intentions until such time as notability can be established according to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7Emusic_156a.html" title="WP:music">WP:music</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Haha I know a guy names David Orr who is most definately not this guy. <b>Delete With 5 Day Period</b> per the nomination, do not speedy because the guy at least makes an assertion of notability. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 01:13, 6 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My "favorite" David Orr is the Cook County Clerk (in Chicago). He's probably just as notable as this guy. We need a disambig page!</li>

<dd>Inks, I <i>strongly disagree</i> that this is speediable. "I am a professor of X at Y" is an ipso facto assertion of notability, in my view, because the prominence of the individual is thereafter easy to verify. I don't think the average professor deserves an article, but he does deserve an AfD to investigate how notable he is. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 09:09, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure how "I am a professor of X at Y" is any more an assertion of notability than "I am a lathe operator at XYZ Engineering". It's just a statement of occupation and employer. Yes, it does increase verifiability, but there is nothing inherently notable about being a professor. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:42, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm afraid I disagree. Thanks to the current culture of universities, almost every active (US, anyway) professor is publishing something in some journal, and it is easy as pie to search that out. In such cases, when there is a very high likelihood of an easy determination of notability at AfD, no claim with any degree of specificity and reasonableness needs to be speedied. Put simply, no single admin is God-like enough to know absolutely whether a prof. is notable; these are the sorts of cases which are fundamental to the design of AfD, in my view. More than one voice is a necessity. To directly address your analogy, a professor is more potentially notable than a lathe operator because it is a virtual certainty he has published some academic work, and it is likely he has published some book. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:46, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But simple publication of books or journals is no indicator of notability. How is a book notable if it sells 4 copies, or a paper notable if published in an obscure journal? Perhaps if they said "has publised 400 papers, 30 of them in Nature, and 50 in Science" - <i>that</i> I would consider to be an assertion of notability. To me, simply being a professor, without further qualifying information is no assertion of notability, which is why I tagged it for speedy delete.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:30, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For me, anyway, publishing a book is an <i>assertion</i> of notability. It doesn't mean you are notable, certainly, but it gives us enough evidence to evaluate quickly whether you are. Say the stub for the recently deceased <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Scott_Peck_b9f7.html" title="M. Scott Peck">M. Scott Peck</a> started as, "He was a PhD who wrote a book." This is not something we need to speedy. Send to AfD, where someone will find out what book and (if they are a constructive Wikipedian, will update the stub. For Postell, he's nn, because nobody has found anything he's written, but suppose he had written The Existence of God Proved... you just won't know whether there is a major work lurking in somebody's background until several sets of eyes examine the thing. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 12:50, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I went to Philmont so I may be biased but these should be kept. Here's why: more than 700,000 Scouts and leaders have backpacked through Philmont since 1938. These camps are familar to many people. With some additional work, the articles could be useful. I tried merging them into a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camps_of_Philmont_27ab.html" title="Camps of Philmont">Camps of Philmont</a> article but if quality information is added to each subheading, that article will be enormous. The information could be valuable but the only way to share it is to keep all the individual articles.--<a href="../../../l/1/a/User%7EL1AM_b77a.html" title="User:L1AM">L1AM</a> 10:31, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- As far as being advertising, its not really. Please take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rich_Cabins_Camp_66f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rich Cabins Camp">these related AFDs</a>.

<ul>
<li>The notability of the camp is not clear from reading the article alone. In fact, it is not clear what this camp is, who it belongs to ("Philmont" is not linked or mentioned in the article"), where it is (it is traditional to name a state and country, not latitude and longitude!)Instead we have such ad-copy as: "a great place to get a hot shower and a great program", "magnificent views", "a small but friendly staff", "a great advisor's coffee in the evenings". This is non-informative and non encyclopedic. If you think the article is worth keeping, you should take the time to write a clear lead, and cleanup, because no one who has NOT gone to this camp will be able to do so. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 07:49, 14 October 2005 (UTC) If and only if rewritten, I'd support a <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philmont_Scout_Ranch_d3bb.html" title="Philmont Scout Ranch">Philmont Scout Ranch</a> --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 07:53, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>After I looked on IMDB &amp; cast my vote, I wondered that very thing -- however, I would expect that the original contributor would mention that he was a stage actor. And yet, if we accept that as a given, how do we then determine whether a theatre actor is worth including? Are these plays in New York, London, Chicago -- or some place like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne%2C_Wyoming_c3a1.html" title="Cheyenne, Wyoming">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bend%2C_Oregon_75cc.html" title="Bend, Oregon">Bend, Oregon</a>? Has he performed in any companies that comply with the guidelines of <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actors%27_Equity_Association_eb93.html" title="Actors' Equity Association">Actors' Equity</a>? (And if so, where can one find a database for all of these companies &amp; plays -- there are none at the AE website.) Or are all of these plays he performed in community or high school plays? I'm looking for information here so I could be comfortable in accepting his entry in Wikipedia.

<li>Hello Bunchofgrapes, I have taken another pass at the Wikipedia entry for the company, WisdomSource. Like Wikipedia, it is a story that needs to be told and Wikipedia is, I believe, the right place to tell their story. What ideas do you have to make it better? Let me know &amp; I will implement them; and then we should be good to go. Thanks! - Paul Dubuc, MA, PMP, 604 313 4126. [User:Pdubuc|Pdubuc]] 04:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Most of the article should be eliminated or replaced with simple, straightforward facts about the products you sell and what they do. Again, simple, straightforward facts. The prose currently on the page is a searingly painful-to-read marriage of corporate-speak and new-age mumbo-jumbo. Honstly, even if you made the changes, I'm not sure that a company of 15 people (including resellers) and $1M revenues is notable enough for an article. I don't think Wikipedia <i>is</i> the right place to tell this story. I do appreciate the terrific effort you have put into this.<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:17, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, that is what is claimed <i>now</i>. That is because an editor did a Google search, saw that the first result which came up was the aforementioned fictional group, and failed to see that the second result was <a href="http://www.namgla.com" class="external free" title="http://www.namgla.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.namgla.com</a>, a message board for the group which matches the description given by the article. Even if we speculate that Harvard went to the trouble of actually registering the namgla.com domain and setting up a message board there <i>just</i> to add verisimilitude to a fictional group referenced in a Constitutional Law class, what are we to make of the fact that the exam took place in 1998 and the message board was active as of October 2005? The much more obvious explanation is that the same name occurred to both a law professor trying to invoke the reputation of NAMBLA without referencing the real NAMBLA and to someone wanting a name for an advocacy group that was to girls what NAMBLA is to boys. It's not like it's an especially <i>creative</i> name. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:09, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b>. This orchestra is definitely notable. It was the orchestra of the catholic broadcasting corporation <a href="http://www.kro.nl" class="external text" title="http://www.kro.nl" rel="nofollow">KRO</a> during the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillarization.html" title="Pillarization">pillarization</a> of Dutch society. As such, this orchestra was one of the top musical groups prior to the arrival of rock 'n roll in this country. The songs of this orchestra never made it to the charts though, for the simple reason that charts didn't exist over here back then. Their 1952 song <i>Naar de speeltuin</i> is a Dutch evergreen, which sold 25,000 copies. For the time, that was an immense amount. In fact, I think I'll replace the current content of the article with some of this information. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 17:59, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>""Keep"". It's notable to about 1k people in the Washington, DC area. It doesn't have anything to do with the Secret Squirrel cartoons. I moved this over from <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squirrel.html" title="Squirrel">Squirrel</a>, because someone created it there, and it certainly doesn't belong there. I added the "articles are deleted", because it kept getting yanked without listed reason, which, well, isn't exactly a model of politeness. Looking through the Deletion Policy and What Wikipedia is Not, this seems a legitimate article. It *doesn't* get deleted, I'll be glad to expand it beyond it's current near-stub state. That said, please *don't* redirect it to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Squirrel_3cd2.html" title="Secret Squirrel">Secret Squirrel</a>, as the topics are entirely unrelated.<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalldean_3932.html" title="User talk:Talldean">Talldean</a> 14:05, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<li>It's not really relevant whether or not there's a connection between what this article is currently about and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Squirrel_3cd2.html" title="Secret Squirrel">Secret Squirrel</a>. The main thing is that the current article is deletable, and it is viable that someone searching for the renamed "Super Secret Squirrel" cartoon would try searching with an -s on the end of the third word. that makes this title a reasonable redirect. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 07:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<li><b>Keep</b> While I am new, the actual measurable notariety of this social group is effectively irrelevant to whether or not this article meets the grounds for deletion. The idea is whether or not this article actually contributes to wikipedia as an encyclopedic article. Ideally the test for this with respect to vanity articles is whether or not someone who is not a member or owner of the group would write an article about the group (in this case, since we are referring to a social group.) I have done some basic research and have found independent references to them, specifically to their so-called "dj takeovers of clubs". Furthermore, it can be argued that documentation of the social state of an existing counter-culture, regardless level of localization, is necessary. Taking into consideration their "dj takeovers" at locations such as Nation in Washington, D.C. and Singapore Bistro (also in Washington, D.C.) it is evident that they play a role in the "rave" counter-culture of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Nation is a nightclub of nationwide notariety, on par with Twilo of New York, NY and Bed of Miami, FL. We are fast approaching the effective end of the rave counter-culture in this portion of the United States. This makes it ever more imperative that we document as much as possible of this important portion of American history. This particular social group claims to be the evolution of a group that once contributed greatly to this counter-culture. Lastly, it's necessary to define the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Currently the Washington, D.C. metro area is one of the largest metropolitan areas, encompassing a vast portion of northern Virginia, USA and Baltimore, MD, USA. Given this evidence, I see no reason to deem this article non-encylopedic, on the condition that it is expanded beyond the current stub-like state. Metagrapher 20:15, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Why don't you spend a little more time on expanding school articles rather than creating (or supporting the creation) of hordes of ugly stubs?

<li>Cop-out, Kappa. Almost all articles face some danger, even if vanishingly small, of deletion. School articles tend, as you have stated several times, to be kept, even in their usually-pathetic state. However, I am not the only deletionist who would vote to keep a school article if it included info that demonstrated notability. You are actually decreasing the likelihood of an article being deleted by adding to it; is that not what you want?

<li>Well I could sure run with that one if I wanted, Kappa. But I'll just leave you to ponder how an article listing a school's location, the name of the principal, the number of students, and the school colors could possibly have anything whatsoever to do with education. This depressing description could be of virtually any of the school articles currently on board. Wikipedia is covering nothing except a school census. And thank you for noting that most schools aren't any more notable than average. That being the case, why are we keeping them?

<li>You've used this argument before, and the response is the same - no one votes to "Keep" an article on a destroyer because "Destroyers are inherently notable".

<li>That's a ridiculous conclusion. Schools are inheritly not notable - they are just a pile a bricks. Ask yourself, why are the other articles kept and what makes them notable? The answer is it's connection to people plus uniqueness. People almost never go back to a school they go to - and why do they go back when they actually do? Its because of the teachers, not the pile of cement that is the "school". That's why these articles are doomed to be substub articles with a very low quality for eternity - there is no connection to people here, no notability, just the same thing as the last school article. There is no point in having 99% these around, thus the term "schoolcruft" - they are just there to take up server space. Sorry to those who are offended but it's true - and even if you did expand the article it would be no different then any other article about 99% of the schools here. There are some school articles that are worth having - but almost nothing I've seen come here fits that. What we should do is make an article for the school district and give a blurb for the school there - as, quite frankly, these articles are never going to be nothing more than a blurb and table anyway. While we're at it, if we are going to have an article on every school we should have an article on every person too - because even one teacher at a school is generally more notable then the school itself, and it seems silly to keep schools and not teachers. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 03:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>School articles aren't about buildings, they are about organizations which shape everyone's lives. They might all look indentical to you, but you are obviously neither interested in the school itself, nor schools in general, so you aren't really the target audience.

<ul>
<li>Well now - first off I disagree that they are "organizations which shape everyone's lives" - they teach - that is their function. That's why if there is an article around here its about a sports program or something of the school - because the schools inheritly all do the same thing. The organization does not do the life-shaping - its the people at the organization. The organization recieves a set sum of money to teach/etc. either from a government or a set of people - thus the inherit non-notability. Also, I am interested in a school article and would like to see a good one but this is not it, neither are most of the other ones I've voted on. As for merge, well, no one else is voting merge here and as merge defaults to keep I'd rather see it deleted in that case (that and there's nothing to merge to). Right now 99% of the school articles here are a small collection of trivia, which does not seem to belong here. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 04:14, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>See #Keep, but briefly, as I understand the arguments, schools are <i>public institutions</i> essential to <i>communities</i> and masses of individuals in their formative years. They are generally <i>fixed in location</i>, and often have <i>long histories</i>. They are likely each to attract substantial <i>communities of interest</i> to WP. I don't firmly agree with these points, but I see some value. My high school, for example, was founded in 1970, with an average class size of 1,000 people. It serves a city of 70,000, each citizen likely to know it. It is known across the entire US state, and well-known by adjacent towns, such that I estimate at least 350,000 people know of it and have reason to search for it. In my state, my school <i>is</i> (or was) average (ie. I looked up class size and campus size when enrolled there, and it was in the middle.) 350,000 potential searchers is good enough, arguably. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do <b>firmly believe</b>, however, that these arguments absolutely distinguish schools from boxes, gyms, bars, factories, and all the other general categories to which the are compared by some here. Generally, most students have at least some interest in their school (if only because they are stuck there in young life when they would rather be outside), and I <i>know</i> most parents have an interest in their children's school. The aggregate community attachment to these places, in my experience, far exceeds community concern for other "buildings," as schools are called here in dimunition by some. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sadly, sir, you are quite wrong. <i>Some</i> parents have an interest in their child's school. <i>Most</i> parents do not, though they do have an interest in their child's performance in their school. I speak from many years' experience as a former teacher, attempting to get parental involvement in my school. Good luck. And the higher the grade level, the less likelihood of getting that involvement. Parents are more interested in the local Safeway than in the local school. Laugh if you will, but parents spend more time there, they spend more money there, and they make more decisions regarding groceries than regarding school.

<li>I think there are quite a few good-faith school nominations, made by people who haven't come across the debate before and don't realise that the nomination will waste many people's time without achieving anything useful. 16:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nominations are also made by people who continue to believe that the subject of an article must be properly encyclopedic, and seeing a school article with name, address, principal's name, and nothing more, properly challenge such an article as unacceptable. Labelling this as a waste of time is a judgement call. Personally, I do not find it a waste of time to guard against dead air in Wikipedia. Even though most school articles are kept because a lack of consensus defaults to a keep, I will continue to keep the pressure on inclusionists such as yourself to stay honest. That, in my estimation, is quite a worthy goal. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:44, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>How can I "continue" to nominate schools when I have yet to nominate even one? I respond to articles as they come before AfD, and that is it. If you are going to throw rocks, please take the time to research your target. Yes, I would be happy to participate in some sort of discussion, assuming it wouldn't be the rather one-sided one which seems to happen here, in which deletionists like myself request some restraint in publishing articles on every backwater school on the planet, but inclusionists like yourself insist on keeping each and every one. When "sometimes" can be part of the conversation on both sides, maybe we can get an intelligent conversation happening. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:33, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Honest. Perhaps you can expand on how it is more honest to keep every essentially empty article on every school than it is to choose the best articles, keep them, and demand expansion or deletion of the remainder. Perhaps you might also consider that you are forcing <i>me</i> to waste <i>my</i> time in attempting to keep Wikipedia free of what I see as meaningless drivel. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:33, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I reject your comment about using this AFD to make people "stay honest". The creator of *this* article, was entirely honest, as the school is verifiably real. Now, you're free to vote as you wish, and to think school's are non-notable, but please don't suggest that *this* AFD is about keeping people honest. Now, if somebody were to create a fake school (yet again), then an AFD would be an entirely appropriate place to keep things honest (by voting to delete). If such a case happens (again), I will happily vote to delete (again) in that case. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 21:42, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You misunderstand entirely what I say. Had I meant to question the motives of the articles author, I would have said so. I was using what is commonly known as "a figure of speech". Who I mean to keep honest is those who vote to keep articles which in any other measure would be deleted as CSD:G1 or CSD:A1, or, if they were about a person, CSD:A7. I am absolutely prepared to challenge these people at every turn, and ensure that they <i>must</i> be here to vote for their precious schools if they wish to keep them. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:33, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>In the time I've spent talking here, I could have easily made a quick vote, and created dozens of one-line school stubs. If I did that, I would be as bad as the AFD spammers. Instead, I haven't, and I have spent time making what I think are decent school articles, and improving others. The only people school AFD SPAM hurts are those who care, and contribute. You're discouraging substantial contributions, but doing nothing to discourage mass creation of one-line stubs, or trivial articles. Perhaps you should focus your attention on those who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gateman1997/Schools_for_Deletion&amp;oldid=23710236" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gateman1997/Schools_for_Deletion&amp;oldid=23710236" rel="nofollow">knowlingly and intentionally create useless articles</a>. I think it is distressing that you would say your intentionally wasting our time here. Frankly, if I showed as little respect for your time, as you do for mine, I wouldn't bother writing this comment to you, I would be making a dozen one-line stubs instead. Perhaps you should re-evaluate who needs to be "kept honest" (don't take offence to my comment, I'm just using a figure of speech). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 06:06, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I will try to say this without yelling. I do not discourage substantial contributions. I <i>welcome</i> substantial contributions. I <i>beg for</i> substantial contributions. Is "Rockford High School is a school in Rockford Ontario. Its principal is Ralph Black. It has 360 students. Its school colors are red and blue" a substantial contribution? Only if your expectations are very low. Mine are not. As a matter of fact, these appear to be very much the "trivial articles" you accuse me of doing nothing to discourage. Seems to me I'm doing everything I can to discourage them. And I beg to differ that I am wasting your time. Surely if your (literally) empty articles are worth keeping, they are worth defending. How is that a waste of time? It is not like <i>I</i> brought these to AfD, and it is not like I am setting out to find school articles to bring before AfD. Furthermore, no article gets a free ride on AfD. Did no one tell you that? What it looks like you want is for me to go away so you can have your own way. If you have made decent school articles, then I congratulate you. If they are decent school articles which contain worthwhile and interesting information about the schools they cover, and they come before AfD, I will vote to keep them. If they are like most of the pathetic pieces of drek that float to the surface here (school articles or otherwise), I will vote to delete them. Frankly, if you were writing dozens of one-line stubs instead of writing these comments to me, you would be contributing nothing much different from a large number of the school articles I've voted to delete. And yes indeed, you would be the spammer then. BTW, you can rest assured that I can always find time to assist anyone, deletionist or inclusionist, to hunt down people like Gateway1997 and dispatch him/her with as much extreme prejudice as Wikipedia allows us to muster. I agree that there is absolutely no excuse for that kind of puerile behavior. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 06:46, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I never said there was either of those things. I said that an 85% VfD/AfD survival rate over the past 10 months establishes a "concensus 'not to delete'".

<li>That's a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>, however, as not all keeps (and even fewer deletes) are based on the "all schools" mantra. In addition, opinions here based on that are sometimes disregarded by the closing administrator (see some of the previous AfDs here), which further shoots holes in that theory (remember, AfD is a discussion about particular articles, not groups of articles). So, what we have here is a rather uneasy 55/45 (well, supposively. With schoolwatch etc. it makes it tough to tell how many regulars really want to keep these articles) standoff. In my early days I was a "school inclusionist" too before I realized wikipedia's goals were more towards an encyclopedia and not a wiki, so I can see where they get their opinions from (although some of the recent ones giving opinions of keep due to thinking that there is a consensus to keep these articles or whatever is pretty bizarre in terms of AfD things). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 19:32, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure that someone who looks at the history of school AfDs and sees a ratio of 9:1 "not deleted" and assumes there is some sort of concensus "not to delete schools" is "pretty bizarre".

<ul>
<li>An article which gets 16 votes to delete and 8 votes to keep is kept on the basis of "no consensus" (and please learn how to spell that word). Often, closing admins will require as high as 80 percent votes to be "delete' Before they will close a vote as consensus. An article must get, minimally, 2/3 + 1 votes to delete in order to be deleted, otherwise it is kept. The onus is <i>hugely</i> on the delete side to come up with votes. For consensus, 2/3 + 1 votes is equally required, whether to keep or delete. Since most votes on schools run around 50-50, or maybe 60-40 to keep, there is clearly no consensus for either keep or delete, so please stop trying to convince everyone of your mythical "consensus not to delete". This is not rocket surgery. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 07:12, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mr. Mann published 2 books, one of which is #156,483 ranked in sales... the other of which is in the #600,000s. They are published by a small publishing house. Not exactly overwhelming evidence of notability as an author. He appeared on Wolf Blitzer, but that's not much of a claim to fame either. His service to his country is commendable, but not any more notable than the service that thousands of other young men and women have performed (and are currently performing). He's the CEO of a non-notable film company and the lead singer of a non-notable band. He had a minor role in a movie. So what are we debating here? This guy has had an interesting life, but not a notable one... at least not yet. His biggest attribute seems to be his shameless self-promotion (aka "Future Oscar Winner"). <b>Delete</b> because the gestalt is as non-notable as the individual achievements.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:07, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am quite sure the text is a copyvio (article contains reference to a photo which isn't in the article). First, I thought about speedying it as a blatant copyvio, but the criterion demands that an online source is located and I haven't found one. Then I thought about speedying it under A7, but the article says <i>"...he helped pinpoint the central gene that controls aging in brewer's yeast."</i> and <i>"he is now vice president, as well as a co-founder, of Longenity."</i>. So I couldn't speedy under that either. Then I thought about bringing it to <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> for the slow copyvio deletion route, but without a source located, I had some trouble doing that as well. So AFD it is, this reads like a newspaper in-depth report and not an encyclopedia article, and I don't really think Matt Kaeberlin meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines either. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:15, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Obviously, having written the article, I disagree. The NFA is notable as it is one of the longer-lived micronations. If you take the time to peruse their site, you will see that it is more developed than many micronations, including currency, postage, "bricks and mortar" presence. It has also been written up in 2 recent magazine articles.</p>
<p>It is certainly more notable and less a case of microvanity than some of the other micronations included in wikipedia, if you will look at all of them without respect to newness on the site, or level of completeness to date.</p>
<p>I would be more than happy to work to improve the article if there are deficiencies that you can point out to me.</p>
<p>All that being said, you guys make the rules, so do what you're going to do. I am happy to agree to disagree with you, and let the wiki-community make their decision, as I am a newbie here. I will of course abide by the community's decision. - <a href="../../../j/s/h/User%7EJsheffield_76de.html" title="User:Jsheffield">jsheffield</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, a micronation that I was involved with for some time lasted over 12 years (about five longer that NFA), and wouldn't qualify for an article (FWIW, The Commonwealth of Port Colice). Mind you, our presence was probably slightly less that NFA's (no currency, though we did have postage, for instance). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 12:11, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Micro Delete</b> I must say, I have never heard of the concept before. (We're all micro nations over here in Europe!) I think it's a grand idea. And I hope the NFA succeed in getting the independent country status they presumably seek. Hard to see what really distinguishes them from the likes of other communes (etc..) though? And most of those are not sufficiently notable to be here. I don't know. Maybe it's a question of longevity? Or of import to others in the micro state world? In any case, being around since 1998 makes me unconvinced of notability at this point in time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Notability generally involves some impact by the micronation upon the real world. Declaring a field to be an independent nation and telling only Wikipedia about it (Pogo), or setting up a club on a web site (Atlasia), do not impact the real world at all. Sealand and Ladonia, in contrast, have elicited mainstream news coverage, and have involved real disputes, real territories, and real court cases. Researching the Northern Forest Archipelago, I find that the external news coverage linked to by the article itself actually <i>cites Wikipedia as its source</i>, and so must be discounted when determining the notability of the micronation. There is no other news coverage, no independently written articles, and no evidence that the micronation has impacted upon the real world in any way. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:44, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uncle G --&gt; There are 2 external news articles, one of which lists wikipedia among its numerous sources (although why citing wikipedia as a source would preclude it from being considered an article in the "real world" seems strange to me anyway); the adk explorer article makes no mention of wikipedia at all. That won't necessarily change the outcome of this (as it seems pretty clear where this is headed), but I thought I would point it out. Is there a clearly defined criteria for inclusion of micronations into wikipedia, or is this done on a case by case basis? - <a href="../../../j/s/h/User%7EJsheffield_76de.html" title="User:Jsheffield">jsheffield</a>

<li>AFAIK, it's on a case by case basis, but if I were to set forth a criteria about this perennial issue over which micronations Wikipedia should include, I'd use Uncle G's. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:12, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>why citing wikipedia as a source would preclude it from being considered an article in the "real world"</i> — That's a straw man. Nobody said any such thing. What I actually wrote was that the article "must be discounted when determining the notability of the micronation". An article that cites Wikipedia as its source cannot even be used to determine the <i>verifiability</i> of a subject. It certainly cannot be used to determine notability. <i>Is there a clearly defined criteria for inclusion of micronations</i> — Not inasmuch as editors have written a page similar to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, no. I attribute this to there simply having been no incentive. We aren't inundated with micronation articles to the same extent that we are inundated with articles about persons, bands, companies, and web sites. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:03, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No it doesn't exist, and it is not notable. Aside the from the silly claims of being a "micronation"; there really isn't evidence of any organization. The web site claims you can join up if you own some land but <i>"...declaring your land to be a part of the NFA does not have an impact on your legal rights of ownership, it is more a state of mind than a binding legal contract..."</i>. In other words the entire article is about a guy's state of mind. This is a silly joke, which we should not partake. If this guy gets enough followers, creates a real organization, then we can create an article on his environmental organization, but never an article for a "micronation". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 00:52, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p>
<p>ich bitte um Löschung dieses Artikels, da ich den Verfasser kenne und weiss, dass der Inhalt frei erfunden ist. Falls Sie die Daten kontrollieren, werden Sie zu der selben Überzeugung kommen und festellen, dass es keinerlei Quellen zur Person von Gaston Lippitt gibt.</p>
<p>Vielen Dank für die Bearbeitung Sylvia Aust</p>

I realize that there are a tremendous number of arguments for and against retaining school articles, but whether the school is <i>named</i> after a notable person should be irrelevant.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Hipocrite, I thank you for retracting your allegation that of bad-faith. However, I feel compelled to point out that I believe in this nomination and I am not attempting to make any sort of point, other than that this particular article fails the test of notability and should be deleted. If you look at my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Johntex" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Johntex" rel="nofollow">Contributions</a>, you will see that I nominate a fair number of articles for deletion because they fail notability standards. Schools are a very small percentage of my delete nominations or votes. Schools, businesses, destroyers, girrafes, eggplants, people, or any specific instance of any other thing needs to be notable enough to merit inclusion in this encyclopedia or he/she/it should not be included. There is no Wikipedia policy that says that all schools are notable or that all schools should or must be kept. I believe the true waste of time is in creating and defending non-notable articles, not the effort to have them excised from the project. And to answer Oblivious' question, my answer would be "absolutely", not notable bands, movies, etc. should be deleted are deleted here everyday. Schools do not have a policy protecting them from the same legitimate scrutiny. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:29, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I will second the "clap, clap" for a mature retraction. And I will also second John's larger point. I won't nom schools (I never go looking for them anyway) but I vote delete when there is no assertion of notability beyond "the bricks and mortar." I'm sure a lot of work has gone into the school's project but there is nothing binding about it. Wiki is not a directory. Wiki is discursive but not indiscriminate.

<li>What? That's a personal attack if I ever saw one. No need to go around calling others "abnormal" because they hold a different viewpoint to the majority.

<li>Please. Firstly, describing a philosophical position as stupid is not an attack on the person who holds it (eg. You are stupid vs You are a Nobel Prize Winning Wikipedian, but your argument is stupid). Second, I've only ever called it stupid once. Third, I retracted it and apologised the moment it was pointed out to me it was rude. Fourth, <i>my</i> conduct has no bearing on the rudeness (or otherwise) of <i>your</i> conduct. Even if I've called you "abnormal", it doesn't grant you license to call someone else "abnormal". In constrast, your use of the term "not a normal Wikipedian" was clearly directed at the <i>individual</i>, not the arguments he was advancing, and you're making up excuses to justify it.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please. First of all, it is at best <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> to refer to someone else's philosophical position "stupid", and a great many editors on WP would consider it a personal attack. Next, <b>I</b> (nor anyone else for that matter) have not referred to anyone as "abnormal", in fact, you are the only one to have used this term so far. Next, it was <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a> (like yourself, one of "those who routinely nominate or vote to delete school articles") who first made the statement that: "Most normal Wikipedians will vote to keep or delete articles on the basis of their content, not their subject," indicating that those of us who vote to keep or delete on articles on the basis of their subject are somehow "not normal Wikipedians" by obverse implication. When <b>KAPPA</b> (obviously not me or my sockpuppet) simply retorted about what 'must' constitute a "normal wikipedian" by that standard, you accused him of making a personal attack. As to your contention that your misbehavior doesn't give "me" (or in this case, Kappa) license to abuse others, you are correct, but your abusing others or being uncivil and then going about admonishing others for being uncivil does make you a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocrite.html" title="Hypocrite">hypocrite</a>. What I'd like to know, is why you weren't rushing to remind <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a> about his uncivil statements when he suggested that those of us that decide to vote on the basis of subject are "abnormal" (as you put it).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 04:55, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps you should get out a dictionary and look up "normal", Nicodemus. No, wait, let me do it for you. "normal - adj. 1. regular, usual, typical" Not so scary after all, huh? No mention of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_scan.html" title="Brain scan">brain scans</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/t/ECT_11a1.html" title="ECT">ECT</a>, or twitchy eyes. No, school inclusionists are probably <i>not</i> "normal" Wikipedians. "Normal" Wikipedians actually take the time to read articles before voting on them, and actually ask themselves whether an article contains anything of merit before deciding to keep it. This is true of schools, pokemons, and star trek characters. If stating what is apparently true can be construed as a personal attack, then all of us are in big trouble. Now can I help you with the definition of "abnormal"? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:58, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with Denni. No one has mentioned Asia. The nom, votes and argument would be the same if it were Kansas School, Kansas City, Kansas. The repeated recourse to systemic bias in these keep arguments is specious. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:07, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The claim that there is <b>not</b> a systemic bias against schools outside of the English-speaking geographical pale is specious. By their very nature, there is a systemic bias against schools whose primary source references are in another language. This renders what "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools" consider to be articles of an inferior quality and more likely to garner delete votes on the basis of a poorly-written article and difficulty of verifiability. Asian schools have been conspicuously targeted in the past 45 days by a variety of "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools". Apart from the bad faith mass-nomination of 24 schools in one day in September, Asian schools represented 15% of all school AfD nominations in the month, while representing a <b>much</b> smaller percentage of the total number of school articles on Wikipedia. If that doesn't consitute a systemic bias, I am not sure what does.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:50, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A systemic bias is <i>systemic</i>. It does not pop up suddenly one day or one month, and the number of school pages that show up in a month is small enough that statistical fluctuation is everything. I would also question your use of the term "conspicuously targeted". I can only assume that you see a plot a-hatchin' when you use language like that. First, there have not been a whole lot of Asian schools nominated, Second, the vote counts for those schools was pretty much the same as it usually is, with the usual cast of character casting the usual distribution of votes. In fact, one Asian School, Apeejay Public School, actually garnered some keep votes from some (myself included), who, as you so quaintly put it, "routinely nominate and vote to delete schools." If you really wish to test this conspiracy theory of yours, you may want to go back to those delete votes and see who it was that originally brought them to AfD. I expect you will find they were nominated by a diverse group, including some who do not participate here on a regular basis. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 06:19, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep. They're just 3 weeks away from putting out an album that will surely bring their notoriety up to Wiki guidelines. Put the discussion on hold for 2 months, I say.</p>
<p><b>DELETE</b>. Realistically, the chances that their new album will give them enough notability to meet the wikipedia guidelines are slim to none. There are literally thousands of such bands out there who put out albums and fail to get noticed, why would these guys be any different? Certainly there is a chance that they could become big, but that chance is infinitly small and thus I see no is no reason for tableing the debate. Its like saying: "I'm going to hold off on planning my retirement until after I've won the lottery." Certainly I have a chance of winning the lottery, but that chance is so small that it dosen't make rational sense to take such a possiblity into consideration.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the author of this page I am well aware the content of this page is quite questionable and arguably sensitive, however, I do feel that this page cannot be deemed 'irrelevant’ context and should be preserved as an entry on the Wikipedia server. I can assure all naive readers that indeed this band exists and I believe the interesting, albeit unusual details of the band members deems this relevant for archival on Wikipedia. I should also note that although at the time of writing, this page on Wikipedia has recieved but 3 views on Google, it has only existed for a little over 24 hours as I created this page last night. Obviously this article is a stub and hopefully over time a reader with more information on the band will come forward and provide information towards this page. Until then, I fully believe this article should wholly remain as a stub on Wikipedia as it is relevant to the history of music, (if only a fraction). Furthermore, although the use of the racist connotation 'niggers' may be considered 'sensitive', banning this page on the reason of political correctness is just another form of censorship. Wikipedias' simple aim is to provide information to the masses via the internet and as this particular band has a seldom source of information on it, I feel it's Wikipedias' aim to provide as much information as possible out of the little that's already available on the internet. Thank you for your consideration. --Topclaw 15:10, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jitse and JahJah: it looks much better now than it did at the time of nomination. My only quibble is that it's tacitly assumed that <i>S</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> and <i>D</i><sup><i>n</i>+1</sup> are embedded in <i>R</i><sup><i>n</i>+1 <sup>with center at the origin and the usual scalar multiplication on <i>R</i><sup><i>n</i>+1</sup>. But perhaps that's easy enough to figure out (assume the author meant something obvious, try it, see it that works), and explaining it might just add verbiage and make the page harder to follow. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:48, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></sup></li>

<ul>
<li>This brings up a basic flaw with the naming of categories for established year. For decade categories, we start on years ending in zero (e.g. 1920s not 3rd decade of 20th century). Example: Category:Schools established in 1900 is under Category:Schools established in the 19th century. However, Category:Schools established in the 1900s is a decade sub-cat under Category:Schools established in the 20th century. Now, I suspect many people would consider 1900 to be in the 1900s. Also, most regular people generally think 2000 is the first year of a new century, regardless of what's technically accurate. I suppose it's to late now, but all the century categoreis should have been in the format Category:Schools established ##00-##99 (avoiding use of the word century). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 19:52, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doesn't show up on iMDB because she is not reknowned for her acting or screenwriting prowesses (and this is a service you have to pay for) but rather non-fictional stories in australian newspapers, judge on the australian young writer's guild. iMDB also does not show many actors in small television series. Not a strong argument.

<li>the information is actually verifiable. Quite a famous name in Australia, due to her loss of the role of Samara. For this information to be considered a prank between a small circle of friends, that would assume that i actually know the people in question.

<li>oh, of course not. But it's nice to read some light-hearted material about people you like to read about. Wikipedia is about publishing all aspects of a person's life.

<li>Hm, the article definately needs editing, but I don't think deletion is warranted. The game appears orignal, as far as I can see, but perhaps merging might be an option. Any ideas?

<li>81.103.136.218, in saying that "the game appears original", ironically puts xyr finger on exactly the problem with this article.

As <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> says, this appears to be an attempt to use Wikipedia as a soapbox to advertise (and, indeed, as a free wiki host for constructing the rules for) a newly invented game. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is neither an advertising billboard nor a free wiki host</a>.

<li><b>Keep.</b> If you people are going to continue using the useless and easily exploitable Alexa site to measure popularity, I'll never cease to question the competence of the Webcomics Wikipedia Staff. Also remember the comic is weekly and its statistics won't be as high as comics that update every single day. The comic has been online almost 4 years and has built up one of the larger archives compared to most weekly comics. Despite what Alexa tells you, GD is hardly an unknown, and even runs one of the most popular Oekaki sites online. He is more hard-working and knowledgable than most of the artists that are considered "noteable" on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 23:50, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Proposal B is totally out of order. What sort of notability is there here? Are we saying Wikipedia is a place where every comic which has been around for over 100 strips gains an article? What about bar room bands who have been around for a while. What about bloggers with 500 posts? Longevity as people seem to claim here, is not an instant claim to fame. Has this strip been mentioned anywhere outside the webcomic community? Has it received critical feedback and reviews from other respected journals/publications/magazines? Proposal B, just claims that if a webcomic exists, then it warrants an article. And people are agreeing? People have been attacking me from nominating webcomics, because of a personal dislike? This is totally incorrect, I was just pretty shocked when I saw the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> article at the amount of cruft that had been let in, which would have been deleted if it were any other category. Alexa is not definitive, that is easy to see, but to have a rank of over 1 million is pretty poor. Any reasonably popular webcomic would have a ranking a lot higher. With non webcomic websites, anything over 1 million would be deleted. How is this webcomic more notable than Fleetwood Back, a <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleetwood_Mac_e8b5.html" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> tribute band, who play local venues in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough.html" title="Scarborough">Scarborough</a>? It's time we changed the webcomic guidelines in line with other Wikipedia guidelines. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:44, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hahnchen, just because you haven't heard of GD or Our Home Planet in whatever little retarded circle of webcomics YOU pay attention to doesn't mean they're unimportant. And I find it really hard to believe that your opinion of Our Home Planet has nothing to do with this nomination. If Proposal B is going to be ignored from now on, throw Proposal A out to, for being completely USELESS. You're not getting the picture here. Alexa is not even a REMOTELY good source to measure website readership. Seeing you obsessively stick to it, despite a great number of people telling you why you shouldn't, makes you look like an ignorant little brat. INCIDENTALLY, GD recently changed its domain name to one <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=ourhomeplanet.net" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=ourhomeplanet.net" rel="nofollow">Alexa isn't even tracking yet,</a> which would make whatever number you're seeing even more wildly innacurate than normal. But since you seem to be ignoring every argument against you, it doesn't matter. The webcomic listing won't be fixed until it represents your narrow view of what's important.<br /></li>
<li>Come to think of it, what webcomics DO you read, Hahnchen? If your answer is "just Penny Arcade and Ctrl-Alt-Del", please do us all a favor and get out. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 00:42, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hi SuperHappy, I at least read a bunch of webcomics, including some of yours. That doesn't mean I think it's the purpose of this encyclopedia to list every webcomic in existence. We're trying to discuss the inclusion criteria on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> and come to some consensus, but swearing at someone who's trying to maintain some uniform standard of notability for <i>all</i> wikipedia articles (not just webcomics) isn't going to help. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 01:50, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Haha... Fine, fine... swears have been edited.

<li>Wow Superhappy, thanks for the character assassination. What does it matter what I read, what I eat and what I like? You have asserted no mention of notability anywhere in your arguments, apart from the size of its archive, and that GD is a hardworking guy. You've got the argument the wrong way round, I do not read Our Home Planet, but that is NOT the reason I nominated it. There are so many bands that I have never heard of or never listened to, and yet if theres a verifiable assertion of notability, I would not delete it. What the argument should be, is "Just because you're a fan of the comic, is that the reason it should be kept?" - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:40, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmmm...where to start. (First editor) is a non-notable educator (at a non-notable institution) with co-authorship of 4 papers to his name. (Second editor) appears to have a little more notability than his colleague. The whole issue smacks of dicdef, original research and postmodern jibberjabber that professional professors throw around when their tenure is threatened. <b>Delete</b> or come up with some convincing prose that demonstrates clearly the how and why of bullying via the internet and why it is a bigger deal than actual physical violence. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 21:03, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>{Rejoinder} Despite the fact that Mr. Willers provided absolutely no constructive feedback regarding this project, I feel that he has contributed immeasurably, insofar as his comments represent a good example of one form of cyberbullying – that is, groundless, unqualified, and clearly inept criticism of another’s work. I will not respond to the personal attack, except for thanking him for visiting our site. I will, however, continue to contribute to the development of Wikipedia and the cyberbullying article specifically as this is an area of interest. Non-notable educator 22:41, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Response to Non-Notable Educator</b>. Sir, I am saddened by your apparent inability to maintain a clear focus on the purpose of this forum. An AFD Nomination is not required to provide 'constructive feedback', as the process calls for contributory votes from other users. Although, as you assert, and to which I shall admit, my criticism is somewhat 'groundless, unqualified, and clearly inept', at no point does my nomination veer in to the realms of personal attack (aka 'cyberbullying') and to suggest that it does is disingenuous, to say the least. I maintain that you have signally failed in your article to clearly set forth a difference between actual physical intimidation in the real world and its electronic percieved equivalent.</li>

<li><b>Keep/Expand/Cleanup</b> Cyber bullying (as two words) has received mainstream media attention internationally as a concept w/r/t kids in chat rooms, and using SMS and IM. Apparently it's more prevalent than in-person bullying due to anonymity the web provides.

<p>This article appears to be advertising for Arrowsmith Research Company and was probably written by same. It is written from the point of view of the company ("Our products are used throughout the chip design process from architectural conception through silicon tapeout.") in a tone inappropriate for an encyclopedia. There are ten links to the <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenAccess_5f37.html" title="OpenAccess">OpenAccess</a> article, which it is claimed is used by Arrowsmith Research, and a great deal of text concerning OpenAccess which resembles ad copy. For example: "IC CAD engineers spend an inordinate amount of time integrating them with thousands of lines of translator code. The resulting flows are fragile and error-prone. As well, they are inefficient and result in longer IC design cycle times. Engineered for industry-wide interoperability, the OpenAccess database allows users to construct flows incorporating design tools from multiple sources to best suit their needs."</p>

It's not from Italian Wikipedia, which doesn't have an article on him, so I don't know where the original came from.

<li>So I took a shot at rendering as much as I could. I had to guess in some spots, and there was some stuff I just had no idea about. (I do speak Italian; it would have been easier to translate the actual original.) It's still unsourced and as far as I know unverified, so unless someone can pick up where I left off, I still say '<i>delete</i>. But it's getting closer. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:08, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I found the original; it's at <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Chiappucci" class="external autonumber" title="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Chiappucci" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. I think my translation is pretty accurate, though I couldn't think of a word that renders <i>vezzosamente</i>, so I just left it out (it was more or less a swipe at the French anyway). The language problem is fixed now, but there's still a the problem of sourcing/verifying the material. Also I don't know why the article is called "Chioccioli" when it's about Chiappucci, but that's a lesser problem (can easily be moved). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:35, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
