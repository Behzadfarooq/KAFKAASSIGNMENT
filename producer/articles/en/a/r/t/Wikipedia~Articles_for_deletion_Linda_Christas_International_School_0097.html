<dd>A pre-university school is most commonly known as a high school, although there are exceptions, such as a <a href="../../../c/e/g/CEGEP_3a45.html" title="CEGEP">CEGEP</a>. If the school is actually a tertiary or post-secondary institution, then we should remember that most such institutions are notable. I left the {{subst:adw|NAME OF ARTICLE}} messages on the talk pages because the nominator had chosen not to. Remember that <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> states: "It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the article that you are nominating the article." Some comments refer to this school as a business. The context suggests that it is a not-for-profit charitable organization, but I have been unable to confirm this. That having been said, I feel that the term "crazy" is offensive and inappropriate, and I would ask the person who used that term to withdraw it. I think that the material that <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> found ought to be mentioned in the article. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 04:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> We have my brother's high school on Wikipedia. What's the diff. Actually, someone should have left the original Linda Christas alone as well. Too many editors who have emotional problems at Wikipedia. Another example, someone is going out of their way to put the word FUCK on Pat Boone's site, and reference to Amway. But the same person deletes that Pat Boone is President of the University Board at Pepperdine, and holds a chair at Linda Christas in honor of the black and blind concert Pianist John William Boone. I mean, the editor likes Fuck and Amway, but not Pepperdine University and Linda Christas. He's done it about ten times. Doesn't say much for the judgement of the editors. I'm going to put it in again. See if you see it when you check. I assume that the REAL editors of Wikipedia might agree that Pepperdine is a bit more notable that Fuck. Well, maybe not.Oppieangel2000</li>

<li><b>Keep It</b> I think people are missing the point here. Linda Christas is a three country school. Wikipedia has one horse town schools in the Encyclopedia, so what is the problem with Linda Christas other than it's a good place for kids. Also, people need to understand that the web site for all three Linda Christas schools is listed under just Linda Christas, not Linda Christas International. The International designation is relatively recent because of their success in China. So ANY hit you get with a Linda Christas search and there are lots of them is good for Linda Christas International. Also, I agree with one of the comments above. The people like The Taoist, and the Miles Williams of the world are really crazy. If those kinds of people win something like this, we are lost.<small>â€” 71.142.236.117 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.142.236.117_94c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.142.236.117">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Yes, Keep It</b> I think that a lot of the trouble here is that one has to look at who and what Linda Christas has accomplished. I mean Sue Grafton, Pat Boone, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Alison Jiear don't lend their names to just any project. In the case of Mr. Boone, the only other school he is affiliated with is Pepperdine University. Are we going to say that Linda Christas is not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> The negative material I see on Google regarding Linda Christas has nothing to do with anyone or anybody who knows anything about Linda Christas. That's what's happening here. The negative posts are from people who a reasonable person would listen to and then do the exact opposite thing. A Taoist and a Racist. I mean, Linda Christas was accused of racism. Take a look at the faces on their Board. If one can call this school racist, then the KKK is not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this school is worthy of being on Wikipedia. If one is counting socks, maybe not. But if one is really wanting to have something worthwhile on the data base then, for heavens sake, girls, back off. Linda Christas has been supported on D.C. Radio. New York City Radio (Public service radio - not high pressure sales radio). It has a record of ZERO BBB complaints unsatisfied. I mean this school is attacked everywhere it tries to help kids, and help kids they do (without one penny of our tax money). One lady wrote a letter complaining that she didn't like the name of the School and if they didn't change it, she was going to file with the BBB. I mean really!!!!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I ask you, why would you delete this school when if you just read the stuff that is said that is negative about Linda Christas you will see that none of the people complaining have a single child in the school. They just like to complain, as so many Americans do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Linda Christas is an elite school with some of the best minds and personalities in the world supporting it. Captain Jim Lovell (Apollo 13) is considering accepting a seat on the Linda Christas Advisory Committee, and NONE of the celebrities or scientists or authors that currently are on the Committee are paid a dime to contribute their leadership to the school. Again, if you girls are salvageable, there is no doubt about the merits of Linda Christas. This article needs to stay. ShirleyDobbins

Wouldn't we say by extension then that Linda Christs is deserving of at least a small space. For example, the Pat Boone listing is several times the length of the proposed Linda Christas site. I say keep the site, and if necessary have some portions re-written although it seems pretty objective to me as it is.</li>

The people who have written on the net anything negative about Linda Christas know nothing about the school. Just read the comments. It would be like including the 3000 unanswered BBB complaints that IBM currently has on file. Why not put that in the IBM article???? Because the complaints against IBM are generally made because there was a loose wire somewhere, and not necessarily in the equipment. If you go to legitimate sources for complaints like the BBB....maybe. But IBM's 3000 unanswered complaints ARE with the BBB. So now with Linda Christas that has had ONE BBB complaint in nine years, and that one not even from a family who had a student in the school, that's what you are going to use to characterize this school??? Is anyone seriously thinking that's an objective listing of relevant material or relevant to deciding whether this school is notable?<small>â€” Bestofseven (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bestofseven_8d37.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bestofseven">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Yes, I see your point here. But, I have no desire to begin a parliamentarian discussion of Roberts Rules. I just think that if the policies lead you to exclude a person or entity I know to be at the forefront of educational practice, if not theory, that is a disservice to anyone who might appreciate a look at the present with a bias (in a positive sense) toward the future. In that situation, only traditional organizations and theories will have an opportunity to meet with favor here, and in this age of speed and dynamic change, Wikipedia will become less desirable as a source than many of the established encyclopedias. (The yearly Americana is normally obsolete upon publication. That's one reason that Google and Metacrawler are consulted BEFORE Wikipedia. They understand the need for virtual change. Unless Wikipedia can overcome its own inertia, I'm afraid it will rapidly become massively redundant.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Said differently, accuracy is one thing;being the best is another. I had hoped (and still hope) that Wikipedia can maneuver out from under the weight of encyclopedic "tradition" and truly become the dynamic venture that was its original vision. To that end I am certainly willing to contribute to Wikipedia. I am, however, going to allow this issue with Linda Christas to be a litmus test for me. If with all the input now posted on the net, and with the trade references and reputations of the persons supporting Linda Christas, the rules of inclusion/exclusion have already grown so cumbersome (not to say Jurassic) at Wikipedia so as to exclude Linda Christas, Wikipedia has moved beyond my personal exclusion "Event Horizon." On the other hand, if obstacles to the publication of the newest and most eagerly awaited societal changes can be reflected in something approaching real time by Wikipedia, without a planetary eruption when "traditional" long term sources are not available, Wikipedia will indeed be the FIRST knowledge source ever to surpass the glories of a search engine by virtue of its scholarship. If you wish, I am willing to interview the principals at this school, and re-create something for you to look at. But, from my perspective what they have already provided to the Wikipedia authorities, seems sufficient to maintain their listing. I can certainly corroborate some of it myself. (For example, I have met and entertained Efrem Zimbalist Jr. on several occasions. He is a very family oriented individual who loved and respected his father and mother very much. With his work at the Curtis Institute (which I do not see mentioned on his listing with Wikipedia, and his acceptance of a chair with Linda Christas, I frankly don't understand how Wikipedia can exclude these facts.

<dd>If this institution is indeed noteable for "[being] at the forefront of educational practice, if not theory" then surely you can cite some <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">reliable</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to substantiate that claim. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 05:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you've provided absolutely no way for anyone to verify your claim. You say Christas was in "Curious Parent" magazine. Is this it: <a href="http://www.curiousparents.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.curiousparents.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>&#160;? If so, it's very small. Which issue has an article about Christas in it? If Efrem Zimbalist is involved, why is his picture on the website a 50 year old headshot (He's 88 years old now)? Why not a picture of him with a staff member or student? Over and over again, all we get are testimonials ("Linda Christas saved my life!") and unsupported assertions ("Linda Christas is on the cutting edge of educational edge cutting!") You act offended that we aren't taking your word for it. Well, we're not supposed to. Wikipedia articles are considered guilty until proven innocent, and no evidence <i>that has not provably come from outside of the Linda Christas organization</i> has appeared. If you could get one of the celebrities listed as an endorser to come forward <i>without any Christas employee acting as a go between</i> and discuss their support of the organization, it would help, but it would probably not get the article all the way. Celebrity endorsements are not enough by themselves. Oh, and by the way, I often lose track of things here and there, but I never ever forget my own first name. You've been going back and forth between Raymond and Mason. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 07:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You are not going to find lots of people in the community saying "gee whiz" what a wonderful way to change the system. Both the Waldorf schools and the Linda Christas schools have been under attack for three or four years for their policies regarding introducing material to children when the children are ready for it rather than treating them like cookies.</li>

<dd>In my substantial travels, I have seen Linda Christas mentioned in several newspapers, albeit not the New York Times. One newspaper was in the Los Angeles area (Los Cerritos Community News), and the other when I was traveling in Oregon (Argus Newspapers) I have also heard Linda Christas mentioned on public radio at least in Watertown, New York (Their fund raising auction in 2005. Linda Christas had donated a scholarship to them to auction off.) And, as mentioned, you can find articles about the school in Curious Parent Magazine. Further, some public high school districts have recently been picking up the Linda Christas rules for selecting extracurricular eactivities, Dedham High School District, for example.</dd>

<dd>Keep in mind that Linda Christas is not a traditional school with a traditional campus, There are no buildings for the tax payers to support with the name Linda Christas over the doors. And, no reporters COVERING Linda Christas FOOTBALL. Linda Christas receives no tax money, nor tax favored money. They have approximately 4000 students internationally. I personally know two of the students currently studying to attend U.S. Universities next year who live in south east China (If it would help, I can ask their permission for you to contact them for verification.) You can contact any of the people on the Advisory Committee to ascertain the existence of the school if you wish. Surely, we are not going to be so petty as to deny that the MOST convincing and important material about Linda Christas, they have already published for the world to see.) Certainly that must count for something. If I asked the writer above to substantiate his or her existence, surely if Dr. Gregory Huckabee, former high ranking officer in the Adjutant Corps were willing to verify the fine work he/she (the writer above) were doing, wouldn't that be superior to his/her name being registered in a box score in the Baltimore Sun? Or are we so convinced that the traditional means of doing everything is what we want for Wikipedia. Dr. Shroeder P.S. I know Dr. Mason R. Ridge by reputation only. Is someone attempting to attack that good man?

<li><b>Comment</b> Not one of the Linda Christas Advisory Committee receives a penny for lending their names to LC for verification purposes. It is simply a pro bono arrangement all around. The only thing that the members of the Advisory Committee are guilty of is being impressed enough with LC to be willing to link their names and reputations with Linda Christas.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let me ask a question here: Let's take for our example the pioneering surgeon, Dr. Ronald Allison (put his name into the Google search engine) who sits on the Linda Christas Advisory Committee without pay. Is Wikipedia saying that BEFORE Dr. Allison knew enough about Linda Christas to agree to serve on the Advisory Committee without pay, he would have been a personage Wikipedia would have accepted for verification of its (LC's) existence. However, since Dr. Allison was evidently impressed enough to have his name linked with Linda Christas he is now disqualified? Does that go for the rest of the people who purposely allowed their names to be used for verification as well?.... though again NONE of the members of the Advisory Committee are paid a nickel for their efforts on behalf of the School. Is Wikipedia taking the position that if a celebrity or noted personality goes out of their way for FREE to help an organization, Wikipedia disqualifies that person or persons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Said differently, I am getting the impression that, since Linda Christas' intent was to recruit noted, responsible people to be on their Advisory Committee, so that parents could verify the quality of the Linda Christas offerings, this very act of getting the person on the Committee disqualifies that person from verifying that the School exists. So, let's say Captain Jim Lovell joins the Committee as he might, he's considering it, but like the others, wanted, of course, to investigate before committing. Now, BEFORE Captain Lovell completes his study of the School to decide if he can support its programs, before he has done that, Wikipedia will accept Captain Lovell's judgment in terms of verifying Linda Christas' existence. But, if he actually becomes enthused about LC and accepts a seat on the Committee, then he is disqualified according to the Wikipedia rules?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's really difficult for me to see the logic in that case. It would be like verifying that George Bush is still physically functional by disqualifying his Cabinet, and then asking the guard in the White House lobby for verification. Can this be? Can Wikipedia really have such a policy, and remain respected???</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am just wanting to understand who in the world an organization might call upon to know enough about it to be favorably impressed, BUT NOT TOO FAVORABLY impressed, i.e. a level of impression that is sufficient for them NOT to want to help that organization, and yet having enough information to satisfy Wikipedia rules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I submit the names of the Linda Christas Advisory Committee for verification of LC's standing. There isn't a high school in the Nation with a more impressive board. Look at the boards of ANY of the high schools in your area or that have been previously listed on Wikipedia without fanfare. Other boards don't even come close, and yet, Wikipedia seems ready to reject what in effect is one of the finest assemblies of celebrity and doctoral talent for any high school in America. I hope I am somehow wrong here. I challenge anyone to try to find a better Advisory Group for a high school!! If LC is not listed by Wikipedia at the end of this discussion, I would say that the illogic of that decision would disqualify Wikipedia, at least in my mind, from ever being taken seriously. In that case, I would actually advise LC to stay away from Wikipedia. It would be a disgrace to BE listed if the logic I am hearing is accurate.I JUST DON'T BELIEVE WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE CARELESS OR ARBITRARY ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECISION OF THAT KIND. Please prove me right!BettyCharette</dd>

<dd>(Can we get a sock check on BettyCharette?) You're referring to a list that appears only on the website. There is no public reciprocal acknowledgement from <i>any</i> of the big names on it. I've only been able to establish contact with one member of the list so far, but they have neither confirmed nor denied anything yet. What the high schools in a particular area do is not in doubt. What Linda Christas does <i>is</i> in doubt. All information about its doings has come through the organization itself. I can make grandiose claims too. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 20:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep It</b>: You guys are not even attempting to think this through. To have those people pictured on the Internet WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION would cost Linda Christas millions in law suits, and it would be all over the newspaper. Where is the logic here. (Remember Barbara Streisand sued an environmnetalist for 16 million for just taking a photo of her house and putting it on the net.) This seems to be a bit like the inquisition. I mean any thoughtful person it seems to me would understand the reality of public images, and how much money some of these people command just for an appearance. For images to be placed without permission would be financial suicide, not to mention the national press panning Linda Christas forever. I give up people. At this time, I really don't believe anything any commentator would say would persuade you of the illogic of what you are saying here. This is not a good reflection of the kinds of individuals defending Wikipedia's position. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by BettyCharette (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BettyCharette_30cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/BettyCharette">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><s>KEEP IT: I agree, it's NOT an argument, It's the ONLY argument that means anything. That you don't accept it is marvelously illogical from my perspective. Why would a separate list anywhere mean anything?(I can put one on the net if you would like. I'll just write a blog, eh. Would you accept that? Of course not. Who do you think is going to be wanting to compile the Advisory Committee list of a private school? As an experiment, why don't you choose any celebrity. Then, go ahead and copy a photo and put your name next to it saying that the celebrity endorses you. I'm certain you wouldn't do that. WHY. You know why.BettyCharette</s></p>
