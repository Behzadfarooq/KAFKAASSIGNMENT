<p><i>Inward singing is a form of singing that involves singing an unroken series of words and notes, even while inhaling</i>. Believed hoax.

<li>Please help me understand this. I have now confined the article to those facts directly referenceable in WP (like descriptions of vocal physiology) and facts from the only extant reference to inward singing (Tenacious D 2001).

<li>The technique may be known under another name.

<li>Answer for RHaworth: The method section of circular breathing article descibes "allowing the cheeks to deflate"... this would make articulation of words nearly impossible... it's a whole different technique. The parallel would be an example in which a fella inhaled through his trumpet or woodwind... never happens.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sugarboogy phalanx (<a href="../../../s/u/g/User_talk%7ESugarboogy_phalanx_5d4e.html" title="User talk:Sugarboogy phalanx">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sugarboogy_phalanx_69ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sugarboogy phalanx">contribs</a>) 01:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Already unanimously deleted once, it appears to be a joke that some editors took seriously. The fact that it was recreated after a deletion consensus (which ended in a unanimous position to delete) leads me to believe that someone wasn't aware of its deletion, or cocky enough to create a new one. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 02:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No... hey wait... I wasn't even aware of that previous thing... and that was a copyright deltion.. this is matters of fact.. Sugarboogy phalanx 02:31, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please Don't Delete</b> This is a toally diferent approach to a vocal innovation,.. not the mere entry of lyrics to the re-enactment.... I specificaly kept it serious, and didn't even mention that the technichnique effectly makes the vocalist "like a one-man-band"... which might actually be worth noting.

<li>Actually, it isn't. Like <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a>, I've actually used this technique when singing, in emergences, <i>long</i> before Jack Black thought up a comedy song about it. The problem with the concept isn't that it doesn't exist. It is that it hasn't been properly documented anywhere. We cannot have an article until this concept has been properly documented outside of Wikipedia <i>first</i>. The problem isn't silliness. It is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiability</a>. We cannot take Sugarboogy phalanx's, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a>'s, or my words that this technique exists. We don't accept personal testimony of Wikipedia editors. Readers must be able to verify it, and to verify it using multiple independent sources, that are more reliable than a comedy song. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:40, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having written that, I am now surprised to discover that there <i>are</i> sources on the subject of singing whilst inhaling. Some performers, such as <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_La_Barbara_b114.html" title="Joan La Barbara">Joan La Barbara</a>, are even <a href="http://www.roulette.org/events/2005_04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.roulette.org/events/2005_04.html" rel="nofollow">noted</a> for employing circular singing. See <a href="http://www.iar-80.com/page97.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iar-80.com/page97.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.larrykrantz.com/rdick.htm#csing" class="external text" title="http://www.larrykrantz.com/rdick.htm#csing" rel="nofollow">this</a>, for examples. These are what an encyclopaedia article should be based upon, not a comedy song. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Okay now c'mon!! If somebody wrote the first ever article about "Who's on First",.. but they wrote in the same veign in which the skit/bit was delivered, as if the team actually exists (I know it sounds obtuse, but hell, that's the device that made it so funny). Even if you had an extreme stick up yout butt about the sanctity of WP's credibility,.... you'd probably swarm round the article and correct it's overall theme to be (accurately) a description of comic/artistic work. I didn't write that article to test the boundaries of latency of WP, but to both inform AND amuse. It's amazes me that so many folks have put so much energy into "talking" about how this article should be DELETED,... but not one person has suggested the one most appropriate thing and the easiest most frequent thing done on WP... correcting the article so that one of TD's more notable tracks has an "appropriate" entry in WP... really, have you ever heard a better tirade of disgust than the spitting-mad burst (sections 1 or 2 in the bit, before and after the phrase "you sit in your tower nap..") that JB unleashes in the track..? Jack black didn't REALLY fire Kyle for naysaying his revolutionary invention, Spinal Tap isn't a real band, and "Who" wasn't REALLY on first... but would it have killed ya to play along for the sake of an infotaining article? Couldn't we have invented an appropriate header statement to frame such a thing (like "the following is a tongue-in cheek description in the comic veign of the Abbot and Costello performance piece"). Sugarboogy phalanx 14:53, 12 August 2006 (UTC) &gt;&gt;&gt;Addendum: Would not such a header statement also make possible a separate article about Santa Clause so that parents could show their kids without ruining it for them?? You DO know that the US Postal Service has never once returned a santa letter to sender as undeliverable... right? So am I to believe that WP now takes iteself MORE seriously than the US Postal... what a bummer if that's the case. Sugarboogy phalanx 15:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
