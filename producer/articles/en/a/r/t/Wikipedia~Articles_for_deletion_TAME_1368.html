<p>I'd like AfD to take a look at this. The topic of the article sounds alright when you read it. But when you Google it, you find <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Teachers+Association+for+Media+Education%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=EGF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Teachers+Association+for+Media+Education%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=EGF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">baically nothing</a>, and Google news finds absolutely nothing. It presumably exists/ed, but the article is a (sub-)stub without apparent potential for expansion. It would be virtually impossible to verify any future addition to the article based on what's on Google. On the other hand, I could just be looking in the wrong places. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:33, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an Irish organization. This may account in part for its paucity of web hits. Nevertheless, I can't find information that it's active; I found one mention of it some newsletter, but that's from Spring 2000. They did have a newsletter called Media Edge, but can't get any info on that either. One Martin Kieran appears to have been involved. He's co-written a couple of books. But there is no mention of TAME in the brief bio <a href="http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/Ecom/Library3.nsf/0/4F55A2E386CD43DD80256AE0003738B0?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/Ecom/Library3.nsf/0/4F55A2E386CD43DD80256AE0003738B0?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If the organizaton was functioning you'd think that there would be. The only marker that the organization IS active is that an editor created this article. Why now, if it's been defunct for years? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:47, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ireland actually has a fairly good World Wide Web presence. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:05, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b> - The article is far too brief to be of use and needs to be expanded. The comment was made that the organization may be defunct and this would indeed account for fewer webhits. Deleting an entry because it refers to a dead organization is inappropriate, especially one that by its title would suggest it had at one time been of some significance in its area. If we delete it because it is (effectively) dead, then we need to also consider deleting entries for the Whig party, Greek Mythology, etc.--<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">eleuthero</a> 18:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>They</i> are verifiable and expandable. How would you suggest expanding this article? I'd be pleased if you can, but it's too common for people to say "expand" on AfD and have no idea or intention how that might be done. That said, if people can find a means of expanding and verifying this, that's great. I dont see any justification for your claim that its title suggests that it may have been of significance: that is just speculation. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:34, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Eleuthero, you are missreading the comments. No one is suggesting that this article be deleted merely because the organisation is defunct. Some effort has been made (with references and all) to determine if this indeed is/was a notable organisation. The "delete" votes (wouldnt you agree) are warranted – unless you can give some evidence to the contrary. / <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 23:44, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">Eleuthero</a> is wholly ignoring the requirement that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">everything in Wikipedia be verifiable</a>. If the article cited sources, as its creator was <i>asked to do when xe created the article</i>, it would be verifiable. But, like so many articles, it cites no sources at all. Like other editors above, I've tried to <i>find</i> reliable sources. I haven't found any. I <i>cannot even find a source to verify the second half of the first sentence of the article</i>, where it describes what the purpose of this organization purportedly is. The only verifiable information about this organization is that some people say that they used to be members of it but that it doesn't exist now. There is <i>nothing else</i> documented about this organization that I have found. (In contrast, there are reams of published books about the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_party.html" title="Whig party">Whig party</a> and about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>.) <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">Eleuthero</a>, the <i>only</i> argument that you can make to counter this, and to change everyone else's mind (This is a discussion. Opinions are not set in stone.), is to demonstrate the existence of reliable sources that cover this subject. Arguing that we should keep stuff that we cannot verify, regardless, simply won't wash. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:05, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It would seem my comments got people to express themselves at least... haven't seen that long of a post on AfD in quite a while--<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">eleuthero</a> 19:13, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> assuming this is an actual orginzation&#160;:), a stub is in order, for future expansion
<ul>
<li>That is poor reasoning. You should make sure the information in the article is verifiable before deciding to keep it based on an assumption that has no basis. We don't hold onto things that we cannot verify. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per Uncle G and my original nomination concerns. Those who are arguing we should keep it <i>in case</i> it may be verifiable need to go and read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This requires us to remove any unverified to the talk page until it is verified. In this case, all but the first few words would have to go. Eleuthero has no grounds to suppose they may have been significant: that is <i>speculation</i> pure and simple. His/her comments about Greek mythology are complete redherrings. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
