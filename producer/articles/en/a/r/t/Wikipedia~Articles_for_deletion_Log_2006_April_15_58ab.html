<li><b>Comment</b>: this appears to meet the cardinal tests of verifiability and neutrality, and is about a theory of speech which appears to be several decades old, i.e. is not original research. Not being a phoneticist, I don't know whether the theory is sufficiently widely accepted to belong here, but the fact that it is apparently referenced in online teaching materials from all over the world implies it may be. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well let us discuss the notability of the webcomic. Considering that there are about a billion websites on the internet (could be more), the ranking of the webcomic seems notable enough (at least for me). Moreover, the article provides the reader with some useful information. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 16:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The 2,000,000 traffic ranking is for the whole of straydreamers.com. And it seriously isn't a notable ranking. <i>My personal homepage</i> is more than twice as popular as this webcomic, according to Alexa's figures, and if anyone wrote an article on that I'd submit it for deletion immediately. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is already incredibly lax towards webcomics, if any other website had this kind of rank and no real sources, there would absolutely be no keep votes. There are more popular myspace pages than this. I can think of a whole slew of single player quake and half-life levels which will have more google hits and more reviews than this site, and they'd obviously be deleted. Heck, I've just come back from a local family run restaurant, they probably had over 100 customers tonight, and that's going to be infintely more notable than this. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:13, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article says that "In his academic career as a psychologist and criminologist ... He is often cited for his work". We have to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> that this is true, and that it occurs in texts that are not online. I have placed a notability tag, so that these citations can be referenced. I think that this AfD should be stopped, and, if necessary, relisted, should the citations not be forthcoming. If they are, they article needs to be changed so that the academic work is the emphasis.

No, actually we don't -- though perhaps you have a different "we" in mind when you use that word.

<dd>This appears to be a new editor Justin sane58and I feel there should have been dialogue in the first instance (especially as the editor has said it is not a vanity article), at least to ask for verification of the claims. There is no dialogue on the article discussion page and no warning on the user talk page (until I put something there). I feel this is lacking in communication and etiquette, when the edit appears to have been made in good faith, even if lack of knowledge of guidelines, which one must expect from a new editor. I feel they deserve a better level of interaction with the existing community, rather than a slap in the face the first time they have a go at editing. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 11:32, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I will point out here that <a href="../../../a/s/c/Asceticism.html" title="Asceticism">asceticism</a> is a specific and well-defined concept with clear boundaries--<i>it only means one thing</i>. Self-denial can mean many different things. This is why it needs a disambiguation page and not a separate article with content that can only redundantly reproduce the content of some articles, and possibly exclude the content of others that might be related. We should note that <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=self-denial&amp;Submit2=Go" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=self-denial&amp;Submit2=Go" rel="nofollow">Encarta</a> and <a href="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=self-denial&amp;ct=&amp;searchSubmit.x=0&amp;searchSubmit.y=0" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/search?query=self-denial&amp;ct=&amp;searchSubmit.x=0&amp;searchSubmit.y=0" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> do not have separate articles on this subject, but rather use their equivalent of disambiguation to redirect to less nebulous topics. <a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> 02:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Making the article into a disambiguation page doesn't require deletion. You just change the text and slap a {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}} on it. I'm not convinced that it should be a disambiguation page, though; "self-denial" seems to have a <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> obvious meaning (denial of one's own interests), and what pages would it disambiguate? Regardless, if what you want to do is make it a disambiguation page, there's no need to take it through AfD. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Not encyclopedic. Actually it's just one section (#38) from a monograph of 51 sections, plus introduction and footnotes. The whole thing can be found here: <a href="http://www.omnisterra.com/botany/cp/pictures/nepenthe/dansermg/dans10.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.omnisterra.com/botany/cp/pictures/nepenthe/dansermg/dans10.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Apparently Danser, back in the 1920's, was the world authority in cataloguing and describing varieties of <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepenthes.html" title="Nepenthes">Nepenthes</a>. This particular page is a straight copy from here: <a href="http://www.omnisterra.com/botany/cp/pictures/nepenthe/dansermg/dans49.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.omnisterra.com/botany/cp/pictures/nepenthe/dansermg/dans49.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Why paste it here instead of just providing a link to it? Author has put a note on the page that it does not belong on wikisource, but there's no explanation why not. This is extremely technical, and I can't imagine it being of interest, or even comprehensible, to anyone other than a botanist. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:18, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It seems all the information from the monograph has been incorporated into the main article in one form or another and a link to that webpage is in the "External links" section. In answer to your question, the reason it does not belong on Wikisource is due to its publication in 1928 and the fact that fair use texts are not accepted. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENepGrower_ccf3.html" title="User:NepGrower">NepGrower</a> 07:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Delete</b> for lack of objective criteria for inclusion. "A subjective list"? What? Wikipedia's an encyclopedia; it doesn't have a personal opinion on who is sexually attractive. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The idea behind the list is legitimate. Objective criteria can be given, e.g. "explicitly described as a sex symbol in major media". However, the current list is unverifiable. Very few references, and none linked with names. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><span style="color:maroon">dbtfz</span></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><span style="color:slategray">talk</span></sup></a> 03:50, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> per dbtfz, and cut down significantly until referenced. Probably should be renamed to something like List of people who have been cited as sex symbols for NPOV purposes, something along the lines of <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 04:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> current version and <b>start over</b> using the format set out by Dbtfz - verifiable names only. I'm unconvinced this list is necessary as a category already exists. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> inherently POV - and even if referenced, does the fact that one (or even three) journalist once called someone a 'sex symbol' make them one? Or would the references show that someone was widely regarded as such? That's impossible to reference. Give some examples in the article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_symbols.html" title="Sex symbols">Sex symbols</a> and leave it at that. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 12:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> However, if we're going to excise this, we should do so with similar subjectivities such as <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">gay icon</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 19:41, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> There's nothing objectionable in the existence of this list; I might not find lists wieldy or especially useful, but that's not to say that others don't. If people don't like what a page says don't read it again; or edit it within reasonable bounds. But don't launch deletion campaigns because one's subjective opinion disputes that of another over who or what is sexually attractive. With respect to referencing, that belongs appropriately in the articles on the subjects themselves where necessary, and not in this (or indeed another) list.

<p>I think this may be a completely fictional person. None of his records, nor the book he is supposed to have written, are on amazon.com. The article says Tammy Wynette was his third wife, but he isn't mentioned on her Wikipedia page, which has a section for such things. None of the links on his page point to anything that actually mentions his name. I can't find any trace of this "greatest living country singer" anywhere. It should probably be a disambiguation page, since there ARE Ray Thomases who warrant a page (such as one of the founders of the Moody Blues). But that isn't this guy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unless someone knows of one besides the Moody Blues member there is only one. The senators don't exist. Nothing to DAB. A Google search for the name finds this article, a lot of entries for the musician, and a bunch of scattered others. There's a lawyer, a few academics, a bit actor in old westerns, a catcher who went 1-for-3 in one game for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938 (his total major league career), an aspiring artist, etc. Nobody who looks notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:31, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

Hitler's sexuality is, like most things surrounding Hitler, a subject of interest, and if we are able to discuss it objectively and with reference to reliable sources, I think we should. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 04:38, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even though this article needs work, it should be improved rather than being deleted. There has been a long standing interest and a number of inquiries into this aspect of Hitler's life by even mainstream historical biographers. The topic was even covered in my high school history classes in the late 60s. Normally I would want this type of thing covered in the main biography but that article is already rather long and has already spawned a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism_of_Adolf_Hitler_4199.html" title="Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler">Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler</a> due, in part to space considerations. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 06:20, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability of subject can hardly be questioned (pretty much every aspect of this man's life is likely to be notable). Article itself could do with touching up but is certainly not amongst the worst I've ever seen. Surprised to see that this page has been nominated on AfD 3 times in the past 6 weeks (presumably as an exercise in order to spur interested parties into working on the page?)- in terms of the subject matter at least, I don't see why this should be deleted, given the space constraints described above. <a href="../../../d/e/b/Hidden_Fuhrer%7E_Debating_the_Enigma_of_Hitler%27s_Sexuality_fcc2.html" title="Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality">Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality</a> should/could probably be merged into this page however. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:11, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Badgerpatrol nailed it. The only reason I relisted this article for a third time was because I'd hate to see some 15 year old kid writing a paper about Adolf Hitler, after all I'm sure there are millions of them out there, only to include in his paper that Adolf Hitler was indeed a homosexual. Even a merge with the main page would be more constructive than having it's own page.

<dd>If there had been reputable sources speculating on the drinking habits of the Pope - then yes, that would be a valid article. But there aren't. There is however a verifiable debate on the sexuality of Hitler (not just 'was he gay?' but was he impotent, and how might we understand his sexual psychology). The 'facts' may be POV, but the fact that there is a debate can be verified and reported.

<p>Casually written account of three movies, <i>Shark Attack</i>, <i>Shark Attack 2</i> and <i>Shark Attack 3: Megalodon</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> (but as new page without colon, see below). I removed the deletion tag as I got confused into thinking a bot had wrongly added it (a bot message appeared when I first saw the tag - sorry, that was not intended to be provocative. However, I remain puzzled as there are thousands of books that have their own page on Wikipedia, and I was not aware we had to argue about notability. If so, this seems an impossible state of affairs as its so subjective. I see many novels given pages, which I would regard as less notable than the ones I put up. There is of course no problem with database space in Wikipedia and so no reason to put all the books on one page. Putting all books on separate pages is preferable, I suggest, as it makes them respond to a search by anyone who does not know the author. It also allows them to be Wiki linked to. I have now put up a new page on Taking Care - an Alternative to Therapy. Again this was not meant to provoke, I was simply testing whether the deletion was caused by the colon in the title being interpretted as namespace. The new article contains more information. Will you accept my reasoning? If not, what is your reasoning for not using the advantage given by separated pages. While I accept that minor points of view are not to be given too much weight in Wiki, as against major points of view, books seem to be a different matter. By listing a book we are not 'plugging' it, so long as all books can be factually listed. By choosing to give only some books a page we are indeed plugging them, and on a very subjective and personal basis. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindosland_587d.html" title="User:Lindosland">Lindosland</a> 11:30, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok thats reasonable. You fixed it up, and it does seem like worthwhile information. So how bout a <b>merge</b> per below?

<li><b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Smail_f71e.html" title="David Smail">David Smail</a> (same goes for Taking Care - an Alternative to Therapy) <i>unless</i> Lindosland adds such a detailed discussion that the main <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Smail_f71e.html" title="David Smail">David Smail</a> article becomes too long; the search engine argument is not valid, you'll find the book even when it's just listed on the author's article. Notability is not the issue, but granularity: As long as the material on Smail is sparse enough to fit on a single article (say less than 50k), creating stubs for every book is spammy. Create a section for each book on the main Smail article. Once the individual sections become too long, branch out via the {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} template. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:04, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Article discusses an interesting attempt to target a niche market at the union of two growing phenomenon, namely the recent increase in attention and popularity of Apple computers and the rapid growth of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

</ul>
<p>Hetar, to refer to this article as "spamvertisement" is totally inappropriate and attaches a very unnecessary, emotion-driven label to the article. No one is being spammed. This isn't an email being sent out. What is the difference between this article and an article on "Third Day", a Christian Rock Band or an article for "Bibleman Jr.", a Christian kids's show, both of which are Wikipedia articles? "Ship Of Fools" is another example of an article about a niche religious topic. Swatjester - regarding your concern, in the short time between your initial comment and now (4 days) a Google search on "Latter-Day Mac" now garners 256 hits - a 61% increase in 4 days. At that rate, in four more days, this hits could be up over 400. Rsabey 13:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"De facto" is not in itself an encyclopedic concept, but merely an adjective/adverb that describes an unofficially recognized state of affairs. In no way does the article discuss anything other than etymology and language usage. That means it's a dictionary definition, although somewhat expanded. The article has no encyclopedic content and even if I'm sure plenty more usage notes can be added, it clearly doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a usage guide</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 10:24, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It contains etymology and examples of what it means in actual language usage. The bread and butter of any wiktionary entry. How does that make it more informative than a dicdef except that it has more examples and prose? And could we just for once have an AfD discussion about the merits of an article concept per se, not the de facto (!) presence of X number of similar articles?

<li>The presence of many similar entries is relevant because it tells us something about what the wikipedia consensus about such articles has been until now.

<li>I know they are opposite terms. What I meant to say was, if you look at both articles, each uses the other as a point of reference.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28fourth_nomination%29_7730.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (fourth nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a></span></h3>
<p>This article is in need of deletion because it violates several of Wikipedia's policies. For one, it is simply a list of random shock sites that various people have compiled; in effect, an advertisement for shock sites. Wikipedia is a repository for notable information, not an indiscriminate linkfarm. If any of the sites mentioned in the article are notable, then individual articles can be created for them, but most of them would not likely merit an article.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of censorship, while Wikipedia is <i>not</i> censored for the protection of minors, that does not mean that any form of content is acceptable anywhere on Wikipedia. In fact, links to shock sites is something <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">specifically mentioned against in <i>What Wikipedia is not</i></a>. Several users have pointed out that this only refers to placing links to shock sites in articles that are completely unrelated, and that placing links to shock sites in an article dedicated to them is naturally acceptable. However, that would mean that by creating an article dedicated to something that is normally prohibited, the prohibition can just be bypassed. An analogy would be a person disagreeing with Wikipedia's policy about having POV in articles, and creating an article on a subject and specifically noting that POV is allowed in the article as a loophole. Having a link to a specific shock site in the article for that site may fall into Wikipedia's category of appropriate usage, but creating an article that is an indiscriminate list of shock sites is really just a way to bypass Wikipedia's policy of inappropriate linkage.</p>
<p>It should be noted also that a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShock_sites_4911.html" title="Category:Shock sites">Category:Shock sites</a> already exists.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to bring to light the interests of those whom have taken both sides of this issue. Though I cannot speak completely objectively, I find that many those who are <b>for</b> the deletion of this article to have the interests of Wikipedia in mind, while those who <b>oppose</b> the deletion often seem concerned primarily with their own interests. Examples of this may be seen in the many of the votes cast during deletion debates.</p>
<p>The following are three votes submitted during previous deletion nominations for this article that share my sentiment:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Delete</i> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">User:Thesquire</a> 10:11, 14 January 2006 (UTC) <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28second_nom%29_6459.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (second nom)">{2nd nomination)</a></i></li>
<li><i>Delete</i> — The large majority of the sites listed on this page would not stand on their own merits of notability. This page appears to be essentially a blow-by-blow list of web site links. I see nothing notable about this page. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">User:RJHall</a> 19:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC) <i>(2nd nomination)</i></li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - This page is just a resource for those Internet trolls out there who want to scare/disgust other people with these shock sites. There is absolutely no need for this article to stay. I can't believe people are asking to keep this article; It's basically advertising vulgar photographs. I suppose anyone can make a shock site and use this article to "advertise" it. I strongly doubt anyone will come into the mishap of seeing these vulgar links if no one sees this page. I suppose the page that just defines a shock site is OK, but there is no need to post links to shock sites. People know what a shock site is, and they don't need to see an example. --User:Blackeye 12:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC) <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28third_nomination%29_e953.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (third nomination)">{3rd nomination)</a></i></li>
</ol>
<p>I would also like to mention that one of the most repeated reasons for the opposition of deletion has been about Wikipedia not being censored. There are two things wrong with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia, while not censored for the protection of minors, <i>does</i> have content guidlines, and, as I stated before, shock site links is something specifically mentioned against.</li>
<li>Completely disregarding censorship for a moment, the article is not suitable for Wikipedia. As was stated before, it is just an indiscriminate collection of links and violates policies related to spam and advertisement/promotion. If the article had delt with inoffensive material, it would have been deleted promptly, yet because it deals with shock sites, many have opposed its deletion even though it merits it for fear that by supporting its deletion they might be participating in "censorship".</li>
</ol>
<p>I will conclude by asking those who are considering casting a vote to think this matter through and to vote with Wikipedia taking precedence over their own interests. Thank you. - Conrad Devonshire 07:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>One other thing that I would like to mention that has merited this article's deletion is that most of the sites listed there made no attempt at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> (though this has been corrected since this nomination began). in other words, they had a discription listed beside their link of what content the link contained, but as most of the sites were said to contain just a single image, there was no way of determining whether or not the discriptions were accurate.</li>

<dd>And I have uncrossed it out as I feel it has valid points beyond asking for the links, especially the fact that there is votestacking requesting going on at other wikis. I will thank you <b>not</b> to cross out my comments, please, even if you feel you have addressed all of them. This "striking out comments by others" has been deprecated in AfD discussions for some time now. Please do not do it again to my, or others, comments, thank you.

<li><b>Keep</b> Shock sites are a part of the internet, and it is only fair to give them a dedicated page. The reasoning "each site wouldn't stand in a page of it's own on wikipedia" is stupid, as you could say that about an album, for example. Why would you list the tracks of an album when you could write a page for each song? You wouldn't. That is why most songs don't have a wikipedia entry, only more notable ones.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like whoever said above, just delete specific ones. If you delete the list you really should delete the individual entries for the important site as well or your whole purpose is defeated. --What does this do? 15:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe in not helping publicize websites that do more harm than good. I believe in protection for minors no matter what Wikipedia says, and my votes and edits will reflect that. Actions that protect minors also tend to protect some adults. When the downside of such actions is just fewer entertainment websites, such actions should generally be taken. If the entertainment is commonly labled as "shock" then it's a no-brainer, and it's even more of a no-brainer when you see what the sites in question actually are.</li>

<dd>That guidline does not mean that rules can be oughtright broken. That's ridiculous. It simply means that if one feels too constrained by the rules he should just try to do the best he knows how without memorizing them. - Conrad Devonshire 11:40, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My interpretation of the policy is that if a rule is getting in the way of making a better encyclopedia, ignore it. I feel that, if you believe it does break rules (which is disputed), then it does in fact fall in to this category. I would most likely argue the same for any article that has survived 3 AfD's that supposedly breaks rules. It shows the community wants it, and we shouldn't be deleting it because of a "rule" when so many people want it. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:37, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As per Dbiv and English Rose's comments, the page is more than a mere list of links (but could be combined into main <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_Site_180a.html" title="Shock Site">Shock Sites</a> article). Shock sites are an Internet phenomenon and should be recorded as such. Whilst I agree with the policy that pages in general shouldn't link to shock sites, links on this particular page are relevant to the content and context. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychomusicianuk_9bca.html" title="User:Psychomusicianuk">Psychomusicianuk</a> 11:19, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, it's an eternal list with no internal mechanism for limitation. Second, it is <i>inherently POV</i> to have "List of (notable/significant) shock sites": without any objective criteria for inclusion, the include/exclude is POV. Third, there is no internal organization to the list -- chronological, in terms of hits, in terms of amount of animation. Fourth, the topic is ephemeral, and sites wink in and out of existence, so, by the time a site is listed, the list is already out of date. Fifth, it's not explained in any context -- it's just a list. "List of shoes in my closet" is also a list, and my shoes are very important to my feet. Without anything internal to the article to give the items listed a function, there is no internal logic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:40, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong, speedy keep</b> But clean-up as per George. The argument about this page being specifically prohibited by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it <b>specifically</b> says <b>inappropriate</b> links to shock sites. I can't see anywhere else where they would be more appropriate. Also, the interpretation of the voting is highly biased. There were plenty of votes for deletion that were primarily selfish (e.g. "This site is disgusting; there is enough crap on the web and wikipedia is meant to break away from that.") and plenty of selfless keep votes. This article is <b>not</b> an advertisment, if anything it deters people from visiting these sites. For every troll that uses this page as a reference there are about 50 innocent users who now avoid visiting any of these sites. There is also fact that every time this article is nominated for deletion the number of keep votes heavily outnumber those for delete. As for none of these sites meriting an article, <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Measure_7d1a.html" title="Last Measure">Last Measure</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> all already have their own articles. So in conclusion I think that this article should be kept, but cleaned up. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoolish_Child_f1d0.html" title="User:Foolish Child">Foolish Child</a> (<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoolish_Child_56c0.html" title="User talk:Foolish Child">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Foolish_Child_860a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Foolish Child">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>First of all, most of the sites linked to on that page have just been random sites of no notablitiy, and therefore the links are inappropriate. And of 20+ sites listed there, only three have their own articles (and the article <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> is being considered for deletion). While the page may help people to know not to visit those sites, it would also provide a haven of sites for trolls to get their hands on and link people to. Most people who end up visiting those sites do so unintenionally due to a troll's meddling, correct? So knowing not to intenionally go to them would not do much good. Also, while I do admit that there was selfishness and selflessness on the parts of both the "keep" and "delete" voters (and showed an example of an unselfish "keep" vote in order to be balanced), the lack of consideration for Wikipedia has been far more apparent on the part of the "keep" voters than it has on the part of the "delete" voters. - Conrad Devonshire 12:31, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's quite a simple matter to block your browser from ever taking you to a site, so yes, it does cut down on the number of visitors to a site. One can visit this article and add all the sites contained to a "block-list". I know of several people who use this article in such a way. And besides, the vast majority of people ending up on these sites are due to entirely unmasked social engineering attempts in forums by users exploiting the new memebers' ignorance. And while I know that several of these sites are definately not notable, I did say this page required cleanup, which would involve deleting those.

<dd>I now think <b>Weak keep</b>. My previous voice was partially out of frustration with certain editors of this page; I had been trying to encourage improvement of this article but was basically thwarted repeatedly, but I now think I'm starting to make some progress. I wouldn't mind seeing this article merge with <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a> but I also don't mind it having its own article, there's a reason for it as an article, but the article needs severe cleanup. Many of the sites in the list aren't even worth mentioning, and there's a total lack of sources. However, I think if we stick to reasonably established sites, they may be sourceable eventually. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 04:12, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Shock sites are an important phenomenon. They are certainly notable, as they many represent some of the most vulgar material found anywhere--on the internet or otherwise. Deleting the list I do not think is in Wikipedia's spirit of exploration, as the sites actually should be studied and discussed. I would like to know why exactly they are created and how people can endure such poses.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable and not in violation of any Wikipedia principles. Specifically, WP:NOT mentions shock sites in the context of <i>(such as inappropriate links to shock sites)</i> therefore implying that <i>appropriate</i> links are allowable. One would be hard pressed to argue that a page entitled "List of shock sites" would be an inappropriate place for such links. Finally, there is the process issue. Even if the last nomination was "bungled" as argued above, the previous ones were not, nor has anyone really come through with new rationale for deletion since it survived the last ones.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I agree. If the nominator has reason to believe community beliefs have changed significantly since the last nomination, <i>then</i> it would not be very improper, in my opinion, to nominate the article for deletion again. However, a week is not long enough for the Wikipedia community to change radically. These nominations could be considered a form of harassment; a way of holding a <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Damocles_0f14.html" title="Sword of Damocles">sword of Damocles</a> over editors heads, always trying to keep them in fear of having their contributions deleted (i.e., threatening them).

<li><b>Keep</b> - The excessive comments by the nominator, challenging every keep comment, inappropriately striking out comments questioning his approach or methodology, hectoring participants to think of the encyclopedia (I would reply that I always do, in every AfD I participate in, and I find it personally affronting to be so hectored), etc, suggest the nominator has more personally at stake than may be prudent. That may not be good. But what is more important is that despite my personal distaste for this topic, it is encyclopedic. The growth of the list during the debate is a factor in favour of keeping it, in my view, as it demonstrates notability of the topic.

<li>I have not crossed out any comments because they "questioned my approach or methodology". The only comments that I have crossed out were a criticism of my introduction which I thought I addressed, and a false and inflamatory accusation made by a user who has vandalised my talk page, tried twice to remove the AfD tag from this article even after being warned for it, and used sockpuppets to try to register multiple votes in this and previous nominations among other things. As for my personally addressing many comments, I admit that I probably have gone overboard on that and will try to refrain from doing it so frequently from now on. I have nothing "personal" at stake in this debate, but I believe that articles like this are detremental to the quality of Wikipedia and that the only reason that this article has been kept for as long as it has is because the argument for its deletion has been made to seem all about censorship, even though there are other strong reasons for its deletion. - Conrad Devonshire 18:21, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Four nominations, and it is up for a vote AGAIN. I will say what I said at the last vote... Wikipedia is not something that bends to the will of the squeamish. Sure, you don't like shock sites, understandable. BUT that doesn't mean that shock sites don't exist. Nominator mentioned the Wikipedia policy, and it says delete shock sites immediately EXCEPT FOR PAGES WHICH DEAL WITH IT SPECIFICALLY. I believe that "List of shock sites" deal SPECIFICALLY with it, so obviously the nominator's "Wiki guideline" argument flies right out the window. Nominator also villifies anyone who votes for keep. Surely, this is abuse? "You vote delete FOR THE GOOD OF WIKIPEDIA. IF YOU VOTE KEEP YOU ARE TRASH WHO DOES NOTHING BUT CONTRIBUTE TO MORAL DECAY." This is an unacceptable attitude. I, and hopefully others, will not be pressured by this attitude of "My way or the highway". I will say this again.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks to me like Conrad has an agenda here. Note the extremely lengthy intro, and of course, his stupid idea that the people voting to keep are doing so only for moral decay. In a time when our crime rate is down, when same-sex marriage has REDUCED sexual promiscuity, and basically people are beginning to realize that true morals (don't kill, don't steal, don't harm others) are more important than stupid shit like laughing at shock sites, it's sad that people like Conrad just don't get it. Nice way to try to be a hero, Conrad - point at some minor "sin" and attach yourself to it to hide from your own personal problems (yes, I checked out your user page).

<li>Addressing User:69.248.236.62, I would appreciate it if you would not attack me simply because you disagree with my belefs and stop trying to infer my reasons for nominating this article for deletion. You claim that same-sex marriage has reduced sexual promiscuity based on the fact that same-sex couples have been shown to last longer on average than married couples, however this does not take into account the number of additional partners that the two members each have during their relationship. And also what morals are "true" and what morals are "stupid shit" are entirely your opinions. It is my belief that things that we tend to deem "smaller", such as pornography lead to the "greater" wrongs, such as murder, and therefore if the "smaller" wrongs were done away with, the greater wrongs would consequently disappear. As for my introduction, I wrote it to try to point out the problems that the article had and avoid making the nomination seem strictly about explicit content. Just because you disagree with it does not give you the right to remove it. - Conrad Devonshire 00:34, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speddy Delete</b> I cannot believe that this list of links to troll porn has been even been given serious consideration by Wikipedia, when other, better articles have been deleted. Here is a list to links that, not only will get Wikipedians fired from their respective places of employment, but in at least one case will infect the computer with dangerous code. This list of links has no scholarly merit, nor any redeeming value whatsoever. Tyr shadowblade 09:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> I don't want to stir up a hornet's nest here, but there is an element of stones and glass houses involved with this. Some may interpret your opening comments to be attacking past (and potential) 'Keep' voters- you do seem to imply that the preponderance are a) selfish, and b) do not have the encyclopaedia's best interests at heart. It would have been a better idea to simply state your opinion of the article, why YOU think it shouldn't be in the encyclopaedia, and particularly, <i>what has changed since the previous 'Keep' vote on the 9th of April?</i>. Speculating as to voter's intent or cherrypicking previous votes (for or against) is unnecessary. I have to say, it is not hard to detect POV in the wording of your nomination (rather than a frank assessment of the article's quality), which editors may pick up and comment upon. Of course however, the only points to be considered here are a) does the article conform to policy; b) has good process been followed in making the nomination. All else is irrelevant. Personal or <i>ad hominem</i> attacks of ANY form are always unacceptable. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The page is completely redundant. There is already an article on the subject, which if properly expanded in accordance with the content policies and associated guidelines <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> will more than adequately cover whichever few sites have the supportive literature necessary for encyclopedic treatment. There is also the category, to link to the small number of articles on those shocksites which have enough reliable source material to justify individual article pages. The page as it appeared before Brenneman's clean up was in a very poor state. Aside from the redundancy issue, there was an arbitrary division of the sites into "Major shock sites" and "Other shock sites"; this is an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">inherently non-neutral</a> construct, as is the idea that some of the entries are indeed "shocking" in the first place.
<p>The keep arguments are not convincing, to my mind. <b>"Useful" is not synonymous with "deserving an encyclopedia entry"</b>. My telephone directory is useful too; like this list, however, that does not mean it is appropriate for its contents to be listed in a Wikipedia entry. The test of encyclopediability has never changed: has the subject been sufficiently studied and reported on in multiple, independent, reliable publications? Are there books, theses, monographs, journal articles, government or repliable third-party reports, newspaper articles, and/or magazine articles that are focused on the subject? If these are plentiful and of very high quality, and the subject meets notability guidelines, then the acceptability of having a page on the subject is a given (for example, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>). At the other end, if there are a few stray sentences on the subject in a newspaper article that is devoted to something else, the subject probably does not deserve an dedicated entry, especially if there is no sound reason to adopt an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualist" class="extiw" title="m:eventualist">m:eventualist</a> view (the John Bambanek entry was a good example). And if the subject has <i>no source whatsoever</i> (in independent reputable publications), the question of including it in the encyclopedia in any form simply does not arise: we can't include it, whether as a statement in a broader article, an item on a list, or (obviously) a dedicated entry.</p>
<p>I suspect the items on this list fall in several different places on this spectrum. A small number may have source material; many, however, are likely entirely bereft of good sources. This posits a further difficulty for this list, in addition to the redundancy and non-neutral arguments I have already alluded to above. The best outcome IMHO would be to expand the main article on shock sites (<i>in accordance with</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). I would ask for a redirect, but the phrase "List of shock sites" isn't a good one. Hence, <b>delete</b>. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 07:35, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The difference between your telephone directory and a list of internet shock sites is that your telephone directory is only useful on a local level. If there was a wiki for the city of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington%2C_North_Carolina_2612.html" title="Burlington, North Carolina">Burlington, North Carolina</a>, an article listing public telephone numbers for Burlington, North Carolina might be appropriate after all.
<p>There are a number of cultural phenomena that have articles on wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_jamming.html" title="Culture jamming">Culture jamming</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a>, and virtually every article discussed in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">Internet meme</a>) that receive (compared to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>) little attention from mainstream publications and academia. I think this is a pretty poor measure of worthiness on wikipedia.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of shock sites is no less legitimate an article topic than a comprehensive list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_children_of_Orthodox_priests_d0d7.html" title="List of famous children of Orthodox priests">famous children of Orthodox clergy</a> (which I'd wager a list of shock sites is both more useful than and more encyclopediable than).

<li>I am the originator of this article. This article is my first full contribution to Wikipedia. So far I have only done minor fixes under an anonymous identity. I was much dismayed to see that the article has been tagged with an AfD flag only seconds after its completion and somewhat in disregard of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. But I guess this is now as good a forum as any to discuss it.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Originally, I started this article thinking that the subject is in the likeness of <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_Scheme_c253.html" title="Pyramid Scheme">Pyramid Scheme</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_accounting.html" title="Creative accounting">Creative accounting</a> and should be covered by Wikipedia, and having thought that I am ripe enough now to be capable of achieving the feat of contributing a full article. Apparently, this was not the case, as can be seen from some of the above statements made by fellow users.<br />
I agree with the comment made by Saberwyn that <i>a good, externally verifiable article could very well be written on this subject</i>. I can try and improve this article myself so it meets such standards, but the time might not be right for that just yet.</dd>
<dd>However, some of the claims presented here were unjustified, in my opinion. Minor ethical questions would have more properly been discussed on the talk page, and not immediately under an AfD. As for the article being original research, numerous sites discuss the matter thoroughly, as can be seen from a Google search.</dd>
<dd>In conclusion, I propose this article be made into a stub. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardak_6bd3.html" title="User:Bardak">Bardak</a> 22:04, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your contributions. I and the others who have voted to delete appreciate the time you took to make the article and your initiative in deciding to do it but we just disagree that such a topic even deserves an article at all. Personally my reasoning is that almost any system can be gamed and exploited. It should be obvious that the same is true about the air travel industry. To that end the topic itself simply doesn't merit an article, and the fact that the article ends up being basically a how-to guide kind of reinforces that for me.</dd>
<dd>If the article gets deleted please do not feel discouraged. You might want to consider finding other existing articles and seeing how much of this article fits into them. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 08:19, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>.This article should be kept as I feel this team is very important to the culture of ayrshire. i am sure that many others would agree that this is a very informative page, and has a lot of valid information to the team. I wholeheartidly agree with what Martin Le Roy has said in his previous statements.

<dd>Hey Shaun, your IP gets logged automagically (check the history tab above). It is quite standard for unsigned posts to be attributed to IPs if they have no user account.

<dd>Hold your horses son... I'd be ok with this getting chucked off cos of Usbob's fledgling notability. But Usbob is real, it is not a hoax let me be clear on that.

<dd>I'll be honest with you, due to the lack of good Ayrshire amature football coverage it's not looking good, is it. I think everything on the official website apart from the frontpage and news is true.

Romoin is an article about the main character of this comic, and Insta-nan is the (fictional) brand of coffee he prefers. Its claim to notability is that the comic has a small following on two internet forums (no Wikipedia articles for either) and that the author spammed it on a third.

Items such as regional or national level newspapers or magazines citing the webcomic's popularity would be your best bet for such a thing. As an internet based comic, it would also be a good idea to review the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guideline, and if you can provide sources showing that this comic can meet one or more of the listed criteria, I would say <b>keep and merge all into comic's main article</b>.

<li>Well, it's obviously notable enough that I came across it through Internet browsing. If you can find something on the Internet that easily through Google, then I'd say it's rather notable. Not to mention the fact that this, by all means, is NOT a vanity article, as - as I said, I have nothing at all to do with the creation of the comics - but you neglected to mention that in your rebuttal. Did you feel you didn't need to, or was it just your agenda? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesustrashcan_01da.html" title="User:Jesustrashcan">Jesustrashcan</a> 13:06, 17 April 2006
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying it is or it isn't a vanity article. I don't care who wrote the article, as in my personal view a well-sourced, externally verifiable article can be written by the creator or someone with a vested interest in the article's subject. I'm asking: "Can you provide sources such as reviews from newspapers, magazines, or major websites independant of the comic, demonstrating the notability of this article?" and/or "Has this comic been presented with an award from a major publisher or organisation?". Because a Google search for the title of the comic produces <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22The+Wonderful+World+Of+Romoin%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22The+Wonderful+World+Of+Romoin%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">twelve unique from 55 hits</a>, which implies a limited spread of the comic's notability across the internet, I am wondering if you can provide any published sources that attest to how popular the comic is, and therefore, if it passes the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guideline.
<ul>
<li>It states, in the very first line on the page, that it is not actually Wikipedia policy except in the cases of advertisement or using Wikipedia as a web directory. While it may not fit any of the criteria, it is neither an advertisement or an attempt at using Wikipedia as a web directory. Those aren't guidelines, they're merely suggestions. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesustrashcan_01da.html" title="User:Jesustrashcan">Jesustrashcan</a> 14:50, 17 April 2006</li>
<li>I'm not sure which section of the guideline you are starting at, but the first sentances I see state "<i>This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious), but it is the opinion of many Wikipedians that these criteria are fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered in Wikipedia in a way that complies with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, <b>which are formal policies</b>.</i>" This guideline is the black-and-white copy of the consensus arrived at concerning website inclusion a while ago, and although it is a guideline, my personal interpretation is that if an article on web-based content cannot be demonstrated to meet any of the points listed, then another reason, one which is not feasibly covered by the guideline, must be provided if the article is to be included. I have not said that the article is an advertisment, or an attempt to promote the comic or use weblinks on Wikipedia to promote increased readership in any way or form. I have said that the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> (official policy), through the use of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, third-party sources</a> (guideline detailing how the verifiability policy can be enacted). -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 05:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a seed, and I don't know if the creation author intends to add more content or not - his edit summary says "created preliminary article", which may indicate that things are not finished yet. The subject is legitimate, and there are plenty of articles that are literally one line stubs. As long as the article subject is legitimate and within WP's guidelines then I am always happy for a stub to be there, as it encourages others to expand it (whereas if the article didn't exist then there would be no chance of expansion unless someone went to the trouble of creating it). <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 19:07, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Defer</b> I've looked at the web site and the language is real and interesting, but a micro-stub like this article isn't useful. The article author in the talk page says more is coming.

<li>Hello, as the stub author I'd like to note number of downloads is not relevant, or even avaliability to download. The project is an interesting research project, with a limited userbase for the time being. The language has interesting articles published around it, and is quite unique, thus notable. <a href="../../../o/y/d/User%7EOyd11_e344.html" title="User:Oyd11">Oyd11</a> 14:54, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> no evidence of notability in substub of an article. Being a "unique" research project does not make it notable. Where are all these articles about it? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The articles are one link away from the link at the stub (<a href="http://www.grame.fr/Research/list.php?type=LANG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grame.fr/Research/list.php?type=LANG" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>), I'd be suprised if anyone with DSP or audio-programming background would concider this not-notable.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. (I'm the person who originally proposed this article for deletion.) Until we have have written a proper [[Wikipedia:Notability (programming langauges}guideline on programming languages]], being the subject of an article in an academic journal would be good enough for me. —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

<p>It seems to me that having an "official webpage" that's a MySpace profile is prima facie evidence of non-notability. I'm not an expert on musical groups, however, so I'm opening it up for discussion instead of using prod. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 18:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Only GHit for his supposedly released album is on DeviantArt (similar to myspace as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of non-notability). His alleged record company's website <a href="http://www.nettlejam.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nettlejam.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> is an empty shell from Lycos Web Hosting with a "coming soon" note. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, much of the article seems to me to be trollish and/or unverifiable. Nowhere is his notability asserted or is it shown that he has attracted any significant audience. However I'd steer clear of making such assumptions about MySpace, as it is extremely common for popular bands to have MySpace profiles, and it's not unthinkable that a band could have one without having a web site proper. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 18:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article - part of Sparky Deathcap's identity is his supposed recent death and ferral upbringing. He's had a significant following in the UK, but there have been no major releases yet. The nettlejam website is due to be finished in 2 weeks time. It's still under development.

<li><b>Slight merge</b> any significantly imprtant information into the Melbourne Tigers article. A straight <b>delete</b> would also be acceptable. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 12:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I created this article, so would obviously not want to see the entire season's worth of information deleted. I feel this also provides a valuable, historical insight from a sporting perspective, of the champion team from the NBL, in a year where the competition in Australia had some life breathed back into it.</li>
<li>Basketball is a growth sport in Australia, with one of the highest junior participation rates of any sport in the country. The Tiger's averaged only around 2,000 at their home games, which seems illogical considering the junior participation levels. With the talent level of the sport in the country, it will rise again as a premier sport, like in the early '90's where crowds of 15,000 at Melbourne Park were the norm. When it does, information such as this would be valuable, historical reference. I would be happy to see it posted on an appropriate sporting page, however, I do not believe all the information should be deleted. Happy to discuss this further. Cheers, Ryan --10:54 Apr 17, 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and rename to Melbourne Tigers 2005-06 given that it was a significant year. If not, *<b>Merge</b> with the Melbourne Tigers. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:19, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Happy to have it renamed to 'Melbourne Tigers 2005-06'. Don't think merge would be a good idea as it would create way too much information for a main page. Cheers, Ryan--21:15 18 April 2006</li>

<li>I would be happy to have this listed on wikibooks or ozhoopsalmanac.com or similair. I would still like to stress that this does provide a valuable, sporting historical reference, of the championship season of a club many regard as Australia's most internationally recognised sporting club. This is not a indiscrimate collection of any random club's recaps. It has historical significance within the sport of basketball, one of the most popular sports in the world along with soccer and should not be erased. Thanks. Cheers, Ryan.--7:34 19 April 2006

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable, vanity, spam, false information regarding article subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article subject, Dale M Houstman already had a Wikipedia article Voted for Deletion under the article title, Dale M. Houstman. The article subject is so non-notable, I cannot find any credible reference source besides a spam website in the External Links on the article's page. Also, there exists blantantly false information that alleges Dale M Houstman was the creator of the comic book character, "Hasty Pudding" in DC Adventure comics #489. Upon investigating this matter, I went to the DC comics index website at <a href="http://www.dcindexes.com/database/comic-details.php?comicid=1348" class="external free" title="http://www.dcindexes.com/database/comic-details.php?comicid=1348" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcindexes.com/database/comic-details.php?comicid=1348</a> and typed in the character, "Hasty Pudding" under <i>find a character</i> and I also typed in "Dale Houstman" under <i>find a creator</i> and no such character or creator exists! This is not only false and misleading information, but spamming and trolling and vandalism of Wikipedia as well.

<li><b>Comment</b> If the consensus for this article is "keep" then this article would need a serious amount of cleanup and wikifying. However I really do think this school lacks notability.

I highly doubt people outside of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_California_789d.html" title="Richmond, California">Richmond, California</a> has heard of St. David's.
