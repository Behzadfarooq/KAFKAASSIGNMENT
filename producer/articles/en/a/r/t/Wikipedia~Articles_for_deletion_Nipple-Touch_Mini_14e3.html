<p>I'm from Massachusetts and I play this game all the time, even out of the car/ by myself. It's actually quite fun and addicting. It's totally safe and immature, but appropriate, just like most car games. I play with the rule that if driving with girls, they are hands off unless they do it first, then it's fair game. I'm so glad somebody finally wrote about this, I hope it goes a long way. ---Transit.letum <b>Keep.</b> Down here in Texas, at least in my city, this game is fairly popular, and i introduce new people to the game all the time. It's a very friendly game, and it really brings the car together. It makes the car ride more enjoyable and light-hearted. To delete this entry and deny the masses access to this game would be a crime against humanity. ---Johnny</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b> I can't beleive I'm seeing this on Wikipedia! My friends and I used to play this all the time (in the suburbs of Chicago) I had no idea it was so wide spread. This game is great, it creates a great bond between the participants (or a release of sexual tension, depending on who you're playing with). Just because Google hasn't picked it up yet doesn't mean that people aren't playing it. ---Molly</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm terribly sorry that my contribution is the same as Transit and Dana, but there's not much else to contribute. It's a game, pure and simple. If you'd like a long and mostly made up essay on the deep philosophy and spirituality surrounding the game, then fine. I'll write one up and e-mail it too you. But honestly, it’s a game, and the only real reason you play car games is to alleviate some of the tediousness of driving, especially long distances. Nipple touch mini, in conjunction with Punch Buggy and Yellow car I win (and The Game where applicable) accomplishes this. There is a severe lack of car games, barring the few you played as a kid, such as the license plate game, or some billboard game, but I honestly feel as though I’ve outgrown those games. I need a game with competition, with several people fighting to get the nipple-touch. It's competitive. Try it, i can almost guarantee you'll love it. NTM is fairly new to my community, probably imported by some college kid on a road trip, but it's a blast. I am honestly astounded that it's so widespread that it's on Wikipedia, it made my day. Even if it is a little too obscure for your tastes, if you leave this up on Wiki, I’m positive that many more people will learn of NTM and fall in love with it's silly, immature charms. After all, isn't this how things grow? Something fun gets posted somewhere. People read it and implement it into their everyday lives, then tells friends. This could become huge, and I think it would be a crying shame to kill it now. After all, it's a lot bigger than either Molly or I thought. Don't stifle a car gaming revolution. ---Johnny</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My main concern with this article is verifiability. If this game is played by a small number of people, and no written records of it exist, we don't have any way of knowing that the article is correct, or finding errors. That kind of content isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia. There are a lot of places on the internet where you can tell people about something new and try to raise its popularity, but Wikipedia is trying very hard not to be a <i>promoter</i> so much as a <i>recorder</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It can be difficult for us to tell whether something like this is popular. I hadn't personally heard of it, and I couldn't find any google hits. If you can find internet references or other textual references (perhaps they were using a different name), or some other records of its popularity and existence, that would be a major help in keeping the article. Barring that, there may be more specialized internet sites which have more lenient inclusion requirements. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 06:24, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I found a Google hit, dated April 2004 <a href="http://www.sternfannetwork.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=47140" class="external text" title="http://www.sternfannetwork.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=47140" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since this clearly depends on a couple of fringe pop-culture foundations (the website appears to be related to Howard Stern, &amp; the link refers to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Surreal_Life_e30a.html" title="The Surreal Life">The Surreal Life</a>), on one hand I'm not surprised this exists under the radar; on the other hand, I am surprised that, because the stereotype Internet nerd tends to hyperfocus on trivia like this, there aren't a number of Google hits about this odd passtime. Has anyone watched TSL &amp; can verify that the "Nipple-Touch Mini" game was played on this particular episode? If so, then it's a definite keep; if not, then it's either a hoax or clearly not-notable. (And given the attention Wikipedia gets, I'm willing to bet money that in 6 months that this <i>will</i> be a real game unless this article is deleted.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>
<ul>
<li>The Google hit Llywrch found does not appear to be about this game; the "mini" referred to is not the Mini automobile, but <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verne_Troyer_dc2c.html" title="Verne Troyer">Verne Troyer</a>, the actor who plays "Mini Me" in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Powers_25dc.html" title="Austin Powers">Austin Powers</a> movies. <b>Delete</b> the game as unverifiable. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:00, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> You're right: the link above is incorrect (thanks for trying, Llywrch; and why didn't anyone else notice this?). It is <i>not</i>, however, unverifiable. There are several people that have verified its existance both above and below this comment. People from both inside the United States (I'm from New Hampshire) and in the United Kingdom have verified the reality this game or its variants. (Which is a good point; I'll add a section on mini-pinch as outlined by Kilo-Lima below.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Ah ha! Thank you, Llywrch. Even if we get over-ruled, you're really right about everything else. I hope this gets to at least have a chance... Or maybe keeping it afloat on a <a href="../../../b/j/a/BJAODN_feba.html" title="BJAODN">BJAODN</a> page would help it last long enough to be undeleted... --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYouremyjuliet_8c0a.html" title="User:Youremyjuliet">Dana</a> 01:42, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> oh give me a break, if you want a deletion give an actual reason. the amount of things on wikipedia is rediculous and this article, according to the couple people who have mentioned it, is relevant to them. Just because its not to you doesnt mean anything. so give a reason or dont write delete, all the people who voted to keep have valid reasons and don't cite "sock puppets" repeatedly. So I vote to keep it based on the fact that there now is a google hit, and that it is relevant to multiple users as well as their pools of friends. I also would like to state that the person who started this deletion probably did not read the article, because they think that the game is sexual, when it is stated differently in the article. In short you dont delete something just because you think its stupid, if its well written and relevant then let it slide. --Aaron 16:47, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Aaron, careful not to be too biting with your opinions. I recognize the importance of keeping Wikipedia clean, and I feel that people do an excellent job with it. I do understand the opinions of many of the people that wrote to delete this article. The first user to respond, Creidieki, did read the article and his comment showed me that I needed to be implicit in stating that the game is not sexual (which I did). This user even came back later to support his claims, which is admirable. I also understand why one would think so without playing the game. Since I published this article, I have read up on "sock puppets" and "vanity articles," and now regret asking my friend (transit.letum) to help in our cause. I realize that doing that is against the traditional wiki rules and I didn't mean do start that. Other than that, however, I am not a... sock-puppeteer? This article is real and many people unrelated to me have come to show it. Please take that into consideration, everyone.--<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYouremyjuliet_8c0a.html" title="User:Youremyjuliet">Dana</a> 18:34, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
