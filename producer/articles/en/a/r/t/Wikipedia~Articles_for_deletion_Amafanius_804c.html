<li><b>Keep</b>. Wow, a Roman writer. I'm so used to seeing minor characters in Codename:Kids Next Door and whatnot that this makes head spin. Let's keep a few Roman writers around with the Pokeman characters and such. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:22, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But wait a second, the Pokemon characters, a lot is known about them. Here, Amafanius is as much of a victim of history as anything--that's not our fault. And again, there is no sourcing that says we have any of his works, that I've read--so we have, essentially, a name. And that's just it--nothing we can attribute to the name, not his works, not his life characterized in other works, nothing. Mention in Cicero and Montaigne is not sufficient--this is a classic case of the difference between <i>use</i> and <i>mention</i>--in fact, Cicero draws this distinction clearly in that he mentions Amafanius, about whom we apparently know nothing, either biographically, or historically (if we do, it's not on the net, and hasn't been sourced outside of it), but again, Cicero doesn't want to do Amafanius' thing--according to the article itself, the mention in Cicero is to briefly say what Cicero does NOT want to do, and thus, he doesn't USE him. While he may have been someone, all we know about him is that he existed and Cicero and Montaigne mentioned him, Cicero not agreeing with him. That does not notability make. What this is essentially is list-pushing; it's trying to accompile a list when not all members of the list are notable. History is what makes Amafanius not notable, not us, and not him. That's the judgment you should make--that we can't control history, and also, we should avoid considerations that Roman philosophers are somehow more significant than Pokemon characters. Significance is not a test--verifiability, notability, these are tests, and what we have for history of Amafanius flunks both.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 07:14, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per failing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I see no need to invent new policy or guidelines when the existing ones work. Subject lacks multiple non-trivial articles by third parties, no evidence of lasting contribution to his field (and we have historical hindsight to show this), no awards, his works haven't been adopted for movies or as textbooks. I am amused that someone is impressed by the fact he's a Roman writer. Yeah, wow, but that's not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all classical authors, even those only mentioned by others. If Cicero considered him significant enough to censure him, and others have mentioned him while citing or discussing Cicero, I think that is enough. Everything in Smith's <i><a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Greek_and_Roman_Biography_and_Mythology_85cd.html" title="Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</a></i> should be included in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are historical reasons why <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicureans.html" title="Epicureans">Epicureans</a> don't get as many google hits as follows of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> (and not just that the bloggers aren't that into them this year) and that not as much is generally known about them. The fact that some ancient authors aren't as "notable" as others is an outcome of centuries of debate, with some thinkers being pushed forward and others left behind, all of which was heavily influenced by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. That doesn't mean they weren't influential to their contemporaries. A classical Roman scholar, whose name and a bit of bio has survived the centuries is notable, even if only for that. I don't believe that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> exists to dumb down wikipedia, but rather to prevent folks from writing about themselves, their neighbors or their brother's band. I essentially agree with <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a>'s statement to the effect that the best arguers write history, but I don't like the implications. Should we just start purging wikipedia of all women and non-western men before the 19th century right now? Substantially less is verifiable via our methods about many of them as well. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 13:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>WP:BIO also ensures that Wikipedia does not become a genealogical database of dead people. Historical figures that have been the subjects of multiple non-trivial published works independent of those figures themselves, i.e. that have been written about by historians, <i>satisfy</i> the WP:BIO criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Subject" is disengenous. Billy Graham's "My Life" has one subject, a principal subject. To be a subject here indicates mention, and not use, as I explained above, and that mention is brief, and not notable. In fact, I don't see anything on the page, nor was I able to find much, about what historians have written about him. Cicero and Montaigne have mentioned him, not used him. That doesn't make him notable. If George W. Bush mentions a yu-gi-oh price guide, does that fact weigh in determining its notability? No. Powerful people, notable philosophers, mentioning, as opposed to using, is a weaker notability standard.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I know of nothing in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that makes an exception for the "If he's ancient, he must be notable" argument. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:23, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I'd argue that perhaps there should be. There is one exception quoted at the top of the guideline ie. <i>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</i> I believe a lot of the editors are making the argument here that ancient scholars are an example of that more general exception. I think it's worth noting that most of the criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would not really apply to any <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presocratic.html" title="Presocratic">Presocratic</a> scholar. The only one that does is <i>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</i> "widely recognized" is what's at issue here and the discussion seems to me to be whether any ancient scholar other than the big names could fulfill that criterion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thales.html" title="Thales">Thales</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximenes_of_Miletus_5cda.html" title="Anaximenes of Miletus">Anaximenes</a> aren't exactly household names either -- and we don't even know when Thales lived, and Anaximander's thought survives only in fragments and references in other people's work . However if you stop by at the first lecture of any intro western philosophy class, you'll be hearing as much about them as it's possible to know. It's specialist knowledge and infinitely encyclopedic in my view. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify my point on reread, I'm not suggesting that <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicureans.html" title="Epicureans">Epicureans</a> were <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presocratic.html" title="Presocratic">Presocratic</a> (cause they weren't) but using the Presocratics as an example of ancient writers about which very little can ever be known. <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> just came to mind as a good example.

<dd>But if I want to know about Anaximander or Anaximedes, I can pick up Plato and role with it, or even Heidegger, for that matter. The Presocratics are all eminently notable, without question. Here we have a figure who was mentioned by just one guy, and seems to have little historical significance, like the Presocratics did--you know, the beginning of Western philosophy, all that important stuff. But the Presocratics wouldn't be notable without Socrates, and so forth. So the fact that Cicero names this guy, this isn't an antecedent of importance like the Presocratics. Hundred of other philosophers held these claims, and here's the big problem: it's his membership on a list that gets him onto Wikipedia to again be in a list. Two lists does not a notable bio subject make.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> To understand the mindset of the Republican circles in Rome one must understand their repugnance for the new ideas coming from Greece, ideas such as those popularised by Amafanius/Amafinius and <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabirius.html" title="Rabirius">Rabirius</a>. They really are the philosophical precursors of the bread and circuses tyrannies of the Caesers. Cicero even claims that Amafinius was the first to write in about Epicureanism in Latin (although he may have been wrong). He may not have appeared on the Simpsons but he is definately notable. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 14:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. The <i>fact</i> that we know so little about some ancient writers is the <i>result</i> of an historical debate that is, in itself, eminently notable. The very foundations of our way of thinking -- at work in even the way we frame our arguments right here, are the result of these ancient controveries.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> obviously.

Suppose someone reads Cicero and comes across this name, and wants to find who that is by looking him up on Wikipedia. The current article then would give all information that is available, and Wikipedia has done its duty. If, however, there's nothing at all on Amafanius on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia would simply appear a deficient resource. Even short articles can be important, and I don't think the article as it stand now is a stub. (And by the way, the nominator's argument about few google hits is absolutely out of place when applied to a Roman philosopher.) <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 16:09, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Was he notable? Cicero thought so; even if he only brought him up in order to refute and reject him, that means he must have thought he was worth refuting - you don't do that to people who are non-notable. Obviously it's unfortunate that his work didn't come down to us, but we can say what we do know - that at one point, his philosophy was engaged by one of the greatest orators of Rome.
