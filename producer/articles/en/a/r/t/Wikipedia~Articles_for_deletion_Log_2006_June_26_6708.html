<p>It's hard to imagine, I know, but Wikipedia is home to more non notable Webcomics than then entire internet combined. This one can be seen <a href="http://www.gotmorr.com/blastwave/" class="external text" title="http://www.gotmorr.com/blastwave/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, already up to its 17th strip! Their forums have less than <a href="http://gotmorr.com/forum/" class="external text" title="http://gotmorr.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">150 users</a> and the domain its hosted on has an Alexa rank of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=gotmorr.com%2F&amp;url=gotmorr.com%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=gotmorr.com%2F&amp;url=gotmorr.com%2F" rel="nofollow">450,000</a>. A prod tag was removed because the comic managed to achieve a rank of 9 on the buzzcomics topsite. This is pretty meaningless, as even tripe like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_InSONICnia_5a45.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/InSONICnia">InSONICnia</a> manages to get into their top 25 and with only <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Gone+With+The+Blastwave%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Gone+With+The+Blastwave%22" rel="nofollow">130 Google hits</a>, no decent sources, this is not a notable website. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The 3-month ranking of GWTB includes a hiatus, and shouldn't be trusted too much. Low activity on the forum doesn't mean anything, since they have a shoutbox they use instead. I think that if Wikipedia wants a "comprehensive and detailed guide to webcomics", then we should at least keep comics that are in the top 10 on the major webcomic ranking sites. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainman_16b7.html" title="User:Brainman">Brainman</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBrainman_38ab.html" title="User talk:Brainman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brainman_eecb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brainman">contribs</a>) 03:56, June 27, 2006.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As this is an encyclopedia, we require that articles be verified by reliable sources. That is, not somebody's shoutbox or a "major webcomic ranking site." This fails my junior high school research paper test -- since my junior high school English teacher would never let me write a research paper based on somebody's shoutbox or webcomics ranking site, then I definitely don't expect to write encyclopedia articles based on such trivial, unreliable sources, either. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 15:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was all <b>redirected</b> to <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> and protected. There is a significant majority here who support deletion, redirection and/or merging, and as there is already content on Armando in <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> I see that as sufficient consensus for the redirect. This article is so light on content of interest to those outside the blogosphere, with the only claims to outside recognition being a few radio appearances, that I see neither convincing reasons nor overwhelming majority opinion to keep this article against its subject's wishes.</p>
<p>The subject's objection to this article does not influence my decision - but I do suspect that, given the extreme lack of substance to this article, the generation of so much hot air (or impassioned discussion, if you prefer) towards getting this article kept on its own partly arises from a backlash against his agitation.</p>
<p>The continued existence of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Llor%C3%A9ns-Sar_8de9.html" title="Armando Lloréns-Sar">Armando Lloréns-Sar</a> as a redirect may be a privacy issue, however this AfD has not sufficiently addressed that issue to support a deletion of that redirect, so if deletion of that redirect is desired it should be taken to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">redirects for deletion</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Summary: [Full professional name] is the blogger Armando on <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> and as such was deemed notable by most editors. The issue revolved around privacy because WP seemingly was used to spread private information on Armando. After new evidence on public appearances was posted this became moot, and can be traced now from <s>various</s> 1 1/2 <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2144005/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2144005/" rel="nofollow">news articles</a>. So the question that remains for the community to find consensus on is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is Armando as a blogger notable?</li>
<li>Would it be better to merge or redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> and add the news story there?</li>
<li>Should this be deleted outright?</li>
</ol>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Google Test doesn't work well when dealing with bloggers and online personalities. In Armando's case, nearly all of the references are from other political blogs and after the first 5 pages, all of them seem to be from the Daily Kos website itself. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 14:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that Armando is given a lower billing at that conference panel than a law school student. In all 3 of his public appearances, he is there in his capacity as a blogger at Daily Kos. Now that he's no longer a blogger, are we really going to assert that a couple years of contributing at a blog and a couple panel appearances on radio are enough to establish notability? <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 15:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm questioning whether "a couple years of contributing at a blog and a couple panel appearances on radio" is enough to establish notability. It does not satisfy any of the criteria set out by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As I noted down below, Armando wasn't even mentioned in the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> article prior to this incident. The separate article on him was created solely for the purpose of further publicizing his identity and hurting him.

<li>OK, but even that article discusses him only in relation to the Daily Kos site/convention.

<li>The page was used to "out" the subject, connecting his real-life identity with his username on dKos. He had worked to keep his real-life identity separate from his blogging. Once the page was created, being Wikipedia it became highly visible. It was then picked up by NRO. Since he saw it as a threat to his livelihood, he quit blogging. Using a Wikipedia article to "out" someone and threaten their livelihood is <i>clearly</i> an attack.

<li>To begin with, no it is not. Anyone can edit an article. There is nothing that says that you <b>cannot</b> change an article back to a redirect. It is patently false to claim that it is "community consensus" that the article should not be a redirect. The majority opinion expressed was to delete the article; merge had substantial support.

<dd>That doesn't change the basic fact that the article is an attack article that was used to threaten the livelihood of the subject.

<ul>
<li>What part of BLP does this comply with? I see nothing to suggest in the guideline that this change makes sense, nor do I see anything that would allow anyone to be "blocked" due to a disagreement regarding your interpretation of a <i>guideline</i>, not a <i>policy</i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BLP reads, in part "Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. In such cases, editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. Material from primary sources should generally not be used (see above)." WP:BLP has wide consensus. If you fail to follow it, you will almost certainly be blocked. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 17:48, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is fine, and your change eliminates plenty that is relevant to his nobility. As noted elsewhere, the <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocking policy concerning this type of threat</a>, which is the part you should focus on, states that "[e]ditors who repeatedly insert critical material into the biography of a living person (or its talk page), or into a section about a living person in another article (or its talk page), may be blocked under the disruption provision of this policy if, in the opinion of the blocking admin, the material is unsourced, or incorrectly sourced, and may constitute defamation." Mentioning who Armando is in the title and sourcing the information about <i>National Review</i>, a major publication, outing him violates nothing, and I believe your threats are entirely without merit. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. Neither the print nor online versions of National Review has used his name - only their low-readership media blog.
<ul>
<li>Which is an extension of the magazine. Regardless, his full name is still in the WP entry, and has been used in association with the blog in numerous other places besides that, such as NPR. It's certainly not a secret, nor does it fall under any sort of "defamation." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:22, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2. I refer specifically to information designed to harm the individuals career - his employer, for instance. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant to this discussion. A Wikipedia entry that mentions a sourced situation which has been out in the open for weeks now has absolutely no danger in harming his career. Armando's use of his name in attachment to his appearances on the radio, for instance, did not supposedly harm his career. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:22, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not established that he used his full name on the radio on purpose, or gave it to the radio show in confidence and they released it without checking with him first. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3. Further, it would be disruption to consistantly violate the other sections of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> - specifically, the part about "primary sources" and that you can't use them. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We're not using any primary sources, either, so this point is moot. A primary source would be, as an example, the link to Armando's law firm that has his name, picture, and contact information without attribution to the fact that he's been outed. A secontdary source would be NRO mentioning which law firm he works at. The third party information is the NRO information, the NPR link, etc. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:22, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>But someone is missing: Armando. A favorite blogger and foreign policy wonk, Armando earned the privilege of posting on the front page of Daily Kos. But, before the festivities began in Las Vegas, National Review Online revealed this hero of the liberal blogosphere to be Armando Lloréns-Sar, a corporate lawyer in Puerto Rico who has represented Wal-Mart and Clorox. Even though this information is a matter of public record, and even though Lloréns-Sar's picture and affiliation are listed on his firm's website, his unmasking sent shockwaves through the Daily Kos community and led Lloréns-Sar to quit the site--and, according to bloggers here, cancel his appearance at the convention, lest his pastime create a conflict for his employers.</i> ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:44, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is even one example known where he (Armando himself) went on record as the same Armando who posted on Daily Kos? The sources cited so far seem to be from third parties who had access to the info and revealed it, possibly without realizing that it was supposed to be private. I.e. suppose I interview you on TV as "Silensor" and you give me your real name privately before the taping starts, but then somehow your real name shows up on the TV station's web site--have you gone on the record as being the same Silensor who edits Wikipedia?

<li><b>Delete</b>, really should speedy, the article barely asserts notability. It says the subject is best known for frequent posting to Daily Kos. Wikipedia is much more popular than Daily Kos, and yet frequently editing Wikipedia doesn't create notability. The article also deliberately includes personal info (the subject's full name), which he does not use in his Daily Kos posts and tried to keep private. It should certainly be omitted from the article on the same grounds under which we omit home addresses and phone numbers and sometimes birthdates even though that info could be found by similar stalking efforts. The situation with <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tron_%28hacker%29.html" title="Tron (hacker)">Tron</a> is not comparable since Tron is unfortunately no longer a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living person</a>, and also because Tron's real name was widely reported in the international press after his grisly and mysterious death. That's much different than someone trying to stay private but having someone slip up on a few obscure occasions. I basically see this article as an attack piece whose main purpose is to out an anonymous blogger who is generally non-notable but who is disliked by a certain crowd that opposes his point of view.

Any notability that he has as a blogger is under his blogging name, which is simply Armando. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not at all. His mother's maiden name and SS # aren't necessary or relevant for a typical biography. A person's real name and occupation are, as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> clearly states, as long as it's well-sourced by third party sources and doesn't create any issues, which this obviously does not. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you can say that it "obviously" does not create any issues. The person in question certainly thinks it does as do some other editors here. I personally don't think it does, but <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> states that "In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be 'do no harm.'" <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 21:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's obvious either. But <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> also says <i>If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it</i>. Clearly this sequence of events had a major impact on A's notability.

<dd>We can reasonably disagree on that, but it's mostly because I don't think this is a borderline case.

<dd>(Edit conflict) Verifiability is not a reason for including, merely a criterion. Independently of verifiability, the real name of a notable person is interesting and encyclopedic information, in the sense that the average person looking up Armando in an encyclopedia might expect to find it and might even be interested in this info. His social security number isn't similarly encyclopedic.

<p>Since it is clear that those who wish to do me harm are numerous at Wikipedia, I withdraw my request for deletion and ask for the following - IF I am so notable a blogger to merit such attention, then where is the discussion of my actual posts? I think the article should discuss what I consider my two most notable blogging issues - opposition to the Bush Administration's torture regime and to the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General, and my posts on the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Indeed, as the folks who hate me so have duly noted, my appearances on the radio were wholly related to these two areas of discussion. Since the evidence of my notoriety that supposedly merit this article, relate to my posts on those subjects, then in all fairness they should be part of the article.</p>
<p>In addition, the evidence of my notoriety includes the name Armando Llorens, NOT Armando Llorens-Sar, thus any references to my name should be to my "notable name" - not to my non-notable professional name. Further, my law firm was not mentioned in my "notable appearances and is clearly not of interest to any but those with harmful intnetions. It should be excluded. Similarly, the client list of my firm also was not mentioned in any "notable" appearances and thus that too should be excluded from the article.</p>
<p>Thus, the description of my non-notable personal life should be to my name - as stated in my notable appearances "Armando Llorens" and my private professional life should be described as "an attorney in large corporate law firm." It seems to me that those who perceive these facts as "notable" should have little to complain about with such descriptions. Those with axes to grind of course will object to excluding the names of my children and where they go to school. I hope Wikipedia has the good sense to not let it be the vehicle for vicious person who have harm and hate as their agendas.--Armandoatdailykos 06:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I must ask one further question. I just checked and saw that Duncan black, more famously known as Atrios, does not have a biography in Wikipedia. It boggles the mind to believe that I am more notable than Duncan Black. I must again wonder how Duncan Black, once porrayed as a character on the West Wing, is not sufficently notable for his own bio, but somehow I am. I also review the standard for notability and inclusion as a bio at Wikipedia and no one can seriously argue that I qualify. I must insist that the clear inappropriateness of having a separate bio for me is conclusive proof that those who are insisting that it exist are motivated by hatred and the thirst for revenge. I do not believe any honest person can believe that there should be a separate biography for me at all.</p>
<p>I am now more convinced than ever that to include a biography of me in Wikipedia would be a sheer act of malice, a violation of Wikipedia policy and strong evidence that Wikipedia itself jhas flown off the rails. I must imagine that others have been subject to these vicious uses of Wikipedia to cause harm. Frankly, any sincere believer in this project will have a hard time explaining how this can be justified. I urge those of you who believe in Wikipedia to consider the damage you do to the credibility of this project. I can say that in all sincerity it is my view that the sooner Wikipedia collapses from its complete lack of control, the better. This is simply disgraceful.--Armandoatdailykos 09:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does this mean that there is a separate biography of Duncan Black? It seems to me that it means that there is a link to an article about Atrios. My point was that the link to Duncan Black did not stand alone. Obviously, I am less notable than Duncan Black. The minimum would require that a redirect would be the most I would face. Moreover, Duncan Black is a fulltime blogger who now blogs for a living. So, not only is Duncan Black much more notable than me, he is a fulltime blogger who no longer is anonymous. I am a non-paid occasional blogger, unknown to most of the world, who does not even come close to meeting the notability requirements established by Wikipedia, who no longer posts on the front page of daily kos, who was the victim of a concerted vendetta that used as its primary weapon Wikipedia and its extremely lax controls.</p>
<p>I am not sure what your view is on these issues as you expressed none but I think that your information misses my point.--Armandoatdailykos 15:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main article <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> <i>is</i> a biographical sketch of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_B._Black_3048.html" title="Duncan B. Black">Duncan B. Black</a> (a redirect to the main article). Your initial claim "<i>Duncan black, more famously known as Atrios, does not have a biography in Wikipedia</i>" is incorrect. Your point in the comment directly above is unclear to me. The pattern in Atrios' biography article is exactly parallel to that of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_%28blogger%29.html" title="Armando (blogger)">Armando (blogger)</a> (main article) and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_Llor%C3%A9ns-Sar_8de9.html" title="Armando Lloréns-Sar">Armando Lloréns-Sar</a> (a redirect to it). I certainly agree with you that Dr. Black appears to be more well known than you—to illustrate, I was aware of him independently of his Wikipedia biography, whereas I have come to know of you through reading this deletion discussion—but I think the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_%28blogger%29.html" title="Armando (blogger)">Armando (blogger)</a> article makes a sufficient case for your notability. As to whether your name should be rendered as "Armando Lloréns-Sar" or "Armando Llorens", the issue seems completely pointless to me; and since you're here, I would much rather just ask <i>you</i> what your name is. You say it is the latter– good enough for me! One final thing: I would request you not to impute ulterior motives to any wikipedia editors here (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, etc.). Politically, I probably agree with you to a great degree (I have not yet found anything to disagree with in your columns on Daily Kos), and I have no reason to wish you any harm. I just don't see why stating your name, especially when it is well sourced, confirmed by you yourself, and especially when your livelihood does not depend on your anonymity, can constitute harm. If there are elements in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armando_%28blogger%29.html" title="Armando (blogger)">Armando (blogger)</a> article that are directly harming you or your livelihood, please point them out and I will remove them from the article, or an administrator will remove them by hiding a portion of the article's history such that it is no long publicly accessible. <strike>I will now make the changes regarding your name and place of employment that you requested above.</strike> (these changes have already been made by others.) –Dicty&#160;(<a href="../../../d/i/c/User_talk%7EDictyosiphonaceae_16a2.html" title="User talk:Dictyosiphonaceae">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dictyosiphonaceae_7639.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dictyosiphonaceae">C</a>) 17:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Armando's "professional name" has been used by Armando in his appearances associated with Daily Kos at NPR, among others. His law firm helps fill out a full biography of him, which is also cited in a variety of different mediums and doesn't rely on primary sources. The type of clients he has served helps fill out a full biography of him, also cited in different mediums and doesn't rely on primary sources. They're notable to be published all over the place, much of it is notable enough to be put out there by other third party places associated with Armando. I'm completely puzzled as to why this is an issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two points: first, there seems to be a mistake of fact in your comment. The cited NPR interview<a href="http://www.majorityreportradio.com/weblog/archives/001520.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.majorityreportradio.com/weblog/archives/001520.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> used the name "Armando Llorens", not "Armando Lloréns-Sar". The sole citation for the latter form of his name is the NRO blog posting (which was cited by Slate). In his comment above, Armando asked that the former be used in the article, and it's a reasonable request as the latter name is not as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from multiple <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Second, that some fact is notable in other media does not make it <i>ipso facto</i> notable for WP. What is notable in a gossip rag (to furnish an example) is not necessarily notable in an encyclopedia. Armando is a notable blogger, not a notable lawyer. Information about his blogging activities are directly relevant to what makes him notable, and should be included in his WP biography. The name of his law firm, the list of clients of said law firm, the brand of suit he prefers wearing while at work, the make and size of his shoes, and the length of his stride are examples of facts that are not directly relevant to what makes him notable, and should be left out. By the way, this discussion is off topic in an AfD nomination and should be moved to a relevant talk page. –Dicty&#160;(<a href="../../../d/i/c/User_talk%7EDictyosiphonaceae_16a2.html" title="User talk:Dictyosiphonaceae">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dictyosiphonaceae_7639.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dictyosiphonaceae">C</a>) 19:16, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no issue with going w/"Llorens" officially, that's not a problem, although I disagree that we HAVE to. And we also disagree on what "makes him notable." Armando has gained additional prominence due to his "outing," all of which is encompassed in what we know about him. Certainly, no one's arguing shoe size or how many grey hairs anyone's given him recently, simply what's known, verifiable, and adds to the entry. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here we go again. Now am I to believe that this person is not acting in bad faith. Only if I agree to assume the role of an idiot. Of what significance can it be to this person that my entry use "Armando Llorens" not "Armando Llorens-Sar"? Why the same reason I prefer "Armando Llorens" (the only named used, against my wishes and permission,even in the evidence presented for my supposed acquiescence to my "outing") because I want to distance the entry from my law firm and professional life. Why? Because it is more likely to do me harm if the "Llorens-Sar" is used. And that is exactly why this person wishes to use "Llorens-Sar."</p>
<p>Thus this user is wrong when he says NPR used "Llorens-Sar." This user is wrong when says "his law firm helps fill out a full biography of him." Not one of you would claim that my law firm is worthy of a Wikipedia entry. Why pretend this editor is acting in good faith?</p>
<p>This user is wrong when he say that different mediums mentioned my law firm PRIOR to the vindictive efforts to out me, commenced and forwarded right here at Wikipedia. This person is wrong when he says the names of my clients are relevant. He claims to be completely puzzled why there is objection to it. And I am asked to assume the good faith of the editors here? Ridiculous. Please do not insult my intelligence.</p>
<p>Does he want to describe the "type of clients" I represent? How about this descritpion? "Fortune 500 companies." Will that satisfy him? Of course it will not.</p>
<p>My position is clear. The integrity of Wikipedia is clearly going to be reflected by what is done here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems clear to me that this discussion is dominated by persons of bad faith. I expect the worst.--Armandoatdailykos 19:24, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe I claimed or intended to claim that NPR used "Llorens-Sar." If you inferred that, fine, but that's hardly the issue at this point. You accuse people of claiming different mediums presented this information prior to "the vindictive efforts to out" you, although I see no evidence of that. If "Fortune 500" clients is accurate, great, if we can grab a third party source on that (since we have editors who will object to using you as a primary source) we'll be glad to use it. I'm sorry you feel that "this editor" is not acting in good faith - on the contrary, I've largely put my reputation here on the line in defense of the straightforward policies we have here regarding biographies of living people, which I suggest you take a look over sometime. The integrity of Wikipedia is going to be reflected poorly if we bow to the demands of anyone who is upset by a neutral, well-sourced biography of themselves here, and I'm sorry you can't grasp that. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The standard for inclusion as a biography, at least as I understnad it the following:</p>
<p>"Like any encyclopedia, Wikipedia includes biographies of important historical figures and people involved in current events. Even though wiki is not paper, there are some criteria which may be considered for inclusion.</p>
<p>See also Wikipedia:Importance, which attempts to be a generic, all inclusive definition of criteria for inclusion. As well read the rules for biographies of living persons.</p>
<p>Important note: Please see criteria for speedy deletion for policy on speedy deletion. The fact that an article doesn't meet guidelines on this page, does not necessarily mean it qualifies for speedy deletion, as a mere claim of notability (even if contested) may avoid deletion under A7 (Unremarkable people or groups).</p>
<p>The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</li>
<li>Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature. (For candidates for office, see the ongiong discussion at Wikipedia:Candidates and elections.)</li>
<li>Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage</li>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (ie - Hollywood Walk of Fame)</li>
<li>Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles.</li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</li>
<li>An independent biography</li>
<li>Name recognition</li>
<li>Commercial endorsements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</li>
<li>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</li>
<li>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</li>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)"</li>
</ul>
<p>I simply do not qualify in any sense. I do not k now how anyone, acting in good faith can think I do. You claim to be upholding the ethics of Wikipedia by violating them. It is an absurdity. Indeed, this whole exercise is an absurdity. Any honest person must acknowledge that that the only reason a biography was written about me was because I debunked a Jason Leopold/Wayne Madsen acolyte who, in an act of malicious vindictiveness, wrote a biography about me which has been the subject of this ridiculous charade.</p>
<p>Well, the rest of you can pretend that this is a reasonable discussion in good faith. But let's be clear about this. You are fooling no one. You are bringing disrepute onto Wikipedia.--Armandoatdailykos 23:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In good faith, you should clearly understand that you meet the second to last one, and many would consider you to qualify under the final one, too. Considering that you meet the second to last, that's when you need to check up on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which is the guideline concerning biographies of living persons. Besides, what you've quoted above "is not intended to be an exclusionary list."</dd>
<dd>Perhaps someone originally created an article on you because of vindictiveness. I was personally surprised you DIDN'T have an article prior to your supposed "outing." Regardless of what the original intent was, the fact remains that the article now, except for the whitewashing, is a neutral, factual piece, and continues to be with the currently deleted information. It meets our standards. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is now argued that I qualify as notable under these two rubriks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</li>
</ul>
<p>What noteworthy event would that be? Why my outing by a malicious member of WIKIPEDIA and the revert war that ensued!! This is ridiculous. Thus, in order to make something worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia one need only write a malicious article about them, start a manufactured scandal and THEN make such person notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>That is your entire argument. That, you say, is the Wikipedia ethic. If it is, it is an indictment of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You say you are putting your reputation on the line in this dispute. I would say you have damaged your reputation here in this matter. And unless you are a simpleton, I can not believe you believe this article merits such attention and such damage for your reputation. You clearly have other motives. Others can play the fool for you. I will not. It is not credible.</p>
<p>You also say I am notable under this standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)"</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not been the subject of ANY non-trivial works. None. You argue that the National Review hit piece on me is not non-trivial? An article, by the way, about how I was fighting my outing in a WIKIPEDIA article! You argue that the TNR article about the reaction to my OUTING caused by a WIKIPEDIA article is non-trivial!</p>
<p>And you say you are upholding the Wikipedia ethic. For the sake of Wikipedia, I certainly hope not. Because it is about the most unethical course of action I can imagine. Malicious use of Wikipedia to make someone notable as the basis for a wikpedia article. Your ethics boggle the mind.--Armandoatdailykos 00:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTE, even if such articles were not non-trivial, the involve only one event, my outing at Wikipedia. So even if you, um, "ethic" is the Wikipedia ethic, I still do not meet the notable standard.</p>
<p>Now, what will your next straw man be?--Armandoatdailykos 00:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just because you fail to understand how we do things here is no reason to get snippy. Yes, <i>National Review</i> and <i>The New Republic</i> are non-trivial, it may be time to accept that. Furthermore, I've said my piece and you're being unnecessarily nasty, so I'm done spelling it out for you further. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Excuse me. I will get snippy when you and others like you continue to campaign to do me harm. As for how you do things here, I did not know you were appointed King of Wikipedia. Rather presumptuous of you don't you think? A number of people are saying that what you suggest is NOT how things are done here.</p>
<p>Finally, the non-trivial requirement is for the story themselves, not for the publication. Moreover, it is my view the the National Review website is very trivial in the main and that TNR is often trivial. Moreover, I doubt very much that either publication would consider the stories written about me or that mention me (the TNR article was NOT about me) as serious.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Objective, what is your NEXT red herring?--Armandoatdailykos 00:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, you have no answer for the one event not being sufficient for notability rule. I take it you concede that I am not covered there. so you are left with the argument that I am a"[p]erson achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" - the newsworthy event being my malicious outing by a Wikipedia article. That is the ethic you are left to defend.</p>
<p>Well done.--Armandoatdailykos 00:55, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has a single purpose — to decide whether an article on you should be included in WP or not. Your argument that you are not notable has been recorded and will be considered in the final evaluation. –Dicty&#160;(<a href="../../../d/i/c/User_talk%7EDictyosiphonaceae_16a2.html" title="User talk:Dictyosiphonaceae">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dictyosiphonaceae_7639.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dictyosiphonaceae">C</a>) 01:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>With due respect Dicty, I am not through presenting my argument, but this will be my final points. The guidelines for biographies of livin g persons states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p>"editors must take particular care with writing and editing biographies of living persons with these key areas in mind:</p>
<pre>
   * The article itself must be edited with a degree of sensitivity and strict adherence to our content policies,
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Biographies of living people should be written responsibly, conservatively, and in a neutral, encyclopedic tone. While a strategy of eventualism may apply to other subject areas, badly written biographies of living persons should be stubbed or deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article should document, in a non-partisan manner, what reliable third party sources have published about the subject and, in some circumstances, what the subject may have published about themselves. The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view."</p>
<p>I think the INCLUSION of a separate biography about me violates each of these guidelines. We must always start from the most significant fact - the original article about was undisputedly maicious, written by the banned dkosser and Leopold/Madsen acolyte jiggy flunknut. This is so because it was a verbatim copy of his diary at daily kos which led to his banning. He posted that diary because I debunked his article based on some delusional reporting by Madsen and Leopold. It was without question a malicious use of Wikipedia. This abuse of Wikipedia to harm me led to the NRO article, which led to my alleged notability. When considering whether this article should be deleted, the misuse of Wikipedia as the genesis of my alleged notability should be central to your decision. To allow this article is to invite similar malicious use of Wikipedia to do harm. In my opinion, absent strong reasons, there should be a strong presumption to delete.</p>
<p>The guideline further state:</p>
<p>"Presumption in favor of privacy</p>
<p>Biographies of living people must be written conservatively and with due regard to the subject's privacy."</p>
<p>This article is in clear contradiction to this policy.</p>
<p>. . . Non-public figures</p>
<p>Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. In such cases, editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. Material from primary sources should generally not be used (see above).</p>
<p>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper. It is not our job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives."</p>
<p>I repeat "it is not our job to be sensationalist, or to b e the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating clams about people's lives." This is EXACTLY what Wikipedia has been in this situation. To further harm me by including this article is to make a mockery of that stated policy.</p>
<p>The guidelines further state:</p>
<p>"Malicious editing</p>
<p>Editors should be on the lookout for the malicious creation or editing of biographies or biographical information. If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability."</p>
<p>That is exactly what happened here. This article rewards that behavior.</p>
<p>You have read my further arguments made previously.</p>
<p>I object to all articles about me that relate to my personal and professional life and include my real name.</p>
<p>I especially object to the inclusion of the name of my law firm, the name I use professionally, and the names of my clients.</p>
<p>I especially object to the article entry Armando Llorens-Sar.</p>
<p>As I am sure my objections will not be agreed to, I will formally withdraw my objection to the article titled Armando (Blogger) as it is written today. Any changes will of course be objected to by me.</p>
<p>I ask that all references to Armando Llorens-Sar be removed from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my views of this matter.</p>
<p>I now retire from the field.--Armandoatdailykos 01:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to reintrude but I must object to this requrst for comment posted by Jeff:</p>
<p>"* Armando (blogger) - is using the name of an "outed" blogger a violation of WP:BLP? As the blogger is aprogressive one at a leading site, and has had relevant information published clearly in multiple areas that fulfill the various requirements of WP:BLP's standards, specifically "If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it," even if some editors believe that including it - regardless of that prior quote - "does harm." The more input, the better, this is a policy issue, not a political one. --14:59, 1 July 2006 (UTC)"</p>

<li>One Piece is a <i>very</i> popular anime in Japan, and gaining popularity in America as well.

<li>Don't try to misunderstand comments. Two well-worded, dignified and objective POV's do make an NPOV. It is necessary to present different sides of an argument in order to establish nuetrality.

<li>The problem is that this is not an encyclopedic article, it is merely a person's opinion, an essay. Balancing it with an opposing essay would still not constitute an NPOV article, it would merely create a debate. There is a potential for an article on this issue, but it would have to be encyclopedic, i.e. here are the arguments of this school of thought, or this sect, or this notable philospoher or theologian. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Certainly Wikipedia is not a conventional hard-copy encyclopaedia. It is, nevertheless an encyclopaedia. It is for articles on factual knowledge. It is not a medium for debate or social discourse. The correct way forward, if this were the policy of a notable group would be to document the group and its policies, not to expound the argument itself. As it stands it is, as has been noted more than once already, simply a political essay.

<p>Failed Speedy delete. (This is not an 'All schools are notable versus school cruft' debate!) The problem that this 'article' produces is a common one. Obviously written by a student, it is barely literate. Now it could be kept on the basis that it might be cleaned up and expanded (though it is improbable that it will); OTOH do we want this sort of low grade stuff hanging around in a serious encyclopaedia? There are loads of these being produced so I think we need a proper discussion as to what to do. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:05, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note that White did actually play on a record (according to his article), though. I'm sure you have other examples you could cite, and I know that as you say you're not fond on using a "like" argument, but there is a difference, since Dufour never actually played on a Libs record, leaving before they were signed to Rough Trade. I can't see that an article of this length on him is in any way worthwhile, since he hasn't contributed to a notable recording - but I can see that people might possibly search for him, so I think he's worth a mention in the main Libs article and a <b>redirect</b> from his name. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 12:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The AMC article is much too long to put this in, nor duplicated after every car. This is a resource that adds to the content of the WP, I cannot believe how much stuff you folks are willing to delete becaues it does not fit somebody's idea of an article, can you quote chapter and verse that tables such as the Periodic Table have no place in the WP. I believe the guideline is that if there is useful information, and it can be edited to be correct that you should edit or change, rather than delete it. Otherwise it will have to be placed outside the WP on a private web page, which can disappear. What you advocate is NOT deletion, but putting somewhere else. You are free to do that, what you suggest is against the spirit of WP.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">Wiarthurhu</a> 14:07, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

It has no stated rationale for inclusion - for example, criteria on the notability of the books to be included, as determined by some reliable third party source. "Have to have them on your desk" is fine - as long as someone reliable has said that, and determined what those books are. Also, as it stands, the list lacks the ISBN and author information that might make it actually useful. But its arbitrary nature is the main problem IMO. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 20:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This one's a bit of an odd one - both <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinti.html" title="Sinti">Sinti</a> have their own articles, and there's nothing here which couldn't be in those articles. But lots of things link to this page. Merge would be the best option, but which to? And is it worth keeping this as a redirect afterwards since it's just as easy for the other articles to have "[[Roma]] and [[Sinti]]" as "[[Roma and Sinti]]"? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the issue is that "Gypsy" may be referring to either one. In the past, the article was a disambiguation, which I thought was strange, because the two were not ambiguous. I say, <b>delete</b> this, point any "Gypsy" references to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a> and include a note at the top, "Gypsy redirects here, for Sinti, see <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinti.html" title="Sinti">Sinti</a>. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 05:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Remark</b>. The given recommendations will not work as such. First, for "[[<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a>]]" above read "[[<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a>]]"; the page <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a> is a disambiguation page. There is an article <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy.html" title="Gypsy">Gypsy</a> which does not redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a>, so the proposed top note would not work. It would have made sense if <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy.html" title="Gypsy">Gypsy</a> was a redirect page to Roma and Sinti, but it is not. A meaningful top note is "Roma and Sinti redirects here", but then this page should become a redirect page, and not be deleted. Many articles already have two links "[[Roma people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]]". If I understand the situation, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">PC</a> "Roma and Sinti" instead of just "Roma" is used because some Sinti groups object to being classified as Roma, not because they aren't Roma people by any objective criterion. If "Roma and Sinti" is not more than PC speak for Roma people, then it should either be linked as [[Roma people|Roma and Sinti]], whereupon this page can be deleted, or be made into a redirect page to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a>. It is not a service to the reader if it is replaced by a pair of links. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:50, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I mean is, most of the links are like these: [[Roma and Sinti|Roma]], [[Roma and Sinti|Gypsy]]. When Gypsy or Roma is said in an article, the convention seems to have developed to link to Roma and Sinti because either or both may be meant. Let the disclaimer at the top of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a> say something like "This is the main article about people commonly known as "Gypsies", there's also <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinti.html" title="Sinti">Sinti</a>." Or something like it.

<p>I don't think Wikipedia is an appropriate place for articles on bus routes that aren't particularly notable or famous. There's also a risk that the information on such a page could change fairly quickly without contributors noticing. My main disagreement is that the Wikipedia page is really only rehashing the content of the <a href="http://www.131500.info/" class="external text" title="http://www.131500.info/" rel="nofollow">Sydney transport information</a> website. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">Netsnipe</a> 07:02, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the article is correct and this is a replacement for the Bondi Tram, it has been operating for 36 years. However, there is always a potential for bus routes to change.

<dd>Honestly how can so many people agree with this? The article is not a bus schedule and does not attempt to give a schedule. It is about the route itself. The article gives details that are not found in a bus schedule, summarises information in ways not found in a bus schedule, gives wikipedia-links to stops which you don't get from a bus schedule, and does not list arrival times. It is a Wikipedia article, not a bus schedule. —<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> 16:00, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Frequency is not an indicator of notability. If that were so, infrequently served stations on the Sunshine Coast and in the Hunter Valley would not have pages. Bus routes change in a way permanent corridors cannot. At best, this can go on the main <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Buses_d09e.html" title="Sydney Buses">Sydney Buses</a> page, as this is not like <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_upgrade_zone.html" title="Bus upgrade zone">bus upgrade zone</a>, which is a package of upgrades and not just a collection of unrelated routes, and not an article about the actual path of each route. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 04:12, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Volume is equally a non-factor in notability. Individual bus routes are not notable because they are not geographical features in the fashion of tram or train corridors. It makes no assertion of notability except for its frequency, which would equally make any number of stretches of road in metropolitan areas in Australia also worthy of a page if they had equivalent frequencies. It reads like a bus guide and not encyclopaedic information.

<p>The result of the debate was: We aren't yet at the point where headmasters automatically get articles as schools do, and with that out of the way, this man has never been committed of the crimes of which he is accused, so we have zero notable deeds by this man, and no claim by the keep side that he has ever done any. That makes this page little more than an attack - until a couple of days after creation the article contained the heading "Criminal History" where no such history exists. The use of possible sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry by the article's creator in this discussion gives even more cause for concern for the article's future if it was kept. The majority for deletion is present but not overwhelming, however if I was to close this as 'no consensus' it would be an abdication of responsibility. Per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, the level of care we <i>must</i> exercise with articles on living people leads me to close this as <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:56, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nice to see you make good use of the argumentative technique of selective interpretation. (Spot the fact I listed a number of offences not of <i>global</i> note, coupled with the use of the word "every"?) Some instances may merit mention in a global encyclopaedia, for reasons of notability. Most are of note to no-one but the immediate community affected. This case for instance. If it ever <i>becomes</i> important beyond its currently limited catchment, then there <i>may</i> be an argument for constucting an article in the context of the case. Currently it's just an attack on the individual based on regurgitating in a global medium what appears to be being published on a small local front. Currently I wouldn't say it compares well in stature against - say - <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Gagarin_8e95.html" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Given the sterling work done to the article, at first glance a fresh AfD would result in a keep consensus, but I'm concerned by the fact that no articles link to this one, and no articles in Wikipedia currently mention Cedric Gore (so no potential for it). That's very strange for someone who's supposedly notable. Nonetheless, I'm not going to second-guess the discussion here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

An example (just to illustrate) on being "general" - Bandlink (like several other <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Rights_Management_7b35.html" title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</a> systems) seems somewhat unpopular with music fans, as there seem to be people who bought CDs with Bandlink who cannot play them in their machines, and others claim it is in effect <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spyware.html" title="Spyware">spyware</a> (this was the only kind of non-press-release stuff I could find on the technology). If this was to be a balanced article, it might mention the record company stuff and how great Bandlink is (which it does now), and then mention the technical problems and its critical reception. Then it might seem balanced. If the article only mentions the upside with happy quotes, as if the product's a roaring success, then it might look like a puff-piece. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 22:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Shawn Fanning" is listed in Wiki' too and though he has many hackers like yourselves on his jock, he was hated by the record labels.</p>
<p>"Cedric Gore" has done work that has been embraced and widely used by the labels and according to his speech, his work appears on something like over 20 million CDs. So 50 negative comments out of 20MM CDs is freaking amazing. That ratio makes Microsoft products look like Satan's work.</p>
<p>No one here says anything substantively negative about the guy, but if you have something, why not add it as you see fit instead of just "deleting". After all, is that not the point of Wikipedia? I did in fact link to the "Slash Dot" article, which is where I am sure most of the negative issues you list come from anyway.</p>
<p>Further, I have looked at other Wiki articles to gain examples of "good content" and see nothing that much different from what I contributed. Speaking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning" rel="nofollow">Shawn Fanning</a>, no negative press is listed in his bio. What about <a href="http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=407" class="external text" title="http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=407" rel="nofollow">Lars Ulrich's diatribe</a>, and oh, I don't know, the entire music industry contempt for him and his work, yet nada is up there and you guys taint saying anything now. Yet, you want me to post just negative stuff about this guy to show the world just how bad black folks are. Why is that, hmmm?</p>
<p>Why just rush to delete stuff you don't know. I did not know about 99% of the stuff here until I saw it here, but when I try to include something about the black community you all just start slamming it.</p>
<p>DaveG12345, what exactly is the "Ghit" quota for approval?</p>
<p>I guess this is your collective way of "White Washing" the site. If an African American contributes to technology that the music industry embraces, his offering is meaningless because you can find a few fans who miscategorize just "one" of his products. That is just your arbitrary standard. How many musicians lost money, work, and music from Shawn's contributions and slammed him for what he was doing?</p>
<p>Oh... no Ghits to corroborate that? I see, if you got blonde hair and blue eyes but get shut down, you get a free ride on the site and a movie role.</p>
<p>I will withdraw the submission and look for a more fair opportunity elsewhere! --Francespeabody 08:14, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ghits is shorthand for "Google hits". When I nominated this article for deletion, I had no racial bias whatsoever or any agenda against Cedric Gore or his company. It was simply my belief that since this article isn't a <b>biography</b> of a noted person, then it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. You have to understand that a lot of people try to take advantage of Wikipedia's ranking on search engines to promote themselves and their own companies/products. At the end of the day this article isn't a <b>biography</b>. If it read like one, then I wouldn't have any objections. Sure not every article out there lives up to that standard, but I only have the time to call them as I see them go past me in the recent edits queue. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">Netsnipe</a> 09:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hey, hey, calm down Frances, I have clearly upset you big-time, and believe me, that wasn't the intention. I certainly hope you won't be going anywhere just yet. I gave my comments above in good faith, as I'm sure everyone on here does. I tried to determine the "notability" of the subject of the <i>article</i>, and I couldn't.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Just to start off with, let me say that <i>nothing</i> that gets written on these Articles-for-Deletion pages is aimed at the people writing the article OR the actual people that the article is about. When we say "delete, not notable", we are not saying "that person is nobody" or "the writer of this article is nobody" - we are saying that, as a Wikipedia article, there is not enough evidence out there to convince us, personally, that this person is "notable" enough to have a WP article. We don't just have a random guess. Honestly we don't. Well - <i>I</i> certainly don't. We are not just looking at the person, for example, and saying "no, they don't belong" without thinking any more about it. Seriously, you must believe me on that. We spend as much time as is reasonable assessing these things before we make a comment.</dd>
<dd>OK.</dd>
<dd>The main criteria used for deleting an article about a person is - as you see above - called <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If you follow that link it gives guidelines for the type of people that are "notable" enough to have Wikipedia (WP) articles. But there are other guidelines too, and at the end of the day, it is tricky, because we do have to weigh up lots of factors. What many of us do here as part of this process is a <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOG_53bf.html" title="WP:GOOG">WP:GOOG</a> test when we come across a new person article, to see how many Google hits we get (Ghits) for that person. If they don't get very many Ghits, we tend to suspect the person is not very "notable". But we will do other tests too - for example, I looked up the Bandlink product, and did some other tests too, that I can't exactly remember right now. But I did whatever I could.</dd>
<dd>OK, that's how I came up with my deletion part above. I could hardly find any Ghits about the person (50 is considered very low), or the product, and (as I said above), some of the comments were not positive.</dd>
<dd>Just a thing I want to point out before I carry on. The reason we have to do these tests and so on, is usually because the article doesn't already say <i>why</i> the person is notable. It often just says "this guy did x and y". There's often no evidence in the article. If we're not experts on the subject, we often have very little information to go on. That's why we do these Ghit tests and so on.</dd>
<dd>OK.</dd>
<dd>I think what has happened with my "Comment" to you above, is I was writing very quickly and shorthandedly, when I probably should have slowed down and thought for a minute, and explained myself better. So, sincere apologies for that.</dd>
<dd>I think the "only guy throwing up negative comments" about any products round here was me, by the way. I hope you can now appreciate that this wasn't meant to criticise the person researching the article in any way, nor the person this article is about.</dd>
<dd>I was just trying to say, that it's very common to see articles that describe a person in really positive terms, that make it sound like everything is great. You can always tell they are written by someone very enthusiastic about the subject of the article. Sometimes, it seems to be so great, that people suspect someone from the company, or related to that person, or even the person themselves, wrote the article. Now, let me point out, that wasn't what I thought about this article, but the people above who wrote "advertising" in their comments probably did. Don't take it as a criticism, it is just what people, reading the article for the first time in their lives, thought.</dd>
<dd>I just wanna say, there's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about the subject of the article. But the problem is, it has to be "toned down" for Wikipedia. It isn't like a forum or blog. And that was what I was trying to point out with my "Comment" above.</dd>
<dd>So, to illustrate what a "toned-down" article might look like, I gave an example (looking back, probably a bad example!) of the Bandlink DRM technology, and how an "enthusiastic" tone might say "the technology is great", whilst a negative tone would say "the technology is terrible", but the neutral tone (the Wikipedia tone) might say "the technology is very successful, lots of record labels are using it, they are all very happy about it, ALTHOUGH! some users have complained that the technology made their CDs unusable, or whatever".</dd>
<dd>I hope you see what I was trying to do. It was just meant as an example of "tone" that doesn't look like advertising, because no one would ever put that in their advert, right? That it sometimes didn't work...</dd>
<dd>And I was writing it quickly, and probably not giving it enough thought. But I wasn't dissing the product or the guy that invented it - I only found out about them both today, so what do I know about them? - I was just saying, it helps to CONVINCE people a lot more that an article isn't an advert, if it says the positive things <i>and</i> the negative things.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I hope you see how an article that presents both viewpoints comes across as a bit more "balanced" than the other two options. Obviously, to include any of that in YOUR article, you would need some sources to back it up in the first place, and like I said originally, I could hardly find any information on the internet, so I wished you good luck in searching (the internet is not the only place to get sources, of course, but it's all I have with me right now).</dd>
<dd>Finally, I am amazed you thought there was any racial motive behind what I wrote, and I hope you don't feel that way any longer. My user page is at the end of this post, and if you wanna talk to me about editing this article to maybe help it survive this AfD process, or about anything else to do with writing this article, just leave a message on my Talk page or the Talk page of the article itself (it is on my Watchlist).</dd>
<dd>And what I am going to do now, as a mark of good faith to you, for obviously upsetting you, is remove my "vote" from this discussion. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 11:01, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Look guys, do what you feel you must. I see this tendency time and again in American society. For instance no Black Senator or government official has ever even made his way on to a beloved postal stamp. Unless something of note has a white face or gains the blessings of the White propagation machine, it gets ignored.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What you folks fail to realize is that we are a Minority in this Country so if 100% of us were online and using Google, we would still represent 13% of the total traffic. That suggest that there would always be far less "Hit Based" traffic than any white counterpart. Now consider that by 1998 only 48% of blacks over 18 were online and though we are finally up to 60% that is only 8% of the total number of "Ghits". Do you routinely purchase African American themed publications? I doubt it, which is why the more obscure but noteworthy citizens of African descent, go largely unnoticed by anyone outside of the race. (Unless you can shake your ass, play sports, or sing, you don't stand a chance, but definitely not "thinkers".)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't say you are actively using race as a way to disqualify the article, but you are subjecting it to standards like a Google search. That is fine for Historical African American figures and references which have had some time to mature in discussion by African American contributors, but what of contemporary individuals. Guys who are doing things now? Who is the Black "Shawn Fanning"? (No one commented on his inclusion from my previous comment) Prominent Blacks do exist whether you know of them or not and that is my point for including this guy. How else are you going to find out?</dd>

<dd><b>Quick Story</b>:</dd>
<dd>I went to Disney Studios some years ago and shook the hand of the guy who was Lead-artist in drawing "Mickey Mouse" for modern use in film productions. He showed me 80 years of design iterations and what he was working on for modern interpretations, took his time to patiently pull out all manner of his work and design contributions, he was also African American. I had no idea of the guy, what he was doing, the significance of his work or anything. I sure as hell know of John Lasseter, and I feel better for knowing of him, but that guy, who's hand I shook, nobody knows! I have a million folks I would love to inform about him but no outlet. Oh, but wait what about Wikipedia? Well I tried that but if the admins don't know the guy personally forget about it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I honestly don't personally even know of any African American's who know of what Wikipedia is, let alone having contributed to it. I am sure many of us use it but I don't know of any personally contributing to it. Not when the fight for daily recognition is paramount. I don't think you guys are able to see things from this perspective but, the people of "note" in our community might not ever pop up on the radar in yours. Cedric Gore was featured in Black Enterprise magazine, which is like the "Black Forbes" to us, but I guarantee not one of you ever picked up a Black Enterprise magazine in your life.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not suggesting applying different or "Less" of a standard for African American contribution but at least try to investigate beyond traditional media or just "White" publications. I am not at odds with any of you for your opinions, I am asking you to expand your field of research. --Francespeabody 22:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have done some research and contributed to this article, and I believe that the subject is suitably notable for WP inclusion. Please check out the article and comment here with any thoughts. I've also responded to the author Francespeabody at their user page re the above comments, and given a few pointers on WP basics. This was a newbie's first article, probably created without much support, and to see it up for deletion I think was upsetting for them, hence some of the previous comments. But I hold nothing against them for that, it's hard work and bewildering starting out on here. I hope they choose to stay. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 06:09, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to either Javakitty Media or Bandlink. As it stands, the article is entirely about the software, rather than the person. Notability of Bandlink seems to be well-established by the references in the article, notability of Mr Gore as an individual, no. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 12:40, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First, thanks to those of you who have helped with the article and for offering feedback on how to improve the article. I do appreciate your support and hope it is enough to keep this alive. Ultimately, I will have to let the article run its course so it will either be given a chance or not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In either case, I thought the contribution was being rather impetuously marked for deletion so I responded to the best of my ability. Sorry if it seemed overly defensive but no one seemed to want to do anything beyond Google in terms of research to validate the work but instantly everyone started putting the guy down. I actually believe that the remark of my having "Screamed Racism" implied recently by "darkaudit" is counter-balanced by the general "Soft Bigotry" implicit in his and others attitude to rush to remove a contribution based on the rather limited premise of "if I don't know the guy, he can't be worth knowing". But to not ask the question "why haven't I heard of the guy? and then do something to uncover the answer seems anathema to the spirit of the website."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>DarkAudit directed his rather poignant remark toward me, "Time would be better spent fixing the entry, and less on screaming racism". This was a point I thought I exactly made earlier when I said; "No one here says anything substantively negative about the guy, but if you have something, why not add it as you see fit instead of just "deleting". After all, is that not the point of Wikipedia? 08:14, 27 June 2006".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wow, if my remarks are going to be ignored in this conversation, why should I expect my thoughts from the primary article to inform opinion. Time spent criticizing is definitely speedier than having to "read everything" but hey, I can forgive your transgression if you can forgive my early ineptitude with the "Wiki-System".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I still hope to be given a chance here, as well I hope to contribute future articles which may or may not be deemed relevant to all admins/editors, but as a contributor I should at least be given a chance to defend my position or to minimally, have my remarks "read" by those who would put me on the defense for my contributions in the first place.--Francespeabody 06:03, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some cleanup has taken place, and it's much better without the letter rant, but the vanity remains for me. The reader is told the film is "created by artist and filmmaker Nimrod Kamer", then told "Nimrod Kamer, creator of the video, is an Israeli filmmaker and journalist", and then "creator Nimnrod Kamer" gets a third full citation. Is this article about a notable film, or a vanity piece for the director? An introductory mention is fine, of course, but thereafter it's surely just "Kamer" or "the director", since we already know who he is and what he does, and this article purports to be about the film itself and its controversy? Just a GF observation. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 22:27, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Seriously, if you'd ask any student from any one of those schools I cited if their school was more "notable" than Cardinal Newman... 99 times out of 100 I'm sure you'd get a "no" answer. In the grand scheme of things none of these schools are exceptionally "notable".

I draw your attention to the discussion between myself and Netscott above. &lt;Re-edited after response below:&gt; <strike>I don't blame Yanksox for missing it (and I don't claim it was definitive) but some people round here think that the whole thread should be taken as read</strike>.

<dd>I do read the whole thread when an AfD comes my way, I've been here long enough to know that. I looked over the article and the statements that it made, and I do believe it should be kept (FYI, I do place my opinion for "Delete," on a few schools, check out the DRV on Arborview High School), it does make some claims of notability. Schools are put under a strange scope, and really that is the fact that it can make some sort of claim of being different from similar schools. About the WP:MUSIC comment, this AfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/SerialPod" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/SerialPod" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> stood up because of that argument. The situation involving schools is getting really ugly, but I admit there is a slight lecinancy in favor of schools, but this article does present certain information that makes in stand out from the rest of it's own class. That is really how people should judge the scope of notability, how does this subject make itself different from other similiar subjects? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 11:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, primarily because your logic is flawed: I added the link to the "advertising site" in an attempt to identify the fight. It obviously happened. The question, I would think, would be more about "importance". Please, let us elevate the conversation. You guys frequently put the contributor in the vise between having strictly non-commerical links and documenting assertions. I guess the more fundamental question is: does this article assert any important facts? You could argue that the only assertion is: "You can break your leg really bad if you kickbox and the other guy blocks with his knee". Oh, and the viral video thing. Compared to most articles about music songs and tracks, at least such a fact might possibly be of some use to the child in Africa that Jimbo keeps saying that the encyclopedia is for. -- 64.175.42.87 17:05, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Kickboxing Leg Break" gives 1,190 Google hits, but only 74 distinct ones. Still not a lot, and not enough to warrant inclusion. "Kickboxer Leg Break" gives 176 hits and 38 distinct ones. When checking the number of hits for a phrase (or any fixed combination of words), be certain to put " " around them. This will always heavily reduce the number of hits. Secondly, try to find if you have actually a large number of <b>distinct</b> Google hits. Often, Google will have many pages from the same source (like a forum or whatever), that will count a many hist but are in fact only one website. Thus, Kickboxing Leg Break gives 152,000 hits, "Kickboxing Leg Break" gives 1270 (this time, the number varies with every serach), and going to page 10 of the results gives me that there are only 74 distinct results. Anyway, enough Google lessons, the result is that it is not notable anyway you name it. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>First of all, I think that some of them (like Anabukinchan) are different, because they have a background (verifiable), a story beyond "it's funny". Secondly, many memes are discussed for deletion, and some are kept while others (most) are deleted. And if they always change their name and are hard to track down, how will you encyclopedize them? Give them a random name? Create fifty slightly different names and make them all redirects? And then, when people who come looking for it (and thus probably have seen the movie) find it here, all they read is what they knew all along, as their is nothing encyclopedic that can be said (or has been said at least) about this videoclip. Finally, another Google lesson: don't write elephant's-ass and then come here to show that it has only 400 hits. Written in your traditional way, it has <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=head+into+elephant%27s+ass&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=head+into+elephant%27s+ass&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">4,260,000 hits</a>, and written in the strict way, it has <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22head+into+elephant%27s+ass%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22head+into+elephant%27s+ass%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">no hits (none at all)</a>. I have no idea under what name that video is known (I don't know it and don't care for it), but obviously not that one. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This meme has no content ... YET. If it's left on here someone will come on who knows the story and fill in the background. That's the point of a stub is it not? Someone will come on wikipedia looking for info on the kickboxing clip and find it either by searching or in the list of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_memes.html" title="Internet memes">Internet memes</a>. Already people have added clues and content i.e. the link in the ring what kind of leg break it was, etc. As for the elephants head I was just following YOUR google search requirements. If I follow your NEW way of searching google then <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=kick+boxer+breaks+leg&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=kick+boxer+breaks+leg&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">kick boxer breaks leg</a> gets hundreds of thousands of google hits again. While like you said <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22head+into+elephant%27s+ass%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22head+into+elephant%27s+ass%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"head into elephant's ass"</a> gets <b>0</b> hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First of all, there is obviously some dispute as to whether or not his contributions are significant. That is why the AfD exists. In the absence of a substantial body of research, a <i>pilot study</i> posted on webMD's online journal isn't convincing. Secondly, writing a continuing medical education (CME) review, or presenting one in person, is not a significant contribution. Plenty of non-notable people do this. Similarly, answering a "call for papers" to present a short lecture at a conference does not make a person notable.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is AED arguing that a radically new approach, based on a recombinant DNA therapeutic, for treatment of Alzheimer's Disease is not important?

<li><b>Comment</b>: First of all, your question contains a false premise: that the approach is important because it is radically new. <b>Tobinick did NOT originate the idea that the suppression of cytokine activity may help Alzheimer's patients!</b> Secondly, there is no evidence to suggest that his approach has yet had a significant impact on the area of medicine and research concerned with treating Alzheimer's disease. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:X2npBzkcdYgJ:www.medscape.com/viewarticle/530141+Cytokine+Inhibition+for+Treatment+of+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:X2npBzkcdYgJ:www.medscape.com/viewarticle/530141+Cytokine+Inhibition+for+Treatment+of+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">One editorial</a> in a relatively insignificant on-line journal does not suffice.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Perhaps you just have not been aware of the facts. Follow-up articles have been published regarding Dr. Tobinick's new discovery for Alzheimer's in newspapers around the country, including Baltimore (Baltimore Sun), Washington state, and Florida, just to mention a few. And this does not even include Dr. Tobinick's other published work, which is being cited by an increasing number of researchers around the world. Just as an example, his original concept of using TNF-inhibition for treatment of avian influenza (see U.S. patent 6,419,934 from September 2000) is now supported by publications from the CDC in 2005 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and is cited in a new publication just this week <a href="http://thorax.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/extract/61/7/640" class="external autonumber" title="http://thorax.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/extract/61/7/640" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. He has also co-authored a well-received medical textbook <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0689/is_1_48/ai_53728235" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0689/is_1_48/ai_53728235" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> and <a href="http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/Fullpdf/feb99/br.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/Fullpdf/feb99/br.pdf" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> <a href="../../../t/n/f/User%7ETnfinfo_cad7.html" title="User:Tnfinfo">tnfinfo</a> 18:38 PDT, 01 July 2006 (UTC)<small>edited 23:10 PDT, 01 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) "Published" in newspapers is not the same as being published in academic journals. 2) As discussed earlier on this page, he has very little published work. 3) As discussed earlier on this page, having your study appear as a footnote in someone else's study doesn't make you notable. 4) You're manufacturing claims. Tobinick was not the first to conceptualize the role of inhibiting TNF in treating viruses, so its disingenuous to imply that others were following his work. I certainly don't see his TNF-inhibition work cited in the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" rel="nofollow">CDC publication</a>.

On another point, #4, AED is wrong also, Dr. Tobinick's TNF inhibition article on SARS specifically discusses avian influenza; this is verifiable by just reading the article, available at: <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/466529" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/466529" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Since AED has now given an incorrect opinion on so many points here, there seems little point to correct him further. (He was, however, right about patent 6419434; this was a typo, which should have been -934, and has been corrected). On another note, Dr. Tobinick has individually been awarded 17 U.S. patents (compare all faculty at Caltech combined, who were awarded 139 patents in 2003 <a href="http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12494.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12494.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) So now he's a notable <i>author</i> on the basis of his contributions to a medical textbook on skin surgery?! 2) You claimed that Tobinick was the first to conceptualize the role of inhibiting TNF in treating avian influenza (which is false), so I wrote: "I don't see any published research by him regarding TNF-inhibition for treatment of avian influenza". As I pointed out in my first post here, Tobinick's "article" is a letter to the editor! 3) Yep... CalTech faculty combined for 139 patents in a year and Tobinick has 17 in his life. Probably for good reason, there is no "patent criteria" on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, though. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 07:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

AED appears to be violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> by posting verifiably false statements. In addition, the Caltech press release <a href="http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12494.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12494.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> states that "Caltech ranks No. 2 among American universities in number of patents awarded in 2003" with 139 patents awarded to a total of 345 faculty members, equivalent to 0.4 patents per faculty member per year. To return to TNF inhibiton for influenza, a concept Dr. Tobinick originated, is AED arguing that this is of no importance, even after publications from the CDC <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no07/04-1313.htm" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and others <a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673602117727" class="external autonumber" title="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673602117727" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> <a href="http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/79/16/10147?view=long&amp;pmid=16051807" class="external autonumber" title="http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/79/16/10147?view=long&amp;pmid=16051807" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> have documented the important role which TNF plays in the <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome.html" title="Acute respiratory distress syndrome">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</a> which is responsible for the high mortality in H5N1 influenza <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avian_influenza.html" title="Avian influenza">avian influenza</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Many apologies for any confusion regarding the creation of those articles. I created them only yesterday as stubs (I do not yet know how to insert the 'this article is a stub...' bit at the bottom), which need to be expanded. All those roads are significant in Blackpool and the surrounding area, and all would be well-known to those who live here. They are all A or B roads (I have no intention of creating an article for every single road in Blackpool or anywhere else). Furthermore, all, but most particularly Whitegate Drive, have some historical importance for the town. Whitegate Drive, for example, is one of the oldest main roads in the area, and as is hinted at (but I admit not yet referenced), is or has been the location of a number of important buildings. I have not read any rule or policy that would call for its deletion; it needs improving, and I welcome any constructive criticism; I was not sure whether to create a single article on all the roads or geography of the town, and perhaps that would be a less controversial decision. My further intention was to eventually create a number of coherent and informative articles on all aspects of the town. If there is no article on White Hart Lane, or any other road with a major landmark on it, that does not mean the article on Bloomfield Road (which is significant for other reasons, though maybe not enough to warrant a whole article to itself should be deleted - I would argue that perhaps those other roads do deserve an article. It might appear that articles on Blackpool are being unfairly proliferated and expanded, but you can only write about what you know. It is for the inhabitants of other towns to write about their landmarks.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but modify. There is value is pointing out that certain events generated controversy. This can be done in a NPOV fashion. However, this article needs to focus on a factual recounting of the fact that there was controversy, not re-hashing the controversies themselves. For example - 1. Graham Poll mistakenly failed to send off a player after the 2nd Yellow. This generated the following controversy: a. Failure of the 4th referee to catch this {cite sources here}. 2. Ghana was awarded a penalty shot in injury time of the first half. This generated the following controversy: a. Video replays seemed to indicate misapplication of the rule. {cite sources here}. This would be a useful and informative article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and adapt to NPOV standards. Also, another good idea would be to describe the alleged controversies in chronological order, instead of just mentioning them in passing. A more formal approach, with information such as date, time, and location of the match, as well as venue names etc would definitely help. It could be like a "controversy recap" in that it could provide the contentious referee calls made throughout the 2006 WC. As NThurston said, there is value in mentioning the controversial plays and calls, but it must be done in an organized manner and in keeping with NPOV rules. --macgirl 16:29, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In response to Starghost and Gadig's thoughts - The purpose of this article is to document that there were mistakes made and there was a lot of whining about the officiating. This is very different from actually being a POV whining page. This page should not be a forum for people to say "my team got ripped." Rather, it is to say that many people felt that a particular mistake, event or action caused a lot of discussion among followers of the tournament. I know this is a very fine distinction, but it is a very important one. I fail to see how documenting facts surrounding an argument is POV, just because it involves documenting an argument. I agree that it still needs a significant rewrite, but maintain that it is notable and can be NPOV. --204.113.19.8 22:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, it is important to note that some of these actions have led to consequences that impact the event. Graham Poll was a likely candidate to referee the final, but that is now very unlikeley. Finally, it's not all about the refereeing. There have been other meaningful controvesies surrounding this event that need to be documented. --204.113.19.8 22:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are saying that the article is supposed to document mistakes. To afirm that there really were mistakes in most cases is POV (to say there's something fishy about the number of fouls between BRA and AUS is misleading, to mention a 3rd yellow card doesn't deserve it's own article). You say it's supposed to document the whining. Newsflash, fans get upset when their teams lose. You say other controversies are meaningful or notable. I disagree. I also think giving the spotlight to some of the controversies unintentionally validates them, therefore stepping over that fine distinction you mentioned. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 00:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, Looking at the date in the deletion log, and seeing the date of creation of the article, I see that this is in fact a <b>recreation</b> of already deleted content. An admin earlier speedy deleted the article as "patent nonsense". The article probably looked different then, but as non-admins cannot see deleted content, we have no way of looking at the history. Does this affect the debate? Was it improperly speedy deleted before? Can it be speedy deleted now as a recreation of deleted content? To answer the last question, this debate already means that speedy deletion because of recreation is not an option. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 07:51, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Continue to improve the article as far as NPOV and references are concerned. It's a very useful reference, especially in the context of the ongoing debate whether video should assist in refereeing football matches: Many of the controversies hinge on what the replays show. Also, historians and future Wikipedia users will want to consult the controversies pertaining to individual matches, or issues such as the Togo players threatening to strike over compensation, or their coach leaving the team in their support. The issue of hair-pulling during a goal at the England-Togo match is a good example of a controversy not resulting from a referee's decision, and one that a referee may well be expected to miss but which affected the score -- a fine addition to the historical record. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareklug_38c6.html" title="User:Mareklug">Mareklug</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareklug_3424.html" title="User talk:Mareklug"><sup><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></sup></a> 01:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> the useful stuff, and <b>Weak Delete</b> the rest. What "controversies" were there in previous FIFA World Cups that would warrant a separate page like this one? The unusual occurrence of 3 yellow cards to the same player is discussed elsewhere, and this is notable for not having occurred before. The T&amp;T pay dispute is also notable and is discussed elsewhere. These should be migrated elsewhere and merged with other similar text if possible. However, it's not unusual to have refereeing decisions that caused discussion among fans of the game. Such decisions would likely occur in every World Cup and whether they were dubious or controversial can be strongly POV. No good criteria exist for selecting dubious refereeing decisions. Such a list could be very long indeed! Most of the article lacks references. The article lacks the time the various refereeing "controversies" occured and thus it is more difficult to substantiate them. Finally, the user that created the page has made no other Wikipedia contributions. --<a href="../../../b/2E/d/User%7EB.d.mills_9f02.html" title="User:B.d.mills">B.d.mills</a> 08:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>I dont think you can cite original research in fairness, the content is from proven sources - specifically the FIFA website. Also it is a relation of actual events which IMO does not constitue research but observation. I thinkthe important question is does the content belong here or split up and distributed between the other FIFA 2006 articles as <i>criticism</i> (for example).
<dl>
<dd>I believe I can cite the lack of original research as the article fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in that the FIFA citations (with the exception of the citation of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepp_Blatter_fba6.html" title="Sepp Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> comments) explain the rules and some editors have taken it upon themselves to interpret the rules themselves based on what they saw (all of the "appears to show" analysis is original research). Perhaps I was a bit hasty in saying the whole thing should be scrapped, as the bit with Togo, and the comments by <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> officials could certainly be distributed appropriately (not criticisms, so much as news) elsewhere. However, these few bits of encyclopedic information do not excuse the completely POV OR nature of the article <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 12:30, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've spent a bit of time on the article today and have researched all of the sources and citations, and I'm going back to my original <b>Strong Delete</b> vote; I actually tried to justify what should and shouldn't be included by using stringent WP policy, but was unable to, given the nature of the sources and incidents. I had to interpret the sources and citations from WP policy, but it was <i>my</i> view of whether or not the sources were NPOV or not, as it's so subjective. Therefore, much of the editing I intended to do was compromised. One can see the talk page for a look at what I was trying to do in remaining NPOV and NOR. Certain incidents, however, such as the three yellows, the record number of cards, and the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepp_Blatter_fba6.html" title="Sepp Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> comments should be merged into the article where appropriate. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 16:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you are all saying here and perhaps the title 'controversy' is a little mis-;eading. I think the thought of the original and cirrent authors is to highlight areas of dispute / human error in the 2006 finals. If 2 newspapers take a different view over something (eg the final seconds penalty in the AUS / Italy game) then it is obviously a dispute of interest. THe article does provide an objective view of that (and all the other) incidents (or just about anyway) in my opinion. Taking the example of that penalty again I don't think saying one team find it a controversy and one team don't is fair. I watched the match and am impartial (supporting neither team plus England are unlikely to play either of them) and think that it was a contreversial decision - not because it was wrong but because of the outcome from it -&gt; Italy scored and won the match. Now even if it is a foul (I personally think not but that is your own opinion) the decision would be contreversial. It is the timing and the oucome that determines it!!! Some of these commments are response to bits and pieces up the page so I stuck it down here for ease. --<font>&#160;<a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166 (Errant Emote)</a><sup><font>&#160;&#160;<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">talk</a></font></sup></font> 14:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> this is an article about a character in some Russian jokes (clearly a very minor one, b/c I have never heard of him) who was apparently mentioned once by Putin. Characters in Russian jokes are not verifiable by google etc. The basic idea here is that this is profoundly NN, indiscriminate, and probably unencyclopedic.- <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 13:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never heard the phrase "Money Train Heist" on the show, and I've watched almost every episode of the series. There's been no episode entitled the "Money Train Heist". so who's going to search for that phrase, or even think of searching for a <i>story arc</i>? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:15, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

As per previous comments by Bwithh, I can find no evidence that any episode was ever called "Money Train Heist". The only formal link I could find between "Money Train Heist" and "The Shield" was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=money+train+heist+the+shield&amp;search_type=search_videos&amp;search=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=money+train+heist+the+shield&amp;search_type=search_videos&amp;search=Search" rel="nofollow">this music video on youtube</a>, which seems to involve music being set to footage from the show (I haven't watched it). Perhaps this has led to the attribution of the title? Without going further, I'm banking on there being no such official title related to this season of the show, so Merge &amp; Delete. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 01:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm Scottish and I agree with the first and third entry of this article. It surprisingly didn't come up on google but this doesn't mean its not true. moloch2012 21:14, 16 June 2006 (GMT)</p>
<p>It really does mean oral sex,its not an offensive term or anything, just slang. i was in America recently and my friends and i were saying it and people didnt know what it ment, i just wanted to tell people.. thats all. I dont mind if you feel you have to delete it but its a genuine phrase i thought people would like to know. Its used in everyday language in Scotland. Mullerdrooler 21:20, 16 June 2006 (GMT)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for your input. Perhaps if you could substantiate the claim that this is a widespread term in Scotland, I would agree with you. However, I nominated this article for deletion not necessarily because it is non-notable, but because <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Also, there is aversion towards <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">neologisms</a> among editors.

<p><b>Comment</b> I think if you want to save this article, Muller, you need to add more than a definition, say, when the phrase was first coined or something, how vulgar it is in Scotland, what other slang related to it, famous people who have said it etc. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 22:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article raises a general issue - what should be our policy on standard IC datasheets? As it stands, the text (and, previously, the illustrations) were copied from <a href="http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/cmos.htm#4026" class="external text" title="http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/cmos.htm#4026" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or possibly from another source, so that gives us grounds for deletion per <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. However, the text could easily be re-written and the images re-drawn to avoid the copyright issue. The question is therefore: do we want to include this sort of datasheet? There are three such articles, including this one, linked from <a href="../../../4/0/0/4000_series.html" title="4000 series">4000 series</a>, and one linked from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits.html" title="List of 7400 series integrated circuits">List of 7400 series integrated circuits</a>. Do we want to keep them, or not? My opinion is currently <b>Neutral</b>. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 20:44, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The main article for these circuits - <a href="../../../4/0/0/4000_series.html" title="4000 series">4000 series</a> has a very long list of these circuits and merging them all into there would make one huge and unreadable article. Even though there aren't many with blue links there now, doesn't mean that they won't appear. The other two alternatives are two have external links or to exclude all the info on the specific circuits. I don't like the external links idea - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links</a>, and excluding material which definitely is useful seems like a waste. I am inclined to say keep it here, but I think that would still violate the notability criteria, maybe this would make a case for <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring all rules</a>.

<p>This page can go one of two ways: either it will devolve further into the nebulous, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">ORish</a> "stories that bear some resemblance to 9/11," for which there is no standard of similarity and no quantifiable metric for inclusion or exclusion, or it can go the other way, and strictly be scenarios in published works of fiction that are explicitly retelling the story of 9/11. The latter would be fine with me, except <b>none</b> of the items currently in the list do that. (One example occurs before the attacks, another afterwards, and the rest have nothing to do with September 11.)

<p>Serius Jones is gaining notoriety in the hip-hop and rap battle underground. As stated in the article, he defeated the former champion Jin the Emcee, but what has not been mentioned is that he won $10,000 dollars by defeating Jin and that Jin the Emcee is on the Ruff Ryder label. Defeating an MC who was a rap battle champion, is a rapper on a major label and winning $10,000 dollars by defeating said rapper adds weight to the importance of keeping this article. <b>Keep</b> this page. --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7EToddd_c954.html" title="User:Toddd">Toddd</a> 06:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC</p>

It's more major than that tool box comp you're citing, for sure, but I don't see the relevance of your follow-up questions anyway (poker? this is music, isn't it? "every magazine best newcomer award winner" might be more like it). I was assuming anything MTV put out is probably trivial, but would have liked some confirmation.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a “bad faith” deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as “verifiable” websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a “bad faith” deletion attempt.

<li><b>COMMENT</b>-Well I will just reiterate some points that I have stated already.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Mainstream celebrities such as <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verne_Langdon_1376.html" title="Verne Langdon">Verne Langdon</a> have endorsed it. To say that it is not notable is entirely ignoring that fact. It has also been unofficially endorsed by pro wrestler Chris Hamrick. Wrestling superstars such as Shane Douglas, Jerry Lynn, Chris Hamrick, and Missy Hyatt have done exclusive interviews for it. Adult film stars Kristi Myst and Lizzy Borden also read the retrospective. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verne_Langdon_1376.html" title="Verne Langdon">Verne Langdon</a> has unofficially endorsed it, and Kevin Kleinrock (the former VICE PRESIDENT of XPW) has officially endorsed it.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;It is PRINTED on sites which Wikipedia considers "Verifiable." The information printed in the retrospective comes from people who were in XPW. None of that specific information is published here; All it is saying is that the information is published in the RETROSPECTIVE. So the argument that there should be a "Verifiability" tag on the article is not a fair assessment.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;ObsessedWithWrestling.com - one of the web sites that the articles are printed on - was featured in Harley Race's autobiography and has also gotten other coverage. At <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it says <b>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</b> The OWW site is definitely "well known" and has received mainstream coverage as mentioned above. So I would think it meets that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline. If OWW is not notable, then over 100 wrestler profiles should be edited on Wikipedia because htey include OWW.com as a reference.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 17:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that it clearly refers to something that does not exist. It is an article about someone intending to write and publish a book rather than a page about a published book. An article about someone intending to write a book seems like vanity to me. Minus the book, this is an article about a collection of short pieces written for the web and posted on a few websites. That would seem to fail the test 168.127.0.51 18:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>* While I do not have a formal vote on this AfD (I have a mediation going on with the author on another article, so my neutrality is compromised), would it have been better if the Wiki entry was written by someone OTHER then the person who is writing the series of articles? In other words, if we remove the "endorsements" (Sorry, JB, Ron Jeremy endorsing it (paid or unpaid) shouldn't be notable), and focus on what the series of articles ALREADY PRINTED covers (namely, XPW's history), Reference that it's a series of ongoing articles and try to remain NPOV, I think it would be ok. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 19:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ronnie did it unpaid. I don't see why you would question that, as it could be considered a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I am fine with having somebody else writing it. Although I don't see how the endorsement of such a high-level mainstream celebrity shouldn't be mentioned. I mean, he is THE RON JEREMY. Not to lose focus, but how can one argue that <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Storm_c3c4.html" title="Lance Storm">Lance Storm</a>'s criticism of DVDVR should be included in that article and yet argue that Ron Jeremy shouldn't be included here? With all due respect, that argument holds <b>zero</b> ground because without the mention of who has participated in/endorsed it, OF COURSE it's not notable, because its just a creation by a fan. It's the fact that such notable people have attached their name to it that makes it notable. Also, you are a DVDVR board poster and you wrote the entry for that site that should be kept mind when you suggested that someone other than myself write the entry.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 19:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I feel it first fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Above quoted is A3 of this: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." However, the last line too of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is quite explicit - "Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article." That's the failure, IMO. The article cannot assume passing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> because the entire site is considered notable (as OWW may well be in terms of, e.g., its wrestling profile data).</li>

<dl>
<dd>This suggests other criteria must be weighed up. I personally think this article fails <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy implicitly, since the author is writing the article themselves. It obviously fails notability criteria for books, since the book artefact does not yet exist. For that reason, it also fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> policy, since the text of the article clearly refers to a future publication, and asks the reader implicitly to trust that it will be notable when it arrives. Finally, it seems to go against <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html#Does_lack_of_fame_make_a_vanity_article.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">the vanity guideline</a> that states:
<blockquote>
<p>Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional. The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>"Overtly promotional" would appear to me to be the tone of those celebrity endorsements. Celebrities endorse many products that would not fulfill WP notability criteria. Drawing attention to their endorsement of a yet-to-be-released project appears, to me, "overtly promotional". The notability should come from neutral and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable third party sources</a> with zero interest in the project's genesis, not the testimony of people involved in its creation and promotion.</dd>
<dd>Taken as a whole, and with nothing personal against the editor whatsoever, I feel these factors - taken all together along with all the foregoing discussion (which I have read with great interest) - constitute a delete IMHO.

<dd>Reverting to somebody else's edit does not absolve you of responsibility, especially in a case where you have a stake in this. As to good faith, I certainly tried to assume it, but your edit comments include "Paulley the entry for BWOHTJ is going to be up for deletion in a few days. If it passes afD without being deleted then we can take it off this page, but until now I'm putting it back on" and "readded Bleeding Was Only Half the Job info as the entry is going to be deleted". I was unable to come up with an explanation other than that you were determined to keep the material in Wikipedia even if the AfD results in deletion. What interpretation do you feel I should be making instead?

<dd>If my intention was "to keep the material in Wikipedia even if the AfD results in deletion" then wouldn't I have continued to revert Paulley's edits to my version rather than say "(sounds good)"? Of course. That is where I see flaw in your interpretation. Sometimes people make misjudgments like I did; I am not saying you violated <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> because I know where you are comiong from, all I am saying is to use language that so strongly casts me as someone I'm not ("dodge the community concensus" has a very strong connotation). Something that I think has gotten lost in a lot of this is that from the very beginning I have done everything I could to try to make any mention of BWOHTJ on Wikipedia fit to Wikipedia's standards. To deny this is simply ignore the NUMEROUS examples of my edit summaries along the lines of "Let's try to work out a wording for this that we can both agree on" and various modifications of that summary.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 22:59, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad you're trying to work with other people on wording. However, you haen't addressed my main point: You don't seem to be following <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. The consensus is pretty clearly that this material doesn't belong in Wikipedia. If you add the material into another article, as yet another edit comment today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xtreme_Pro_Wrestling&amp;diff=60980806&amp;oldid=60976038" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xtreme_Pro_Wrestling&amp;diff=60980806&amp;oldid=60976038" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> suggests that you intend to do, then that is dodging the community consensus. I'm glad you're excited about your project, but Wikipedia is not a place for self-promotion. If you can't bear to lose to the material, move it to your user page, where it's perfectly appropriate. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 16:22, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Alexa ranking of 20,000 is, AFAIK, not <i>too</i> shabby (but nowhere near the "similar sites" listed above). Some evidence of mentions in the media, but they're hard to find due to the nature of the site.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I think it's important to disambiguate the criteria here. As a company, AC does not appear to be notable per nom. As a web site, there aren't any accolades, but there does appear to be coverage by secondary sources. But are these secondary sources noting it for it's innovation? Only one of the media references is working now, the other two appear to have changed perhaps. Ste4k 06:56, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Matt Timson is a professional illustrator who has had work published in (IIRC) The Guardian, The Observer and Radio Times amongst other publications. He also has worked prolifically for American and Canadian clients. It should be noted that the deletion proposal of this entry from ScottNestle is a personal one, as he narrowly escaped legal proceedings for defamation of character against Timson, for which at the time was made to publicly apologise for. Scott is a prolific Internet 'troll', who holds stalker-like grudges against published writers and artists due to bitterness over his failure in the field himself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Again, I'd urge care in slinging around insults. I know the Scott Nestel that you are referring to well (hell, a quick Google search would tell me anyway), but you can't prove that this is the same individual. It could just be a coincidence of there being 2 people with virtually the same name. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 16:39, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> In another deletion proposal ScottNestle said the reason he was proposing dozens of small press-related entries for deletion (even when they have other notable claims to be kept) is "because I consider them inherently non-notable. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottNestle_a535.html" title="User:ScottNestle">ScottNestle</a> 20:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)" This shows a fundamental (and wilful?) misunderstanding of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_small_press_comics.html" title="British small press comics">British small press comics</a> scene. Granted you can run off a self-produced comic on a photocopier and call it a comic but the small press publications that he has worked for are anthologies and so can have their pick of who works for them especially when it comes to artists who tend to get commisioned to do the work on accepted scripts. To top that Matt has also been commisioned to produce the covers of a number of publications. The only real grounds for non-notability for the small press would be on circulation which misses their importance for the British (and international) comic industry as breeding grounds for new talent.

<dd>If the notability of small press titles is judged by their importance in breeding notabletalent, surely they should only be added once they have actually generated that talent? Also on top of that you;re listing people who are otherwise non-notable because they are affiliated with a publication that MIGHT make them notable and then assert their own notability...

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I agree that the artist is not as notable as many others out there, the article is well formed for a stub and fits well within it's network of pages.

<p>I vote to <b>keep</b> the article. Let's at least have a crack at editing it into an acceptable form first.

<li><b>Response to Comment</b> - I didn't say the article is perfect as it is, I was disputing your categorisation of it as "research". My main point is that just because a given article doesn't currently conform to Wikipedia standards, that doesn't automatically mean it ought to be deleted. If these types of concerns are raised about a specific article, those interested in the topic should work to bring it up to scratch, rather than simply deleting. There is potential here for a good article, though it needs a bit of work (if there <b>wasn't</b>, I would wholeheartedly support deletion). --<a href="../../../o/b/j/User%7EObjectiveBrit_38b3.html" title="User:ObjectiveBrit">Matthew Humphreys</a> 18:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Popular culture always is referenced to some degree in various parts of time, and I do not believe that decades are but an arbitrary way to define culture and cultural movements. One could cite examples and attempt to prove retro movements for any arbitrary period of time, but it's not particularly useful and attempts to imply a significance where none exists. Also, pretty much bound to be original research. GassyGuy 04:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus, so keep.</b> Pity indeed the administrator who sorts this one out. It would seem to be the opinion of the keep voters that the article has indeed acquired referencing. This is often the goal of deletion nominations which rest on the question of referencing and verifibility (if it can be referenced, then it shall be kept). No clear consensus to delete; "cruft" has never been a criteria even though we've all done it at one time or another. On a further note, this is the third nomination in three months. Absent strong consensus this is not inappropriate, although a fourth nomination would need to address different criteria. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> This article is a textbook definition of original research. In its original nomination for deletion nearly a month ago, and in the defense mounted during the subsequent deletion review, the most convincing arguments to be kept were made by those suggesting that the material was good but that they would need to prepare citations from "games and several books" or from various other references. Since the time of the article's nominations coming up on three weeks ago, no efforts at improving the article's references have been made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&amp;diff=60514292&amp;oldid=57198551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&amp;diff=60514292&amp;oldid=57198551" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, although the article has been actively edited by many editors. To me, this demonstrates a lack of interest in bringing this article up to Wikipedia verifiability standards. Other keep votes during the original AfD had no substantive policy support behind them, only using phrases such as "this is important" and "this is interesting" and "it does no harm" and "it really helps out my Jedi Academy clan" which offer no supportive Wikipedia policy for keeping an uncited, unverified original-research article on Wikipedia. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Clerical note.</b> I'm sure others will argue that I've nominated this again too soon. I disagree. Wikipedia's deletion policy states that "[t]here is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations," and the community of Star Wars fan editors on Wikipedia have had several weeks since the original nomination was opened to improve this article with regards to its citation of sources and its verifiability. I do not consider this an "immediate" renomination. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>CLERICAL NOTE REGARDING MERGE AND/OR TRANSWIKI VOTES.</b> For those who would vote to merge and/or transwiki, please clarify whether or not your vote stands for preservation or elimination of the material, as some closing admins have in the past interpreted merging and transwiki-ing as keep and delete votes, respectively. Furthermore, please note that you may instead wish to vote either as a <b>straight keep</b> or as a <b>straight delete</b>, as <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" class="external text" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat" rel="nofollow">Wookieepedia already has an article on lightsaber combat</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><small>When this nomination began, it was listed as <i>Lightsaber combat (second nomination)</i>. During the course of this nomination, it became clear that the article had been nominated once before under a different name. I went through and renamed <i>lightsaber combat'</i>s first nomination as a second nomination (correcting references), and then renamed this nomination as a third nomination (correcting references). However, when I nominated this, I was only aware of it having gone through one other nomination; I was assuming that when someone referred to it have gone through "two other nominations," one of the two they were referring was the article's deletion review. Hopefully, though, the matter is now clarified. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 15:42, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>response</b> It has been three weeks since the date the article was first nominated — June 6, 2006 + 21 days (3 weeks) = June 27, 2006.

ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' Everybody looked at Alice. `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice. `You are,' said the King. `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen. `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.' `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King. `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

<li><b>Response</b> First, sources mean nothing if they're not documented within the article itself. If you'd like to take the time to bring the article up to a situation where it's adequately referenced and sourced, all the more power to you. Second, there are articles on Wikipedia that have been nominated for deletion for five or more times, because despite being on a popular subject, they flagrantly violate one of Wikipedia's policies. This article is in the same vein.

<li>Please note that being "a great resource" is not a criterion for inclusion. There are plenty of things that are "great resources" that are not on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a free webhosting service.

The Virginia Tech message board is a "great resource" of football knowledge, but I wouldn't suggest pasting everything that everyone says there into a Wikipedia article. Further, I would remind you of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> policies.

Furthermore, an article that does not verify its content and that contains original research, as said above, contains problems that, <i><b>by policy</b></i>, automatically supercede community consensus. Finally, the community's "consensus" last time was largely a matter of ballot-stuffing by individuals whose supportive reasoning made no cites to Wikipedia policy and, with most votes, directly contradicted same. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 11:35, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not at all clear why you think I am assuming bad faith, although you are clearly assuming bad faith regarding my vote- further demonstrated by your attempts to move my comment out of context. A renom 11 days after a close = a speedy renom. I see no need for it following a keep result. In those cases, I always vote speedy keep, which is perfectly valid and in no way precluded by policy. It also does not in any way reflect on you, particularly as I have no idea what motivated your renom.

<li>I think I may have been a little hairtrigger the <i>first</i> time I accused you of assuming bad faith, JJay, and for that, I'll withdraw the comment here and apologize to you; but the above portion of your comment — "further demonstrated by your attempts to move my comment out of context" — <i>is</i> a textbook assumption of bad faith. I also honestly have no idea what you mean when you suggest I'm assuming bad faith behind your vote itself — I'm instead saying that you have no supportive guideline for <i><b>speedy</b></i> keep, which is a very specific item, outlined at <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>. Just as if someone votes to speedy-delete in a discussion, they need to provide why it matches under the speedy-delete guidelines (and not just general deletion guidelines), if you vote speedy keep in a discussion, you need to provide why it matches under the speedy-keep guidelines (and not just general keep guidelines). As for moving your comments, it was not to "move them out of context," as you suggest, but because the first time you wrote the above comment, you gave it a single bullet. That placed it not as a reply, but as a new comment in the main stream of the discussion. Votes and comments are supposed to be kept in chronological order in an AfD, per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDM_d240.html" title="WP:AFDM">WP:AFDM</a>. However, I wouldn't have messed with a message thread, and had you had a double-bullet, indicating your comment was a corollary to your vote, I wouldn't have moved it. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:06, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your apology. You should be aware that WP:SK is a guideline. Editors choose to apply it or not, but there is nothing binding in a guideline. WP:CSD is policy. It is not a guideline and should not be equated with speedy keep. They are very different beasts. I have repeatedly indicated why I voted speedy keep- my thinking here is not at all unusual, and does not have to be explicitly included in the guideline page. Otherwise, I do not think it is proper for you to move comments on the page, whether double bulleted, single bulleted, or no bulleted. This is a discussion - one that you started - not an art project. Frankly, I think you need to focus less on style guidelines and more on the crux of the matter - namely that there is no consensus to delete this article. That was the case two weeks ago and is still the case today. Despite self serving comments like "I just want to gauge community opinion", the fact is that repeated renoms waste everyone's time. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>To respond to your comment:
<ol>
<li>A guideline is "something that is: (1) actionable and (2) authorized by consensus" (<a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>). My sense of it has always been that it is semi-policy: it can be countermanded, but only with good reason.</li>
<li>My citation of <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> was basically to denote that your "speedy keep" vote is exactly equivalent to a "keep" vote; the "speedy" adjective prepending your vote had no supporting weight to it in the <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> guideline. I believe the only policy reference to "speedy keep" is in a section of <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> where it refers to "if a clear consensus for non-deletion is quickly reached."

<li>With regards to whether or not it is proper to move comments to improve readability, that was already decided on Wikipedia a very long time ago by community consensus — yes, it is perfectly acceptable to refactor a discussion to make it more readable.</li>
<li>With regards to your comments about it not being an "art project," your belief that I've made "self serving comments," and your belief that this nomination "waste[s] everyone's time," I would appreciate it if you would <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">remain courteous</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">not attack me personally</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 03:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mike, given your clear propensity for wiki lawyering, it would have at least been intellectually honest to cite the second line of WP:Rules, namely: <i>Guidelines are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception</i>. There was eminent common sense in my speedy keep, designed to prevent the writing of hundreds of lines of text in a sterile debate ten days after the close of a previous discussion on the same topic. Therefore, I would ask that you stop trying to impugn the validity of opinions on the opposite side of the aisle. Regarding your remark on refactoring, moving an obvious response to a comment to a completely different part of the discussion does not help "readability". It lessens readability. It creates confusion. You should desist from moving comments on this page and not edit war when your moves are reverted. I'm also not sure why you continue to harp on civ, npa, etc, etc. Challenging the validity of someone's vote, and then displacing an explanatory comment, is likely to provoke a reaction. It is not personal, despite your continued assertions to the contrary. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:29, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To respond to your comment:
<ol>
<li>Wikilawyering (<a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WP:WL</a>) is defined as "[u]sing legal terms inappropriately regarding Wikipedia policy" or "[a]sserting that technical interpretation of Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines should override the principles they express." You've not cited principles I've attempted to override with technical interpretations. If you are calling me a wikilawyer simply because I am familiar with Wikipedia policy and am responding with it when disagreeing with you, I don't believe that qualifies.</li>
<li>With your regard to my quotation of <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>, I paraphrased the second sentence you cited by immediately saying thereafter "it can be countermanded, but with good reason." That was my sense of the phrase based on the term "<i><b>occasional</b></i> exception" (emphasis added). Therefore, I don't think you can validly call me intellectually dishonest.</li>
<li>With regard to moving the comment, I moved a comment which replied to my message to an indented spot underneath my message. This is how it is done in Wikipedia nearly universally. It is not only permitted by the guidelines, it is a common action performed by numerous Wikipedia editors every single day.</li>
<li>I am not attempting to impugn the validity of opinions on the opposite side of the aisle. Please do not use straw man arguments when disagreeing with me.</li>
<li>Despite your citations of "eminent common sense," I again do not see any justification for calling your remark a "speedy" keep. I was not arguing that prepending the adjective "speedy" made your vote worthless (again, a straw man argument), only that it was of no practical difference from a normal "keep" vote.</li>
<li>Finally, I am "harping" on one of the core pillars of Wikipedia (pillar #4 of <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, also see <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRI_cf98.html" title="WP:TRI">policy trifecta</a>) because you appear not to be respecting it, once again with your phrase "clear propensity for wiki lawyering," as well as with the implication that I was intellectually dishonest, and the poor characterization of my actions. And even were we to assume that I had done a wrong to you, a point I do not concede nor agree with, being wronged is not considered acceptable grounds here for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">being rude</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personally attacking someone</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 14:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but you moved my response to your comment to a completely different part of the discussion, while leaving your comment in its original place. Here is your diff to refresh your memory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FLightsaber_combat_%28third_nomination%29&amp;diff=60822116&amp;oldid=60817432" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FLightsaber_combat_%28third_nomination%29&amp;diff=60822116&amp;oldid=60817432" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. By so doing, you created enormous confusion. You destroyed the readability of the exchange. You forced me to review numerous diffs to try to figure out what happened to my comment. You forced me to restore my comment to its original place in the discussion. You also added a comment implying that I was trying to vote twice. This was a significant waste of my time, and attack on my character, but then you went further by edit warring over the change. Otherwise, as far as I am concerned, the tenor of many of your responses here, such as the one above, demonstrate a continued focus on wiki lawyering. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>To reply to your comment:
<ol>
<li>Either a comment is made separately, in which case it is then moved to chronological order within a discussion, or it is a comment made in reply to a statement, in which case it is indented properly to show that it is a reply. I moved your comment to chronological order; when you made clear it was underneath my comment as a reply, I indented it for you to denote that it was a reply. This sort of formatting is longstanding and frequently enacted in AfD by numerous editors every day, and is widely considered acceptable.</li>
<li>I believe your following comments that employ heavy hyperbole — "enormous confusion," "destroyed readability," "significant waste," and so on — really do not have any meat in them to which I can respond. They are very much your opinion, as counter to normal deletion practices as that may be.</li>
<li>I find it odd that it took you "many diffs" to locate your text quickly given that most browsers have within them the ability to look for text within a webpage — it is something I frequently do when my own comments have been refactored or are not where I expected them.</li>
<li>It appears to me that simply responding to you while citing policy to support one's response is enough for you to label it as "wikilawyering." If that is not the case, I would appreciate what guidelines you use to differentiate wikilawyering from the simple action of citing supportive Wikipedia policy in a policy discussion.</li>
<li>With regard to your comments about the tenor of my arguments, I cannot say that I have been impressed by the manner in which you have decided to present yourself during this disagreement, either. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 14:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you think a perceived missing bullet authorizes you to move comments on the page, start edit wars, and waste my time, more power to you. You are clearly someone who relishes argument and looks for every shred of a line in a policy, guideline, or essay- linked and selectively quoted over and over - to try to support their point of view. You also continually make accusations of incivility whenever anyone disagreees with you. None of this is not my approach. Good luck in the future. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:59, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDM_d240.html" title="WP:AFDM">WP:AFDM</a> allows anyone to move comments on the page in certain ways in order to improve the readability of comments and their responses.

The remainder of your comments were <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and thus not able to be responded to.

On the other hand, if I wanted information on this Wikipedia is not where I would look and it is probably better suited elsewhere.

That's fine. But this one is ... overboard. An article discussing lightsaber's usage in the movies would be one thing ... but this one is describing terms that never appear in the movies and techniques that never appear in the movies. It would be like if someone started writing articles on all of the stuff in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Trek_Star_Fleet_Technical_Manual_9642.html" title="The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual">The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual</a> and other related books. If the term never appears in an episode/movie, then I just have a hard time seeing it as having interest outside of the Star Wars world. I love Star Wars. I have the movies. I saw the prequels on the day they came out. I'm not some anti-sci-fi guy desparate to delete anything and everything sci fi. Lightsabre combat is fine for a topic ... but maybe the article could be restructured so that it just discusses actual scenes from the movies.

<li>Yes. Sure. You're reading <b>way too much</b> in to what is fun, kiddies entertainment. Star Wars is not a philosophy, a way of life, its a series of childrens movies. They're fun. They're not documents to be intertextually analysed based on the writings of people with way too much free time. There can be nothing interesting to be said about the movies based on these post-hoc inventions and rationalisations of its over-excitable fans. The Star Wars "canon" doesn't even rise to the level of Tolkien's writings on Middle Earth; Tolkien, at least, had a motive for invention beyond profit, and the intelligence to weave interesting themes into his mythos. Lucasfilm is a machine for churning out vaguely-coherent product for gullible fanboys. Feel free to write as much about these meritless, fan-driven "interpretations" at Wookieepedia, and leave wikipedia for things that have an existence and importance beyond bored college kids in internet chatrooms. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>

<dd>Which of the sources are not "Reputable"? The web pages are in general either official in and of themselves, or are copies of official material; and I have absolutely no idea why you are objecting to the quotations from novels, legitimate published canon sources. The article is not original research; all of it is/can be sourced (and indeed, in a number of cases I had to tweak text to shy away from plagiarism, which is as <i>unoriginal research</i> as you get). As it is not OR, your NOT contention is irrelevant, and I believe I've established that this subject is neither OR as everyone keeps chanting and also not an "over-analysis" (see my discussion with Gareth Owen and the sources in the article); assertions that the used websites and novels are somehow not references for this article (but references for other articles) smack of a double standard to me. Incidentally, being "an example of the systemic bias" on Wikipedia is not a deletion criteria. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 22:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A reliable source would be a book, or article, on the subject. Now, if the article is based on "Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat" and the like, and if <i>Star Wars Insider</i> is considered a reliable source on Star Wars, all would be well. Is it&#160;? If not, it looks original research. Another <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problem is the vast list of neologisms (shiim, jung ma, so chung).

<dd>To address your first point, Insider and the rest are generally C-canon, so they are reliable SW sources, no worries on that score.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have no idea why Mike (et el) is so insistant on wiping it off the face of Wikipedia so quickly. I thought it was an interesting and informative article. My feeling is that it's probably just as substantiable as many of the other Star Wars fan pages on wikipedia. At the least the questionable stuff could be "identified" as such, and the article edited. I have no idea why this short sighted zeal to delete it.

<li>Oblivionboy, your argument isn't very helpful- the primary reason proffered for deleting this article is that it is unreferenced and made up by its editors; simply saying that it <i>could</i> be "substaniable" does not blunt their argument. The important thing is whether the article is substaniated right now. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 22:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I earlier objected to how quickly this current AFD came about, and I was rebutted by Mike with the example of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lost%7E_The_Journey_%28third_nomination%29_838d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lost: The Journey (third nomination)">Lost: The Journey</a>. That was an anecdote, an extreme example which no argument was made for why it was the <i>ideal</i> way OR issues should be resolved. Frankly, to properly source this article, if it was legitimate, would be a monumental task. It is long and filled with detail, seemingly cobbled together (by me, at least) with numerous sources, adding those sources is not something I would do in my spare time. Yet, with this AFD, editors are being forced to do so. This AFD is a virtual revolver pointed at the article with a threat saying "edit this or this dies". People who value this information and could add the appropriate sources are forced to edit this page to an acceptable point. I don't agree with forcing editors to work and make edits. It's unfair and against the spirit of cooperation, with editors forcing the hand of their peers.<br />
<br />
Now, going into the article history, at the time this AFD was listed there were two line-items within External links referencing "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones The Visual Dictionary" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith The Visual Dictionary". I believe this (improperly formatted) sourcing is enough to establish that "Lightsaber combat" is an actual concept that has been structured, explored and documented by people at Lucasfilm. The keep votes from previous AFD established its notability. Both points should save the article from deletion. In my view, the proper thing to do here is to wipe the page clean save for the few sentences that are so general they could be verified, tell the talk page or Wikiproject Star Wars what you've done, and asked they go through the page history and copy and paste the sections of the article that could be verified, along with the right source. It takes more work than a simple AFD, but it's the procedure outline in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>. Instead, the AFD route was opted, a route that <b>failed twice already</b>. If those sources were contested as false, then that is a completely different matter that to me would merit a third AFD. But it wasn't, and it smelled like an attempt for consensus by attrition (per Kotepho).<br />
<br />
Over the last two days or so, if you check the page there is a growing number of bracketed numbers in superscript, I believe they qualify as proper sourcing. Maru, <b>thank you</b> for your work, I think you went above and beyond what editors are meant to do on this encyclopedia. I was suspecting this AFD had more to do with the tastes of editors (witness the instances of "fancruft" in this AFD, irrelevant because again its notability was established by older AFDs) than actual <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> issues. I know <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sets a high bar which can translate to a "guilty until proven innocent" requirement. Still, I'm unsettled about raising the bar higher to the point where proper formatting, a matter as trivial as grammer and spelling, is required. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 05:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> An encyclopedia article on Wikipedia should be appropriately referenced. That is not a choice, that is a mandate, and it is one that has existed from the beginning of the project. Articles on Wikipedia that are not appropriately referenced do not belong on Wikipedia. That is, again, a mandate that has existed from the beginning of the project. Whether or not you believe articles that do not currently fulfill Wikipedia requirements should be allowed to stay in the mainspace indefinitely while they grow is a difference of wikiphilosophy: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:eventualism">eventualism</a> versus <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/immediatism" class="extiw" title="m:immediatism">immediatism</a>. It is a debate that has no more chance of being resolved than those between <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:deletionism">deletionists</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionism">inclusionists</a>. Any Wikipedia editor, however, is required to be civil to their fellow editor and to assume that that person means well; I would therefore suggest that using such melodramatic hyperbole as "virtual revolvers" isn't useful. Moreover, it's not accurate: content is not killed when it is deleted. Even if already deleted, any administrator is happy to retrieve and then userfy an article (move an article, with its edit history intact, to someone's userspace) so that it can be worked on in a non-"live" atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Your argument then goes on to suggest that I nominated this article on the basis of lightsaber combat not being a Lucasfilm concept (even were we to assume that the existence of 'visual dictionaries' amongst the vast array of Star Wars merchandise was somehow indicative of the concept of formally denoted styles of lightsaber combat being officially endorsed), or it not being a notable concept, or even nominating it due to spelling and grammar issues. I did not nominate this article based on same. I sent it to deletion review because I believed the closing administrator in the second nomination allowed sheer numbers to blind him to a bevy of extremely poor arguments (such as the infamous "Jedi Academy clan" remark). I renominated it for deletion because people made absolutely no effort to improve the article in the three weeks since it was originally up for deletion by Milkandwookies. And, to make it clear, like others here, I agree that <i><b>extensive</b></i> quotations from <i><b>novels</b></i> whose canonicity has not been well-established is insufficient to rescue this article from the venue of original research. <b>Obviously, others here will disagree with me, but if the closing administrator reads these particular words, I would respectfully ask them to look at the quality of the references, not just merely the fact that the article in question has now been referenced.</b><br />
<br />
Furthermore, lightsaber combat is neither a source of interest or expertise to me, so I would not enjoy rewriting this article, nor would I be of help rewriting this article, nor is such a rewrite required of me. If you feel policy requires same of me, I would appreciate specific cites. I enjoy the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy and do not agree with GWO with regards to his commentary about those who do, but I simply do not believe that the subject of this article is able to be saved in a way that its content would be supported by Wikipedia's policies as to what it should and should not contain. My action to nominate it a second time for deletion was thus, in my eyes, an entirely appropriate way to handle the article in question.<br />
<br />
With regards to a "guilty until proven innocent" requirement for articles, perhaps more accurately described as "considered unverified until actually verified" requirement, yes, that is required by Wikipedia's policy: "The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain."<br />
<br />
Finally, with regards to your comments how you believe the matter "smells" and it dealing with the "tastes of editors," I think one of the most disillusioning aspects of the debates I have engaged in with regards to articles I've nominated for deletion is the large number of people who chose to disagree rudely and in a personal way. Very few people had the sheer class, such as Nick Cook did, to keep the matter a civil exchange on policy and reasoning, with a final resolution to agree to disagree. Instead, the vastest majority of people have chosen to accuse those supporting deletion of massive malicious intent, conspiracy, and a host of other silliness. It makes people such as Mr. Cook stand out as class acts, and it illuminates the very sorry state of affairs upon Wikipedians' attitudes towards Wikipedia's requirements that its participating editors <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">be courteous to each other</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume that the person holding an opposing belief to yours means well, even if they disagree with you</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 15:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ha ha, I agree for the admins.&#160;:) However I would just like to point out to Mike (et. el) that there are alot of other pages with far less documentation for the starwars universe. Example: <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan_Vong</a>. For this article I count now over 35 just for this page, which seems exceptional for me even for normal wikipedia articles. Surely this meets the requirements of even such a dedicated editor as yourself. Also I feel that trying to polarize the issue into bioptional points prevents a possible larger view of the issue. My question would not be option A vs option B (eventualism versus immediatism), but rather what are all the options. Instead of delete-ism, what are the other options, what would it take to bring this article up to standard? After all, even if you got it deleted, someone would be able to come back and just recreate it again, even if under a different title. Hardly a win-win situation for all of us.

No soldier has ever gone into battle wielding a lightsaber. Lightsaber stunt work... yes... lightsaber combat... no. After committing this basic error, the article then evolved by, in large part, being written as if fighting with lightsabers is a real subject and Jedi Knights are real. I'm waiting for the next article, "X-Wing piloting", to come along and further degrade any credibility Wikipedia has as an encyclopedia written by people with both feet in the real world.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think that it IS the point. This article is not about filmmaking (the art and the science), rather its objective is to add information to a fictional universe that people might be interested in. I think its completely releveant from that perspective, and the delete call originated from whether or not the article "was just made up" or had actual referenes in order to substantiate itself. Not if it was "imaginary" or not. A subtle difference for some people perhaps. Naturally you are more than welcome to start a page on the stunt work in the starwars movies if you're interested. I'd certainly like to read it too.&#160;:) However the larger question of if wikipedia should only contain articles on "real" things, or "fictional" things (Hemmingway's characters are fictional yet are articled in Wikipedia), is perhaps a debate out of scope for this discussion - <a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EOblivionboy_4ebe.html" title="User:Oblivionboy">oblivionboy</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EOblivionboy_fe6e.html" title="User talk:Oblivionboy">talk)</a> 20:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article states in the <u>very first line</u> "Lightsaber combat is the <i>fictional</i> style of lightsaber fighting used by Jedi and Sith in the Star Wars franchise." Fictional, and Star Wars. It is categorized as a <b>Fictional</b> martial art. What more do you want to ensure people don't inadvertently think this is real - besides the whole solid light thing. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 22:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, So what? Just sticking "fictional" in the introduction does not solve it. Read the rest of the article, and look at the name of it. If you added a disclaimer at the top saying that "this article has been written by people who have difficulty telling real from imaginary", it still wouldn't work because disclaimers shouldn't really be necessary in an encyclopedia. The article is fundamentally inappropriate (hopeless would be another way to describe it), by its name and by the style in which it was written. It should be deleted and restarted as an encyclopedia article that is both named and written from a real world perspective. The only reason it's survived this long is fan voting. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Do you hav any idea how many thousands of articles would need to be deleted under that logic? There are many hundreds in each of the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Tolkien universes that exhibit these same tendencies (just to name the fandoms that I follow). While I am sympathetic to the need to maintain the focus on the "real world", there is <b>clear</b> community consensus for inclusion of these articles. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 12:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, from someone who wouldn't consider himself a fan: this is interesting, far more notable than all the Pokémon, now well-cited, and the amount of jeopardy and animosity toward this article (three VfDs, especially in this short span?) is something I frankly don't understand at all. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightwatch_8a25.html" title="User:Nightwatch">Nightwatch</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightwatch_7a38.html" title="User talk:Nightwatch">respond</a> 21:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is far more notable than a number of other fictional topics covered on Wikipedia, and it's no longer primarily OR. I can also think of a number of reasons non-Star Wars fans would be interested in this; Gillard's work developing lightsaber combat for the SW prequels is pretty important to anyone researching, say, modern stage combat, or fight choreography in American films. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 04:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. Startlingly <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">rude</a> response, Kim. Wikipedia's policy allows as many nominations as needed, and the reasons used for this nomination were not only acceptable but perfectly justified.

<li>I'm just being short and to the point, not intentionally incivil per-se. Apologies if it seemed that way. What I'd like to know is what is the point of re-nominating in rapid succession like this? You could see volunteer time as a kind of donation to us.

<ul>
<li>No hard feelings -- and that's a nice way to think about editors' time, and I'll have to keep that perspective in mind in future interactions. But my reason for renominating it was that people had obviously had time to work on the article since the article's second nomination — but evidently the community chose not to work on it in a way that would bring it up to community standards. It was that that led me to believe a third nomination this shortly after the second would be appropriate. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 00:41, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am no expert on this subject but considering the lack of information in the RNR article itself, I am not sure a 35-person subdivision is notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is not "self-promotion" by any stretch of the imagination. Take a look at the history of the page and see that this article was started by a man named <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott Perry</a>. On his personal website, Scott Perry is identified as a "student" of ACIM who lives in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan_cad1.html" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> and is a professional "licensed master plumber" <a href="http://www.miraclevision.com/perspage/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miraclevision.com/perspage/index.html" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>. Foundation for Inner Peace, on the other hand, is in California and was started by Judy Skutch, a woman who comes from a wealthy New York family that, during her childhood, used to entertain <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Roosevelt_a44d.html" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> during breakfast (citation: Journey Without Distance<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587611082/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587611082/" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>). Mrs. Skutch hardly needs the help of a professional plumber in getting word out about the organization she helped to found. (No disrespect to plumbers. The point I'm making is obvious.) Foundation for Inner Peace did not start this article. Besides, they are a non-profit organization that does not need any advertisement anyway. ACIM has been a steady seller for more than 20 years. Go to any bookstore and you will find it there ... all without any promotion! (You will never see an ad for ACIM in any magazine. It doesn't need it. It is grass roots and spread by word of mouth.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia states that there is a difference between "notable" and "famous." Foundation for Inner Peace is not famous. But it IS notable. Whether you had heard of these sites or organizations is not the point. The point is that within their field these organizations are notable. Oh, and it is hardly "original research" to mention an organization and then link to that organization's official website. That is actually called "verification," the thing you have claimed on three ACIM-related pages to hold so dear, and yet it is also the thing you cannot accept with regard to ACIM. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I guess I get frustrated by the fact that you all say it has not verifiable evidence. It is a book publisher. It is verified that this exists. I'm also frustrated by the lack of "good faith" in all of this. These articles were started by a very nice and well meaning man who was not attempting to do anything other than contribute articles he thought would be of value to other people. There is no denying that Ste4k (or whatever) has been spiteful and mean spirited all the way through. With that, delete the article. I don't care. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 21:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually it is not a publisher. The book's contents are public domain. And as a publisher they only printed perhaps a couple hundred books out of a small print shop known as Freeperson's press. Have you read the valid secondary sources? The court case?

<li><b>Comment</b> The difference is that every kid in the English- (or their semblance of English&#160;;) )-speaking world is using that term; obnoxious as it may be it's entered the common parlance. Even toy manufacturers are capitalising on this (with "Bling" editions of fashion dolls, etc). And where Google enters the equation is a quick way of checking verifiability: if this term is being used a lot, a lot of people will have written about it, and it will appear a lot on the internet. If nobody can verify the information, it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 23:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Google isn't the definitive guide to notability, but if I can't find it on Google, it is up to you or ther defenders of the article that it is nevertheless notable, by providing other verifiable sources.

<p>"Scientology as a business" is somewhat of a POV title, and indeed POV subject, to the point that I cannot see how this article could be worded neutrally. The article is rather anti-Scientology in POV at present. As a consequence I think it should be deleted, perhaps also merging to other Scientology articles in part. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 21:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In response to JChap2007, unless I'm very much mistaken, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is exactly where this material started, making this the opposite of a POV fork. Respectfully, I have to disagree with Nicholas; I agree that looking at the issue of "Scientology as a business" may be exploring a particular POV that is not shared by all sides, but so is looking at the issue of "Scientology as a religion", which is a POV not shared by all sides either, but which is explored in detail at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>. There's a lot of responses I think we could consider -- merging back to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>, renaming to Scientology as a financial entity, merging with other "Scientology as a ______" information -- but I can't defend the idea of deleting it because it's too POV a concept to explore, not when other equally POV conceptions of Scientology are given not only space but much more prominent placement. So, I might change my vote if someone suggests a better plan, but for now I really have to vote <b>Keep</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:50, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This article doesn't meet that description. This article serves to document the fact that Scientology, particularly as represented by the Church of Scientology, functions to a very real extent as a business. This is the conclusions that multiple courts of law and several government reports have come to; to lump discussion of a subject that <i>those</i> inquiries have treated seriously in with "Rob Jones is a total meathead" attack pages is just ... really, a very grotesque abuse of the system. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:39, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The whole article was in fact written to disparage the subject. No, its not like most other attack articles, but it is still an attack article, as definied in the policy. If a similiar article were written about a religion with less opposition at Wikipedia, the word "grotesque" would be used to describe that article. Wikipedia should not favor or disfavor any individual religion. Your POV on Scientology seems to have the votes on your side. But votes can't change policy. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 11:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, in short, you want to rewrite the A6 criterion, and replace the very limited "serve no purpose but to disparage" criterion with the far broader "is perceived by some to disparage no matter what else it does." You state "votes can't change policy" as if it were those voting <i>other than</i> speedy delete who were advocating a change in policy. I agree that Wikipedia should not favor or disfavor any individual religion, and if any other religion were to be noted so many times in so many legal actions and government reports to be operating more as a money-making enterprise than as a religious institution, then it should be noted about <i>that</i> religion as well. But what you are proposing is that Wikipedia should <i>favor</i> Scientology over other religions by hiding this information, which we would not do for any other religion. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:59, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The title of the article is not an allegation - every religion has certain financial activities that make it a business (in broad sense).

<li><b>Keep</b> Documenting the business aspects of the complex group of Scientology companies is hardly meant to "disparage the subject", and the costs to members are part of that. It's less subject to editor interpretation than arguing Scientology theology.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Scientology is a business, since it charges money for services rendered.

<li><b>Keep</b> it could, perhaps, be renamed Perspecties on Scientology and expanded but then it would tend to dwarf the main Scientology article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs to be further developed. Hubbard himself sometimes stated Scientology was not a religion.

<li>Hello, I created this page to have an easy way for folks to find the related articles about the Order of Interbeing and to begin the process of creating relevant articles. I actually don't know the pros and cons of using a "category" vs. a "list" - I'll look that up on the "help" pages this morning. If anyone would be kind enough to let me know the whys or the preference for one over the other, I'd appreciate it. I would like to have one or the other as a leaping off point for more articles that I believe will be of interest.

<dd>As you can check (in the "what's new" of www.entropysite.com, this site (and those related to it) are not trivial or ordinary websites. The ideas in them and the articles cited (and reproduced by permission) in www.entropysite.com have resulted in a complete deletion of "order-disorder" in most new editions of US first-year university textbooks,15 as of 2006. This is a revolution in the teaching of entropy to beginners in chemistry. The replacement is the approach of 'entropy is a measure of the energy dispersal in a process'.</dd>
<dd>Later today, I will justify the reason for (whoever suggested!)the existence of this unit, Entropy Sites. As a novice, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions and ask for advice as to how to proceed to bring these changes to the major pages of Wikopedia dealing with the second law and entropy. It is a half-century overdue for 'order-disorder' to be discarded and a modern conceptual view of entropy change presented. (That does NOT mean any change in thermo! It means that thermodynamicists should be aided to speak understandably to the naive as well as to the math advantaged.)Thx.for your aid -- emails would be most time/space economical: flambert@att.net .</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> You have not provided any compelling reason to have an article dedicated to your websites. The merits of the contents isn't the issue at hand. The question is, should there be two articles in wikipedia dedicated to these marginally notable sites? The current consensus of disinterested editors is that there should not. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> 'Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers'. <a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonsuch_d676.html" title="User:Nonsuch">Nonsuch</a> 19:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> Two articles? I ran into only this "Entropy Sites". Of course "Wikipedia_ is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" ideally, but it certainly should contain vital information about the changed interpretation of entropy for students and pros. I have no time to argue to help W -- so delete what you want to. Thanks to Bduke for including (correct!) URLs -- can I properly order them and give a sentence of explanation for each? I'll do so, but delete whatever you wish.</dd>

<p>Now, as to a more important insertion about which I would appreciate your joint advice: The Entropy article is well-organized and well-written standard presentation. I do not want to make any changes in it, but I believe an insertion of a dozen lines is essential -- in a box, or somehow set off after the intro. They would outline the reason for the demise of 'order-disorder' in chemistry instruction with the resultant simplification of a scientific view of entropy for all levels of interested individuals. Could you give me a clue as to typographical symbols for such a box? Even better, is there any way I can submit the material to knowledgeable thermo editors for approval or rejection before laboring on learning the wikipedia format? Thanks for your aid. Frank Lambert, 28 June.</p>

<dd>I'm unsure what the boundaries of notability are in this area. It seems to have garnered respect in the MUDing Community, which has several other text-based games on Wikipedia. It points to awards, rankings, various communities, and a large number of people who have played it. I wouldn't delete it, but I am simply unsure of what "notable" refers to. Searching the TopMudSites site ranks them 14th(at this moment) out of over 1,000 text-based online roleplaying MUDs. -D</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Delete it. Non-notable. The 'awards' it points to are non-awards that take the agreement of about five random users to attain. There's no competition for them. I've been in MUDing since long before this MUD opened and the only people I've ever heard talk about it are the administrators. Keep in mind that very few MUDs actually participate in those silly rankings, and that virtually no users are required to reach the top 20. OneThousandYears 05:58, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In fact, given that the people writing/submitting this article appear to admit that this is just an advertisement (see the comments above from Blackrazer), saying that their advertising personnel just got involved again, why is there even a question here? - OneThousandYears.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually, I pointed out that we have advertising again because that's going to provide notability in the future because we will have more people curious about what aspects of the game we have and the more information they have access to, the easier it is for them to decide what they want to do/have access to help and tips. We have already gotten at good amount of new people in the past few weeks and they all had to ask what we offered. Giving people a way to research things about things mud is why I made this in the first place. The only reason the other people from the mud know about this is because I linked them to it to ask their opinions about what I was writing. I'm sure the "notability" of this entry wouldn't have been called into question if I knew more about writing entries in Wikipedia and the first entry wasn't three lines long. But I didn't know anything when I started, and I have worked feverously to make it a more respectable post. If you still feel that it needs to be deleted after looking at it now, then please by all means delete it. But I started this with the full intentions of expanding it to be a very descriptive entry about what Cland is and has that other muds may or may not have. -- Blackrazer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To note is that "Blackrazer" certainly is not the advertising staff of Clandestine. He's not a member of the staff at all. Merely a player of several years; I know this as a member of the staff. I can also say, as a member of the staff, that you can log onto Clandestine and see for yourself that we have a larger number of players. And if The MUD Connector(who granted us one of our awards) is not an authority on the MUD-world, who is? Also to note is that many of the other MUDs that rank in the Top 20 on TopMudSites(the largest website on the net for MUD advertising and traffic) have wikipedia entries - and some of them are smaller and younger than Clandestine(Armageddon MUD for instance). As a staff member, I have no issue with the player's entry here. It also does seem to approach the game in a positive, yet objective way. I would not call it advertising, and I believe that it gives an accurate portrayal of a very popular MUD. Before you "delete" it, I'd challenge you to look up our rankings and log onto Clandestine to see the statistics for yourself. Non-notable? Beyond all of the easy-to-find information on the game, many pieces of its code were released as open-source and are used on other MUDs(especially its mini-game programs), directly influencing the community. I'd be very disappointed in any inability to recognize a strongly acclaimed and popular online game as a notable entry. I also strongly question the level of expertise "OneThousandYears" claims to have of the community if he states that you do not need a significant number of players to maintain a high rank on TopMudSites. Either that, or his intentions may not be pure. -- <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonathin_3abc.html" title="User:Donathin">Donathin</a></li>

<dd>A simple check of the other MUDs which received the same award from MUD Connector that we did will show you that the ones that have survived the years are the most popular free-to-play MUDs on the Internet. BatMUD, Carrion Fields, Clandestine, and Wheels of Time MUD are all examples of this. I am rewriting our player's entry to fit more into the WIKI mold, and remove the advertising qualities of it. Once this is done, I sincerely hope that this silliness can end - Clandestine has been a great contributor, very popular game, and a source of originality in a gaming world that is stagnant with mediocrity. I simply cannot fathom researched opinioners being able to call Clandestine not notable. The Advertising issue will be taken care of shortly.

<dd>One last thing, instead of just saying <b>Delete</b> (which makes it very frustrating to figure out what's wrong when someone would really like to have a wiki added) some comments about how to fix up the entry would be appreciated. One person said it was advertising, I see now how it could have been viewed as advertising but constructive criticism would have solved that a lot easier and probably kept me from stressing out over what I was doing wrong.

<li>Both myself and Donathin have read the section on notability multiple times. It says that notability is based on being publicized in some manner and makes like a very quick statement about advertising. The problem is that you all were saying we are non-notable which is why we were trying to find a way to say "Hey, we're known in the MUDing community". Instead it seems you guys were saying "You're trying to advertise your MUD" by saying we were non-notable. Which I can see your point in that matter. However, instead of saying that and trying to give us an idea of what we could have done to prove otherwise, you guys let the matter drop. "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." We meet criterion three in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as TMS is well known within the MUDing community and independent of the creators of our MUD and is distributing our web content to others. Also as Donathin has already shown, the wiki entry has been changed to be even more of an encyclopedia entry. So I urge you to not delete our entry. --Blackrazer 18:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - As has been noted other MUDs with smaller populations and a shorter period of existence have already met the burden required to be classified as notable. If they remain on Wiki so should Clandestine. JaquesDeMolay 12:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If a MUD like Carrion Fields, which has done nothing notable, is listed here, I'd suggest deleting it as well. Batmud, on the other hand, is many times the size of Clandestine, much older, and the biggest LP MUD in the world. Armaggedon is notable for its respected and hardcore roleplaying. Listing on TMS is meaningless as that's just a banner exchange that anyone can participate in and doesn't constitute any sort of 'distribution decision' made by TMS. MUDs with 1 player are listed on there. Incidentally, it may be worth pointing out again that it's pretty clear that Donathin and Blackrazer are doing this to advertise. They even started a discussion over on Topmudsites (TMS) in the 'Advertising for Players' section about this Wikipedia article (<a href="http://www.topmudsites.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=44a17312314cffff;act=ST;f=12;t=1051;st=20" class="external free" title="http://www.topmudsites.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=44a17312314cffff;act=ST;f=12;t=1051;st=20" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmudsites.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=44a17312314cffff;act=ST;f=12;t=1051;st=20</a>) OneThousandYears 18:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I have no affiliation with TMS. I am merely a player of 6 years of Clandestine. That's it. Also, TMS has been very helpful in trying to make our entry less "advertisee" from just looking at that forum post and I thank them for that now. And just to point out. I don't see how you found that post to begin with, it's pretty obscure where Donathin placed it. So your affiliation with TMS must be pretty high if you found it. Which proves my point that it's a well-known place in the MUDing community since you advocate that you know a great deal about MUDing in general. --Blackrazer 19:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There aren't really any notability criteria laid down for MUDs, but Clandestine was (and maybe still is) very popular. Most MUDs peak and die within a year, and that only if they are lucky. Clandestine has been around for almost 10 years, which is a LONG time for a MUD. I'm personally surprised that it's still up, and that Sebek is still involved. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 21:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again, Blackrazer has no affiliation with TMS or the advertising element of Clandestine. I only became involved because I was asked to help make the entry more encyclopediac. The thread on TMS was meant to get feedback from other respected leaders in the community on (first) our entry, and (second) this issue. I would also again push that Clandestine's the originator of several coding elements(particularly minigames) that have been copied and have become mainstays on many other DIKU-derived MUDs. Beyond just 9 years of service, a large playerbase, recognition in the text-mmorpg world through awards and awareness - Clandestine has actually affected other MUDs. The poster's claim that Armageddon is notable because of the quality of its roleplay is the sole opinion of the poster (OneThousandYears), who appears to be a member of the TMS community with some sort of bent towards making sure Clandestine does not get the entry that it certainly deserves. If someone else, other than this poster, is able to tell me that Clandestine is still(after this) not-notable - I would like to hear the specific reasoning and explanation.

<dd><b>Advertisement</b> It's my belief the Advertisement is one of inexperience in writing in Wikipedia, rather then trying slight-of-hand tactics. I must go on to write, that if said advertisement is harmful, then help them out with some <b>POSITIVE FEEDBACK</b>, just saying it's advertisement and not specifying how it does advertising, or where it does advertise is a negative post<br />
When I see the willingness of Donathin and Blackrazer saying they want to comply and fix whatever they can to make this a better Wikipedia page, and then those negative posts from other people without constructive criticism show me an almost spiteful approach from the other participants in this review. In fact, I'm wondering if the only reason Onethousandyears is speaking out, is because of his biased nature, he claims to be a long time MUDder and an advent suscriber to groups of people of the same game type, what shows he doesn't have his own he wants promoted or being plain envious? Is this a childish dispute on his part?<br />
MUDs are a part of our history in gaming, If E.T. the game can have it's page, even though it's one of <b>THE WORST</b> games out their, so should Clandestine, for better or worse.<br />

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I'd just like to point out that since I redid the wikipedia entry about 30 hours ago, commentators have expressed notability with explained reasoning(the earlier comments were in response to a completely different entry which has been fixed to comply to wiki standards). This is with the exception of OneThousandYears, whose P.O.V. seems to have been explained. If we've moved past the notability argument, please let me know if there is anything that can immediately be done to improve this wikipedia entry. Thank you. I didn't want to throw around the words "strong keep" until I was sure that people from the wiki-community felt the same way about the notability of Clandestine that I do. -- <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonathin_3abc.html" title="User:Donathin">Donathin</a></li>

<li>This new article is much better. Very detailed, fixed some of the tone problems. I applaud the effort. I hope you'll post it somewhere it belongs, but I still can't help but think that this doesn't meet the guidelines for inclusion in Wikipedia. Also, theorizing as to reasons why users may be expressing sentiments in favor of deletion does not strengthen your case and, in my opinion, borders on attack. Please read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. GassyGuy 18:37, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is not meant to be an attack. I just understand the frustration of wanting to meet wiki-standards(which many people seem to think we meet the notability requirements), and only having received very unhelpful, nearly insulting responses in return. It made me feel the need to open whomever may read this debate/consensus' eyes to the fact that there could possibly be unsavorable outside motives. Other posters(of whom I have no idea of their identity at all) seem to agree. At any rate - what do you think makes this article not meet the guidelines for inclusion? As has been said before by someone else, the notability requirements for MUDs on Wikipedia is very grey area - and Clandestine has surpassed the age and popularity of over 99% of other MUDs, including other MUDs that were given Wikipedia entries. I'm just not sure what you think we're lacking, specifically, though I really do appreciate your cordial approach, GG. -- <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonathin_3abc.html" title="User:Donathin">Donathin</a></li>

<li>So if people care to write articles about any of them, should those articles be deleted as well. Did you know that there are about 90 Wikipedia articles about Pokemon characters? And they are <i>fictional</i>. L. Craig Schoonmaker is, on the other hand, <i>real</i>. (As they say, you can't make this sort of stuff up.) It makes sense that if his party is a one-person operation, it is covered in the article about him, rather than in a separate article, doesn't it? If this article were just a stub that said, "L. Craig Schoonmaker was a candidate for President of the United States.", I be with you in supporting deletion. But this article provides a lot more information than that.

<dd><b>Response</b> I did not vote for delete due to a belief that the subject is non-notable. I voted for delete because - as I stated - that this subject does not have enough notability to be <b>encyclopedically notable</b> for his own article in Wikipedia . Can you see and appreciate the difference? The "this article does no harm" argument inherently fails to understand that Wikipedia is an attempt at an <i>encyclopedia</i> and "harmless" articles of insufficient notability do cumulative damage to the authority of this attempt. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> states under <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_that_may_require_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles that may require deletion</a> that if the "subject of article fails...<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (for biographies)", then it "may require deletion". Note that the title of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "Wikipedia:Notability (people)". The Deletion policy also refers to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information: ... Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety." The rationale of non-notability refers to these policies and guidelines, and is a specific application of the fundamental principle that <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:01, 28 June 2006

<dd>WP:BIO is a guideline, not a policy. Furthermore, it states: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</dd>
<dd>WP:N is not even a guideline. It is an interesting interpretation that notability is a "specific application" of a fundamental principle when WP:N states that: "There is no official policy on notability. However, there are a number of consensual guidelines regarding notability within a limited subject field...." and "Although notability is not formal policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious), it is the opinion of some editors that this is what is meant by Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (which is a formal policy)." You are entitled to your interpretation of notability and WP:5P, which is shared by some other editors, but it just isn't policy, and there is no accepted consensus on it. If consensus could be developed on notability, you can be sure that it would have been added as a real ground for deletion to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> a long time ago.</dd>

<p>Article about a trade dispute between Japan and China which although sounds plausible, is unreferenced and I could not find any results when searching on Google. --<b><a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownCow_1d26.html" title="User:BrownCow"><span style="color:brown">Brown</span>Cow</a></b> • (<a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownCow_7773.html" title="User talk:BrownCow">how now?</a>) 23:48, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should also note that the article discusses folding chairs and the image, which comes from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chair.html" title="Chair">Chair</a> article, is definitely not a folding chair.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I googled "War on chairs" and the only other instance besides Wikipedia I could find was a June 18 post <a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=58167&amp;page=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=58167&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> by andyandy on the JREF forums, the same day the article was created on Wikipedia. A separate article by Waronchairs that was speedily deleted today was about JREF forum culture, so putting one and one together, it seems like the War on chairs article was created by andyandy merely for his JREF forum needs. —<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 14:26, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I searched Asahi Shimbun's Japanese Web site for each of six expressions that could be read "isu no kousen" (the headline the article cites): いすの交戦　椅子の交戦　いすの抗戦　椅子の抗戦　いすの好戦　椅子の好戦. No hits within the Asahi site. A citation would be helpful. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 08:08, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Where to begin... The topic could be newsworthy if it was true - it would need to be better written. That said, not all news articles are worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. There are already several articles in Wikipedia that already cover the worsening of Japan-Chinese relations in recent years. —<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 12:34, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia adopted a Limbo namespace, this article could be moved to Limbo during the discussion on deletion. Moving an article to Limbo would remove it from the article namespace and prevent search engines from delivering suspicious content while the community decides whether to keep or delete it.
