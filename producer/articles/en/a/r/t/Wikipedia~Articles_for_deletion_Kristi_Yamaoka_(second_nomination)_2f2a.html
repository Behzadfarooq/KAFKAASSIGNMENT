<p>Kristi Yamaoka is nn, and that is even more evident since no substantial biographical improvements have been made to the article in any fashion since the last AfD on March 9 - not even a birthdate. There are also no news articles directly about her in Google News dating after the 11th of March.

<dd><b>Comment:</b>However, this is not an <i>event</i> article, this is a bio stub.

<dd>Well, you could discuss making it an event article on the talk page, as a solution if you wish (e.g. a name change). I'm not recommending it, but it's a valid option, worth discussion. Deletion, as an option, has already been ruled out. We can not allow noms who fail, to simply keep trying until they get what they want. When you're point is "<i>...what I was trying to show the last time too.</i>", you're admitting you're just repeating yourself. What is the practical purpose of arguing the same thing, all over again? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:07, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because it's still valid - the article still fails the tests; it did three days after the fact, and it does now two weeks later. The basic issue with this not being AfDed is that people are (and were) confusing short-term popular consciousness (fifteen minutes of fame) with long-term notability (enough to be in an encyclopedia for all time, as it were). The claim before was that it would be expanded, but this has not happened in over two weeks, as evidenced by the history, and therefore is not likely to be expanded in future. The excuse that WP is not paper is <i>not</i> a blanket justification to include any old thing that comes to mind - if policies were meant to be exercised in a vacuum, there would be 47 million articles on absilutely anything on here, and there aren't. It was apparent then and it is apparent now that Kristi Yamaoka is only notable for falling on her head on video and waving her arms, not for any individual accomplishments. If nationwide news were a prerequisite, every disaster on record would need to be here on WP, which is why WP is neither a current events log nor a newspaper. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:12, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just as a point of clarification, the previous AfD was not closed as "Keep". It was closed as "No consensus" which has, I believe, somewhat less weight. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 07:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the nominator cares enough, set a reminder to bring this back in July and I predict you will get a total of four to six votes, all to delete or merge. This is obviously unencyclopedic ephemera, but the bias for including recent news events on WP under the guise of encyclopedic content is simply too strong to allow for rational consensus to form while the item is still relatively fresh. The conflation of news coverage with notability is regrettable but understandable. Cf the Saugeen Stripper, which was roundly declared to be of immense encyclopedic value (ok that's an exaggeration) until the meme wore off and AFD was able happily to merge it back to obscurity where it belongs. Hasta julio. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 14:44, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but that is false. The SS AfDs resulted in No Consensus. The merge set off a very nasty edit war. I hope that is not what you are suggesting. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:56, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Well, you are welcome to disagree with my personal view of course and you don't have to be sorry. But re the SS, by WP edit war standards it was more like a minor skirmish, the issue was resolved through a merge which stands as of now, and the 46-20 AfD vote to strip (sorry) the SS of a separate article was generally resolved, so my language may be flippant but the point is germane. And that was when the material was still rather fresh. By July, no-one will care and this can be dealt with without the interference of news-established notability obscuring the issue (which is not to say it would necessarily be deleted - that's just my prediction). <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not to belabor the point, but the AfD you keep referring to closed as no consensus- <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Saugeen_Stripper_2_dfdd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper 2</a>. Hence, there was no vote to strip, delete or merge anything. I also don't believe that anything was resolved. Furthermore, the comparison with SS is not even germane given the massive difference in news coverage. To my knowledge, the Saugeen Stripper, unlike Ms. Yamaoka, was never a guest on the Today show or featured on primetime news or the recipient of a call from President Bush. The SS also did not have an impact on organized sports. Instead of clouding the issue or playing with crystal balls, you should thus recognize that the keep voters here are perfectly "rational". -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, let's keep some perspective here. I think editors could well make a case that this is not a major event or a major subject, but given the tools typically used to determine relevance, the items listed by jjay to establish notability can distort encycopedic value. That is not to say that arguments for keeping this article are unfounded, but what I do think is somewhat irrational is using conflated google counts spawned by massive reproduction of a few wire stories to show encyclopedic value. Hence, in July, when those have disappeared, the issue can be addressed without this distortion. Per the point about disruption, I don't think renominating this for deletion when some distance has been established can be considered disruptive - that is simply acknowledging the bias of WP inclusion choices. We can disagree on this, surely, without deciding that one or another course of action is simply disruptive. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 22:21, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The argument that a handful of wire stories being replicated across a number of media outlets is an irrational basis for notability is, I think, missing the point. Each media outlet, from your local newspaper through to the biggest names in the business, make editorial decisions on what news items to run of the dizzying array of articles that come down over the wire every day. Every one of the media outlets that ran articles on Kristi Yamaoka thought it was newsworthy enough to be in their particular media outlet's output. It doesn't matter if it is a replica of a news wire article. The fact of the matter is hundreds of media outlets found the incident and the outcomes of it to be sufficiently news worthy. Trying to minimize the impact of this by saying the articles are replicates of each other entirely misses the point. Should we never include notable events in Wikipedia when such events only have one reporter handy to write a story first hand? --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

At this time, the correct decision is the one already made, which is to keep. WP is the place people should expect to be able to come and find information about transformative events and people such as this. <a href="../../../c/m/s/User%7ECmsb705_c5e9.html" title="User:Cmsb705">cmsb705</a> 28 March 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> clearly states "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Given all of the press attention, appearance on a number of TV shows, a call from the President of the United States, and ONGOING press coverage, the article clearly passes this requirement. The above statement that there is no news of her since March 11th is false as she's been mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> and been on the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Degeneres_c40a.html" title="Ellen Degeneres">Ellen Degeneres</a> Show of late. This article passes WP:BIO. If it doesn't, then a broad range of articles will need to be put up for AfD.

Furthermore, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Limitations_on_renomination" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Limitations_on_renomination</a> states in its first sentence that an article should not be immediately renominated unless there is a good reason for people to change their minds. The last AfD on this was 6 delete to 7 keep. In the 12 days since then, there's not anything to make this bio <i>less</i> notable, in fact rather the opposite. Currently, this AfD is 5 delete to 18 keep. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Suppose we have one "temporarily famous" person like this a week. That’s only 52 articles a year. In ten years there would be 520 people added to Wikipedia. There are 80286 entries in the Living people category. If every “person of the week” had been added to Wikipedia since its inception they would constitute less then .5% of the articles on living contemporary people. Ms. Yamaoka is probably closer to a person of the month on top of that. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeano1_3dfb.html" title="User:Seano1">Seano1</a> 21:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
