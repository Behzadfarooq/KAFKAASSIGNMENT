<p>Hoax. I would Prod this but I expect it'd be pulled. From the article <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a>: <i>Chessmaster 9000 comes with over 150 different personalities ranging from International Grandmaster strength down to Stanley, who is described as a monkey and plays what are essentially random moves. This simian personality has inspired a <b>fictitious</b> chess variant called Stanley Random Chess.</i> See also <a href="http://www.geocities.com/verdrahciretop/src.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/verdrahciretop/src.html" rel="nofollow">this.</a> Stand by for possible influx of chain-yanking. (N.B.: Please be careful how you vote - any vote, including BJAODN, may be taken by some admins as (effectively) a keep vote.

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> page was actually incorrect in describing SR Chess as "fictitious". While much of the commentary and purported history of SR Chess is clearly exaggerated and fictitious, and functions as a spoof and parody of serious chess commentary, the game itself is real, as can be verified from the website where it is actively played. Another user has since (correctly) emended the Chessmaster reference from "fictitious" to "humorous". <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 20:26, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. First off, AfD is no longer VfD and therefore we are not voting to delete or keep this article. Second, I'm really not sure what to make of this. References to this "game" have already been inserted into the articles of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29_7356.html" title="Mornington Crescent (game)">Mornington Crescent (game)</a> and elsewhere, yet I am very hard pressed to find anything on the internet about this game that has not been written by Mr. Topov. The author references a fan base that seems to include solely himself. I am going to hold off on a keep/delete decision for now, pending more information.
<dl>
<dd>Right, about AfD, but rather than "vote" perhaps I should say "traditional bolded one-word summary prepended to your argument (TBOWSPTYA)". I'm just pointing out that a TBOWSPTYA of (say) 5 Delete and 5 BJAODN can result in a closing of "No consensus, keep". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that if the fan base only included myself, it would be nonsense, but that is not the case. Two supporting references from external web-sites, to verify the above information:</dd>
<dd>* 1. <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html</a> This chessvariants.org site only lists bona fide playable chess variants, and does not publish hoaxes. The historical claims of SR Chess are disputable and much of the commentary is cloaked in humor, but its playability and authenticity as a real chess variant is genuine.</dd>
<dd>* 2. <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" class="external free" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15</a> This list gives the current games of Stanley Random Chess in progress at this correspondence chess server. Over 100 games of Stanley Random Chess have been played in the last ten days alone. In fact, an international tournament is currently in progress between ten players, as is evident here: <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" class="external free" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" rel="nofollow">http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520</a> This information can be verified with the webmaster of the schemingmind.com website, Austin Lockwood.</dd>
<dd>Two external contacts I can give: Tony Quintanilla, registered editor of chessvariants.org; and Austin Lockwood, webmaster of schemingmind.com. And dozens of schemingmind.com members who are actively playing the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can appreciate the scepticism, but in view of the above, the Chessmaster page is incorrect in calling Stanley Random Chess "fictitious." This is not the case, because SR Chess is in fact a real chess variant, admittedly inspired somewhat by the Stanley Random Chess personality from the Chessmaster software. By way of explanation, the game is a parody of chess in some respects, by featuring humorous commentary and analysis. But it is a real and serious chess variant, that is played actively online between human players, especially at schemingmind.com.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The game plays exactly like regular chess, but with some additional rules, as described in the wikipedia entry. The two main differences from regular chess are correctly described under the "Rules" section, i.e. approximately 50% of moves are randomly selected by a computer; and if the game goes beyond 30 moves, the game can apparently randomly end at any moment, the winner being the player with most material. If you try playing online at schemingmind.com, you will find these facts to be true, and that the game plays exactly in this way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short, although some of the historical claims and some aspects of the game are subject to exaggeration and humor (as referenced in the link posted by Herostratus), the game itself is not a hoax, because there are players actively playing Stanley Random Chess at a real correspondence chess server. If deemed necessary, the content on the wikipedia page can be modified to clarify this. If items like <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29_7356.html" title="Mornington Crescent (game)">Mornington Crescent (game)</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_%28game%29.html" title="Mao (game)">Mao (game)</a> can have Wikipedia entries, the same applies to Stanley Random Chess. The game has aspects of humor and secrecy, but it is a real and playable game, as any active member of the above-mentioned correspondence chess server can verify. I am quite willing to have the content modified or clarified to meet Wikipedia standards and satisfy those with concerns, but a valid entry for Stanley Random Chess is justifiable, especially since it is referenced by the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> article (albeit incorrectly as "fictional"). Feel free to direct me with specific suggestions about how I should modify the content to make it satisfactory.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 05:38, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's a great lot of words which I'll look at when I can, but your argument is not aided by the fact that the "Historical origins section of the article includes passages such as <i>"Documenting historical evidence that dates back to the early English monarchy..."</i> which links, as reference, to a page which says <i>"Until recently, it was incorrectly supposed that Stanley Random Chess owed its humble origins to... the lowest rated personality in the world-famous Chessmaster software... [but] Following concentrated studies of the Stanley family in early Britain... Goldman and Morgenstern provide solid evidence that the name "Stanley" originates with Sir Thomas Stanley (d. 1459)... The first mention of the game itself is found in historical accounts of the Ferrers family in 1137... In 1892, the Stanley Cup was sadly donated by the rebel Sir Frederick Arthur Stanley, from which time it was used as a trophy for amateur hockey in Canada. Frederick T. Stanley, who in 1843 founded The Stanley Works... was responsible for popularizing SR Chess in America..."</i> The game may well be real, but mixing such faux history with the actual game is probably not a good way to get an article kept on Wikipedia. Perhaps a general cleanup of the article would solve the problem, assuming of course that the game itself <i>is</i> real. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:20, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>. Good point. Even though the game is real (verifiable by the links above showing <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" rel="nofollow">current games</a> and a <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" rel="nofollow">current tournament</a> between multiple players), a Wikipedia article on the game should clear state that any claims about historical origins are exaggerated and intended to reflect humor rather than reality, even though the game itself is real. The same can be said about most commentary and analysis of the game, as described well below by another player of the game, <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/plyrprofile.aspx?profile_id=58" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/plyrprofile.aspx?profile_id=58" rel="nofollow">surfnsuds</a>. The paragraph on historical claims has currently been deleted by another editor - it probably should be reworked so that readers are informed about the wild claims, but made aware that while they are false the game itself is real, and that Monty Python style commentary is typically employed to accompany a real game, and is part of the attraction of the game. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 14:21, 23 March 2006 (UTC)Gregorytopov</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Update</b> It's real, and it's fun to play! I have played many games of Stanley Random Chess on Schemingmind.com over the last year or so. I enjoy it very much. It is worthwhile on a number of levels.</p>
<p>The game itself can be played to win, in spite of (and even taking advantage of) the random aspects (which are accurately described above, though I think the percentage of random moves are less than 50% as stated above - more like 30% is my guess). This aspect involves an exercise of basic statistics. The game also is unique in that one may make moves which in regular chess would appear to be blunders. However, again by playing the odds, you can frequently obtain advantage by making intentional "blunders". With study, you can determine which "blunders" can reault in advantage and which are not likely to. This aspect of the game to mind resembles bluffing in poker and is unique among the many chess variants I have played.</p>
<p>However, the most unusual and to my mind, the most fun aspect of the game is the tradition of creative, humorous commentary surrounding the game. The process is as mentioned above, similar to "Mornington Crescent" and the result reads more like Monty Python.</p>
<p>These points are intended to show that the game is viable and enjoyable for folks who tend to enjoy creative gaming. But they are my conclusions and opinions. Surely, however, the hundreds of games played to date at SchemingMind.com by dozens of players over the last year are a verifiable fact that proves the game is as real as tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>I am brand-new to Wiki and have not figured things out yet. Bear with me. I am NOT GregTopov, but I admire his creation.</p>

<ul>
<li>YES - much of the commentary and history of the game is fictional, for the sake of parody; in fact this is precisely one attraction of the game for creative players who enjoy adding to the imaginary traditions surrounding the game, and this is now clearly described and admitted as such in the revised form of the article.</li>
<li>NO - the game itself is not a hoax, but is a legal and fun chess variant, as can be verified from <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" rel="nofollow">this tournament</a> and <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" rel="nofollow">100s of current games</a> from multiple users (logging on as a guest may be necessary to view those pages).</li>

<dd><small><i><b>Refutation</b></i>, the Krabbe article correctly portrays typical SR Chess commentary, which as already noted is highly exaggerated and humorous in keeping with the spirit of the game.

<li><b>Good point</b>. Stanley Random Chess is just as notable as most of the other <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a> already on Wikipedia, if not more so given its active player base. As a matter of consistency, if it is not sufficently notable, then many of the other <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a> should also be deleted, since several of them only reference a chessvariants.org page for verification, and are thus even less notable and less verifiable than SRC.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The first and primary reason for AfD was "hoax". This reason is objectively false. The game is real; it does exist. Enough evidence has been provided to prove that to someone willing to follow the source references.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the discussion turned to questions of notableness. It was compared(?) to a water gun fight in someone's backyard. I think the rhetorical comparison actually illustrates that the game is notable. Please follow my logic.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a water gun fight; but, could a tug-of-war contest ever make the Wikipedia? There is a famous tug-of war contest between two cities on the Mississippi River. While only the Iowa and Illinois city have direct interest in the contest, surely its relationship to the Mighty Mississip, to commercial river navigation (which is halted during the contest), and its uniqueness would give sufficient notoriety to the contest to justify a Wikipedia entry, n'est ce pas?</p>
<p>So, how do I justify that SR Chess is notable? SR Chess is discussed in at least two languages and on at least three referrenced independent websites (four with Wikipedia). Hundreds of games have been played -- by players around the world. This real and notable game has legitimate strategical value (for instance, the random elements are no obstacle to the good SRC player winning the majority of his or her games).</p>
<p>The problem is perhaps not irrelevance, but irritation. While the psuedo-serious approach to the game by its adherents (of which I am one) seems to bother some persons, their distress over behaviour is clearly no reason to eliminate the article itself. I do not know in what form the article first appeared; but, it looks objective and unoffensive at this point.</p>
<p>Stanley Random Chess is a legitimate part of the growing realm of chess variants. Please allow the article to remain in Wikipedia.</p>

It's very tough reading at the moment for anyone who's wondering what the game actually is, and "too complex to summarize" sets off all the usual hoax alarms.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's chess. Chess (IMO) has a special status in human intellectual endeavor, IMO it is a field coequal in important ways to (although very much smaller than) music composition, art, and so forth, and a proper encyclopedia should recognize this. So if 100 people are playing this, that IMO is <i>much</i> more notable than if 100 (or 10,000) people are playing some variant of Pokemon or Magic:The Gathering or whatever. It <i>sounds</i> like a valid and reasonably useful extension of chess. Per the arguments above that it's accepted as such, I say keep.</li>

<dd>1. On more than one occasion Stanley Random Chess has been the subject of discussion in chess newsgroups and other websites (I even came across one instance where a user observed that he had checked Wikipedia trying to find accurate information about it); SR Chess was even referenced here in Wikipedia on the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> page prior to the creation of this article.</dd>
<dd>2. The number of people who play it is certainly not limited to 10 (although the question could be asked whether this would be true of some other <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a> with Wikipedia articles), in fact I'm not even participating in the present tournament involving 10 players.

<li><b>General comment</b>. As an aside, and as a newcomer to Wikipedia, I'd like to express appreciation for the patience shown me in learning how Wikipedia works, and for Wikipedia itself. I'm very impressed with and appreciative of the rigorous process required for publication here. In my ignorance, I was mistakenly of the impression that any Tom Dick or Harry could post their wild theories here (not that I counted myself among them). I'm finding that the method of peer consensus to approve and moderate content is very effective - I know that my article has already benefited from that, and rightly forced me to reshape its original form. I have learned from my experience with this that I can trust Wikipedia content to be quite reliable! Although I recognize that the article on Stanley Random Chess probably needs some further work, I have already made significant changes to the way it was originally submitted, and I now realize that in its original form, it was quite unacceptable and would (correctly) have raised many flags of alert. It should be noted that several of those who expressed themselves in favor of its deletion, did so in response to the article in its original form, not its present revised state. I hope that in its present revised form, with some further improvement and editing, can eventually be regarded as appropriate, honest, and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 19:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The bottom line here is that it's not a hoax. That was what the AfD was called for and it's clearly not true.

<dd>Sorry, I'm new to the AfD process, so forgive me if this is explained somewhere obvious, but - is this how the process actually works? The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">AfD page</a> just says that <i>"Articles for Deletion (AfD) (formerly Votes for deletion) is where Wikipedians discuss whether articles should be deleted."</i>, and I don't see how this rules out a discussion that moves away from the initial point. It looks like the system has been changed from "Votes for Deletion", so it's not about vote counting any more, it's about debate. So long as we don't delete this article purely for being a hoax, I don't see a problem. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 02:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's acceptable to delete an article for reasons other than the nominator's.

And I still say <b>delete</b> because even if not patent nonsense; I have yet to see any evidence of the encyclopedic nature of SRC as compared to the aforementioned backyard water pistol competition. Just being a chess variant is not sufficient. If it is being played by 10 people (or even 100 people) that too is not notable. The question is, is it a well-known and significant chess variant or not? IMO neither the above argument nor the sources demonstrate that it is. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 16:38, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
