Why? Because real cats seldom impact culture and generally become "famous" only by association with their owner. Ditto for dogs. I read the book 15 years ago and of all the things I remember from it: that fact that Anne missed a cat she left behind was not one of them.

<li><b>Keep</b> the information. There is no doubt whatsoever that Anne Frank is a famous person, yearly over 900,000 people visit the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_House_9cbc.html" title="Anne Frank House">house</a> she lived in <a href="http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=220&amp;LID=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=220&amp;LID=2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and her bestselling <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_2ad9.html" title="The Diary of a Young Girl">diary</a> is translated into at least 23 languages <a href="http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/annefrank/annefrank-lit4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/annefrank/annefrank-lit4.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Still, the cats don't play a crucial role in the diary and are only famous (if they even are) in relation to Anne Frank, so merging them could be a good solution to dissolve the dispute about this particular article. But there is no good reason why there can be several articles about <a href="../../../h/a/r/Category%7EHarry_Potter_magic_831a.html" title="Category:Harry Potter magic">Harry Potter magic</a> and not just one about <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank%27s_cats_4d61.html" title="Anne Frank's cats">Anne Frank's cats</a>. I consider the remarks about the names of the cats and their translation as the most interesting and encyclopedic information, I hope that this will be preserved. - <a href="../../../i/l/s/User%7EIlse%40_2e80.html" title="User:Ilse@">Ilse@</a> 21:42, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
