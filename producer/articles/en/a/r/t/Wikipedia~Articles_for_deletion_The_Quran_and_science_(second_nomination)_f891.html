He also ignored my request to include the fact that the Qur'an implies that the moon is farther from the earth than the stars are, and he also refused to include the fact that the Qur'an claims that mountains prevent earthquakes. He also refuses to mention the fact that the Qur'an depicts someone finding the muddy pool into which the sun sets. If there is a repeated and steadfast attempt to keep the article one-sided, is that not grounds for deletion? <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 21:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Well if people are actually going to be re-voting on this , I vote to speedy delete.

<li>Example <i>Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water?

The big bang was not a separation of sky with Earth or Universe with Earth .</li>
<li>Oh wait , I just noticed , while we are at it , the word "we" in "we made every living " implies a more than one , yet the tenets of Islam assert only one GOD, so right there is a contradiction in the Qur'an itself.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - That was largely the issue around which the first AfD revolved and a number of reliable sources were suggested. The fact that they have not been incorporated 18 hours after the previous one closed is perhaps less than surprising. If they haven't been incorporated sometime later - whether due to neglect or the intransigence of one or more editors - then we have more of an issue here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This may not be the correct way to view unsourced material; the reason for the failure to incorporate reliable sources may well be that they do not exist. I believe I saw Jimbo quoted as warning specifically against this line of reasoning, and may return to share this quote. I for one have never heard of any of these people, and am not clear that they are even notable, much less reliable. Faisal is more than welcome to work on this essay in his userspace and recreate it <i>if and when</i> there is something real here.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 03:21, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We may be talking at cross purposes here. There were a number of reliable sources suggested over the course of the original AfD, most of which have been sitting on the article's Talk page. Failure to incorporate same into the article in 18 hours is hardly a hanging offence, regardless of motivation. If the only thing that's preventing the incorporation of the sources suggested (and any others anyone can find) is the intransigence of a particular user, the problem is with the <i>user</i>, rather than the <i>article</i> and should be dealt with via other channels. Again, however, there's the time interval: I find it hard to believe that 18 hours of intransigence indicates a usage pattern that will continue ad infinitum. If it does, however, it's intransigence by the user rather than by the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Proabivouac did an excellent job of removing all of Faisal's original research (i.e. tenuous interpretations of the Quran) and leaving only Maurice Bucaille's (not that he's much better).

It should be clear to everyone from the facile analogies and silly captions that this article is more like a book you would give little Muslim children in third grade than it is an encyclopedia article.

Arrow740 needs to understand that it is part of Islam's reformation and Enlightenment for Muslims to go through the exercise in futility of showing the correlation between the Quran and Science. To me it is a template for what is not science so let them play with pseudoscience as eventually (and it will be a number of generations) they will realise the gap between what is faith and what is science can't be closed. This is what happened to Judaism, to Christianity and will happen to Islam.

<dd>There he goes again with his "dichotomy". But as to the recent AfD, since then at least one of the people behind this article (Aminz), having made a good faith effort to find sources, has come to the conclusion that there is no academic source for any of this material, pro or con. He quite reasonably suggested that we wait until such sources surface before proceeding with the article. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 08:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is inaccurate that Aminz came to that conclusion? See above. Also I meant since the previous AfD, but she might have written that on your talk page before it closed, I don't know. As regarding the sources itaqallah found, one is Maurice Bucaille's book, one appears to be published by the Saudi government (it is probably propaganda), and the third, Peter Hodgson's book, actually claims that Muslims go too far "by attempting to find detailed adumbrations of scientific knowledge there [in the Quran]]". It discusses Muslim scientists, and does not go into any of the wonderful detail that Ibrahimfaisal has.

<dd>no, i think Aminz's observation is inaccurate, read the comment in context of what you said. first: show me where i linked to Bucaille's book. i didn't. second, do you see where it says Bridgeview, Illinois? thirdly, Hodgson discusses the issue of Qur'an and Science, his own opinions of it, as well as notable Muslim opinions on it. that is certainly material which can be included in the article, esp. in the first three sections, and proves that the topic of qur'an and science is notable to merit inclusion in contrary to your claim that that "there is no academic source for any of this material, pro or con". so maybe it is you who needs to read a little more closely before rushing to respond with aggressive rhetoric. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However the list contains: Bucaille's book; a book only owned by one library in the western world (if the website is accurate. you yourself indicated that you could not get a hold of it on faisal's talk page); a book called Islam Questions and Answers, which doesn't appear to be immediately relevant; and not much else. Regarding Hodgson's book, he does not address what Faisal is trying to address with this article, which is the subject of coincidences between science and the Quran. He doesn't address the other side either, which this article should address. Regarding the book that I suspect to be Saudi propaganda. Publisher: Makkah, Saudi Arabia&#160;; Bridgeview, Ill.&#160;: Islamic Academy for Scientific Research, 1990. The fact that there is a front company in the US does not give the Saudi publisher and legitimacy; Saudi spends loads of oil money in the US funding mosques and <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawah.html" title="Dawah">Dawah</a>, so their involvement in publishing here is to be expected.

<dd>so Bucaille's book isn't "one" of the "sources" i "found", is it, Arrow? it's on a list, along with other notable books. "not much else"? try going through the several pages, a notable book pops up once in a while. don't forget the other books i mentioned which you did not comment on. "a book only owned by one library in the western world", a lot of books on that site which are notable or even reliable contain no library info at all. the categorising is, understandably incomplete, and your conclusion may be untrue. Hodgson's analysis is entirely relevant here, in the light of Aminz's objection ("I haven't been able to find even a single academic source either supporting or denying, <i>or even explaining the issue of the Qur'an and Science</i>"), unless you misunderstood what he said. Moore's book is also notable, and again his analysis is certainly relevant here. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't care who wrote it, if a book (Moore's book) is only published by the Saudi government it's worthless. I don't know about the Journal of the Islamic Medical Association, though. I would say that if something is on a list you are citing as proof of your point then yes, you found it. I entirely agree with that sentence of Hodgson's that I quoted, however by my standards it should not be included in the article, as he does not try to justify his opinion. However by the standards of this article it should be featured quite prominently. I will reiterate that if his book were to be used for any article that article would be called "Muslim science", as he does not attempt the point by point correlating that Ibrahimfaisal has been doing, and in fact dismisses it, as we should do.</dd>
<dd>Would you support removing quotes from Bucaille's book? You keep distancing yourself from it. It is not reliable. It is published by American Trust Publications, which is owned by the <a href="http://www.nait.net" class="external text" title="http://www.nait.net" rel="nofollow">North American Islamic Trust</a>, not an academic publisher, and probably financed by the Saudi government.</dd>

<dd>whether you "care" or not is irrelevant, what matters is if it is suitable for use on wikipedia, and it is. again, your "standards" are not relevant here. so you are saying i "found" 300+ publications? why then focus on Bucaille to the exclusion of the rest, including some that i explicitly mentioned from the list? you are clearly trying to shift the discussion by introducing red herrings, as you seem to do frequently. the issue was about whether there are actual sources which even discuss the topic of the qur'an and science, and there are. accusations of saudi govt backing are pretty meaningless, pointless, and merely an attempt to poison the well. i am not distancing myself from Bucaille, you keep trying to misrepresent my position by making it a debate about Bucaille, as you clearly feel more confident about criticising it than you do backing up claims that there is "no academic source", which is exactly what this particular discussion is about. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:02, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep; Overhaul</b> There is potential with the article, based on the title alone. But, the article is currently in a terrible state.

Citing <i>Blessed is He Who made the constellations in the heavens and made therein a lamp and a shining moon</i> as a prophecy of the fact that moonlight is a reflection from sunlight seems quite dubious; the connection is a far stretch. These juxtapositions throughout the article are presented in a manner that is not encyclopedic and neutral, but rather a manner that appears to imply that the Qur'an is a scientific marvel. We, as an encyclopedia, should be trying to avoid the appearance of promoting one holy book over all others as well as trying to source interpretations of holy texts.

<li><b>NOTE TO CLOSING ADMIN:</b> Meaning no disrespect to any particular user, there is an unmistakable correlation between religous persuasion and recommendations on this issue of an article which alleges that the sacred scripture of this religion may be proved to be the words of God himself by references to contemporary science. Furthermore, it it clear that users of this persuasion significantly outnumber those who don't share it on the majority of matters related to this subject, certainly including this AfD. It is difficult to see how, in these circumstances, Wikipedia's consensus-based procedural policies can be expected to yield encyclopedic results. The possibility of a vigorous open-minded <i>non-predetermined</i> debate is, with only a few exceptions, almost entirely absent here. I strongly urge you to consider the precedent that would be set by the "community"-based retention of articles like this one. Without a change in approach, or the involvement of a large number of editors who aren't particularly interested in these subjects (but how, when RfC's are nearly useless?), it is virtually guaranteed that we shall see a good deal more of the same. Please take a long hard look at this article and ask if this is the direction we should be taking; no gentle recommendations to follow source policies in the future will speak nearly as loudly as the fact that this nonsense was allowed to continue without check or sanction.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your "correlation" claim is <b>entirely false</b>: If you'd look at the comments, A large number of editors have voted Speedy Keep or Keep on the basis of the nomination itself being <i>way</i> too early after the previous AfD closed, with no bearing whatsoever on their religious inclinations. Or are you supposing that MARussellPESE, BigHaz, Indon, Alecmconroy, Ratherhaveaheart, Pablo D. Flores, Storkk, Ttiotsw and Irishpunktom are all Muslim? Really now. - <code><a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValarauka_53df.html" title="User:Valarauka">Valarauka</a><sup>(<a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValarauka_0f66.html" title="User talk:Valarauka">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valarauka_1a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valarauka">C</a>)</sup></code> 07:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At least three of the editors you've named are in fact Muslims. The correlation is not, however, that non-Muslim editors "vote" as a bloc - they do not, as you observe - but that <i>every</i> Muslim editor has "voted" to keep (though one subsequently changed his mind). 100% is a non-random and notable correlation, or would you disagree?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, ok. That correlation does exist, I agree, but I don't see how that makes the votes suspect, unless you're assuming bad faith on the parts of all the Muslim editors involved. I personally agree with most of the objections regarding OR, etc., and I think that removing them all to a subpage is a good first step; however, the fact is that the "Quran/Science" debate itself <i>does exist</i>, and is a valid topic for Wikipedia. The fact that the article isn't up to par yet isn't grounds for deletion, as was amply demonstrated in the previous AfD. - <code><a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValarauka_53df.html" title="User:Valarauka">Valarauka</a><sup>(<a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValarauka_0f66.html" title="User talk:Valarauka">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valarauka_1a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valarauka">C</a>)</sup></code> 07:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re good faith, Take a look at some of the usernames we see here, Truthspreader, Truthpedia, Islamiâ€¦They've not attempted to desceive you, have they? If you nurture the possibility that they mean to be neutral, it is not their bad faith that is to blame. Similarly, consult the userpage and contribution history of the editor who created this article. They are admirably upfront about why they participate; no assumption of "bad faith" is warranted or necessary.</dd>
<dd>"that the article isn't up to par <b>yet</b>â€¦" - "yet" is projection of a future outcome we've no reason to believe will ever exist. Such logic can support the retention of most anything on the grounds that reliable sources don't exist <i>yet</i>, when in fact this article <i>should never have been created</i> without them.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> I changed my vote while writing out these thoughts: I <b>might</b> be leaning towards changing my vote to keep as some of the edits have addressed some of the problems. I do not think its fair to say that this is a waste of time since the debate has definately improved the article in ways that might not otherwise have been accomplished. AfD often force a editor to take charge of the situation to improve an article that they want to see kept. I really feel like there should be an expansion of the criticism portion. I want to see an even balance between alleged proofs and alleged disproofs. I would like to see lots of references for both sides. I imagine that some of the references for each side could be the same as for Creationism in general even though much of the lit on that more directly addresses Christian claims. I think it would be nice to expand the article to include extra-Quranic sources such as the Peak of Eloquence. Perhaps then the title Quran and Science would be inaccurate though. Someone else can deal with that. No one's argument has affected my possible vote, but I am seeing an article that is sincerely trying to opt a less POV style, and incorporate more references. My main concerns are mainly the alleged history of revert wars to keep criticism out (<b>please</b> allow all sides into this article, otherwise it is not encyclopedic) as well as the extensive original research and unverifiabilty and non-notability of references used in the article as it stood when I first made my vote. I'm also sore about the lack of civility of Aminz to me, but that has nothing to do with the article. There is a general lack of civility here, and it is on both sides. You should not harshly criticize someone who renominates for AfD even if it is soon, since the renom was in good faith, made valid points and caused vast improvement on the article. OK I'm changing to <b>keep</b> so that I can see how it turns out. But I think we should keep an eye on it, and bring it to the crucible again in a month's time <b>IF</b> it doesn't continue to improve.
