<p>This article seems to be totally unintelligible to some mathematically astute WP editors, I have serious concerns about the history of edits of this article (some major contributions by 'Cruise' or 'David Cruise' and links to external sites which mention 'D. Krus') In its current state, the article is quite possibly OR, and fails to give any sensible definitions of the concepts it claims to be about. Reason the page should be deleted Madmath789 22:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC) and <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 16:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was previously listed as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Homogeneity_9e9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homogeneity">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homogeneity</a> however the content of the page in question was cut and pasted into <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">Homogeneity (statistics)</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">Homogeneity</a> was turned into an uncontriversal disambig page.

<dd><b>Conditional keep</b> I'm not an advanced math guy, but the history suggests that this has been taken seriously by a number of editors and expanded. It would be good to get a statistics expert to take a peek at it. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 22:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> it sounds like an application of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneous_space.html" title="Homogeneous space">Homogeneous space</a> to stat but my statistics classes weren't that good and they were a while ago now. --<a href="../../../p/b/o/User%7EPboyd04_487e.html" title="User:Pboyd04">Pboyd04</a> 01:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have moved the material that WAS at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneous.html" title="Homogeneous">homogeneous</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">homogeneity</a> and redirected <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneous.html" title="Homogeneous">homogeneous</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">homogeneity</a>, and moved what WAS at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">homogeneity</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a> and added a cleanup tag. That that is how the material should be apportioned among the article titles is obviously required by simple common sense. So a question arises: Should this AFD tag be put on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>? I've only superficially glanced at the material; it appears to be one of those things used in statistics applied to psychology that are better-known among statisticians in psychology departments than anyone else. More later... <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 14:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Confused issue</b> Hmm - I think that has somewhat muddied the waters, and I am not sure that moving an article in the middle of an AfD discussion was best thing to do. The material which I think is utter gobble-de-gook, and which caused the original AfD is now at: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>. I am a reasonably competent mathematician, and have taught statistics for many years, but this article seems to be almost meaningless pseudo-maths, and has already been described by other editors of maths articles as "whacky" and "... like abracadabra ... ". What is the next step? should I tag <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a> as AfD? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmath789_8910.html" title="User:Madmath789">Madmath789</a> 14:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> probably simplest to withdraw this AfD and start a new one for <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>. The two current votes could be copied across. I generally agrees with Hardy that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity.html" title="Homogeneity">Homogeneity</a> should be a disambig page or a redirect to one. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 15:50, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Week keep</b> and extensive rewrite. Basically it looks like there is not much stats going on here. We have a set of fairly standard correlation matricies correlating the variables p,q,r. The authors have then taken examples of a few special cases where there is a logical relation between the variables, say p implies q and given examples of the resulting correlation matricies. The illustrations don't really illustrate the mathematics well. Some of the matricies look suspect, no examples of real data are given, just synthetic data, giving 0 for some correlation coefficients where you would really expect some small non zero numbers for real data.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There does seem to be a core of something worthwhile here, there is certainly important statistics concerning hierarchal statistics, which I brushed across in my PostDoc days.</dd>
<dd>I'm less certain that this material is correctly titled, or the concept of homogenity in statistics is adaquatly represented by this page. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 19:59, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Walk into a math library, pick up a journal of a branch you do not specialize in, and it is likely (very) to look like gobbledygook. Ditto for electrical engineering, chemistry, or virology. The appearance of gobbledygook to a non-specialist should not be a criterion for deletion. The journals and authors cited are certainly not made up (Chronbach! He wrote the book used in a tests and measurements book I had decades ago.) This article appears to be perhaps written by an expert in a subfield. Meta-analysys is real. However, the article is way less approachable than the article on, say analysis of variance, which is far less technical but of far greater application. I agre one can have more than a nodding acquaintance with stats, read the article, and still not be sure what it is about. More definition and some simple explanations would be good.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per arguments made by Edison, immediately above. In fact, when I go into a math library, I make a point of picking up a journal in an area I do not specialize in, and I make a concerted effort to read and understand it. And, amazingly, I often can understand it, because it is usually well-written. If the topic is particularly difficult, good articles do provide overview sketches for the required background. The problem with this article is not that it deals with a difficult, abstract topic, but rather that it is so poorly written, that one cannot make sense out of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 18:03, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
