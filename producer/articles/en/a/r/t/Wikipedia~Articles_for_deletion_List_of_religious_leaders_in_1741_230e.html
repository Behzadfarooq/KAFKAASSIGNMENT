<p>This is not what it purports to be, (a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List.html" title="List">list</a>) but a single entry. I don't see any reason to have a list of religious leaders from each year in history, so I believe this page is unecessary. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">ÅrÐ£nT</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCCC"><sub>∈</sub></font></a> 02:59, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think if we had an actual list like this, it would be great. Even if this was the only year we covered, it'd be good. Unfortunately this is rather weak. The originator of the article could at least have named the pope at the time. I suppose I'll go and do that. Marginal keep, just to encourage the creation of a real list. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:19, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You make a point, but I think a page for every year is excessive. by century, or even by decade would constitute more of an actual list since religious leaders are often the same for many years. Perhaps a change to List of religious leaders in the 1700s or 1740s would be appropriate? Awaiting concensus. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">ÅrÐ£nT</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCCC"><sub>∈</sub></font></a> 08:34, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, no need to make a list entry for every single year. I think one for the 1700s and so on with sections for each decade would suffice. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:48, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that might be better; perhaps start out with centuries and then move to individual articles on decades if the list really fills up. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:49, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Weak <b>Delete</b>, cumbersome. If allowed this would set a precedent of allowing religious leaders for every year to be created and I dont think that is either practical nor necessary, even <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_leaders_by_year.html" title="State leaders by year">State leaders by year</a> was a bad idea to begin with. What's wrong with simply having just a List of religious leaders? Unlike state leaders, religious leaders aren't in and out of power that often, so many years would be repetitive. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 23:56, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> now, but as nominated it was a delete. I've formatted it as specified by the wikiproject and removed Edwards, who shouldn't have been on the list. Now it's back to having a single name, but hopefully it will grow.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> by different sort. I'll go against the crowd here and say theres no reason for something like this sorted by year. By decade, alright, but having one year out of the entire eighteenth century and it having only one entry seems pretty useless and the other pages by year are just as bare. I agree with Megan above, religious leaders tend to stick around for much longer periods. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 07:52, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems dumb. What is notable about the state of world-wide religion in 1741 that we need a list of the religious leaders in that particular year. Even dumber would be to add a few thousand articles to the Wikipedia with the list of religious leaders in each year. The list for Y would generally be nearly identical, if not actually identical, to Y-1, because religions don't change their leaders frequently. Anyway, why would anyone ever need/want to know who all the religious leaders in the world were in a particular year. Lists like this just make Wikipedia seem stupid, and diminish its authority. In one of Jorge Borges' stories, there is a hilarious list of "lists", including Objects that from a long way off look like flies. I'm expecting to see that as an article on Wikipedia any day now. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:43, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've come to think it could be a good point of reference if one was doing research on religion, but yes, a list for every year does seem excessive. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">ÅrÐ£nT</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCCC"><sub>∈</sub></font></a> 22:50, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. At first blush, tracking religious or political leaders by year over a period of many centuries seems like vast overkill, but people have actually been obsessive-compulsive enough to do it pretty thoroughly for the heads of state/government, so why not for religious leaders as well? <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">Dtobias</a> 15:51, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
