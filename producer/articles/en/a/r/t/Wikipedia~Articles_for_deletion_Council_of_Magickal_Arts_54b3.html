<li><b>Keep</b>: (I am the article's author) I can (and will) argue that CMA has, within the worldwide Neopagan community, considerable notability. However, seeing as how I just this afternoon started this page, as a stub, it is kind of absurd to instantly slap an AfD tag on it. Nardiman originally tagged this page as db-spam, apparently without actually reading it, then changed his mind after I spoke up, and now he proposes it for deletion. Wouldn't it have been easier to just admit his error, remove the db-spam tag, and give me some time to develop the article? --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

<dd>How can you possibly make a statement like <i>"Saying it's a registered 501 c means absolutely nothing, that has not been verified..."</i>? Do you happen to know what 501(c)(3) means? It means they are a tax-exempt religious organization and recognized as such by the IRS. It means donations to the org are tax-deductible, for one thing. Do you think that is something you can just claim on your website without it being a fact? What would convince you? I am PRETTY sure the IRS does NOT post a list of all 501(c)(3)'s anywhere. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

<dd>FYI, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_8d7d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion">deletionists</a> are primarily out to destroy other's work rather than contribute to wikipedia, so it's best to just ignore them. They usually go after small grass-roots groups and particularly like to prey on new editors.

<dd>If someone had bothered to actually READ what I wrote, I did not say it wasn't notable, and I said notability wasn't even the issues. I said that no one had any verifiable sources.

<dd>Speedy deletion, yes. I agree, the speedy that the article had was out of line, and you did right with the hangon. The Deletion process *is* working correctly.</dd>
<dd>I'll break it down for you. IF your article is both notable (which it may or may not be) and verifiable (which means you would have added sources) then deletion nominations are a joke. Take <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starwood_Festival_bc88.html" title="Starwood Festival">Starwood Festival</a>. Horribly written spam sounding article. But it has plenty of sources, from places that have nothing to do with the festival directly. Books, newspapers, mainstream blogs, etc. You say that the Council of Magical arts is important , and the article claims that it's one of the larger pagan thingies (festivals, what have you) in the world. WHY CAN'T YOU PRODUCE A SINGLE INDEPENDANT SOURCE? You haven't got anything that even demonstrates a shred of notability.

<dd>Here's the thing... JChap says that published books that mention CMA in lists of festivals is not significant, but you have to realize that CMA has been holding these festivals twice a year for 27 years! Yes, CMA does not sponsor a chair at a university, or fund research into <i>why hamsters have no hair on their tongues</i> but what they do is what they do... 2 festivals a year and 4 journals. Longevity, particularly in ANYTHING alternative, is notable. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

For "council of the magickal arts" I get 259 ghits (we have had this problem for years as many add "the" although it is not correct).

<dd>The question is whether the posts are reliable (and Cuhulain did not write any of the posts cited in the article). The posts contain the personal experiences of attendees of the festivals and are not an attempt at doing any sort of reporting (and I don't think they were intended as such). There is nothing wrong with that, of course.

<p><b>reset indenting</b> A newspaper or magazine publishes information of interest to their readers, and which they believe will sell papers. A website of the longevity and quality of The Witches Voice publishes articles, essays and news items of interest to their readership, which they believe will generate traffic and fulfill their stated mission. Sure, there are portions of the site that are user-generated and of less than stellar notability, but the editorial portions of the site are considered of high notability among the community in question, namely Neopagans. What I responed to, regarding Kerr Cuhulain, was your disparaging tone when you referred to witchvox as <i>a place where witches go and write posts about organizations they are involved with or events they attend</i>. I find it really amazing that a project that seeks to use the Internet as a tool to create this vast encyclopedic reference is so inherently dogmatic in its distrust of the medium it lives in. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

<dd>No one's being dogmatic or disparaging. slate.com is frequently cited here (to take one of many examples of online publications that are considered reliable sources). The reason that the three posts cited in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Magickal_Arts_6ed4.html" title="Council of Magickal Arts">Council of Magickal Arts</a> article we are discussing do not qualify as reliable sources is that they were obviously written to convey a personal experience, rather than as part of a concious attempt to collect and report objectively on information, such as would be undertaken by a journalist, academic or professional author. There's nothing wrong with writing about one's personal experience, of course. Such writing does not fall within the definition of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, however. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 23:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you know how many new articles that , on first glance, "look okay" are spam? How many are created and never touched again? Thousands. Literally thousands. If I come back to the average article in a month's time, it's still going to be crap. Example that you can relate to: Free Spirit Gathering. Not a source in sight, and it's been here since April. It is NOT biting or violating AGF to ask that you follow the policies. Was it speedy tagged too quick, maybe. But your article reads like vanity spam. I'm sorry, but it does, and that's what I suspect got such a rapid response. I'm not going to nom Free Spirit Gathering for deletion, but there are plenty of articles like that "under the radar", and saying "Well, you can't kill spammy looking unsourced articles" isn't right. When I make a new article, even a stub, I always include at least two sources. And if I can't THEN I DON'T MAKE THE ARTICLE.
