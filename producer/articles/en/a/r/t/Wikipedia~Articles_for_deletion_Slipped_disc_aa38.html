<li><b>From the article:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Some of the terms commonly used to describe the condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc, and the misleading expression "slipped disc." Other terms that are closely related include disc protrusion, bulging disc, pinched nerve, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sciatica.html" title="Sciatica">sciatica</a>, disc disease, disc degeneration, <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degenerative_disc_disease.html" title="Degenerative disc disease">degenerative disc disease</a>, and black disc.</b></li>
<li><b>The popular term <i>"<a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">slipped disc</a>"</i> is quite misleading, as an intervertebral disc, being tightly sandwiched between two <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebrae.html" title="Vertebrae">vertebrae</a>, cannot actually "slip," "slide," or even get "out of place." The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched, and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot "slip."</b></li>

<ul>
<li>I would only agree that a re-direct is appropriate if you can demonstrate that "slipped disc" is used to refer to only a herniated disc, and never some other sort of spinal problem. Based on the opening sentence of the slipped disc article, this does not appear to be the case. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 12:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

If there are other uses of the term, then they can either be discussed in the new article -- <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a> -- or a real disambiguation page can be used to replace this one. Whatever happens, the contents of this one have already been merged, and the problematic nature of the term "slipped disc" explained there. That would be the logical place to do it, but I'm open to discussing it. I have left several messages on talk page.

<dd>Fyslee, I think from past experience, that people tend to vote <b>Keep</b>, <b>Delete</b>, or <b>re-direct</b> based on which solution they think most appropriate. The fact that people are voting <b>keep</b> indicates to me that the article should remain as an article, rather than as a re-direct to a different article, which addresses a different subject. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 12:41, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The new article was created by including all the content from this one, and adding much more new content. I (a Physical Therapist) and Dematt (a chiropractor) did most of the work, and other medical personnel, including MDs, helped. It has been well-accepted. The term slipped disc is a misleading expression for the subject of the new article. It does not describe a "different subject." -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 12:46, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fyslee, can you please explain why the article needs to be deleted and redirected rather than simply redirecting it? Also, you keep saying it "should have been deleted". Should have been according to who? Was there a previous AfD? I don't understand why the article can't be kept under a redirect, particularly if, as others above say, it includes additional information that might be useful in the future.

<dd>Fine with me. Just as long as the redirect is left in place, and the article isn't edited. This article hadn't been edited since August 30, 2006, since all the editors back then -- PT, DC, MD -- all agreed a new one would be better. The new article is much better, and a well-accepted improvement here. Articles that are turned into redirects should not be edited or revived, or even linked to directly. A way to use the term, if one has no qualms about perpetuating the use of a misleading term, is to do this:</dd>

<dd>In that case, Fyslee, I suggest we simply redirect the page and keep the old article in the history. If Rebroad feels there is material in the old article that needs to be merged into the new one, he is welcome to do so. I think everyone but Rebroad has qualified their "keeps" as redirects so there seem to be consensus here to redirect. If the other party refuses to accept that, we can look at protecting the redirect. But unless there's a particular reason to delete, I think redirecting should be sufficient. <b>Sarah</b> 14:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

An upset stomach covers a number of conditions of which indigestion is only one.<a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Comment - definitely agree. Thanks Nuttah68, that was the first example I found. Hopefully you got the idea that the "lay" term is redirected to a "medical" term. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 15:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm happy with that as long as someone answers the question that seems to be at the heart of this. Can you confirm that the term slipped disc is used only to mean Disc herniation? If it is then the redirect is fine However, if slipped disc can refer to more than one condition a simple redirect will be no more helpful than the current upset stomach article. In this case we need an article at slipped disc explaining how it can refer to more than one condition and linking to the appropriate articles. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is a very good point and deserves consideration. I would expound by asking if someone can come up with another condition that cannot be covered in the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a>, then I would agree. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 16:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem at the moment is that not many people will have heard of terms other than "slipped disk", and therefore a) won't search for the other terms, and b) won't understand what other articles mean unless they use this term. I think it was going OTT to change all articles referring to slipped disk to a term that no one would be familiar with. The best way to educate people as to what a slipped disk is is to continue using this terminology but to explain what it means and also what it doesn't mean. Uses of words change over time. For example, "gay" no longer means what it used to. It should not be up to the medical profession alone to decide the future of the meaning of "slipped disk" especially if it is a term the medical profession themselves chose NOT to use. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 15:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rebroad, maybe you misunderstand. That is the reason for a re-direct; so that if someone searches for <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">Slipped disc</a> it will go to the article that covers what they are really looking for. The medical profession stopped using the term because it misled people and anything that would be in an article with that name would be lay language and unhelpful - all they would be doing is repeating that it is misleading and link them to <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a>. They don't need to know what the other words mean. The article that they are re-directed to explains that well, I think. But you are welcome to improve it if you think it needs it. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 16:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect and protect</b>. (Also change all links which were <i>recently</i> edited to point to <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">Slipped disc</a> to point back to the original target, but that would have to be done on an article-by-article basis.) All information from the August redirect was included in the target article, and it <i>should</i> redirect.

<li><b>Redirect and protect</b> per Arthur Rubin, with note on talk page as to why redirect is proteced. The merge already ocurred; links pointed to the new, accurate article. There was no reason to return the old "Slipped disc" article and change the redirects, as that article has been superceded with one under the accurate term. As far as "other meanings" given in the intro to "Slipped disc", the only ones I see which do not mean Herniated disc are <i>pinched nerve, sciatica and degenerative disc disease</i> - which are not cited, and not even in the See also of the article, so that seems to be very bad editing rather than a valid concern. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 17:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> then all searchers for "slipped disc" will get to the right place, and that article can be made excellent. Actually, I'd collapse it even further, putting disc protrusion and herniation into one article. Rewriting as a fork was/would be a retrograde step. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 21:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect and protect</b> reading Arthur and KillerChihuahua's explanation makes this sound a no brainer. I think a delete is to be avoided since slipped disc is common terminology. The presense of a redirect has an educational component, in that the correct term is then discovered rather than it appearing there is no article on the subject. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 22:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. There does seem to be a lot of confusion here. I do not support there being two articles, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">Slipped disc</a>. Anything in the latter that has not already been added to the former should be merged into the former. The article should then be made a redirect with its history intact. I think protecting it might well be a good idea if "merge and redirect" is the final conclusion to seal that conclusion in place. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
