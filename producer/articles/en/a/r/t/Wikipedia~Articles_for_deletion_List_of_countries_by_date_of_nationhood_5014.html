<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>

<p>The lead of the article pretty well sums up the reasons for why the list should be deleted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nation-building is a long evolutionary process. It is therefore practically impossible to come up with a single date for a nation's "birth".</li>
<li>The following list is mainly based on data published by the CIA, and is therefore restricted to nations whose independence is recognised by the USA.</li>
<li>The situation is futher complicated by the confusion between the terms nation (genereally considered an ethnic or cultural grouping) and state (an independent political entity).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no way to make this list useful, let alone NPOV. What makes it particularily biased is the chronological order which suggests that some nations are "older" than others. Still, many nations are listed more than once, with different dates.</p>
<p>I know many people have put considerable effort into the development of this list, but this cannot be an excuse for keeping a useless and biased article on WP. –&#160;<a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a> <a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a> 00:16, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful and informative. As for your objections:
<ol>
<li>Yes, it certainly is. That's why several nations are listed with more than one date. I consider it very appropriate.</li>
<li>Since creation of this list, it has been greatly expanded with data from other sources. Btw, "nations whose independence is recognised by the USA" is pretty much the same as "nations whose independence is recognized by some country", with Northern Cyprus, Palestine, Taiwan, and Western Sahara being the only contemporary exceptions I can think of.</li>
<li>This is a purely technical issue, that can be solved by rewording the introduction, or perhaps renaming the article.</li>

<li>No, it's no good either. I'm afraid you can't escape a US-centric perspective. Nationhood or statehood not always equals independence. Many countries have existed since times immemorial but later lost and regained independence. For instance, Poland has existed since mid-10th century and the traditional date of Poland's statehood is 966. But because Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century and regained sovereignty after WW1, the date of independence is November 11, 1918. Poland's just an example, there are many more countries with similar histories. Perhaps, if the list is to stay (as it clearly is) it might be good to split it into (at least) to lists: one for countries by date of nationhood, and one for countries by (most recently regained) independence. The US, then, would be near the bottom of the former, and near the top of the latter. –&#160;<a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">Kpalion</a> <a href="../../../k/p/a/User_talk%7EKpalion_7aef.html" title="User talk:Kpalion">(talk)</a> 17:33, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>O.K., I'm going to start with the problems one by one. The problem of <i>why shouldn't I redirect/move a VfD page</i> is dealt with in both <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>, an article you should have read before voting on a VfD, and in <a href="../../../p/e/d/User_talk%7EPedroPVZ_5c0b.html#List_of_countries_by_date_of_nationhood_VfD" title="User talk:PedroPVZ">the message I left you on your talk page</a>. Problem 2 is that moving this article is somewhat contentious and is not an opinion shared by the majority, some people want it moved to a different place, AND the title your moved it to is misspelled (capitalized "independence") and is disagreed with for various reasons. Your going ahead and moving it anyway shows a lack of respect for other's opinions. I also mentioned this on your talk page. Problem 3 is that you lied and said that you didn't know it was in VfD (three posts up), and when I called you on it, you said, "so what? It should be redirected again," which I take to mean that you don't paticularly care for the opinions of others, and that you didn't bother to read my message, which is what talk pages are for, or <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>. That's "so what." --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 16:37, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pedro <i>did</i> go ahead and move the article, unfortunately. I'll move it back and change the new <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_date_of_Independence_15c8.html" title="List of countries by date of Independence">List of countries by date of Independence</a>, which is what he moved it to, to a redirect page. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 00:42, August 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Never mind. Just tried and it looks like I can't do that. Well, that's unfortunate. Instead, I'm going to put a notice on the talk page with a link to this VfD so that at least there's some way to get here. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 00:47, August 27, 2005 (UTC)
