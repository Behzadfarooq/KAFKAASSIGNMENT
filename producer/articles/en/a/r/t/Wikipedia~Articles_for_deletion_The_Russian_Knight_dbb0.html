<p><b>Delete</b>. Hopeless. Not to say that "<a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">Knight</a>" is a misleading translation of the russian word <i>Vityaz,</i> which is simply "warrior", with connotation "brave, valiant warrior"; see more at Talk:The Russian Knight. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:08, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> research is valid, only some of it isn't backed up with a source. Also a knight is a warrior, therefore "Vityaz" does mean knight.<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenrin13_e688.html" title="User talk:Henrin13">user talk:Henrin13</a>

<li>Your logic is wrong. A <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> is a warrior, so "vityaz" must be a samurai.

<li><b>Create an article <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vityaz.html" title="Vityaz">Vityaz</a> and redirect</b> this Russian knight there. Google finds &gt;21000 hits on Vityaz (in latin letters), so I assume it is an English word now. I suspected many English-speakers might look into Wikipedia to understand what the word exactly mean (I, been a native Russian speaker, would be interested as well). According to my understanding Vityaz as a professional warrior, usually on a horse, in armour and with proper weapons. He is much more real than Bogatyrs, but still has some folklore connections. Part-time warriors like Bogatyr Mikula Selyaminovich are never refer as Vityazes, despite been valiant and able.
<dl>
<dd>While he was a professional warrior, he was not necessarily mounted (at least 30 of them were not&#160;:-). Also, wikipedia is not interested in "your understanding". Did you see anything specific on net? As for &gt;21,000 hits (+ 11,000 for <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitiaz.html" title="Vitiaz">vitiaz</a>), the majority of them are various names of things of Russian production (and many of them do fit encyclopedia), so it is not exactly an English word. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 06:05, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Instead of deleting it why don't people who know about the subject of russian knights/warriors, simply improve the article. Because after all there were such a thing as "Russian" Knights and they <b>were</b> different in appearence from the European and other slavic ones.I have seen and read some books (mostly in Russian) which contain information about Russian Knights, which meens that they did exist. Unfortunatly there simply is no name such as "samurai" to describe Russia's particular type of knight. Also, on a side note, I have seen various figurines of <b>Russian</b> Knights posted on the internet and in stores, so obviously people must recognize that they have existed.<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenrin13_e688.html" title="User talk:Henrin13">user talk:Henrin13</a>
<dl>
<dd>There were Russian warriors. There were no Russian knights, just as there were no Mongolian knights, no Egyptian knights, no Papua knights. One may call the figurines of lightly armored Russian warriors "Russian knights" to boost their business, but it is not for encyclopedia. the word "knight" has certain complex associations, not transferrable unto early military of Rus.

<li>Alright, then what would everyone say if an article on the <b>Russian Warrior</b> was created? I hope no one would have a problem with that. I just want to educate people on the fact that Russia also had warriors. The article isn't finished by the way. I just started it and was planning to write about certain battles and warriors of Kievan Rus, Novgorod, Muscovy, ect. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenrin13_e688.html" title="User talk:Henrin13">user talk:Henrin13</a>

<dd>You will probably run into several troubles with this as well, from other people. I will not go into detail, but there are three problems with this title (not to say about a trifle that the proper style would be Russian warrior). First, a "politically correct" term would be "Early East Slavic", rather than Russian (judging from your intentions). Second, there was no single kind of "warrior"; there were many categories of them, both by social organization and by specialty. Third, all this was changing with time. So I strongly suspect that this title is way too general for your knowledge. Finally, I would not strongly objects against the current article either, but if you excuse me, it is so naively incorrect, primarily by the above three reasons. So I will strongly suggest to use some serious sources, rather than Internet sites. There is so much garbage, lots of Russian pseudohistry, because there is no <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> in the internet, everyone publishes their petty theories, some of which are really crazy, e.g., explanation of the name "Rus" from the meanings of the sounds "r", "u", "s". 00:04, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you for your opinion. Like I said before if anyone would like to help save this article then feel free to do so. I will start another one, on this same topic in the near futur, if it does get deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have a few problems with this article... most of which have already been enumerated above. It's unsourced and seems to have a large element of original research. It is also non-verifiable... and the term appears to be a neologism. That being said, I understand what the author is trying to do here, but as pointed out, is it correct to call this facet of the Slavic military at that time "Knights"? From what I'm reading in this article, they don't appear to bear any real resemblance to what the definition of a knight is. Even calling it Russian Warrior is problematic because of the problems pointed out above, but also because it is unclear to me how "Russian Warrior" merits distinct mention over say "Polish Warrior" or "Chinese Warrior". The term is also detached from the time period you are trying to target. A better route might be to create an article on Early East Slavic Warfare, or something along those lines where you could detail the things that set Early East Slavic military tactics, arms, and armor apart from any other military organizations of the time period... provided you can properly source this of course. You could also make mention of the bogatyr motif, etc. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:11, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
