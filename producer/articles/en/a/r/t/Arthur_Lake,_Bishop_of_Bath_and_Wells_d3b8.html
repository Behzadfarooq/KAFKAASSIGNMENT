There is no unequivocal evidence for this but the initials "AL" appear throughout the notes of the General Committee of Review and no other candidate has been proposed.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">26 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/0/1608.html" title="1608">1608</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Still_39bd.html" title="John Still">John Still</a> died and James Montague, Dean of Worcester, succeeded him as <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells_030d.html" title="Bishop of Bath and Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>. Three days later the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_of_Westminster_e1a8.html" title="Dean of Westminster">Dean of Westminster</a> wrote to Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Lake_b6bd.html" title="Thomas Lake">Thomas Lake</a>, asking whether his brother would like to be appointed to the Worcester deanery, or would rather wait for Winchester. Arthur Lake chose to be dean of Worcester, was presented by the King on 18 April, and installed on 23 April. He assisted the chapter to buy in a long lease of certain cathedral lands, which had been illegally made, and was instrumental in the setting up of a great organ in the cathedral itself; he also founded the cathedral library.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/1/1616.html" title="1616">1616</a> he resigned the archdeaconry of Surrey and later that year he became <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells_030d.html" title="Bishop of Bath and Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>. His election on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a> received royal assent the next day. His archbishopric was confirmed on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">6 December</a> and consecrated at <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambeth_Palace_2367.html" title="Lambeth Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> two days later. His enthronement was held on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/1/1617.html" title="1617">1617</a> and the King appointed him Keeper of the Great Seal. He was knighted in August the same year. He continued to hold his other offices as well as his bishopric. He was warden of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_College%2C_Oxford_e952.html" title="New College, Oxford">New College</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-chancellor.html" title="Vice-chancellor">vice-chancellor</a> of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> until July 1618, and he held the living of Stanton St John along with his bishopric until his death. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fuller_8398.html" title="Thomas Fuller">Thomas Fuller</a> noted that he was promoted "not so much by the power of his brother, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Lake_b6bd.html" title="Thomas Lake">sir Thomas</a>, as his own deserts, as one whose piety may be justly exemplary to all of his order". <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Smith_6e7f.html" title="Richard Smith">Richard Smith</a>, another of his contemporaries, was much impressed by his great humility, temperance, affability and contempt of riches. Smith described him as one of the ‘greatest benefactors of our times’ who ruled his household well.</p>
<p>His probity was demonstrated when on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a> his brother <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Lake_b6bd.html" title="Thomas Lake">Thomas</a> was freed from prison (where he had been held for slandering the Countess of Exeter) and handed over to Arthur’s custody.</p>
<p>Arthur Lake spent the last eight years of his life in quiet industry at Wells. Izaak Walton, said that he made "the great trust committed to him the chief care and whole business of life". He was a preached often in the cathedral and the adjacent parishes and he strived to improve the standard of preaching throughout his diocese. Unlike many bishops who relied on others to examine candidates for ordination he conducted such examinations personally.</p>
<p>He died on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a> <a href="../../../1/6/2/1626.html" title="1626">1626</a>. His tomb may still be seen in <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wells_Cathedral_136e.html" title="Wells Cathedral">Wells Cathedral</a> and his collection of 300 books forms the basis of the cathedral library.</p>
