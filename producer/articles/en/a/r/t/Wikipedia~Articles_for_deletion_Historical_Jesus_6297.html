<li>I have no wish to defend the contents of this article - but the title is valid and quite distinct from those mentioned above. 'The Historical Jesus' is a regular academic title for Jesus reconstructions and even university courses - it is used by believers and revisionists alike (it asks what 'was Jesus really about' and may or may not conclude that this is the same as the NT's view). There is a whole history of scholarship here which could neutrally be recorded in an article. The question of the 'Historicity of Jesus' ('did he exist') is actually seldom debated in mainstream scholarship - and so to merge the mainstream into a peripheral discussion would be POV. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 12:22, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, this article is rubbish. It says it "presents a critical reconstruction of the Historical Jesus" - well that has no place in an encyclopaedia, as it will always be POV. What, IMHO, should be here is a record of the various critical reconstructions that scholarship has offered over the last 200 years. Not 'did Jesus exist?', but 'what kind of Jesus existed?'. I've simply been arguing that this title deserves an article. I understood Vfd was not the place for articles that had content problems, but for articles that shouldn't exist (that may be a moot point). If this is deleted, I'm willing to write/help a new scholarly article. If it is kept, I'll (help) re-write it - but either solution may take me some time. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:09, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> This is certainly no redundant fork. Important term widely used.

<dd>The opening paragraph is good. <b>Childhood and family background</b> needs a lot more than just Biblical reference. One thing I know of is that there is some belief that "Doubting" Thomas was Jesus' twin. It should also mention his name was probably <i>Yeshua</i> (Joshua), but that "Jesus" derives from the Greek transcription "Iesou" (Greek having no equivalent of our "Y" sound, /j/ in IPA). It mentions this briefly toward the end, but this should really be at the beginning of the article. <b>Works and miracles</b> is a bit better about using extra-Biblical info (altho there's some stuff there that doesnt belong in that category). The last two sections are basiclly just rehashing the Biblical account without giving much outside info. Also, it mentions in passing the belief that Jesus was not a historical figure, but doesn't really expound upon it. Something else: I've heard that some scholars think that Nazareth was founded (I believe) around 70 BCE, therefore, as the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> article says, "Such historians argue that <i>Iesou Nazarene</i> was not 'from Nazareth', but rather that his title was '<a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarene.html" title="Nazarene">Nazarene</a>.'" -<a href="../../../t/y/d/User%7ETydaj_1a42.html" title="User:Tydaj">Tydaj</a> 16:37, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Other stuff: The article opens, <i>"This article presents a critical reconstruction of the Historical Jesus, as based on the four canonical gospels. Other related articles present different descriptions and perspectives of Jesus.</i> The problem is that it should include other material and perspectives than orthodox Christian (whatever <i>that</i> is). Does anybody know where these supposed other articles are? Perhaps a merge may be in order -<a href="../../../t/y/d/User%7ETydaj_1a42.html" title="User:Tydaj">Tydaj</a> 16:48, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Certainly Jesus is important enough to warrant multiple articles with similar content, and I can see the flow of the two is differentiated, but these two (this and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>) have confusingly similar names. So I propose a name change of some sort. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 10:13, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rewrite and Cite</b> - <i><b>There are absolutely no sources cited</b></i>, and this article, in my opinion, needs to present more viewpoints of prominent scholars before it can claim to be "The" Historical Jesus. I'd like to see Bultmann, Crossan, Funk, Chilton, Smith, and others. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">The Thadman</a> 13:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> I'd prefer the article to provide a disclaimer at the top and more-or-less outline what the term means and the disputes surrounding precisely who the historical Jesus <i>is</i>. It might also do well to point out "historical Jesus" is usually contrasted with "Biblical Jesus" and the two agree on such-and-such a point and disagree on such-and-such a point, etc. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmicuspublilius_c81e.html" title="User:Amicuspublilius">Amicuspublilius</a> 23:05, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and keep working on it. "The New Testament View of Jesus" necessarily reflects a Christian point of view (if there are different ways Christians interpret the NT, those different interpretations should be provided). But there are many critical historians and Bible scholars who believe that Jesus existed, draw on the NT as a source, but do a considerable amount of reinterpreting and reconstruction based on their rejection of the supernatural element, and their use of techniques of comparative literature, Biblical archeology, etc. We need an article that represents this important body of scholarship. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:08, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
