<ul>
<li>The (somewhat spurious) argument that, since all pokemon are covered in Wikipedia, anything that is more notable than a pokemon should be kept. But note that millions of people worldwide can recognize any pokemon on sight, so arguably there aren't that many things more notable than pokemon. Also note that the pokemon test is usually invoked by people who have the POV that pokemon are stupid, and that they use it as an argument for keeping anything that they do not consider stupid. Using it like that is, obviously, fallacious. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:36, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is nothing spurious about that argument at all, how do you figure? Saying there are millions of people worldwide who can recognize Pokemon on sight is no different than saying the same millions can recognize a school on sight — these are fairly easily and obviously recognizable things. Now, if you start asking for specifics, things change dramatically. Not even my son, an avid fan of Pokemon, would be able to tell you the specific <i>name</i> of every Pokemon character on sight — yet we have a complete and all-inclusive index of Pokemon on Wikipedia, some of which are completely empty and vacant stubs. (!) This is just one reason why I, and presumably others, make reference to the so-called Pokemon Comparative Notability Test. Sure, it sounds funny, but Wikipedia is not paper and I've yet to meet a school article which didn't have the potential to be expanded and useful in an encyclopedic capacity. This horse has been beaten up long enough— fix your sig already. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 02:46, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is spurious because <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a> consistent, and an argument applying to one topic (fictional creatures) does not generally apply to an entirely unrelated topic (schools). It is often used fallaciously because it relies on the assumption that more people, worldwide, would recognize or be familiar with the item in question (the school in this case), than with individual pokemon. For the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian.html" title="Smithsonian">smithsonian</a> or <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_tower.html" title="Eiffel tower">eiffel tower</a> that would be obviously true.

<li>I think that various people have provided <b>more than enough</b>. Like I said, it's about time you either quit arguing, or actually come up with a good counter-argument that answers the <b>real</b> issues, such as reputation, credibility, coverage, storage (something people would appreciate if they <i>read</i> <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINP_a8ac.html" title="WP:WINP">WP:WINP</a> instead of simply <i>quoting its title</i>), maintainability, usefulness, duplication of information, and the inclusion of trivia that is removed everywhere else. Is it too much to ask that someone actually comes up with a good argument why pointless articles on schools that are for all intents and purposes near-identical <b>aren't</b> harmful, relevant to the points I've mentioned? Is it too much to ask that people stop making dumb comparisons between schools, which are infinite on WP scale, and other finite sets (Pokemon, railway stations, albums)? Is it too much to ask that you even <i>consider</i> the other points of view, instead of dismissing it? Finally, is it too much to at least take the suggestion of articles on <i>generic</i> school types (face it - 95% of US high schools are unremarkable, we should have articles for the few that are remarkable, and a generic article describing the general common features of the rest) to replace these endless stubs seriously? Is it too much to ask? Of course not. So why won't you do it? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 03:33, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the three pages are quite different in content, but I no longer believe there is any justification for deleting honest efforts at providing information to this encyclopedia. The amount of esoteric make-believe covered in Wikipedia requires far more attention and consideration for "notability" than whether any particular school is or is not. I can only think that those who express the opinion that these articles are not important enough to keep have not spent much time looking around at what all is in Wikipedia! Schools are and will always be an important part of any community, and what is significant about any community is really to be judged by those familiar with that community. Each school was a big deal to all who attended it and is of interest to those who might someday attend. If an article remains stubby, then make it into a redirect and move the info to the proper political entity (city, county, borough, etc.) until someone comes along to develop it into a real article, like this one: <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moanalua_High_School_24b1.html" title="Moanalua High School">Moanalua High School</a>. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 01:14, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This would be a valid argument if school deletion arguments were about hard disk space. They aren't. Wikipedia has plenty of disk space. Wikipedia is not paper.

<br />
Truely, It has <b>never</b> been established that <i>school's are not encyclopedic by nature</i>. So that leave's it open for people who feel that all school's are encyclopedic by nature. I've researched this issue quite extensivly, and to the best of my knowledge, the issue of intrinsic school inclusion is still very much in the air and has not been resolved to anyone satisfaction.<br />
<br />
And I will advocate for the inclusion of all school's, and try to convince people of the merits of beliefs, because I beleive that my beleifs lead ot a better encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Honestly, this debate is stupid. It really shouldn't matter whether it is a redirect or a separate article. Apparently, multiple people want this to be a separate article, even after it was turned into a redirect by VfD's last decision. Why not placate them by letting them have the separate article? It isn't as though the information itself is in dispute; if that were the case, then the article would not have been merged. Since we're only talking about whether or not the content should have its own article, then why in the world should any of us care one whit? There are <i>lots</i> of stubs with less info than this page that we are all apparently okay with keeping. Why are so many of you continually arguing about this? It's so stupid. If we redirect it, someone will just reinstate the article, and it will just get listed on VfD again. Since it really doesn't matter one way or the other as to where the content is listed, why not just let them keep their separate article? I vote <b>keep</b>, and urge everyone voting 'redirect' to reconsider their reasoning. — <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 04:44, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If high schools sell alumni goodies and photos commemorating proms, a high school is important enough to have a Wikipedia article (elementary schools and junior highs are still under question).

<li><b>Keep</b>: I believe that all school articles should be kept, if they are more than stubs. For me this goes for elementary and middle schools too. It's not just about the impact that they have on lives and communities, or about using Wikipedia as a repository of information on more than famous whos and whatwhens. Schools may not have a big impact on history individually, but with few exceptions, celebrities don't either, and yet Wikipedia tends to keep them. It seems rather odd to me that people think we should only keep articles about things well know by a lot of people, and get rid of articles on things less well known.--<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintucket_ce2b.html" title="User:Quintucket">Quintucket</a> 03:38, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect.</b> Redirects are useful as index entries, and guarantee that people looking for a specific article will find it, regardless of whether global search is enabled or not, etc. I continue to see no benefit whatsoever having two closely related short topics on separate pages rather than having them on the same page.

<li>Personal opinion: a) If the school article is more than one full page of traditional print, say 5-10 paragraphs, then it is no longer possible to glance from one school to another on the same page. And it will take more than one mouse click to scroll past it to the next school. So at that point it's at least reasonable to break out a separate article. b) If the BEEFSTEW score of the broken-out article would be somewhere up in the eight-to-ten range, as a practical matter it's unlikely that anyone will even nominate it for deletion, much less get consensus for deletion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:19, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
