<p>Apparently, the issue on if it should be deleted <i>has</i> been brought up before, and can be seen in <a href="../../../s/a/d/Talk%7ESad_girl_in_snow_be85.html" title="Talk:Sad girl in snow">the article's talk page</a>. Despite the fact that most people felt that the article should be merged into <i><a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a></i>, the article is still on its own. Personally, I don't even think it deserves to be merged, as it's a pretty stupid basis for a "meme" in my opinion (and I love <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanon.html" title="Kanon">Kanon</a></i>). We don't need articles like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie%27s_Angels_b1fe.html" title="Charlie's Angels">Hot girls with guns</a>. The article is pretty much a bunch of original research, as there's no real use of the term outside of the webcomic community. It's not like its an actual named, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese.html" title="Japanese">Japanese</a> asthetic like <i><a href="../../../w/a/b/Wabi-sabi.html" title="Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a></i>. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 10:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment to all people voting "Merge per nom"</b> The nominator specifically says that they do <i>not</i> believe that the article deserves to be merged. Seizure Dog wants it deleted—if you are going to vote merge, please don't base it on the nominator. As for the article...well, its usage does not seem to be confined to the Megatokyo comic, so I don't personally believe that a merge to that article is appropriate. <b><a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>)</b> 04:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The information presented here about lengths of reigns of Popes is redundant; it is <b>already completely contained</b> in the main article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>. While it is true that this page contains unique content, that content is specific to Peter and much of it is also irrelevant to the subject of length of reign. It should therefore be transferred to the main article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, or possibly <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html#Catholic_Church" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_S_616d.html" title="User:Robin S">Robin S</a> 00:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is not redundant, it is a unique presentation of the data which is the subject of the article.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> how many ways can we slice the list of popes and have it be encyclopedic? By date of reign seems (pardon the pun) canonical. By how many cardinals he made? By how tall he was? or By how many illegitimate children he fathered, seems clearly popecruft. By length of reign? Close calls as there may be nothing particularly notable about the length of a pope's reign, there are other lists where the listees are sliced by notable things: see, e.g.,</li>

<p>Look I am sorry but this School is not notable, plain and simple. Just because it is a school does not make it notable. A google search for this School, gets a low return. What is returned is a list of multiple different schools by this name. Yes, it is a school, unfortunately this does not make it notable. I informed people on both sides of the last AFD. Colleges have been deleted off of Wikipedia for lack of notability. Simply put this school does not need an article. So I say:</p>

<dd><b>note</b> - first off, I was simply informing them even five people is not stacking the vote, is it stacking the vote to inform people that their is an election? no I did not inform all of those that voted to keep for they already made themselves known by removing the template. (though I did inform most) Also during the last vote, as I stated before the overwhelming reason for keeping it was because it had not had a lot of time to grow, a year is plenty. Yes there are verifiable links but that does not make it notable. Also, the fact that I am doing this has [nothing to do with my leanings one way or the other. I attended a non-notable highschool, it is not listed on wikipedia it does have verifiable sources though. I am so sorry if it seems that I was attempting to stack the vote.

<dd><b>Reply</b> The statement by the nominator that "Hello I know that you patrol non-notable articles and I thought I would bring this article your attention this article is up for deletion again and you can vote on it at the following page:" was aimed at individuals with track records of deleting such schools.

<dd>The nominator has made efforts to cover the damage, but it's clear that the initial attempts at votestacking, all of which used the greeting <b>"Hello I know that you patrol non-notable articles"</b>, were aimed squarely at deletionists. Those notified after the canvassing issue was raised here received an abridged message that avoided the rather explicit push for deletion. That such votestacking occurs on both sides is a great reason to report both individuals, not to ignore it here. The attempts to trivialize this are quaint, but do nothing to address the core of the efforts to encourage individuals to vote in one direction. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

I wanted results one way or another and I knew that informing both sides would allow the improvement of the article, c. I wanted to do exactly what you wanted me to do. I know very little policy, and that is the only reason I informed the other person of this they patrol article that lack notability and they know what to do (for or against).

Two more things: 1) I moved Lil Miss Lubbock from the school awards section to Notable Alums and Students as this is a personal award, not the school's, and 2) As I have noted above, informing a few people known to be interested in a subject area of a pending AfD is considered perfectly acceptable "Friendly Notice" pursuant to <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECanvassing_8b86.html" title="WP:Canvassing">WP:Canvassing</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> This school doesn't have the top Google hit for "Trinity Christian High School", and as the nominator says, there are many schools by this name, so it is unjust for this school to exclusively have this page on Wikipedia. The company that owns and controls this school and seemingly many other schools must at the very least have its own page on Wikipedia before one of its schools of little-to-no significance has a page. Being "well-referenced" is not a reason for a page; I could easily make a well-referenced page about myself with tons more detail than this school's page. Many high schools win state championships, and what this school has won is a very exclusive competition for Christian private schools, not a state championship. --Ndickson 03:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> The article makes explicit claims of notability for the school, in its winning a few dozen state championships, once all of the relevant article are added. That there are other high schools with a similar name is a great reason for disambiguating the title, but a spectacularly poor one for deletion.

<li><b>Reply:</b> The article is about the high school (hence "High School" in the title), not the company of the name "Trinity Christian Schools", and as such, it is invalid to have the reference there.

You are correct that none of us knows the exact intent of the person who added the false references other than that the person appears to be trying to save this school's page. The person did intentionally put information there unnecessarily and in haste, and that information was false, but they might not have known that it was false, so there is a chance that it's not "vandalism" by definition.

<li>That's not what's at contention here, it's notability that is. What I see for assertions of notability are an award granted by a newspaper based in Lubbock Texas, quite a number of athletic achievements, and two students who have some claim to fame: a pro baseball player and a local beauty pageant winner. Maybe the sources of these are reliable and verifiable (which, by the way, I do not contend is what is at issue), but I still question the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the school.

<dd>A) For the most part, the article in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115967101" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115967101" rel="nofollow">current version</a> meets the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> policy by refraining from original research and using secondary resources. The only unsourced statement is that school opened in '79 but noone graduated until '91.</dd>
<dd>B) From the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline: <i>"Notable is defined as 'worthy of being noted' or 'attracting notice', but is not synonymous with 'fame' or 'importance'."</i> . The school attracted the notice of various newspapers when it won state athletic championships, and the article now references these news stories. The national level of fame or importance the school earned by winning these awards does not grant or remove notability as because notability <i>"is not measured by editors’ subjective judgment."</i></dd>
<dd>C) The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Wikipedia%7EPlaces_of_local_interest_4265.html" title="Wikipedia:Places of local interest">Wikipedia:Places of local interest</a> essay states that if a place is not notable to stand on its own, it should merge into its city article (<a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubbock%2C_Texas_5ed1.html" title="Lubbock, Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a> in this case). The resulting merge would cause an imbalance of information on Trinity Christian High compared to other schools in the education section.</dd>
<dd>Those reasons being said, the article was indeed unreferenced and stub-length at the time the deletion notice was posted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115912570" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115912570" rel="nofollow">view that revision</a>), and would have qualified for merge or deletion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I saw "high school" in the title. That means it's notable in my book because all high schools are notable, just as, in Wikipedia, all towns are considered notable, and my book is right here <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">User:Noroton/opinions</a>. That said, I'm not opposed to redirecting some stubbly little high school articles to their school district or town pages, but that's not a deletion matter and can be discussed and disputed on the school's or town's talk page. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Both respondants above, please go to <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">WP:WAX</a> and scroll down a touch to the part where it says "Notability is inherited".

<li>Sorry, Dennisthe2, I don't understand the relevance of what you pointed out to what I said. And I hope you're not confusing "inherited" with "inherent" ("involved in the constitution or essential character of something&#160;: belonging by nature or habit"), both Librarianofages and I believe that all high schools are <i>inherently</i> notable. I make my case here: <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">User:Noroton/opinions</a>.</li>

<li>Surely, per <a href="../../../a/l/l/WP%7EALLORNOTHING_ed9c.html" title="WP:ALLORNOTHING">WP:ALLORNOTHING</a>, this cannot be the case. Many high school (secondary schools in the UK) are obviously notable, but many can easily be dealt with via a section in the entry for their locality. In the UK there are nearly 5,000 secondary schools - it is not credible that all can be notable. We would end up with a collection of stubs saying "School A is a secondary school in town B. It was founded in year C and has D pupils." <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 21:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm going to write a userspace essay on this soon (and I'll inform you on your talk page), but I would say that some reasons for notability would be (a) excellent performance, abhove and beyond what would be expected (b) alternatively, very poor performance involving the threat of closure, etc (c) some notoriety not related to education, which produces secondary sources (d) A long and easily notable history. (There are probably more). I don't think you can possibly create well-written WP articles on all high/secondary schools, without them merely being clones of each other. On a personal note, my daughter's school isn't notable in the slightest. I'd love to write an article on it, but it'd just end up like the one I linked above. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 00:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You do have a good point here without really trying though. Consider first that a keep on a previous AFD doesn't always set a precedent to keep in the future. It often does, but things can change. On the other hand, this closed in the past 24 hours. The general rule is to not re-nominate something for one month - and unless somebody's travelled through time, it certainly hasn't been a month since the closure of the last AfD.

Local sports seems the main claim, but these seem thin. <b>All</b> papers cover local high school and college sports to some extent; every school in the city has probably been mentioned in the paper.

<li><b>Comment</b> so why should we have to state whether we were "canvassed"? Does that make our votes less valid? I object to the big-brotherism of that whole process and it will doubtlessly lead to the opportunistic behavior of "canvassing" people whose views are likely opposed to yours and then have some requirement that they admit that they were canvassed and their votes be discounted.

<li><b>Response</b> - I'm not sure you should state whether you were canvassed (it seems irrelevant), but IMO, asking people who you know are biased toward this is kind of gaming the system.

<li>An additional note, a school - an educational institution - is more a facility to <i>contain</i> a group of people (the students), and its faculty.

<li>Nothing they say asserts the school's notability, though. They only assert (and show with references) that the school exists.

<li>This is true, but the quandary we're in is that A7 expects that there is positively no assertion whatsoever - including references that don't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. If we have links, or something more than, say, a note from the author's mother saying it's notable, then the A7 falls out.

<li>A school is not a group of people. It is an institution in which people are educated. There is a big difference.

<li><b>Delete</b> Basically, it says she is going to appear in a movie, and the rest is filled with fluff. And say, how would the article's author know all about the childhood aspirations, likes, dislikes, etc of an utterly non-notable actress?? Hmm... <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 13:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I created the article. The article was speedily-deleted before as a non-notable stub. The deleter told me that in order for the article to be put up again, I would have to write more than a stub, and establish with references the case for notabilty. I believed that I had accomplished that when I put up the current version of the page. This has been reflected on the talk page since I first put the page online. Also, I would like to respond to the points made by Touchdown Turnaround.
<ul>
<li>First, notability guidelines. On this point, I agree that Robin Raven's inclusion only borders on meeting notability standards. Nevertheless, wikipedia is not paper, and there is very little wrong with accepting an entry that may miss the mark of notability guidelines by a small amount. I would point out that many current entries make much less of a case for notability on wikipedia right now.</li>
<li>Second, non-subjectivity in the article does not seem lacking to me. Some parts are written from info gathered online, and these sources may not be completely objective, but in rewriting the wikipedia page, I thought that I had removed any aspect of subjectivity that may be in the original sources, stripping it down to facts and general knowledge of the actress.</li>
<li>The third issue is the only one of the four that I agree with. The article was originally written by me, and I do know Robin Raven irl. However, I believe wikipedia standards regarding such conflicts of interest require only that the article be reworked by someone not in such a situation of conflict of interest. <i>But in the question of whether or not the article should be deleted, conflict of interest in irrelevant.</i> Articles, if deleted at all, should be deleted on the basis of whether or not an article should exist on wikipedia, <i>not on whether or not the current edition of the page was authored by someone with a conflict of interest.</i> Therefore, I do not believe this aspect of the situation is relevant on this afd page.</li>
<li>Fourth, the links do NOT mismatch. To say that this was done intentionally to prevent red links is not a good assessment of the page. In many places in wikipedia, such links as the ones on this page are considered standard. Take, for example, the case of characters from movies or video games. In most situations, a character will be linked to, but no content at that page would be present. Instead, it would redirect to the page containing the movie or video game that character is from. This is not meant to confuse, nor to prevent red-links. It is just because no page for the minor topic exists, and linking to the broader just make more sense for users wanting to get more information about it. On the Robin Raven page, <i>Letters to Liesl</i>, a book by the people behind <i>The Sound of Music</i> about <i>The Sound of Music</i> is linked to <i>The Sound of Music</i>. I felt this was appropriate linkage; if others disagree, they are of course free to change the links -- but even so, this has nothing to do with whether or not the page should be deleted.</li>

<p>Well, here's a mass nomination. I've discovered while reading <a href="../../../s/e/r/Series_finale.html" title="Series finale">Series finale</a> that the article Notable series finales (1990s) has been deleted through <b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Notable_series_finales_%281990s%29_ec28.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Notable series finales (1990s)">this AfD</a></b> back in January. But it's obvious that the article was just part of a series, and it doesn't make much sense to delete the one and keep the others (or vice versa), and so I had the choice to either go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> with the the deleted article, or nominate the other articles for deletion. I chose to do the latter, because right now those articles don't cover <i>notable</i> series finales, they simply cover <i>all</i> series finales from that time. I think we should <b>merge</b> these articles into <i>one</i> article, List of notable series finales, that only cover the <i>notable</i> series finales, and not all of them. Now we're going to have a lot of fun while discussing which series finale is notable and which isn't, but I think that it's possible to create a few criteria for inclusion (For example: having multiple <a href="../../../5/8/t/58th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards_d028.html" title="58th Primetime Emmy Awards">emmy nominations</a> (<i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Everyone%27s_Waiting_4a21.html" title="Everyone's Waiting">Everyone's Waiting</a></i>), or being praised/noted by well known critics (<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Good_Things..._f6a5.html" title="All Good Things...">All Good Things...</a></i>, I'm sure some sources can be found). --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConti_fae9.html" title="User:Conti">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConti_c57c.html" title="User talk:Conti">✉</a> 01:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

It's hard to make a convincing argument why there needs to be a centralized article about series finales, instead of placing the content for each show in that show's article.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Merge</b> per nomination. As Jerry noted above, the term <i>notable</i> should not be in an article title in and of itself. Much the same conversation emerged in the debate a week ago about <i>notable</i> African American inventors, et.al. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 16:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom's reasoning. One was deleted so the others should be too. "Notable" is too much a POV term and if you take it away then you open up the door for every series finale to be chronicled. Best to let the individual series articles handle whether a finale was particularly notable, and there's probably an article on the highest-rated TV episodes somewhere that also serves the same purpose. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Quite a notable and lengthy subject in British history, I must say I am surprised that this article is so neglected. I have added in a source for what material is there. Some also appears to have placed a tag on the article page saying that the neutrality of the article is disputed, but I find scant comment on the talk page. Seems fairly neutral to me. There is a wealth of material, on the net too, which could really turn this into a quite tremendous article. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloveoil_93d8.html" title="User:Cloveoil">Cloveoil</a> 02:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination makes the case for a merge more than a deletion. As for whether such a merge should be made, I believe a general article on human rights will inevitably focus on current events or Saddam's atrocities. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 03:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: (1) mixes history with very recent and fuzzy concept of human rights, (2) the only event mentioned (bombing) is likely part of supression of Kurdish autonomist movement during 1922-25, (3) the <i>whole</i> post-Ottoman Empire history of Iraq is history of uprisings and putches which Brits, when in control, tried to moderate. The article looks as prime example of making propaganda through original research - take a loaded word (human rights, fascism, terrorism, anti-xyz, ...) and mix it together with something author does not like. That the heavily biased media do it is understandable but WP should be based on different principles. (I used the book by Marion Farouk Sluglett &amp; Peter Sluglett, Iraq since 1958 - From Revolution to Dictatorship, 2001, London to get overview of the era). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 00:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <s>It's sad and pathetic that more effort has gone into this discussion than seems ever to have gone into the article. The subject is important and sourceable, the only question is whether Wikipedians have the interest and responsibility to treat the subject with the work and care it deserves.</s> It is an important subject because it helps to give some perspective to the more important subject of Saddam Hussein's human rights record and the human rights situation that followed the invasion. I think we can do it, so I'm voting "Keep". I'll try to put some appropriate external links in the article, and maybe others can help improve it as well. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)crossed out blathering <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I've tried to put my effort where my mouth is. I've added substantially to the article, but it's only a start and from only a couple of sources. I hope to make further improvements later. I think these additions (which I'll continue making) show that this article can be improved and the subject matter is substantial enough to support a good Wikipedia article. I haven't changed the British section at all yet.

<dd>I'm very open to a main article instead of a disambiguation page, but I don't have the time to work on it any time soon. A main article could have sections on various ethnic groups and how they've fared in terms of human rights, as well as a chronological overview. But I think the period article "pre-Saddam" has so much meat to it that we shouldn't cut it down to fit into a larger article.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't see what this was before, but it looks like it is starting to come along. I'd suggest that there is a lot of material for the pre-1920 period for this region as well. When time permits, a navigational template among the different articles would be useful, and ultimately these should be integrated into broader histories of the region. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">A Musing (formerly Sam)</a> 02:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>--The article was not deleted but shifted by me to the new article at the suggestion of an editor. The footnotes and authorities are impeccable. Hugh Thomas is THE authority in the English Language as his 1961 work has now gone through the 1965, 1977. 1986 and 2001 editions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article deals with the persecution on both sides of the conflict, and it happens that the most flagrant was on the losing side of the conflict.</p>
<p>The article is still under construction and so I am wondering if the deletionists haven't jumped the gun here. Out of fairness and scholarship, shouldn't the article be finished?</p>
<p>Finally, truth is the truth. This presecution is probably the major reason why the Republic lost the war. The atrocities were so broadcast around the civilized world, and caused such an abhorrent reaction, that ONE country, Mexico, rallied to the Republic at the time of the rising.</p>
<p>I realized that the article may offend the political sensibilities of many, but often the truth hurts.</p>
<p>Here is the removal notice that was done without notice to me or by posting.</p>

<li><b>More Amendment to Keep--Criticism of Lord Thomas</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that the deletionist attack Thomas for being biased against the Republic. If that is so, why was his work banned in Franco Spain until Franco died?</p>
<p>I would also cite Sheelagh Elwood in the Historical Association Studies book, <i>The Spanish Civil War</i>. On p. 122 we find this comment about Thomas's book, "[Names author and work]is packed with detailed information, but its density and lenght may be a daunting project fir relative newcomers to the subject." The author continues about the Spanish edition. Thomas' book, published in 1961, has gone through revisions in 1965, 1977, 1986, and 2001. Lord Thomas is now probably in his eighties and perhaps we have seen the last of his revisions. That is a terrible loss to the historical community especially now with the work being done in the Soviet Archives. His expert eye on the Spanish material found there would be beneficial to all concerned.</p>
<p>To delete this article based on the assertion that Hugh Thomas is biased is akin to book burning, internet style. It is quite obvious that those who attack Lord Thomas, have not read the book.</p>

<li><b>Maybe the testimony of an International Brigader in support of Thomas might affact some the attacking deletionists</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I refer the deletionists to Don Lawson, <i>The Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans Fighting Fascism in the Spanish Civil War,</i> (1989) where he states about Lord Thomas, p. 146. "Every writer, including this one, who has written anything on the Spanish Civil War, is indebted to historian Hugh Thomas. His <i>The Spanish Civil War</i>, [publisher omitted} was first published in 1961 and was throughly revised and updated in 1977. It is unquestionably the definitive book on the war and so far as I have been able to determine, misses no important wartime fact or detail, large or small. But I would hesitate to recommend the Thomas book to a young reader, except an extremely advanced one, because it is so highly detailed."</p>
<p>I recognize that a person who is not familiar with the subject would find Thomas a large undertaking.</p>

</ul>
<p>A new and exciting work that I am just finishing reading is Gerald Howson, <i>Arms for Spain, The Untold Story of the Spanish Civil War</i> (1998). On page 249, Howson notes Hugh Thomas' work as "great." Howson's work, by the way, is quite revolutionary. He has used the recent access to Polish and Soviet archives in his book and reviewed actual inventories and lists of the ships that carried arms to the Republic and also was able to get copies of some of the actual arms purchases. I will need to update my "Foreign Intervention" article with the new information.</p>

<li><b>Perhaps the deletionists would be interested to see what Herbert Mathews states about Hugh Thomas.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As all the learned experts on the history of the Spanish Civil War know, Herbert Mathews of the <i>New York Times</i> covered the war from the Republican side during the entire period of 1936-1939. An interesting anecdote, that Mathews does not cite in his book, is that Mathews and Ernest Hemingway went in with the troops when the Republic captured Teruel in 1937-38. This intrepid pair actually were at the fall of the governor's headquarters where the troops fought each other from different levels of the building firing at each other through holes in the floor.</p>
<p>In any event, Mathews in his work, <i>Half of Spain Died, A Reappraisal of the Spanish Civil War</i> (1973), states on page 104, "The judgment of the British scholar, Hugh Thomas, whose work is as authoratative and objective as any history of the war can be...." Mathews, an eyewitness to the war, cites Thomas twenty-four times in the index to the book and praises it in other passages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenghisTheHun_0179.html" title="User:GenghisTheHun">GenghisTheHun</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGenghisTheHun_6693.html" title="User talk:GenghisTheHun">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GenghisTheHun_b093.html" title="Special:Contributions/GenghisTheHun">contribs</a>) 23:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Cecil Eby has written at least two books on the war. I have them both, but I only purchased the second book last week and I haven't had time to read it. In his work on the International Brigade, <i>Between the Bullet and the Lie, American Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War,</i> Eby states on p. 323 "The best general study of the Spanish Civil War is Hugh Thomas' <i>The Spanish Civil War</i>....

<li><b>I have other works if you are interested that cite or praise Hugh Thomas.</b></li>

<p>I have an extensive library on the Spanish Civil War and started to review it when I started working on the various articles and edits that I have done on this site. If anyone wants more citations, I shall provide them.</p>
<p>I have no illusions that I am going to convince anyone. I am quite familiar with academic politics and I have discovered in my short time on Wikipedia, about 4-5 weeks, that the politics of this site are quite similar. There is a huge "Old Boy" network and lots of point of view politics here. There appears to be a large happy group that sends valentines to each other and pin medals on each other's user page. Hilarious.</p>
<p>I had hoped for better but at my age, I should have known better. Some editor posts a delete and immediately we have about half a dozen deletes from people who obviously have never read much about the Spanish Civil War. I doubt few of them ever cracked the cover of Hugh Thomas' work or Professor Jackson or Gerald Brennan or anyone else.</p>
<p>I liken this to a modern bonfire of knowledge that Savonarola or Dr. Goebbels would have throughly approved. You can do this virtual burning of knowledge, but I would be hopeful that truth and knowledge would somehow carry through.</p>

<dd>This does not necessarily mean it is the best source for specialized aspects. All the references mentioned come from a very few pages of the book, so they must have been simply listed, rather than discussed. There should be a very large number of specialized academic and general interest articles on the subject, and I think it would be reasonable to insist that individual incidents be sourced and to more than this single textbook.</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> This is especially true because of the overall tone of the article, which is both sensationalist and politically biased. To anyone with even the most general awareness about the period, or about war atrocity stories in general, it is obvious that some are real, some are not, and many depend in the end upon a single report. This is why the WP guidelines require <i>multiple</i> sources, not one text no matter how high its reputation. Both sides in this war were noted for their expert efforts at propaganda, and this article is a retelling of it. I don't want to say the subject is not N, but I do think that the articles is plainly on the face an attempt at a POV fork. I think it so contaminated with POV that it should be started over. The article is so radically short of normal WP standards that this seems the wisest course.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The section "Consequences of the Persecution to the Republic" is so badly written, ambiguous and confused that it is effectively unitelligible. The overall impression of the article as being one-sided and still based on a few pages from one single work remains and has even been reinforced.Maybe it is an issue to be taken up with the editor who originally suggested creating a separate article, but I am not sure that this subject merits an article of its own. Even if it does, I am not sure this current article could even be used as a basis for a satisfactory article. Its shortcomings and problems are so numerous that the ammount of work would probably be greater than just starting from scratch.</li>

<p>I have a 1967 Set of Enclyclopaedia Britannica and looked up this controversy. No article in that work exists on the Spanish Civil War, but in the general article, Spain, history, volume 20, page 1108, we find this quotation:</p>
<p>"On both sides the war was marked, especially in the early stages, by a ruthlessness that astounded the world. Churches were burned and desecrated and public religious observances forbidden throughout Republican Spain; ten bishops, and many thousands of priests, religious and devout members of the laity were murdered in cold blood, for no political activity or crime."</p>
<p>Also in the bibliography, p. 1116, as authority for the 19th and 20th Centuries, yep, there is "H. S. Thomas, <i>The Spanish Civil War</i> New York (1961)." Another of my sources, Professor Jackson is also noted in the citation.</p>
<p>Let's examine the question of criticism of "weasel words," so beloved by certain editors of this august web site. The good gray Britannica staff and editors approved these words in that short quotation: "ruthlessness," "astounded," "desecrated," "murdered," "cold blood," and perhaps we could argue about a couple more.</p>
<p>This language is so good that I plan to include it in the article if I can get it by the politburo.</p>

<p>I forgot to respond to the criticism that the article relies heavily on Hugh Thomas. I hate to make this startling revelation to that obviously erudite comment, but the bulk of the literature on the Spanish Civil War is in SPANISH. General histories in English are harder to find.</p>
<p>In any event, after Franco died, and the ban against Thomas' book was lifted in Spain, it was translated into Spanish, and is now a Spanish standard on the conflict.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> First, this list is not indiscriminate information. It's clear that an effort was made to, in fact, discriminate among team names and mascots to include only those derived from European peoples or traditions, as distinguished from indigenous peoples of the Americas and Oceana. Second, why would a list like this need to be documented? It mostly links to WP articles where the European-origin name is part of the title or easily seen at the linked source. I suggest keeping it to reduce the friction at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sports_team_names_and_mascots_derived_from_Indigenous_peoples_945a.html" title="List of sports team names and mascots derived from Indigenous peoples">List of sports team names and mascots derived from Indigenous peoples</a>, where the Fighting Irish and similar names keep getting added and deleted.

<li>Yes the list is "USAcentric". Actually its North American centric with most teams listed located in the USA. The point of the list is to show which teams in North America are named after things that ARE NOT native to the continent, just like the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sports_team_names_and_mascots_derived_from_Indigenous_peoples_945a.html" title="List of sports team names and mascots derived from Indigenous peoples">List of sports team names and mascots derived from Indigenous peoples</a> is a list to show which teams are named after things that ARE native to the continent.</li>

Any of the college or pro team mascots have numerous article about them, and there has also been ample press coverage about the lack of corresponding agitation to get rid of European mascots. It is not "conjecture" that college teams have Spartans or Irish as their mascots, for pity's sake. Google them if you doubt the truth of the assertions. Add references rather than just voting to delete. U.S. team mascots have been widely covered, and Chief Illiniwek was banned after 80 plus years. No bannning of "Fighting Irish" and the like so far.

<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a>. I return to my favorite AFD argument, and one of the first I ever used on these pages: if we had an article on every city and town about all its roads and streets, the size of Wikipedia would spiral out of control. If we won't have them all, we should not have any. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 03:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"out of control"? Not at all... even 1 million such articles wouldn't come close to using up the storage space Wikipedia already has sitting empty. Text files just don't take up much space, deleting articles to save space isn't necessary or wanted. This is what "Wikipedia is not paper" is about. At any rate, this particular article doesn't seem terribly useful in present form but could probably be expanded to cover streets there's actual encyclopedic information on. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:21, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> applies here, given the additional historical information presented in the article. On the one hand, the encyclopedic information presented in the list is better suited to the individual articles. One the other, having one list of all roads rather than 100+ one-sentence articles for every road is a reasonable means of organising content. I also don't find the argument that <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">other cities lack such lists</a> a convincing reason to delete.

<dd>Not to make an issue of this (I hope), but isn't the problem with that article that the entries are speculation?

<dd>The term Antichrist does not have a clear, objective definition. "List of fictional characters to be called Antichrists" would not be an encyclopedic list. The problem with this list is that it cannot be sourced properly because some one has to make a judgement call. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 17:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

At least in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Omens_d9ec.html" title="Good Omens">Good Omens</a> Adam is clearly referred to as the Antichrist, the son of the Devil, and necessary to bring on the final battle between good and evil.

<dl>
<dd>That isn't how our own article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">Antichrist</a> defines it. The list does not have a clearly defined criteria for inclusion, and that's where the problem is coming from. There's no clear definition so people have to make judgement calls, and you can't source a judgement call. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 04:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article could be good with some listed sources. It is a normal-sized list and is coherent. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheunicyclegirl_65d8.html" title="User:Theunicyclegirl">Theunicyclegirl</a> 18:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no reason this couldn't be a decent little list if it is sourced properly. It wouldn't be OR to say that the dude in the Left Behind series is a fictional antichrist, for intstance. <a href="../../../o/s/k/User%7EOskar_Sigvardsson_905b.html" title="User:Oskar Sigvardsson">Oskar</a> 20:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But can it be completely sourced with an objective criteria for inclusion? The source doesn't just need to point out the character actually exists within the work of fiction, but that the character is actually referred to as an antichrist. Most of the characters already on the list won't have that capability. My reasoning for nominating isn't just that it isn't sourced properly, but that it cannot be sourced properly. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 22:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. All of the characters listed here are either explicitly Antichrists in the works in which they appear, or (as in the case of the South Park character and Randall Flagg) are implicitly associated with the role in the context of the fiction. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 04:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How do you intend to source the implicit ones? The South Park character is never referred to as Antichrist. "Son of the devil" does not equal "Antichrist". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 05:10, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The more important part was the sourcing issue. How is the sourcing going to work? I still feel uncertain that it can be sourced since no one has made a real attempt to. The one external jump that was added doesn't seem to actually work. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 18:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename or merge</b> So WP can determine and verify which "Antichrists" are fictional and (more importantly?) whether any aren't fictional. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well we can easily verify that all of these are fictional characters. It's the verifying them as antichrists that's tricky. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 19:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The word "fictional" is used to mean that all of these come from works of fiction, not that the concept of antichrist is fictional. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 00:39, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Judging by its present state, the article has clear criteria and definable bounds. As long as it avoids the temptation to include all villains under this name ,it should do well. There is a purpose to such articles--so that a reader having checked one, can see additional ones, and this list provides more information than a category. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The composition of the list is clear enough and in keeping with other lists of its kind. The line items on the list can be supported by references, it just takes some diligence to find <i>reputable</i> reviews ... I'll not cite the guidelines on movie reviews, but essentially these need to be published in mainstream periodicals or books and not merely blog postings (the vast majority of movie reviews are only blog postings now). I've added two external links to supporting material for one of the line items (not using <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">Template:Cite_news</a>, sorry). --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 12:33, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the end there will only be two or three you can source like that, not deserving of a list. Also, the list does not have a clear scope because the term "Antichrist" itself does not have a clear scope. It is subjective to call some one an antichrist. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 14:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I started at the top, did the first two line items and found support for each; that seems like a high hit rate for the ability to find supporting references. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 15:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No doubt you'll find one for the third as well, because it's The Omen. After that, you have things that would not have been written about in reputable reviews, things written as speculation (arguably), and one that is even wrong (Point Pleasant, daughter of the devil but not antichrist). Do you really want to maintain a list of three? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 15:16, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As noted above and ignored by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloma_Walker_eea0.html" title="User:Paloma Walker">User:Paloma Walker</a>, there are three-quarters of a million Google hits in Korean, including a large variety of reliable sources, three of which (representing coverage in two different countries) I had already added to the article shortly after I made my comment above (thus meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 14:44, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I see the links, but as they are in Korean and Chinese they could be about pretty much anything and the sites could be utterly non-notable in themselves (the two I looked at look like MySpace style pages to me).

<li>I don't distrust what you're saying (and never said that I did so please do not put words in my mouth), but people differ on what amounts to a reasonable secondary source - and the pages I looked at seemed to me to resemble kid's MySpace pages. As for <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">inability to read the facts it publishes</a> - well that's an essay not a policy or guideline (and I'm not entirely sure how it even applies here) and I personally think it's for you to demonstrate notability which, thus far, you haven't. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 15:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are welcome to your opinions about the web design skills of Korean newspaper editors (which I share), but given that you freely admit you can't read them in the first place, I'd have to question your qualification to judge what constitutes a reliable source in this case. We judge what is a reliable source based on their editorial policy, not on superficial impressions of having too many Flash ads on their site. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 16:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You seem to be taking this personally, which I hope is not the case as I have based my opinion on the evidence on the article page - three unreadable sources (again, it is <i>your</i> job to convince other editors of the band's notability so I suggest you find English language sources for the band's notability). To be honest though, even if the sections you mention were in English, I think the band would still fail on notability since all it says in the article is that the band were formed and then signed to a record label. Hundreds of bands do the same thing every year, without being in any way notable. (wholly unrelatedly, how can the title track to an album have a different name to the album itself?) <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 16:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Two of the references are somewhat reliable sources in Korean (one is a news site operated by a large web portal, while the other is a sports newspaper operated by the same company that runs a mainstream newspaper). Both of them are non-trivial mentions, where one talks about an all-male fan club for the group, while the other talks about the recovery of a member from a hospital stay. I have no idea what the Chinese page says. <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKiersta_49aa.html" title="User:Kiersta">Kiersta</a> 23:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the improvements to the article since it was nominated for AFD, including the addition of sources to establish notability (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Wonder_Girls&amp;diff=116795287&amp;oldid=115947861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Wonder_Girls&amp;diff=116795287&amp;oldid=115947861" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> He is notable for the reasons previously stated.

Here is an additional forest farm (yes, another one of "US") website to check out: http//www.highdesertnet.com/morninghill/</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
There are quite a few forest farmers out here and we have a forest farm association. Following is a letter by Orville camp exerpt from <i>The Forest Farm Management Journal:</i> (journal is hardcopy only, not available online at present.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Forest_Farming_-_The_Ecosystem_Approach_to_Forest_Management_757e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Forest Farming - The Ecosystem Approach to Forest Management">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The forest management controversy</span></h4>
<p>Dear Forest Manager,</p>
<p>Management of our forests has become one of the most controversial issues of this century. Many species are now extinct or in danger of becoming so. The controversial spotted owl, for example, is only one of many species dependent on ancient forests which are rap­ idly being eliminated. People are concerned. Our social and eco­ nomic well-being is at stake.</p>
<p>Forest management practices continue to deplete our forests. As a result, opposition to these practices has become intense. Many are desperately working to save what little remains of the ancient forests by having them placed into wilderness for future generations.</p>
<p>On one side the traditionalists want to continue converting forests into tree farms. On the other side, environmentalists want all of the forests preserved. While both may serve some immediate needs, neither seem to have a long term solution on how to manage and sustain the forest ecosystem so that it can continue to provide our many dif­ ferent needs.</p>
<p>Most timber management pro­ grams, for short term economic rea­ sons, are based on the clearcut con­ cept. Clearcuts are typically done in one or two steps. They are called "clearcuts" if everything is removed in one step, "seed tree cutting," "shel­ terwood cutting," or "selective cutting" if done in two or more steps.</p>
<p>Who do you know who's able to sustain either the forest or himself using clearcutting practices? The truth is, probably no one. Most businesses keep track of what is happening to their "net worth" as a measure of their success. However, many foresters prescribe clearcutting which reduces the net worth of that forest to zero. Even the value of the land itself is often re­ duced because of the reduction in potential for productivity. They then try to measure their success by the number of trees they plant. Regard­ less of how many trees planted, or survival success, the net worth of that forest is still relatively close to zero. If the forest was one of old growth, it will be several hundred years at best before the some values can be ob­ tained.</p>
<p>The main cause of the management problem is a result of not recog­ nizing the forest as an ecosystem of all species and ages where each are dependent on the other in some way as we are upon them. This body of living things also has a natural system of checks and balances which keeps it healthy. The sec­ ond cause of the problem, as a result of the above, is in failing to select the right individuals for har­ vest so that all species' needs can continue to be met.</p>
<p>Proposed solutions to forest management problems typically call for either dividing it up, or eliminating unwanted parts, to serve special interests .. Since all parts of the forest ecosystem are interconnected and interdependent, neither of these solutions are good ones.</p>
<p>There is now an alternative for those who support management of the forest as an ecosystem. Mid­ way between just growing and har­ vesting trees, on one hand, and maintaining a do-not-touch wilderness on the other, the Forest Farm Association offers a new meaning to the term forestry. The Forest Farm Association is comprised of forest managers who support and practice a middle-of-the-road approach.</p>
<p>If you are interested in practicing forest management in an environmen­tally sound manner, or want to learn more about it and also help educate others, please join the Forest Farm Association. Your contribution is needed and very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Orville Camp</p>

Keep: Are you guys joking, this guy is at the forefront of one of the most popular games in the world. Just because some people do not consider someone or somthing important doesnt mean others dont. He is one of the biggest winners in online poker history and tons of people would love to know more about him due to his HSP appearance.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I just went through and added references and more information about this guy. I disagree about your assertion of non-notability; he was selected to appear several times on a nationally broadcast poker program (GSN's High Stakes Poker). Further, he has had in-the-money finishes at both World Series of Poker and World Poker Tour events. Finally, he is an online sensation, playing high-stakes heads up poker against the likes of Phil Ivey on a regular basis. His online popularity is corroborated by an article in The Official World Poker Tour Magazine that I have referenced. I admit that I am an inclusionist at heart, but that certainly suffices to establish his notability in my book. --<a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanempire_9f7f.html" title="User:Romanempire">Romanempire</a> 14:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - while I don't necessarily agree that simply playing on one or more episodes on HSP automatically takes one across the notability threshold and I strongly disagree that being an "online sensation" or playing heads up against Phil Ivey does (I'm sure Phil would be happy to play against anyone heads up if there were enough money in it for him), there is just enough in the way of sourcing for me to pass the article. I added another interview to the links section. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 06:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> Also Phil Ivey can play Brian 300/600 NL HU whenever he wants. I'm sure that is enough money for Phil, so maybe he's not playing because Brian is good.</p>

<li>High Stakes Poker is not a game show. He was not a "contestant." According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "a person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject."

<li>Well, my general feeling is that playing poker (even televised poker) isn't in itself a particularly notable activity. Obviously though other people feel differently, as we have lots of articles about poker players. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 16:13, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In response to Otto4711, he doesn't just play Phil Ivey heads-up, and it is not just "money in it" for Ivey. According to the WPT magazine article, Ivey got "taken to the cleaners" by Townsend. Some people in the media consider Phil Ivey to be the best poker player in the world, but Townsend regularly contends that notion. In response to FiggyBee, I could say that I feel like cooking food isn't a notable activity. But when someone is so skilled at the activity that a large audience watches him perform it (Iron Chef), it becomes notable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I personally would predicate notability on being noticed/mentioned in general interest as opposed to only trade publications. My weak keep recommendation is based on applying <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#Special_cases" title="WP:BIO">notability criteria</a> for 'athletes' as opposed to 'entertainers' as I consider the 'athletic criteria' to be applicable across all sports and poker could be described as a sport as much as football can be when played professionally. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 13:20, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Note</b> further additions of links to related topics in Wikipedia. W.r.t. "reliable sources" I don't want to rely on blogs, but if one wants to show a term used journalistically then blogs and reviews should be allowed (not, of course, to the exclusion of other sources). Also, I note from your Wikilink "the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication." To some extent, any publisher must consider all these issues before allowing a review, or letter to the editor, onto his pages. BTW (not that I'm claimimg to know) how do you know the book doesn't use the term?</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the sources weren't a little on the wonky side this wouldn't be much more than a dicdef as it stands. This article suffers the same problem as a related article recently deleted in that the 'sources' are largely just instances of the phrase being used and do little if anything to establish the meaning of the term or convey any information about it. It does little more than establish the existence of the term - the point of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is not to simply find quotes but to tell us something, which this doesn't. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 05:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

When they are constructive edits that actually resolve the problems that have been brought up. Your edit really hasn't satisfied that, and I will explain to you why. If you haven't read <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> in detail please do, but for starters, pay attention to the line that states <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true.</i> The problem with the sources in this article (as well as the now-deleted Unholy Alliance) is that they are almost exclusively quotations of someone using the term <i>Southern Mafia</i> without actually telling us what the southern mafia is. Your article then goes on to use these various examples of the word use to support a conclusion - but that is a violation of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. Wikipedia cannot rely on articles of this nature that basically say "This person has been called a member of the Southern Mafia, and so has this person, therefore the Southern Mafia can be defined as ..." What you really need is a source that explicitly tells us "The Southern Mafia can be defined as ..." You have one and only one source that does that - but the problem with that is that it is from a blog and not a reliable source. Again, read up on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for a more clear picture of what a reliable source is, and why a blog is not. Finally, if you do find reliable sources to cite on the subject, make sure that you can expand the article beyond a mere definition, else it will not pass <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a>.</dd>

I am certain you are very well intentioned in wanting to contribute to the project with these articles of local significance that you feel are underrepresented here, and we all appreciate your desire to contribute.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Can't speak for anyone else, but I know I've changed my opinion on several articles up for AfD if they've been improved. The problem with this article (in my opinion) is that while it's sourcing has indeed been improved (with the addition of the Texas Observer link added to the decent Scarfone link), there are still serious issues. One is that pretty much all of the other footnotes should be removed as they do not add any verifiable benefit to the article that I can see (all they seem to do is show the authors of this article didn't make the term up, which is covered by the two more acceptable sources, and that the term is used sometimes in the music industry, which oddly isn't mentioned in the article itself).</dd>

One is <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">it now appears to be just a dictionary definition</a> as mentioned already, but the sparsity also leaves two other issues: 1) that there is no assertion or evidence that the term is particularly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, 2) that from what I've seen so far, the phrase seems to clearly be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neoligism</a>.</dd>

<dd>I would be happy to change my vote ... if the concerns that have been raised by myself and others were actually addressed in the article. So far they have not. A synthesis occurs when you place two seperate ideas together so that they form a conclusion, whether stated outright or implied. In one sentence you talk about "traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise" and "organized crime". In the next you mention "conservative Congressmen from the South working together for a shared purpose". The clear implication to the reader is that that criminal activity and conservative congressmen have a connection. Whether this is "true" or not does not matter, <i>we</i> (as editors) can not make these connections ourselves... we need to cite reliable secondary sources that make such connections for us. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suppose someone thinks that a new <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> advertising campaign has hidden racist messgages in it.</dd>
<dd>They go online and find a few books/magazines that explain what subliminal messages are and what racism is defined as.</dd>
<dd>Then they go and find a summary of the ad campaign.</dd>
<dd>They write an article explaining their ideas and citing their sources.</dd>

<dd>Yes, that seems to be the problem, but where? Criminals and politcians that are not linked, remain so forever, until they are linked in some clear way.

<dd>And you shouldn't add text to my comments. What I was trying to explain is that an article can be OR even if you give sources. The sources need to explicitly say what you say in the article. Many of the sources on the article only mention the Southern Mafia, in popular culture. I see nothing that <b>connects</b> "a traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise" to "The Southern Mafia in the Senate."

<dd>"Literary uses" = the words "Southern" and "mafia" are used in conjunction in books and magazines. What is needed is a reason that these two words belong next to each other for some specific reason. As it is, you just have a collection of referenced occasions that the words have been put next to each other. You need to show that the words next to each other have meaning beyond what the two words mean alone. There isn't any one specific group here that is called the Southern mafia (except groups that also go by other names?). In fact, each reference in the article weakens the case that an article is needed, as most of them are talking about a different thing. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Objection</b> - I really have to object to redirecting the article the way you did ... Perhaps I have misinterpreted your motivations, but redirecting an article that is in the middle of an AfD debate comes across as a back handed attempt to save the material in violation of the process ... which in turn comes across as a POV ploy. All this redirect does is shift the problem to another article. The material is still a dicdef and is still a violation of WP:SYNT. Plus the article into which it was moved has it's own issues with lack of citation (ie it had none prior to your redirect). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>According to WP:SYN,</b> "that precise analysis (A+B=C expressed by the author) must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published in Wikipedia."</p>
<p>In the Smith and Jones case, the author analyzed what Jones did (A) in light of some standard the author chose (B) to assert Smith may have been wrong about Jones (C) without citing a souce who agrees with the analysis. He takes A from one source, B from another, and asserts C on his own.</p>
<p>But here, there is no "Conclusion C." What are you saying are the A+B=C? If you assert I <b>imply</b> C, first of all that's not in WP:SYN, and if you do so on the basis of two different meanings of a term sitting on the same page, you'd better not read any dictionaries, your head might explode from possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, there is nothing I <b>"say in the article ... that connects a traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise to The Southern Mafia in the Senate."</b> - Mr.Z-man(above) It's you, making it up.</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Update</b> - With recent changes to the article, especially re-paragraphing, SYN is indeed much less of an issue. Unfortunately Dicdef still is an issue. The article basically says that a whole bunch of people have used this term, and then gives quotes of them doing so. It is an article about the <i>use</i> of the term "Southern Mafia" instead of an article about the <i>concept</i> of a "Southern Mafia". That is a DICDEF. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

You can't do that. Second, it doesn't help address the DICDEF issues anyway. Third, the subject of that particular source is the "Dixie Mafia", not the "Southern Mafia". Your assertion in the article that "Scarfone uses the terms 'Dixie Mafia' and 'Southern Mafia' in the same work, therefore we can establish Dixie Mafia = Southern Mafia, and therefore any reference to Dixie Mafia can be treated as a reference to Southern Mafia" is the very <i>core definition</i> of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>.</dd>

<dd>I have to commend the effort you are putting in to trying to save this article. It shows a lot of editorial perseverance and dedication that are <i>very</i> good traits and I for one appreciate your enthusiasm. Wikipedia can always use such tenacious editing! Unfortunately I think the problem with this article is that the "Southern Mafia" simply does not exist beyond a mere term of use and just can't be expanded beyond a dicdef - nothing out there seems to support anything more than that, and no amount of sourcing in examples will cure that fact. The zeal you are showing in trying to find sources leads me to believe that if they were there, you would have found them by now. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Somewhere</b> between SYN and COPYVIO must be room to write. Note, new rewriting so as not to cut-and-paste. Another more direct example of Dixie Mafia = Southern Mafia has been cited.

<dd>MBHiii, there is tons of room to write between SYN and COPYVIO ... Don't simply quote what the sources have said, write <i>about</i> what those sources have said. Also, I don't think anyone is saying that the Southern Mafia doesn't exist... We are simply saying that the way you are writing about it constitutes either OR or DICDEF. You keep going from one extreme to the other... without substantive statements discussing what the Southern Mafia is, where it came from, how it developed, etc. the article is nothing more than a dicdef stating that the term exists. When you try to add substance... you don't cite any reliable source to back up your substantive statements, which swings the article into violating NOR and SYN. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not agree that this article “Appears to fail notability and verifiability guidelines” or is not notable. The article refers to this person whether myspace or not. The link is audible and clear on what he believes and organizes according to his beliefs which are proven in his (audible-audio) lectures which are placed on myspace. Who said myspace was not notable or verifiable? Myspace is reliable. Myspace has rules and criteria and if someone writes a page on myspace and it is not correct, notable, verifiable, offensive or “libel” it will be removed from myspace. And myspace is also affiliated with CNN. Myspace is notable and verifiable(as everyone from political figures, political organizations, businesses to artist have a page there) and there are many “wikipedia pages” which uses or refers to myspace as a source. Do not be slanted in your view and misquote verifiability or notability. How notable and verifiable do you get, this guys actual lectures and speeches are on (audio) on myspace and the actual existence of his page and speeches (being there) is a very verifiable and notable source. I have also found flyers and postings of his lectures and speeches as well by going to the page. --Talib_Talib 19:24, 18 March 2007</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowstone_National_Park_578c.html" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. This trail is beautiful (I've hiked it) but isn't especially noted and featured enough for an encyclopedic article. One reason (not mentioned in the nominated stub) that it's noted among a small circle of biologists is that it's been studied for regrowth since the 1988 fires that were reported worldwide; thousands of new trees have been growing among stands of utterly burnt trunks. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Mallard+Lake%22+trail&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Mallard+Lake%22+trail&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> shows that the trail is listed in some trail guides that are independent of the National Park Service (Yellowstone's caretaker), as well as less attributable sources such as personal hiking blogs, but I don't think there's enough. Maybe a Park naturalist could provide enough history and book citations (such as Aubrey Haines' and Lee Whittlesey's books, I haven't checked Google Books) to make a new article, in which case it should be welcomed. But this stub doesn't assert any notability nor provide any sources. I'm not aware of much historical relevance, and if the trail has some <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributable</a> sources that are more like "featured" rather than "passing mention" or "directory entry", this belongs in <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowstone_National_Park_578c.html" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> which doesn't currently have a trails section, let alone a "Trails of ..." breakout article that Mallard Lake Trail might be merged to. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I see that NPS (and USGS) sources are the vast majority of references for the Glacier articles; they're reasonable authoritative, but not very independent. Some third-party sources would be nice. There are enough books about Yellowstone's trails, backcountry, and history to write a trails section if we can devote enough time to it. This would be better broken out as a topic than split among geographic regions, in YNP's case, because the best trails either link two or more developed areas, or start in backcountry and go deeper (such as Bechler). I'm considering starting a draft in a user subpage, and getting interested people to improve it there and cite the Haines and Whittlesey books, so it won't get AfD'ed like this stub. This trail's article exists because someone wanted a place to put one photo of a stump, with no other claim of notability or interest such as the fire-regrowth studies; it won't help for the YNP article nor for the "Trails of ..." article I might write. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 22:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's been <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28news%29_d447.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (news)">some discussion</a>, although no apparent consensus, about the standards that news reports about crimes need to rise to in order to be proper encyclopedia subjects. Versus the obvious fact that they typically <i>do</i> usually meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">basic standard</a> of disinterested, third party coverage, there is the sense that we ought not to be creating a memorial to every crime or criminal. As to the specifics of this crime, while half a ton of cocaine is nothing to sniff at — aye, it's a great deal to sniff at — it isn't particularly impressive by U.S. standards; there are at least several thousand people in U.S. prisons who could top that. There are, of course, also <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a> considerations when living dealing with people who are accused, or stand convicted of crimes.

<li>This may certainly be true by U.S. standards, and while that may be an unfair comparison, by British (and arguably European) standards it is one of the largest ever to be smuggled into the country. It was also the subject one of the largest survailance operations undertaken by British customs officials. Additionally, his wife and co-conspiraitor Julie Paterson, apparently a personal friend of actor <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Dalton_911f.html" title="Timothy Dalton">Timothy Dalton</a>, was sentenced the largest prison term ever given to a female drug trafficker. All of the points are stated and cited in the article.

<li><b>delete</b> Although I believe that that the scale of the crime makes it a worthy article, it is based upon such an unreliable source (a single article in the Evening Standard), is lacking in detail and contains so many flaws that it should be deleted. For a start, Michael Tyrrell is spelt with 2 "r's" and he was not married to Julie Paterson (she was a former girlfriend). Michael Tyrrell's partner was Jill Fuller and between them they bought four properties in the UK with a value exceeding £1 million. One of these properties was Orchard Bay House on the Isle of Wight and it was here that the smuggling operation took place. It was Jill Fuller who was convicted of money laundering (not Julie Paterson) and she got a sentence of 4 years. Jill Fuller was a friend of Timothy Dalton and he was a character witness at her trial. Julie Paterson did indeed receive 24 years, the longest sentence for a female trafficker in the UK, although this was subsequently reduced to 22 years on appeal. The comment that this crime is small by American standards is not a good reason for deleting this article but it so fundamentally flawed, it should go. Negferret 14:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Until new rules for notability of criminals are set by wiki community, I say now we should keep it, at least for now. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooyi_6e7f.html" title="User:Wooyi">Wooyi</a> 04:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh good, we have a volunteer! Bear in mind that there are TWO articles (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a>) which deal with the current AF1s, and you'll have to watch them both. I RESENT your assertion that editors who don't wan't to deal with the cruft are simply lazy. I have fought cruft for months here on Wiki, and they do NOT add THEMSELVES. Many crufters will fight tooth-and-nail to keep their items in the articles (see <a href="../../../f/-/1/Talk%7EF-15_Eagle_b20c.html" title="Talk:F-15 Eagle">Talk:F-15 Eagle</a>'s battle over Transformers). As I detail below, as long as Wiki policy permits itms like these, they have to go somewhere. I have yet to encounter a crufter who objects to having a separate page for their items, but they just want them on Wiki. I am totally for banning ALL unsourced cruft, and will join you in this fight if you want to challege the current rules. But for now, having pop-culture pages is an acceptable compromise on the issue under Wiki's current policies and guidelines. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I much agree here. Trying to maintain a popular article where people add pop-culture references every day gets futile after a short while.

<li>The way to fix bloated pop-culture items is to BAN them, esp. since most are unsourced. Until then, these articles are legitimate, and should remain.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article was created (by me) after a split of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> page (which covers the history of the name and callsign), and the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a> page (which covers the current planes uses as AF1). Because of the split, it was confusing to have two separate Pop culture sections in both articles, with the same items being added to each list by editors unaware of the other list. ALL items on this page at this point are there because of consenus over several months of editing and pruning of the list on the main article. Most serious avialtion editors in <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">Project AIrcraft</a> would rather not have pop-culture items at all, but as long as Wikipedia permits them, pages such as this are a suitable compromise. I will oppose re-adding this material back into the main article on that page, if it happens. It will only cause confusion in the furture. If you don't like cruft, then try get Wiki policy changed to ban it; deleting pages like this is not the way to go. As long as crufters feel they are allowed to add their cruft to Wikipedia, it has to go somewhere; better here than cluttering up the main articles. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is official policy, not a guidline, and some idiot admin will block me for it. So in the real world, your suggestion to keep deleting is just not practical, and VIOLATES policy. Besides, crufters have friends, and they can gang up to form a concensus to keep the most inane items imaginable, and then you're screwed. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 17:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with BillC. Until a policy is created banning such articles, they have a right to exist if their topic is notable enough, can be sourced, is non-POV, etc. This topic is notable enough to justify an "in popular culture" article. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And again, that's a guideline, not a policy. In this case, it's better here than in TWO places, as explained in detail above. Whether one like Pop-culture pages or not, one really should consider the actual intent here, which could have been uncovered by a little reasearch. It was easy to find out who created the page, and ask the creator why he felt it necessary. But that was not done in this case (others might accuse one of being lazy). - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand that it's an essay. At no time did I suggest that it was anything other than an essay so I'm unclear as to why you felt the need to remind me of it. Essay or not, BHTT is still a piss-poor argument and if the best or only reason for having an article is because the information in it is trivial clutter from the main article, then that ought to be an indication that the information shouldn't be <i>anywhere</i>. I also understand why you thought it was necessary. Thinking that you couldn't possibly be more wrong in your reasoning doesn't mean that I don't understand your reasoning. The big problem with your reasoning is that now, instead of there being two articles to monitor for garbage content, there are three. That doesn't really strike me as accomplishing, well, anything. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:19, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not really a BHTT argument, because the Pop-culture content is sufficient for a stand-alone article.

The summary style link in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> is excellently written leading to this breakout article. The subject matter of this article includes notable books by well-known authors, high-budget Hollywood movies, and songs, of which Air Force One is the primary subject, not a mere mention in passing. This kind of article is an excellent reference intersection of several items on the same subject matter but which aren't otherwise linked. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 19:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Ambivalent</b>, delete it or keep it, but <b>do not merge</b> with Air Force 1.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> article is long, and splitting off a section is normal editorial practice, as was splitting off <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_VC-25_8fed.html" title="Boeing VC-25">Boeing VC-25</a> because it was an obvious content dividing line. Further splitting off the popular culture is a logical choice, because the relationships to the main article are more tangential, and including the trivia in both articles is redundant. With a major motion picture, books, etc. there is more than enough verifiable content for a stand-alone pop-culture article. The arguments here against popular culture content sound like <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDON%27TLIKEIT_90f9.html" title="WP:IDON'TLIKEIT">WP:IDON'TLIKEIT</a> IMHO. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 21:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The material is notable by definition (especially the films and TV references), and yes, there actually are people interested in cultural references to aircraft such as this one.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Here's what's stupid: if a subject is <i>too</i> notable, popular culture lists are deleted for having too many entries.

Also, some of these votes seem like <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> to me and are arguing that there are some people who are <i>interested</i> in this, which isn't a factor on if it should be kept or not.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 04:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Dear god no!</b> Please don't create any kind of policy solely for the purpose of allowing or disallowing "in popular culture" articles. Case-by-case consideration, even if time-consuming, is the best approach. That said, most of this article is verifiable and indeed verified through primary sources (i.e., the films, books, etc. themselves). However, the main article has a short "in popular culture" section that I believe is an adequate replacement for this list (although it could use selective expansion--of analysis, not additional instances). So, <b>redirect without merging</b> to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> as this is a plausible search term. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason summed up with one word: "And?" Another non-notable school. <b>Edit:</b> Article has since greatly improved. It should not take a AFD to make an article keepable though.

<li><b>Reply:</b> Thanks for the (changed) vote of confidence. Though the process can work, using AfDs as a means to satisfy notability criteria at the barrel of a gun is not the most effective means to improve articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The band <b>does</b> meet the notability requirements. They have six albums to their credit at the present time according to the article about them. Additionally, notability in itself is not a criterion for deletion. That being said, my concern is that there are not any sources listed. As a result none of the tracks or information can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verified</a>.

<dd>As the nominator I haven't nominated the band (although on closer inspection three of those six albums appear to be self-published), but just this album which appears to be an unreleased demo with nothing in the text to indicate any kind of significance. I recognise that some unreleased albums, eg the Beach Boys' <i>Smile</i> or Big Star's <i>Sister Lovers</i>, are genuinely notable but there's nothing to indicate it here. <font face="verdana"><a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 15:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My comment about the notability of the band was directed at the post above mine. I understand that you did not nominate the band. I was simply pointing out that they did have some degree of notability. As I said before, because this is a demo, the author of the page is going to need to provide sources for the content of the article. Otherwise, there is no way to prove that the album even exists. If the author is unable or unwilling to provide sources then the article should be deleted as per the nomination. I was not arguing for the album, I was merely stating that it needed sources in accordance with Wikipedia policy. --<font face="Times New Roman"><a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_Andiron_ae23.html" title="User:Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><strong>Cyrus Andiron</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrus_Andiron_c02a.html" title="User talk:Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyrus_Andiron_3174.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 17:32, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

No evidence of any scholarly discussion of this book that I can see, the closest we get to a claim of notability is this: <i>In about 2001 there was a made-for-TV-movie about a Civil War II that started in 2020 with a Chicano revolt in the Southwest that appeared on a cable channel with a scenario very similar to but not based directly on Chittum's book.</i> Er, right, so it was <i>not</i> made into a film then.

Even though these groups are small as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, secessionist sentiment is an important political issue that may need to be addressed in the near future, especially since there is a possibility that the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Oil_a7ee.html" title="Peak Oil">Peak Oil</a> situation which may develop in within the next five years or so may make sentiments favoring secessionist movements more prevalent. In addition, the science fiction book by Geordi LaForge and the 2001 TV movie shows that others are thinking along these lines (the TV movie and the science fiction book even showed the United States breaking up into White, Black, and Hispanic republics, just like Chittum's book). There are no cited sources because nobody wants to address an unpopular viewpoint that is so pessimistic, but it is a viewpoint that should be heard and that people should be aware of. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKeraunos_cb12.html" title="User:Keraunos">Keraunos</a> 04:10, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> <font color="red">[Editor has five edits, all to this page]</font> The book <i>Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America</i> is a major landmark on the American Right. As such, it is simply too important to lack Wikipedia coverage. It boldly picked up where certain other works left off such as "The Fallacy of the Multiethnic State: The Case of Yugoslavia," by Tomislav Sunic that appeared in a 1990 edition of the <i>Conservative Review</i>, and ""<a href="http://originaldissent.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-171.html" class="external text" title="http://originaldissent.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-171.html" rel="nofollow">Militant Musings: From Nightmare 1995 to My Utopian 2050</a>" by William S. Lind that appeared in the April 30, 1995 Sunday <i>Washington Post</i>. I was so impressed with this work that in the summer of 2006 I went out of my way to meet the author. Later that fall I spent over a week of my time personally crafting the new ebook version for America First Books. I also explained in the <a href="http://amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/chittum-thomas_w/Civil_War_II/CivilWarII-4-PublishersPreface.html" class="external text" title="http://amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/chittum-thomas_w/Civil_War_II/CivilWarII-4-PublishersPreface.html" rel="nofollow">Preface</a> that I wrote for this new edition why I view it as very timely and relevant even though it is now over a decade since its first publication in 1996. Please note the very positive reviews for the out-of-print <a href="http://amazon.com/Civil-War-II-Breakup-America/dp/0929408179/ref=sr_1_1/102-0221251-5707335?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174474695&amp;sr=8-1" class="external text" title="http://amazon.com/Civil-War-II-Breakup-America/dp/0929408179/ref=sr_1_1/102-0221251-5707335?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174474695&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">soft cover version at amazon.com</a>. It has five reviews with the maximum five-star ratings each, and one review with four stars. Also, on right wing talk shows I have heard listeners spontaneously bring up Mr. Chittum's work to talk show hosts many times. This happened four different times in the spring and summer of 2006 on Michael Collins Piper's talk show on <a href="http://republicbroadcasting.org/" class="external text" title="http://republicbroadcasting.org/" rel="nofollow">Republic Broadcasting Network</a>, which helped inspire Mike Piper to have Tom Chittum on his show twice in the fall. In fact, illegal immigration control activist Frosty Wooldridge, who now has his own talk show on the Republic Broadcasting Network, wrote a two-part feature article series about <i>Civil War Two</i> posted online in December 2006 at freedomsphoenix.com (see <a href="http://freedomsphoenix.com/Feature-Article.htm?InfoNo=012773" class="external text" title="http://freedomsphoenix.com/Feature-Article.htm?InfoNo=012773" rel="nofollow">Part One</a>and <a href="http://freedomsphoenix.com/Feature-Article.htm?InfoNo=012774" class="external text" title="http://freedomsphoenix.com/Feature-Article.htm?InfoNo=012774" rel="nofollow">Part Two</a>). Earlier, when Mr. Wooldridge was being interviewed by John Stadtmiller on his National Intel Report show, a person called in and stimulated a lengthy discussion about this book. Between Mike Piper, John Stadtmiller, and Frosty Wooldridge, the tone was fairly similar to my own in the <a href="http://amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/chittum-thomas_w/Civil_War_II/CivilWarII-4-PublishersPreface.html" class="external text" title="http://amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/chittum-thomas_w/Civil_War_II/CivilWarII-4-PublishersPreface.html" rel="nofollow">Preface</a> that I wrote for the ebook, namely that the issues that Tom Chittum has addressed burn even hotter today than ten years ago. Therefore, one might fear that any efforts to delete <i>Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America</i> from Wikipedia could be construed as a form of thought police suppression. After all, "secessionism" and "seperatism" are both regarded by many Americans as the ultimate "thought crime." All of this is actually a strong argument to not only keep the <i>Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America</i> article, but to also expand it out with more discussion. We need to confront our worst fears, not hide from them. Wikipedia also needs to avoid a taint of partisan censorship. As soon as I get through submitting this input, I am sending emails to Frosty Wooldridge and Mike Piper. I think the mere idea that folks involved with Wikipedia might entertain booting out the <i>Civil War Two</i> article would make a good topic for an open public forum discussion on their talk shows. And finally, in regard to comments that this work may be "pessimistic" or "depressing," although I dislike violence as opposed to peaceful means for achieving political objectives, I personally find the highly centralized, de facto bankrupt, arrogant, restrictive, and over-taxing Federal government that we have today more depressing than the possibility that North America might some day return back towards decentralized political structures closer to what the anti-Federalists contemplated in the 1780's, when they represented the majority opinion in America.

<li><b>Comment</b> note that the above contributor has a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> as the publisher of the current edition of this book. Furthermore, there is nothing here that argues within established wikipedia policy for keeping the article: the suggestion that the book is a "major landmark" is merely Mr. Fox's opinion; the two published articles whose themes it continues are irrelevant; Amazon reviews (other than editorial reviews, of which there are none for this book) are not reliable sources, so cannot be used to determine notability; callers to phone-in radio shows are not reliable sources; freedomsphoenix.com is a questionable source per the definition at <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.</li>
<li><b>Rebuttal Comment</b> I have worked in brokerage businesses in real estate and Wall Street where it is perfectly legal and ethical to have potential conflicts of interests (which are in fact unavoidable as a broker) as long as they are openly disclosed. I have openly disclosed my background, purpose, and potential conflicts of interests. Often people who are closest to a topic and who can provide some of the most insightful inputs also suffer potential conflicts of interest, therefore if everyone is screened out who might have a conflict of interest, Wikipedia could lose some very valuable input. I think that evidence of popular grass roots support can be a form of "free market place of ideas" citation for Mr. Chittum's works, even if his self-taught background and blunt style may not be particularly stylish for many academic journals supported by government-funded institutions. I can point to nationally prominent authors and academics who have given talks and published papers that have strong similarities to many points that Mr. Chittum makes, even though they might not openly cite him specifically. For example, the prominent maverick liberal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidal%2C_Gore" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidal%2C_Gore" rel="nofollow">Gore Vidal</a> gave his Nov 4, 1994 talk to the National Press Club titled "Confederacy of States" which described desirable aspects of future fragmentation of the U.S. and devolution of the U.S. Government. The prominent anarcho-libertarian scholar <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard-lib.html" class="external text" title="http://lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard-lib.html" rel="nofollow">Dr. Murray Rothbard</a> defended secessionism and separatism in his <a href="http://mises.org/media.aspx?action=showname&amp;ID=299" class="external text" title="http://mises.org/media.aspx?action=showname&amp;ID=299" rel="nofollow">archived lectures at Mises.org</a>.

<li>Furthermore, "Wikipedia also needs to avoid a taint of partisan censorship" is not a valid reason not to delete the article. Wikipedia has clear rules, most importantly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and its subsidiary guideline <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> that require evidence be presented (usually in the form of secondary sources in reliable publications, by which we mean those that have strict editorial controls and no blatant extremist political bias) that the subject of its articles is generally considered important. This evidence is lacking in the case of this book. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 20:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rebuttal Comment</b> Who are the real extremists? In his book <i>The Age of Uncertainty</i>, the late Harvard economist <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" class="external text" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" rel="nofollow">John Kenneth Galbraith</a> observed that most Americans are stunned when they first read the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> and see how many items on Marx's platform have become a reality in America today. Similarly in a late 1980's <i>Forbes</i> magazine interview, Nobel laureate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_friedman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_friedman" rel="nofollow">Milton Friedman</a> observed that virtually every item on the 1928 Socialist plank has become a reality in America today. Conservative columnist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Sobran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Sobran" rel="nofollow">Joseph Sobran</a> has observed that today "modern liberalism" is almost the exact opposite on key issues compared to "classical liberalism" of the early 19th century. Therefore, if one believes that history is cyclical, from a very long term historical perspective it is current U.S. Government policy, the bias of America's national media, and the leftism of our government-funded educational institutions that is "extreme," and not the views of traditional American conservatives such as Thomas Chittum who were driven underground in the pre-Internet late 20th century. Mr. Chittum is largely self-taught and has described himself as a "hillbilly." I think it shows discrimination against innately intelligent working class Americans to delete an article about one of his works because his style and socioeconomic background may not appeal to leftist extremist Establishment institutions. Dr. Murray Rothbard observed in his lectures that in the 1780's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-federalists" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-federalists" rel="nofollow">anti-Federalists</a> reflected majority opinion in America, which was much more in line with Mr. Chittum's views than what libertarians such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Craig_Roberts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Craig_Roberts" rel="nofollow">Dr. Paul Craig Roberts</a> refer to today as the modern liberal philosophy of "the Neo-Jacobin welfare-warfare global superstate that wages perpetual war for perpetual peace."

<p>This article deals with a minor company, Oshvision, that no longer exists. During its existence, it produced a few computer games, and was run by two teenagers. Previous versions of the article (over eight months ago) were incoherent, <s>there were issues with copyright</s> <small>(see my comment below)</small> and I speedily deleted some of them back then. However, as I recently found out, the creator of the article perceived this as censorship and still thinks Wikipedia should have an article about Oshvision. I told him I'd restore it, and properly nominate it for deletion, so the whole community could have a say in it and he could contribute to the discussion himself. Last year, it didn't meet our company inclusion criteria, and these days there are still no secondary sources that could ever serve as a source for the article. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 11:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My apologies. I remembered something about copyright issues with your images, but I looking through the history of the images you used, it seems to be that at first it just wasn't clear what the correct licenses were for the images you provided. Even if you've made certain images yourself, without the correct tagging, they can't be used. However, I think that I was wrong in including that in this nomination, it has nothing to do with the current discussion. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 14:22, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is CC-DucK. The CC-Comp page is still under construction from several members of CC-Comp. It is a private project that only several people know atm. We intend to finish it up asap, before letting the members of CC-Comp Forum know about this Wikipedia page. With 7k+ Members on our forums, I am certain that this Wikipedia page would be able to generate hits. CC-Comp IS an extremely active forum, and perhaps you went to check the 'hits' at the wrong time. So, please be patient, this Wikipedia page would be done soon. CC-DucK 21:51, 18 March 2007 (GMT+8)</p>

<p>Nope, we just felt that since we are arguably the best trading site of our game for that particular realm, we should have a Wikipedia page.

<p>Well, we just wanted a place to put the history of CC-Comp (Which is being worked on regardless). A lot of people ask about it.

It included the text "before she took out the single 'Naughty In the Bed' she already had release the singles global so all the music store chucked out the CD's and gave them back to Gwen, which he kept them just incase she wants to release it again."

<li><b>Delete/Redirect</b> - this was never relased as a single anywhere, Gwen filmed the video for it as a possible future single but her pregnancy prevented her from releasing it. No single was sent out, no promo was sent out. Tracklisting fake and details of video fake. The story of how the song was written alos fake, Gwen has never been hospitilized for a broken arm. The whole concept of video is also wrong, no body knows the details behind it, only rumors, Gwen has never even talked about the video, their has only been a one minute preview from teh choreographer.</li>

<dd>So much for the categories "LGBT nightclubs" and "Nightclubs in Australia" then and all the pages in them.

<li><b>Delete</b> If this was notable, there would be more to the article than its address and opening hours. Being "The Only Gay Nightclub in the Village" or even the best does not make it notable, nor do minor reviews or trivial mentions.

The creator's lack of civility ("Wiki-nazis" and suggestions of homophobia) aren't helping much either.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think that there is currently vandalism underway <i>per se,</i> it seems to me that the author is writing an article with a slight slant against the Chinese.

I don't deny that there's stuff going on that doesn't look, on its face, as if it's vandalism. But I don't know enough about the subject to be sure.

<p>According to the text in the article, the institution is involved in immoral activity. If it is true, it does not deserve to be an article under any category of educational institution in any standard encyclopedia. Plus I think, a bunch of ill information about anything is not a very nice article for an encyclopedia, it destroys the overall usual expectation for the readers. I think proving someone innocent or guilty is not wikipedia's responsibility. So the article should be deleted to avoid any controvertial content <a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPointchair_63f9.html" title="User:Pointchair">Pointchair</a> 15:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia must not shirk from controversy, and the article doesn't say anyone is being immoral. The question here should be, "are the cited sources <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a>?" <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 15:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Above comments are rational, but not necessarily true. One can start editing with any article. The thing that dragged my attention is the note it had as mentioning it Imballaced. Plus something that is informative should be careful enough while criticizing, cause may be the information we have already in the article are not rootless, but there may be some other information about it that we don't know or we haven't prove wrong. We can only ensure a negative image after we abandone all the positive claims. As far as I have known, the institute is authorized to produce non-formal education according to Spanish law and also the information about the Spanish law mentioning its authority other than the ministry of education is also correct. If anyone can help by any correction to this information, that will be a solution too. Otherwise it might be unjust to keep the article that way. Ofcourse I felt sympathetic after I read the letter complaing about the article in its discussion page.<a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPointchair_63f9.html" title="User:Pointchair">Pointchair</a> 17:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you want a "correction" contact Michigan, Oregon, Maine, and Texas' agencies to remove Bircham off the lists and allow that Bircham's degrees are valid. Also contact the other organizations including UNESCO. The article is not imbalanced because it is either accredited or not. The government sources as NPOV as possible. It is illegal for people in many places (Germany, US states, etc) to attempt to use unaccredited degrees. It is vital to make the unaccredited status clear.</dd>

</dl>
<p>This article was deleted previously (on the 1st nomination) on the basis of being non-notable. (In the interest of openness, I should mention I made that 1st nomination) It was subsequently recreated. Somebody else almost immediately nominated it for deletion a 2nd time, but the discussion seemed to focus more on if Andrew actually helped make RuneScape or not (which he did), and the nomination failed. This is therefore the 3rd nomination.</p>
<p>I am nominating this article for deletion, as it appears to be original research (see WP:OR), and also because I believe according to wikipedia guidelines it is 'not notable' (see WP:BIO)</p>
<p>Justification: With regards to the 'notability' part I don't dispute that this person helped make RuneScape which is a significant game. However reading WP-BIO it seems clear that whether something is notable enough to appear in wikipedia is more based on whether other reputable publications deemed the person notable (by writing about them). In particular read the primary criterion of WP:BIO. I believe the reason for this is because that then determines if sufficient reliable information is available about a given person to actually write the article. (without original research)</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is lack of solid 3rd party articles about this person. As such this page has ended up COMPLETELY unsourced, (original research). This in turn means it contains numerous factual innacuracies, and a bizarre mix of trivia as a result. It's certainly not a good biography. I can't see any verifiable facts that aren't already on the jagex article. It doesn't actually cover the key points of the persons life. (just a weird mix of things he did at 17)</p>
<p>I should mention that I am aware that there are articles that mention this person *in passing*, but those are articles are about Jagex or RuneScape, (which already have pages), not actually about this person. I.e they aren't biographical articles. The ONLY article I can find at all which is actually about the person (as opposed to Jagex) is the very brief paragraph in the sunday times, but that is referenced on the Jagex page anyway, and doesn't contain enough info to actually make a wikipedia page.</p>
<p>I therefore propose this article is redirected to Jagex, as all the verifiable facts (and their sources), are already listed on there anyway. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunefire_8dd8.html" title="User:Runefire">Runefire</a> 18:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S: Since first posting, I have reworded the above slightly, to repeat itself less, and hopefully be clearer. I have removed the comment about vandalism, as you are right that's not relevant. I hope that's allowed. Thanks</p>

<p>Reply to the above. I did read the entire 2nd nomination, and check every one of the sources. But as I originally stated they didn't actually seem to be about the person, and so didn't really provide facts to base the article on. (I.e they weren't biographical - With the exception of the sunday times one I already mentioned.) You mention WO:BIO#Special Cases. But the very first sentance of that section reads "The following criteria make it likely that sufficient reliable information is available about a given person". Obviously that isn't the case here. I was actually originally just going to strip out the info that wasn't verifiable, but then I realized that's the entire article. Hence the AFD instead.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no idea how you're not seeing statements that aren't on the Jagex article. This discusses programs he created AT THE BEGINNING and BEFORE Jagex was created. Destruction Imminent was not mentioned on the Jagex article. Andrews original plans for DeviousMUD are not stated in the Jagex or RuneScape article. Of course DeviousMUD is vaguely stated in the RuneScape article, but not in detail. This article is technically about the man who created RuneSCape, because not much is known about him. I created this article as a hope of informing others about this very interesting man. You have to understand that the sources were originally here when I first wrote this article. It was Andrews personal site-- where I got everything I stated in this article. It was later removed from archive.orgs database... which is why there are no sources, and likely to never be any sources again. Like I said, I'm just trying to inform people about a man who could be considered interesting, and outstanding in programming. This article is basically the only information left about the man, seeing as his site was blocked on archive.org. I ask that you keep this article, for historical purposes. ~ <a href="../../../r/i/h/User%7ERih29_7752.html" title="User:Rih29">rih29</a> 21:24, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes it is me, that has worked and invested so much into making this article a worthwhile addition to Wikipedia, having the article in the deletion process has been wonderful, and has taught me much about Wikipedia. I'm still learning, yes at the start I panicked and tried to delete the whole thing. I have not always signed on, yet I have been using <b>one</b> computer during the whole review process. The help I have received from people more experienced than me has been great. The article has been improved and anyone who needs the actual facts in their hands can ILL any of those journals or get them in many research libraries, if you have trouble I can help with that. Bangtale International was a small press affair, (1000 copies) I can forward to anyone if that is an issue. The part about nobility is somewhat in the range of social experiences. The various involvement in strong publications helps. I do have that MA in Information science where objectivity was drilled into me, day, after month, after year, yet I still miss things and make mistakes. . . thanks for your very useful insight. When bias towards one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed.

<li><b>Keep</b> Has not appeared in requisite 75+ films, but appears to direct pornographic films as well as act in them (should probably add that to the article). However, being a big-busted regular columnist for a big-bust genre magazine would probably fit the criteria for being prolific in or contributing significantly to a specific subgenre.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 02:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another "in popular culture" section that was split out into its own "article" instead of being pruned, as it should have been. There is nothing encyclopaedic about "references to &lt;randomly chosen film&gt; in popular culture", so a list of same is defintely not encyclopaedic. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> That's a fairly interesting article. It should be said that "A Clockwork Orange" (both the Kubrick film and Burgess novel) have been considered highly controversial and influential and cannot be fairly compared to "random films" as the nominator has. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 13:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Originally this list was part of the main Clockwork Orange article, and it got too big so it had to be spun off. Clockwork Orange has had significant influences on various types of popular culture, and this article demonstrates that. However, it does need references to verify that all of the entries are accurate. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 23:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it is worth documenting the extent of influence of the film, although some of the entries are trivial. There are certainly some recognisable themes that crop up. The list adds to the body of knowledge about the film and it's effects on people. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentC_c6bd.html" title="User:SilentC">SilentC</a> 00:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Remains to be seen whether the browser is "short-lived" (gee, thanks).

<p>Sorry I didn't mean short-lived as in "won't last long" or "dead", I meant it as in "only been around for a matter of months". And notability is generally held to mean third-parties have talked about it. Can you point to anyone talking about it aside from yourselves, or forum postings? For people who are interested in browsers, it is only notable in that "WebCore" has been ported to another platform, which suggests it should just be a short mention on the "WebCore" page, not an entire article. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 01:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And from where did you get my name? It hasn't been previously disclosed on Wikipedia as far as I know. But yeah, you got the right guy. I demoed the Pegasos and MorphOS at a fold-out table at Computerfest Dayton in 2003. At that I wore a Genesi shirt that had been given me and I did write at that MorphOS fan page with the world map that I "represented" Genesi there. I received no money for that, but a year or more earlier I had paid $600 for a Pegasos mainboard, a discount, with the understanding that I would demo the board at Computerfest that year (2002). But it didn't work out and I decided to go the next year. I also attended CES 2003 where I shared a hotel room that Genesi had paid for for two nights. I snapped some shots and stood at the stand there, not really needing to because they had about 13 people, between wandering around to enjoy the show, running the 5K (or was it a five miler), and infecting my friends there with an unholy flu bug that I had caught just before flying out (on frequent flyer miles). The arrangement was all wholly informal "sure, come on out, we'll set you up with a room." I think the discount, the hotel room, and the shirts are the only things I ever got from Genesi, no money certainly, and I didn't expect or ask for anything else. I also demoed the Pegasos at my computer user group in 2002, and when Genesi held a show near my town in late 2003, this was at my initiative and for the enjoyment of it. Since 2003 I haven't attended anything like that that I recall, hard to believe three and a half years have gone by. I said above that I have no financial interest in MorphOS or Sputnik and that I am a user of them, and that is how I see myself. But you've done your detective work well, hope it's as sordid as you imagined. I think you're insufficiently tying it all back to Sputnik though, a browser that is not even sold, it's given away. When you figure out where my payoff is coming from, Alistair, please give me a call on my cell-phone or perhaps a letter or maybe you can have an enforcer drop by my place and show me his brass knuckles. As for a conflict of interest about any of this, I'd rather hear perspectives from anyone who is not you. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 22:08, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AmiGR and Henriok already said on the article's talkpage why they believe it is notable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep - This web browser is notable since it's the only really modern for MorphOS, it's based on the second most popular Open Source webb-browser source (WebCore) and it's under active development. -- Henriok 19:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is notable in that it is the first working browser on AmigaOS-related platforms (MorphOS currently, will be ported to AmigaOS4 and others) to support modern web technologies like CSS and reasonable JS. AMiGR —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 81.96.77.103 (talk • contribs) 19:51, March 18, 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>AlistairMcMillan, you've now done two things that I've never had done to me in almost two years of editing Wikipedia. First, you've posted my real name. This after Googling my username and the subject of an article that I edited, going through the results until you found the Daniel you were looking for, in some sort of detective effort to find a conflict of interest for this, an article about a browser programmed by one guy and given away at no charge. Second, you have modified a comment I made above, to draw a line through the name AmiGR.</p>
<p>It doesn't help me to tell you not to post my real name again, you've already done it. I will tell you not to modify comments that I have made. You may rebut them immediately after, but leave my comments for the Wikipedia record as I wrote them. I have restored my comment to the way I posted it and undid your damage to it. If you change it again, I guess I will see about complaining to an admin about you.</p>
<p>I am astounded at the level of personal antipathy you have towards this, an innocuous article about a free browser for an alternative computer platform. You are sarcastic and rude and seem determined to throw stuff at it until it falls down. I can't imagine it is actually about this article and can only surmise you are misdirecting your negative feelings about something else. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 23:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's been five or more days and the discussion shows that most see the notability of the Sputnik browser article. As several noted, it is notable for being the first browser for MorphOS that is capable of modern standards such as CSS. This is reliably sourced in the article, to an alternative computer news portal with editorial controls, as well as to a print magazine. One editor comment that "hardly anyone has heard of" the OS but number of users does not equal notability any more than Wikipedia is a democracy. Neither does a small number of users equal non-notability. The same editor went on to imply that since the print magazine is produced by an Amiga user group that it is somehow suspect and unreliable, but the magazine is full-length and high quality and released and mailed on a reliable schedule and generally lives up to a very high standard. This may be directly observed by reading the sample articles at the website. The same opposing editor appeared to be attempting to make the case that I as the article's originator had a conflict of interest because I presented Pegasos computer hardware at a computer show 3 1/2 years ago. To do this he Googled my first name (which is included in my user name) as well as MorphOS, the Pegasos operating system on which Sputnik runs. Finding something he regarded as incriminating he then posted my full name in this discussion. This was against my wishes and I believe against Wikipedia policy, but the salient point for this debate is that he failed to actually show a conflict of interest. By any reasonable standard I am not "involved" with Sputnik, a freely released browser programmed by one person who is not me. To summarize, I believe the discussion shows that Sputnik browser is notable and that the article (a stub right now) is fairly well-sourced (given its nature as a new program for a less-known alternative OS) and that the article is an appropriate and valuable addition to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 23:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know something, if you had devoted this much time and energy to improving the article it might be something worth keeping. The four sources you have come up with are all to do with the Amiga community, no sources from outside that community. The three web sources all pretty much just say "someone ported WebKit to MorphOS and here is a brief list of features" and nothing else. The magazine source does have an interview, but we can't see that to determine if there is anything in there that might be interesting: for example is it just a direct port or has the developer added any new feature like the Nokia guys did with their port.</p>
<p>About your name. I am genuinely sorry that I revealed your real name. Given that you use your first name and the first initial of your second I didn't think for a second that you were trying to hide your identity. But the fact is I asked you whether your had any involvement with the project, when I already knew you had some contact with Genesi hoping you would say something like "yeah I helped out at a booth for free a couple of days but I'm only a user" or something, not the cryptic "I have no financial interest" answer. For what it is worth, I genuinely believe you that you have no involvement in either MorphOS or Sputnik, aside from being an interested user. And, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we have any policy about protecting editors identities. <a href="../../../a/n/o/Wikipedia%7EAnonymity_56f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Anonymity">Wikipedia:Anonymity</a> is almost a blank page and our <a href="../../../p/r/i/Wikipedia%7EPrivacy_policy_7b3a.html" title="Wikipedia:Privacy policy">Wikipedia:Privacy policy</a> basically says don't use your real name if you want to be anonymous. You might be thinking of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> but that is about biography articles not editors themselves.</p>
<p>Which all doesn't change the fact that the only way in which this software is notable is that (a) WebKit has been ported to another platform and (b) MorphOS now has a browser. Notes to be added to other articles, not enough for a whole article itself. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 03:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's factually incorrect in (b). MorphOS has at least three other browsers. <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyager_%28web_browser%29.html" title="Voyager (web browser)">Voyager (web browser)</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/r/IBrowse_8584.html" title="IBrowse">IBrowse</a>, <a href="../../../a/w/e/AWeb_ec69.html" title="AWeb">AWeb</a>. As said by others in this discussion and me, one reason Sputnik is notable is because it is the *first browser for MorphOS to support modern standards such as CSS*. And Alistair, I'll return your comment, your time would be better spent in positive activities. At least I try to make an article that people will be interested in and use as a resource to learn about the subject, whereas you just try to pick it off. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielM_572f.html" title="User:DanielM">DanielM</a> 14:53, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

While brigade-level subordinate units can certainly be notable (although, frankly, one that's only been around since 1985 is rather pushing it in this respect—it simply won't have the extensive history needed to write a good article), the current article is an overly detailed play-by-play of every operation the brigade has undertaken rather than a true historical narrative; it would be a mere stub if it were trimmed down to the level of detail typical for a unit article. Given how short the parent article is at the moment, I don't think a split is warranted at this time; if/when the parent becomes too long, we can reconsider the issue. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>De-prodded by an IP with no rationale. This is a dicdef and never will be more than a dicdef. The original disambiguation page was unilaterally moved to <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destruction_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Destruction (disambiguation)">Destruction (disambiguation)</a>, and I think that page has the relevant history and should be moved back after deletion (which is why I didn't do a C&amp;P move).</p>

<li>Ah, well, then we get into the question "how long do you give an article to <i>become</i> something worth keeping?" <i>I</i> certainly don't know. I think I'll practice wikifying the article, and hope the original editor comes back to finish (started in just the last 3 days or so). (issues of duplication, getting the links 'better', comparing exposition style with other poets/authors, reducing article to essentials, etc.) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 19:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let's give it some time to develop then. I'll do some work on it if I have time then, and we shall see how this turns out - I suppose the notability question really comes down to what links to the article, how many readers visit the article, and how many editors edit it. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim.bounceback_15a6.html" title="User:Tim.bounceback">T<sub>im</sub>.boun<sup>ce</sup>back</a> - <a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETim.bounceback_9fe6.html" title="User talk:Tim.bounceback">TaLk</a> 21:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> this article makes a useful contribution to the documentation of Black British writers and writing. This writer is well known on the British poetry and spoken word scene and has published several books (as the Peepal Tree site confirms). This wikipedia entry is a good and useful reference for those of us who are researching into contemporary literature, particularly as contemporary poets and poetry tends to be ignored outside specialist publications. So I strongly urge that this entry remains. 62.7.150.93 12:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b>-I don't understand the objections. This person appears notable and interesting to me. Definitely keep. 212.219.249.5 18:59, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>I think this should be kept. Someone who has published two books of poetry and had plays produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and 7:84 Theatre Company is clearly notable. 212.219.249.5 19:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>New request for <b>Deletion</b> reason: i dont see any point in having theese articles surrounding peoples races. i mean their are just to many arguments over theese. just as the black people,white and caucasians.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You are mistaking the term <i>Asian</i> for one that denotes a single racial or ethnic group. The header itself makes it very clear that the article is about <i>definitions</i> as used in English-speaking countries. —<a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagalag_0ace.html" title="User:Lagalag">Lagalag</a> 06:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very strong delete</b> This article is just an excuse to tell people who is and isn't Asian and force a POV. It contains no real facts, just glorified opinions pretending to be encyclopedic <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 21:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. An encyclopedia should not delete information and historical accounts on what has been and what is. This and other similar articles are not putting a value to a certain skin color or "race" but only describing the cultural heritage and history of mankind - with all the bad sides to it. If this article is deleted then we're on a slippery slope and it could lead to historical revisionism, much worse than the proposer is suggesting. Closing the eyes won't make any suggested problems disappear - only enlightenment can take care of that. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 21:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No having this article itself will lead to historical revisionism because extreme POVs on either side will selectively quote selectively chosen historians to push their POVs and since most people don't bother to read history books, they just get all their information from wikipedia, history will indeed be rewritten <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 22:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On that basis, several articles about the nazi's <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcrime.html" title="Warcrime">warcrimes</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_hygiene.html" title="Racial hygiene">racial hygiene</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> and similar should also be deleted. If they're taken out of context they could also be misused and misquoted. Just because people have heavily slanted POVs out there is one reason why articles like these should be there to inform and point to the facts in its sources. History is ugly in many cases, but deleting the accounts of them won't make them go away and the following generations won't learn from the previous one's mistakes. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 22:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Asian people is a neoligism which qualify for deletion. The correct term is Oriental.

<li>Oriental and Asian have the same age in terms of lingustic history, both refering to the same place (Read Count of Monte Cristo, which the arab girl is described as "oriental").

<p>Nominating for <b>Deletion</b> Reason: How is this article notable? its about black people like it is a sort of animal or something "special" atleast many people her thinks so when you look at the discussion page. I think this should be deleted ,i also think its strange that it is a "massajman" as a rawmodel for black people and then celebrities and other more notable persons on the White people section. How is a massajman notable? lets here more opinions.should it be kept or deleted? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatrix17_be53.html" title="User:Matrix17">Matrix17</a> 17:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>*Very Strong Delete</b> I'm tired of all the edit wars and complaining on the talk page. I worked very hard to make sure everything was referenced and make sure all view points were heard, but people are never happy. If you look up the word black in the dictionary it is defined as a member of a dark skinned race especially one of African descent, and yet people are complaining that race is being mentioned in the article. It's like trying to write an article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chritianity.html" title="Chritianity">Chritianity</a> without being allowed to mention religion. One person keeps saying that even 4 year olds know what a black person is. If so, why the need for an article? There isn't much encyclopedic you can say about this topic that doesn't offend people and create edit wars, and most encyclopedias don't include this as a subject. They may include articles about the African diasporas, or skin color, or race, but not about black people. In general I don't think the wikipedia process works well on controversial topics because controversial topics attract people with extreme view points who are trying to push an agenda &amp; such articles are always swinging from one extreme to another depending on which side become more numerous and more determined. Wikipedia works much better for less politically charged topics where editors can work together instead of against one another. In short how can you write an article on black people if editors can't even agree who black people are. You have some editors claiming only people of sub-Saharan African ancestry are black, you have other editors saying Oceanic ancestry is also black, and you have still others saying people from India are black. And don't even get me started on whether Afro-multiracials are black. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 18:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>*<s>Very Strong Delete</s></b> I also VOTE for deletion. i think as iseebias thinks that it is to many people getting upset and angry on this article. and also on the white and caucasian articles. i dont think you can place PEOPLE in certain categories according to race. I dont see my dark coloured friend as my "black friend" but as only my friend. this article also has many strange opinions in it. and the massaj man is actually not representative for all people. so i say this article should be gone.Their are to many people thinking it shouldnt be deleted if you look at the discussion page to,and the Vanuatu man making food or somthing with a stick is just pure racism in the worst way.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatrix17_be53.html" title="User:Matrix17">Matrix17</a> 19:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> what I am trying to illustrate is cultural relativity. What may offend one person may not be offensive to others. If you only have a western view, then there is a vast array of things that will be offensive. There are many people who still live a pre modern existence. to some any mention of them is racist. to others its just a way of life. but we digress. my point is if society sees black and white, why should we pretend not to. for example most social economic indicators still show differences between black and white.<a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMuntuwandi_bdf5.html" title="User:Muntuwandi">Muntuwandi</a> 20:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Society sees black and white because we keep focusing on the distinction. There are many other distinctions: Tall-Short, heavy-slim, old-young, blue eyes-brown eyes, democrat-republican (many of these also show economic indicators)but society (at least in North America) is obsessed with dividing people into "blacks" and "whites". The more attention we give these social constructions the more important they become. What a positive message it would send if wikipedia decided that "race" and/or skin color were of so little significane that they didn't even have articles on blacks and whites<a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 20:47, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b>. An encyclopedia should not delete information and historical accounts on what has been and what is. This and other similar article are not putting a value to a certain skin color or "race" but only describing the cultural heritage and history of mankind - with all the bad sides to it. If this article is deleted then we're on a slipping slope and it could lead to historical revisionism.

<dd>No having this article itself will lead to historical revisionism because extreme POVs on either side will selectively quote selectively chosen historians to push their POVs and since most people don't bother to read history books, they just get all their information from wikipedia, history will indeed be rewritten <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 22:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

If they're taken out of context they could also be misused and misquoted. Just because people have heavily slanted POVs out there is one reason why articles like these should be there to inform and point to the facts in its sources. History is ugly in many cases, but deleting the accounts of them won't make them go away and the following generations won't learn from the previous one's mistakes. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 22:08, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>. An encyclopedia should not delete information and historical accounts on what has been and what is. This and other similar articles are not putting a value to a certain skin color or "race" but only describing the cultural heritage and history of mankind - with all the bad sides to it. If this article is deleted then we're on a slippery slope and it could lead to historical revisionism, much worse than the proposer is suggesting.

<li><b>Speedy Keep.</b>. Are we certain Matrix17 is not working for NAACP? In any case, you know what: who cares if he report this to NAACP. This article, unlike caucasian race, actually explore the perceptions of each regions with Caucasians. I think this is a valid article. As for <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasian race</a>, which is also going AFD and nominated by Matrix17, that's a even more valid article if not more. May be a bit better rewording, but nothing a <b>move</b> can't solve. And you know what? The exact reason why we have racism is because, aside from people who are out right racist, is also because we have people who decided to do a young Malcom X and just accuse everything that is unfavorable to them as racist. And no, political correctness, which is clearly what the nominator trying to do, just does not work, unless you actually believe that by erasing essential but ugly knowledges will help things out. Then again, in that case, why don't we take out male and female? Why don't we take out fat and thin?

<dd>wikipedia only works when editors work together towards a common goal. It does not produce quality results in controversial articles because controversy attracts extreme opinions and when editors become polarized they work against one another's interests which gives rise to editorial chaos. Articles that have required repeated protection do not lend themselves to the stability wikipedia strives for and should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Odd how the majority of the "speedy keeps" have had little or nothing to do with the article in question. I wonder if they are making snap decisions here without actually having had a look at the sort of POV pushing racism on this article? Defending something they have not actually read. This article is certainly damaging the integrity of Wikipedia, and claiming that it is a valid subject for an encyclopaedia is <b>not</b> the same as claiming that the content is of any value. If it is impossible for the article to become of any value because it attracts people with extreme POVs to push, then what exactly is the purpose of the article? The value of an article is no measured by the utilty of it's title, it is measured by the impartiality of it's contents. Unless more good faith editors are prepared to spend their time on this sort of difficult and depressing article, then it is never going to be anything other than a very deep and very sad reflection on the lack of credibility Wikipedia has. This article currently makes Wikipedia look like a bunch of racist nutters, but if that's how you want the project to be perceived then please go on defending this article, even when you do not know what is actually contained within it. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 01:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

However, it is <i>certainly</i> a valid topic, so it should just be cleaned up.

<li>Oh really? Why not? An article may look good in theory but if experience has proven that the subject is too controversial to be maintained at a level of quality, then of course we should delete it <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 01:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see why not if a vote for deletion were to be carried. Maybe the fact that Wikipedia is prepared to allow this sort of nonsense, just because the subject is allegedly a "valid topic", just goes to show that it is as fundamentally flawed as it's critics claim. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 01:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>It is "fundamentally flawed" to accurately report the widely held concept of people who are white?</i> SO are you claiming that the article in it's current form is accurate?

<li><b>Comment</b> - As an administrator pointed out above, when speedily closing the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> AfD, (which was nominated for identical reasons) "Controversy is not a reason to delete." Removing an article requires far more substantial an argument than, "It might cause problems," "Its content has issues," or, "I don't like this topic." In the <i>opinion</i> of a few editors, the articles are "unstable," but there is no policy that can possibly be followed to justify the removal of content simply because of trolls, vandals and politically driven soapboxers. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 01:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article is controversial to the point where it can not function, to the point where quality editors are being driven out by POV pushers, to the point where there's constant chaos, incivility, and requires page protection repeatedly, and is damaging wikipedia's credibility, then I think that's perhaps the best reason of all to delete. Never forget that a paramount wikipedia value is stability. Just as stability causes articles to become feature articles, articles that have demonstrated an inability to achieve stability and cooperation should be deleted. Wikipedia policy states that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view. Experience tells us that some articles are too polarizing for this ideal to be maintained in practice, and thus thier very existence violates the spirit of wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 01:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case we should delete all articles about European countries east of the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Curtain_64ae.html" title="Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 02:01, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't know. I haven't studied articles on eastern European countries. But I have studied articles dealing with race, and I've seen a consistent pattern of editorial disorder. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> is quite frequently the sounding board for editors in conflict over countries like <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>.

<ul>
<li>Again I haven't studied middle eastern articles and thus will not speculate outside my experience. But with respect to articles on blacks and whites, experience has repeatedly demonstrated that they tend towards chaos, incivility, editorial disintegration, and POV pushing. Experience has repeatedly demonstrated that they are impossible to maintain to wikipedia's standards so how much longer should we induldge such hopeless topics before pulling the plug? At some point we have to accept that certain topics simply don't work in wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Disruptive editors should be warned, and then disciplined. POV statements should be removed, and controversial statements should be properly sourced. You don't delete content from Wikipedia as long as it satisfies the criteria of verifiability and notability. We can certainly verify that a subset of humanity refers to itself as "white," and the amount of problems you've mentioned with the entry certainly speaks to its notability. Experience should be a catalyst for growth, not defeatism, and you don't quit doing something just because it's "hard." Editors who find their stress level rising over a particular entry should simply edit less emotionally charged material and leave the matter to those willing to continue - you don't try to cover up temporary and apparent failures by erasing the evidence. This is the way Wikipedia has worked and continues to work. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 02:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>All excellent points. You have convinced me. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 02:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Certain topics are simply a magnate for disruptive editors and when one is removed ten new ones show up. There's an endly supply of notable verifiable content but opinionated editors selectively choose only that which promotes their agenda and find excuses for removing alternative content. People end up wasting days and weeks arguing on the talk page. Edit wars ensue, pages get protected, editors get blocked or simply leave in frustation, articles get tagged, good faith editors are told to hang in there, and the cycle continues endlessly. At what point do we say enough is enough? We've tried this topic on wikipedia, we've given it opportunity after opportunity to succeed, and it simply has failed. Why can't we just admit that not all topics lend themselves to the wikipedia process and confine our efforts to those that do? I think editors that are claiming this article can work, despite the massive evidence to the contrary, have a responsibility to stay here and make sure it does work. It's very easy to throw ideals around, much harder to maintain an article 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, in the face of numerous conflicting interest groups <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think you have understood my point above. This is not about ideals, it is about maintaining <i>policies</i>. You have all the freedom in the world to give up hope... I am not going to try to convince you to keep trying to do what you have been doing. But this does not mean that we must deny others the opportunity to make the attempt because of <i>your</i> point of view. Wikipedia works by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. I think it might help, though, for you to realize that it is not your personal responsibility "to maintain an article 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, in the face of numerous conflicting interest groups." That's what the community is for. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 02:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding was that wikipedia works by maintaining <i>standards</i>. I agree that there's a consensus that this topic has a right to exist, but I urge people to stop trying to reinvent a broken wheel. There is value in learning from the mistakes of others and policy needs to be flexible <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Certainly, but if you take a look at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>, you will find that right under "Wikipedia policies" (the table on the upper right) you find, "Article standards," and then the list of policies I have mentioned. In other words, the standards are maintained by the policies, not the experiences of individual editors, regardless of how valid those experiences may be. Policies may be flexible, yes, when they come into conflict with consensus, but that is not the case here. I am not trying to trivialize the difficulty that has existed with this and other articles, and I do believe (as you seem to as well) that "race" has far more to do with society than anything empirical, but it is a notable, verifiable social construct, and as such must be discussed in any legitimate body of knowledge (i.e., an encyclopedia) with as much neutrality and care as can be. Again, if you find it difficult or feel burned out on this entry, take a step back; take a look at <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a>, and let others fight the vandals for a while. In any event, I think I have represented my position as clearly as I can, so I'll just let the votes tell the tale. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 03:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So how much time does wikipedia give an article to come up to quality standards before deciding to delete it? <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 03:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No. Just the ones that pass <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I think its ability to provide sourced, unbiased articles on obscure, but notable, subjects is Wikipedia's greatest strength. Personally, I would be very wary of using Wikipedia as a reference source on the big subjects-- mathematics, country profiles, major historical figures, etc. First, because reliable sources on those subjects already exist in abundance. And second, because Wikipedia is, after all, the product of anonymous, uncredentialed editors, any one of whom may be a vandal or a troll. However, information on non-traditional subjects, like this article, is exactly what Wikipedia does well. Why chip away at Wikipedia's strength? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 23:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nearly all porn stars have IMDb entries. It is not a criteria for notability, as stated in Wikipedia guidlines. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 23:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
