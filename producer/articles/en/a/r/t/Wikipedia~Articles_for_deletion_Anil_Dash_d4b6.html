<li>Bullshit. There are 270 blogger-related articles on Wikipedia at this very moment. See <a href="../../../b/l/o/Category%7EBloggers_c891.html" title="Category:Bloggers">Category:Bloggers</a>. Anil Dash is VP of the company which owns <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, amongst other things. This entry is notable, verifiable and NPOV. No valid reason given for deletion by the <i>anonymous</i> nominator. My vote is to <b>keep</b> and <b>delist</b> from VfD as an invalid nomination. —<b>RaD Man</b>(<i>talk</i>) 05:56, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: User:Bloghate was created the same day this article was posted to VfD. Probable sock puppet as the user migrated immediately to VfD and this particular vote was their 8th edit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Bloghate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Bloghate" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> —<b>RaD Man</b>(<i>talk</i>) 05:59, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like to point out that there seems to be a noticeable overlap between the contributions(which all seem to be votes for deletion) of <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.19.111.5.html" title="User:70.19.111.5">User:70.19.111.5</a> and User:Bloghate.

<li><b>Keep</b> Anil was one of the notable personalities and business people of the personal online publishing revolution of the early 2000s.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think anything should ever be deleted from Wikipedia.

<li>Keep! Anil is an important figure at one of the leading blogging technology companies, responsible for LiveJournal, Movable Type and TypePad. User:ianbetteridge</li>
<li><b>Keep!</b> Anyone who can get a goatse.cx t-shirt into the new york times deserves canonization, let alone 1.5K of markup on wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Minor) Delete!!!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I really dont think he is that important a person who needs a mention on wikipedia.As has been already said there are lots of VPs and good number of them have done wonders, livejournal having a more users that citizens in some countries isn't really a good reason to add livejournal's vp to wikipedia.Also a good deal of whatever he writes isn't useful to common public anyway. by Badrinath.V.S</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Anil was one of the early webloggers and that he continues to this day is amazing, and he's still one of the most high-profile ones. This, more than his position within a company, should certainly net him a place on Wikipedia if it's true that 270 other webloggers are listed. (On a side note, this concept of condemning anything containing the four letters "blog" in combination is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. What if someone registered "Gamehate" and went on to kill all pages with one-off Mario RPG characters?) Wootest 08:42, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> No one accomplishment may warrant his inclusion but the sum of them make him a noteworthy and recognizable figure on the Internet landscape. The page is NPOV and I doubt it is an attempt to push publicity like an artist or somesuch. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelfavia_326a.html" title="User:Michaelfavia">michaelfavia</a> 16:13, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm disturbed by [User:Bloghate]'s attempt to delete pages of well-known and influential people in the context of an important emerging technology. Should we delete Jimbo Wales' page because he's "only" the creator of wikipedia? SixApart is a significant company in the context of computing today, and Anil has been an influential voice in the development of weblogs. Mamamusings 19:08, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Just because there are "lots of VPs" doesn't mean that Anil's work isn't worthy. If the only reason he was listed was because "he's a VP", then there's scant _information_ that adds to the body of knowledge of the Wikipedia. He's listed because he's "done something" and has been part of the formation of a new body of work, a new mechanism for communication and a new style for communication; and that would seem to be sufficient. On a side note, look at how many people have opinions on him. This doesn't suggest to me that he's a non-entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (minor) if "Dash is known for his love of all things Prince, and his encyclopedic knowledge of music breaks" is what passes for wikiworthiness these days, then fine, keep it. Or mebbe he needs to come in here and blow loud and hard his own horn. He's a likeable, intelligent person but *on his own* hasn't really "done anything" noteworthy that future generations really oughta know about. I mean, there's still Google (and his own blog). You can still find him if you want to.
<ul>
<li>The rest of this article is fine with me, and I do agree that that one sentence does not make him "wikiworthy". But one bad sentence is a reason to re-edit the article, not delete it entirely! Wootest 10:36, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly notable in the field of social software. I'll admit that some of the current content is subtrivial, and it doesn't help to have supporters here who don't know his gender (are they confusing him with <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mena_Trott_1a31.html" title="Mena Trott">Mena Trott</a>?). And I'll grant that this field is often easier for us to cover; however, the fact that we should have articles on comparable people in other fields, but don't, is not a valid argument for getting rid of this one. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 05:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a pure vanity page and not relevant in encyclopaedic terms. By all means have an entry for Movable Type or LiveJournal as landmarks of the Internet, but personalities should stay out. Either that or let everyone have their own vanity page, as everyone contributes to life in their own way! -- Gashdot 10:55, 16 Jun 2005 [UTC]</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>and <b>Comment</b>. Atleast Anil Dash finds this somewhat amusing. <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/06/14/my_greatest_mil#trackbacks" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/06/14/my_greatest_mil#trackbacks" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>&#160;:)--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 18:50, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> To my view part of the purpose and value of wikipedia above and beyond traditional encyclopedias is that it documents and explains emerging and obscure trends in culture and media, and provides a fairly authoritative source to point people to where there often isn't otherwise one. Blogging fits that bill, and Anil is certainly a prominent enough blogger to make the cut.jddunn</li>
