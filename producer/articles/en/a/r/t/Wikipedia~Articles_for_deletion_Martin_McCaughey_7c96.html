<p>This article was tagged for notability concerns and a prod, which was removed without improvement to the article, so it's here for AfD. There is no indication in the article of meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> requirements. Not everyone who was shot in the "troubles" in Ireland will have their own biographical entry — only those who in some way have achieved wider prominence, which can be established by mainstream coverage, of which there is none cited here. It might merit inclusion in a wider article about the alleged "shoot to kill" policy or whatever, but not, from what is written, as a stand-alone article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Lets not get this out of persective, over 3,000 people died in "the Troubles", how many of them have articles? McCaughey was actually the youngest ever elected representative in All of Ireland and at the same time held membership of PIRA and held up by Unionists as the prime example of inextricable link between Sinn Fein and the PIRA. When I removed the tag I did state that I would fill in the full details tonight and would have thought that that would have been taken in good faith and given a chance to extend the article. Obviously not. I will extend it tonight so i would appriciate if you would revisit your "delete" votes after that. regards--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 15:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You have displayed your prejudices clearly above where you attack the whole of a Wikproject. The argument of "memorial page" is irrelevant to the debate, which is concerned with the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the subject. "Memorial page" relates to the style of writing, which — if your observation is true (and I don't think it is anyway) — can easily be amended. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My argument, which you are misrepresenting, is that this article (amongst others) is one of a series on minor IRA members which individually and sequentially (1) do not satisfy the notability criteria and (2) display bias.

<li><s>Leaning to <b>delete</b>.</s> The claim about being Britain's youngest "representative" (of what sort?) would make him notable, if there was any press coverage outside the council's area to that effect.

<dd>You need to prove sufficient coverage of 11 and 7, and if this particular incident in 12 gained attention, not merely an instant news story, but something more durable. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>1. Not notable. 2. Not notable. 3. Only notable if Dungannon was a stronghold of anti-Sinn Fein votes. 4. Notable, but <b>unsourced</b>. 5. Not notable. 6. Maybe notable, if uncommon enough. 7. Vaguely notable (but, Tyrenius, sourced in the link to the parliamentary debate). 8. Plotted, not notable. If he'd done it, notable. 9. not notable. 10. Maybe notable, if sourced. 11. Notable, depending how often they rotate the list, but not sourced. 12. Not notable unless non-IRA sources made a big fuss about it.</dd>
<dd>So, based on Vintagekits' claims, he's notable. That's enough to prevent a Speedy Delete. If references are provided for 4 and 11, then I'll change to keep. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 21:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're a hard man to please! What about the court cases over his death also. Anyway, for 4. See the Tírghrá reference that I have added. for 11. See transcript of the BBC doc "BRITS". Also I hardly think that being the youngest elected representative in Ireland is more notable than getting shot in an <a href="../../../s/a/s/SAS_2db4.html" title="SAS">SAS</a> "shot-to-kill" mission only months after getting kicked out of a council after being in another shout out.

<dd><b>weak keep</b>. The reference for #4 does not show that there was any note taken of McCaughey's youth as a councillor at the time he was elected a councillor, therefore does not demonstrate that he was notable for that. #11 does seem to make him notable, but there's not really enough context for the claim - how big was the "Most Wanted" list in those days? How often did people come off or get put on it? But there is a reference that he was "most wanted in Britain", which does seem to make one pretty notable, unless the term was so overused as to be meaningless. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 01:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete:</b> - Non-notable as per nom. <s>Not every IRA terrorist is encyclopedia-worthy.</s> Allow me to expand -- I know I was a bit flippant; I apologize. I have studied the Troubles to a certain degree, and many members of the IRA/INLA have had interesting backgrounds that some may view as "notable"; however we cannot (despite the possible intentions of some) give a page to every republican paramilitary with an interesting history or background, even if he was killed on active duty. And what about the majority of paramilitaries who were not killed - will every one of them get their own page? McCaughey is still a non-notable and I stand by my vote. <a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJill_Teed_22e2.html" title="User:Jill Teed">Jill Teed</a> 22:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

There are hundreds of thousands of ordinary terrorists world-wide who are not at all notable except that they voluntarily joined organisations dedicated to the murder for political purposes of innocent people, and may or may not have come to a sticky end themselves. I just don't think that Wikipedia should become a propaganda vehicle for terrorists.

Also, the assertion that he was one of Britain's wanted men appears to be based solely on the transcript of a BBC documentary and not any official government listing. As a side-note, the article itself suffers badly from POV even after recent clear up attempts.

<dd>OK, thats quite strong language there.
