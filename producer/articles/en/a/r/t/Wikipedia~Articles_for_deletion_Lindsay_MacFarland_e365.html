<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. The raw totals are 9 Keep, 6 Delete. Two of the Keep votes were by editors whose only edit so far are their Keep votes, another by an editor who has had one other edit, and another by an editor whose only edits have been to this AfD or to the article under consideration. If for the sake of argument we don't count those, we have 5 Keep, 6 Delete. No huge advantage in strength of argument, thus, no consensus. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is a source of information for just about anything you choose, ranging from aerodynamics to Zion National Park and everything inbetween. Whether you choose to accept it or not, up-and-coming stars are another part of life in 2006, just as much as musicians, MySpace celebrities, or even criminals for that matter. As long as the information is accurate, then let's resort to the basic rule of thumb: no harm, no foul! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.104.72.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.104.72.97_e583.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.104.72.97">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia articles should not be used to help lead to a "big break". As this individual has not had even medium roles in any notable films. For some films, as noted above, she is not listed at all. If she becomes more famous, then she can and should have an article, but I don't think she's notable just yet. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 18:53, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>The attacks this actress is undergoing here on this page negates the very essence of Wikipedia. They seem personal in nature and lack merit. The quality of the writing is acceptable. The article is written with a neutral point of view. The information can be verified by both on-line sources (IMDB) as well as hard copy sources (The Hollywood Reporter). This actress is acknowledged by the Screen Actors Guild as being a professional. Her face has been seen by millions of people, being that she has been in huge Hollywood films. She also has two new soon to be released notable films with character names credited, both on IMDB. The very fact that there are so many statements here shows that this person is someone of note, otherwise no one would bother. I for one would like to know more about an actress that could stir so much controversy. --<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfoGuru_993a.html" title="User:InfoGuru"><font color="green">InfoGuru</font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup>13:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are lesser known people that are on Wikipedia. There are reality TV stars who were on just one episode, so should they be removed too? This is an actress/model who has been in well known movies, so if you only want leads than you need to make that clear from the get go. I thought wikipedia was for the people, done by the people and did not realize there was a heiracy of who the right people are to be part of wikipedia. seriouslyomgwtf 20:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unfortunately, some people are referring to IMDB as the most reliable means to establish someone's credibility. Although IMDB is convenient, it is sometimes highly inaccurate. In addition to using this [IMDB] site, it is known amongst those involved in the entertainment industry to use reliable hardcopy publishings (i.e. Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Daily Variety, etc.) as well. I subscribe to the Daily Variety, and I found that this individual's film <i>E&amp;A</i> was listed in the Friday, August 4, 2006 edition (p.8). And as a side note, she is listed as the first in the cast which means that she is most likely one of the leads. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/g/r/User%7ETGreenburg_7122.html" title="User:TGreenburg"><font color="green"><b>TGreenburg</b></font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup></li>
