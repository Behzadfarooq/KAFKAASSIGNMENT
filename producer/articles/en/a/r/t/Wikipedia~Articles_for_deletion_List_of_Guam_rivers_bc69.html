<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not all that happy with the list as it is since it is a bunch of unannotated redlinks, but since we don't have any articles on any of these rivers, it is <i>not</i> redundant with a category (since we don't <i>have</i> the category). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see three pages listed at the top, in addition to Guam rivers.

That's the article I'm really here voting to keep; in addition to Mass. islands now that I see it up there.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no real connection between any of the articles nominated other than that they are all lists. The nominations for each should be separate as the debate will be rather disorganised causing possible difficulties for the admins. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The five lists list things that are certainly finite. Obviously, there is not an infinite number of rivers in Guam nor an infinite number of islands in Massachusetts, so, the lists are useful and can be expanded with further info. <a href="../../../a/f/o/User%7EAfonso_Silva_8531.html" title="User:Afonso Silva">Afonso Silva</a> 11:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b>. I've used many such lists to help fill out missing articles on geographic features.

<li><b>Delete All</b> I can't question the lists as being useful or finite to particular editors. I do question the basic notability and encyclopedic relevance of the articles, which I believe is to the point. These articles only exist as lists, since if you stubbed the individual rivers there'd be no reason to have the stubs at all. I have a toolbox that's been very useful to me (and has finite contents), but I don't see how that rates inclusion in WP. (sorry for the belated appearance, I wasn't aware that it was done for afd nominators to also vote on their afds.) <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 15:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure I understand your point. Are you saying that there's nothing verifiable or notable about any of the redlinked items in any of the unreleated lists you've proposed for deletion? Or are you saying that there's not content to these lists orther than being lists? I'm afraid your toolbox example does not seem to be very clear; your garage toolbox has done little to help editors on wikipedia, and would continue to be useless if it were included here - are you saying that these lists are also not helpful to finding articles to create and helping editors? There would seem to be quite a bit more to some of these lists than just 'a list' as well; the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_canals_in_the_United_States_0964.html" title="List of canals in the United States">List of canals in the United States</a> is grouped by canal functionality and operating state and also has some notations included as well. Could you please exapnd on your point a little further? I'm trying to understand your position. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 15:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm also a little concerned that the discussion here is getting a little fragmented since each list would appear to have different problems; and with the exception of the insular/guam issue - they're all unrealted. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 15:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm saying the articles listed for deletion only exist as lists. There's no notability stated or implied for any of the listed items, except as readers apparently have for them on a personal basis. I point out there's no reason at all to have articles on most of the individual items, they only have relevance as items on a list. And being on a list does not make them notable, nor are lists intrinsically notable. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 15:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm still not sure of your point here: 75% of the items in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_canals_in_the_United_States_0964.html" title="List of canals in the United States">List of canals in the United States</a> already have articles which are more than established. I could probably create articles for the remainder that meet the notability standards for geographic locations fairly easily. The list complies with the <i>guidelines</i> at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a>. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of geographical lists along similar lines. Again, what is your guideline for the notability of a list? All items must be notable? Most? Which guidelines are you using? Please don't think I'm being combative - that's not my intent, I'm simply trying to understand where you're coming from. Thanks! <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 16:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

(As an aside, I came upon that article because I was seeing if we had an article on <a href="http://www.asce.org/history/brdg_duckcreek.html" class="external text" title="http://www.asce.org/history/brdg_duckcreek.html" rel="nofollow">Duck Creek Aqueduct</a> or <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitewater_Canal_a795.html" title="Whitewater Canal">Whitewater Canal</a>.) <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rivers_in_U.S._insular_areas_9bd4.html" title="List of rivers in U.S. insular areas">List of rivers in U.S. insular areas</a> -- it's redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Guam_rivers_4de7.html" title="List of Guam rivers">List of Guam rivers</a> (which I vote to <b>keep</b>), <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Puerto_Rico_rivers_df9e.html" title="List of Puerto Rico rivers">List of Puerto Rico rivers</a> (not up for deletion), and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Virgin_Islands_rivers_and_streams_777e.html" title="List of United States Virgin Islands rivers and streams">List of United States Virgin Islands rivers and streams</a> (also not up for deletion). As far as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_islands_in_Massachusetts_347c.html" title="List of islands in Massachusetts">List of islands in Massachusetts</a>, I prefer to <b>keep</b> it, but the entries about "minor rocks" can probably go. I doubt we'll ever need an article about a minor rock. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 02:40, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
