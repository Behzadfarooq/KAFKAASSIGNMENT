<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless I'm mistaken, the representation of a number's digits in base 10 has rather little to do with any mathematically interesting (i.e. notable) properties it might have.

<li>666 isn't an apt comparison though, seeing as it's famous as the "number of the beast", and not just the fact that it's three 6's in a row. 9814072356 lays no claim to cultural significance, so it needs to be judged on how interesting it is mathematically. My point, I suppose, is that this article makes no claim to mathematical notability. It just points out a quirk of the way we write the number in base 10 - which is only one of many ways to write it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> 03:51, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - but rename as <i>9814072356 (number)</i>. Qualifies for its own article under the <i>remarkable mathematical property</i> criteria. Can't see any criteria that say a number must have <i>more than one</i> remarkable property to qualify for its own article. Could be expanded to a more general article on <i>pandigital squares</i> or <i>pandigital powers</i>. Definitely do not delete - it contains some really interesting information. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 11:07, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I was thinking of the part that says "As a guideline, you ought to know at least three interesting properties of a number. (What constitutes interesting can be debated, but the point is that the careless creation of number article stubs is to be avoided.)" I don't see three interesting properties in this article. --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">(talk)</a> 14:15, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A proven Sierpinski number would be remarkable. A counterexample to Poincare's conjecture would be remarkable. An odd perfect number would deserve its own article even if it was very dull otherwise. But a square that is pandigital in one base? Interesting is as far as I'll call it. Now, if it was pandigital in several consecutive bases, that might be remarkable. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 14:56, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assuming you mean using each digit exactly once, it is impossible for a number to be pandigital in more than one base. If you allow repeats then the number in question fits the bill for bases 1,2,3,4. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a></i> 17:59, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I for one would find it interesting if this number was pandigital (even with repeats) in every base up to the largest base for which it would be reasonable to expect pandigitality (sort of like a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strictly_non-palindromic_number.html" title="Strictly non-palindromic number">strictly non-palindromic number</a> <i>n</i> is not palindromic in any base from 2 to <i>n</i> - 2, while in base <i>n</i> - 1 it must be "11"). But it fails the test at 5, and I don't find that all that interesting. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 18:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This number has just one remarkable property, which I'd classify as mildly interesting at most, and which is listed at other places. The other properties listed in the article need to go, IMHO. I think a redirect to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_number.html" title="Square number">square number</a> would be confusing; perhaps redirect to <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000000000_%28number%29.html" title="1000000000 (number)">1000000000 (number)</a> where other 10-digit numbers are listed. I seriously doubt that the GFDL requires a redirect in this case since mathematical facts are not copyrightable. Only a weak delete since the number is apparently listed in some other books. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 15:06, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename for consistency with other numbers.
