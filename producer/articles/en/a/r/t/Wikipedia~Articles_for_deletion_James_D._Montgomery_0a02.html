<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, bad faith nomination, prod nomination does not even present a prima facie case for deletion, putting the lie to the nominator's stated motives for his crusade to delete articles on academics. Also accessory Wikistalking and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> violation, since the original prodder has been targeting new user Tseeker's contribution for deprecation, disregarding the terms of the consensus deletion policy. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 17:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, no kidding. The nominator has said over and over that he's making these nominations regardless of their merits, just because he has some undocumented, unverified, unsourced concerns that the deprodding process is somehow screwed up. He provides no evidence, and made no effort to engage in discussion on the relevant pages. That's a paradigmatic <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, and nominating an article for deletion without a good faith basis for believing it meets the deletion policy criteria is by definition bad faith; that the nominator's indiscriminate actions affect the good and bad alike is hardly a sign of good faith. If I nominated for deletion every article created in the one hour period that's 5-6EST/4-5CST/3-4MST/2-3 PST, claiming it was my belief that most edits during that time came from the US and came from insomniac trolls, vandals, and POV-pushers, there wouldn't be anybody defending my good faith, for good reason.

<li><b>Comment</b> I placed the prod tag on this and a few other similar pages because, simply, while this professor may be a fine researcher does it merit an encyclopedia article? No solid notability was claimed in this article, just a very brief biography. I don't appreciate insinuations by <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">User:Monicasdude</a> that any of this was "bad faith"--I used the prod tag on only a small number of these type of articles in an effort to be "good" faith. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_D._Montgomery_12c7.html" title="James D.

<dd>I am an academic myself, so I fully recognize how these researchers may be <i>important</i>, but generally non-notable. I personally think <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> may be too lenient (8 criteria seem ~equally weighted, but I think they're inherently unequal: there are a lot of mediocre scientists with a large volume of published data, for example, and many awards <i>sound</i> important but mean little to anyone outside of a particular field). I gladly open this up for debate because, as a community, the larger desires of the Wikipedia community should determine academic notability. I just don't think every principal scientist at every institution ever needs an article... -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 21:03, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is a fallacy. Two wrongs do not make a right. If you feel that Wikipedia would be improved by these articels not being included, then by all means nominate them for deletion and demand consensus. A distaste for popular culture on an editor's own part does not justify applying that bias when the community's consensus has spoken otherwise. It is a vital fact to remember that at Wikipedia we must work toward consensus; doing <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> things is encouraged, but that is only as long as it doesn't go against the will of the community as declared by consensus. Please consider these things in the future, and we can all keep cool about these disputes. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 02:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've missed my point entirely. I don't reject the community consensus on notability. I accept the low bar it sets. I object to the refusal of a relatively small but quite active and vocal groups of editors to accept that consensus as it applies to certain subjects, particularly knowledge workers, creative artists, and figures outside American-Western-European-based cultures. I think the extensive creation of articles relating to those subjects by a very large number of editors is a much clearer demonstration of consensus than the actions of the relatively tiny number of editors who work incessantly for deletion. We have gotten to a cultural state where "Gee, I never heard of this" seems to be a good enough excuse to nominate something for deletion, RATHER THAN raising legitimate issues on the talk page first to see if anyone can help improve the article. There's a real sickness in the process, and, in terms of encyclopedic goals, it's ludicrous. It drives away new editors. It offends the subjects of articles, many of whom could be valuable contributors. And it continues to expose the project to public embarassment. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 03:02, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think my reaction to your surprisingly vitriolic comment has been handled well by <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a>. I think you're conflating different issues here: this isn't about "mediocrity" (I doubt Montgomery is a "mediocre" scientist)--you seem to have willfully misinterpreted my statement above. I simply meant that having a large number of publications does not a good scientist make. (My arguments for and against portions of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> are being crafted now &amp; I will share them soon...) Additionally, as I tried to suggest above, you are conflating "importance" with "notability." These are often correlated, but certainly many examples exist in which one is prominent while the other is missing. Often it's difficult to define either, kind of a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter_Stewart_d5d7.html" title="Potter Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>-esque <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobellis_v._Ohio_046e.html" title="Jacobellis v. Ohio"><i>I know it when I see it</i></a>, but poular culture (with its random <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> characters) is generally defined by its notability without importance, while scientific endeavors often suffer from a lack of notability despite their broad importance. Maybe this isn't "right," and we should inform the world of the work of good, but unknown (publicly), scientists...that's why I think this is a good thing to debate! -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 00:50, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you've missed my point almost entirely, and you've missed an important point on notability. As what appears to be the most broadly accepted, if not consensus, treatment of notability here says, <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact. It is an extension of the notion of prominence for biographical articles. It differs, however, from fame and importance; while all articles on "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important.</i> And, given the sheer number of articles from thousands of editors which are created according to these principles, there's much stronger evidence that this represents consensus than the contrary behavior of a relative handful of editors who participate in the AfD process. "Policy is what we do" is an imperfect guide, but it's better than "Policy is decided by whoever yells the loudest." <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I read your point loud and clear. Montgomery is not "known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency," and therefore the impetus to show that he "should be" falls upon those who would vote to keep. The strongest argument is that he won an award--one that is, clearly, also not "known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency" (should it be?). His July 2005 <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jmontgom/vita.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jmontgom/vita.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>CV</i></a> shows 14 published articles (2 more in progress), 6 reviews and 5 working papers, all since '89.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Mangojuice. The problem with the proftest is that we scientists are too self-effacing. Mostly we want to do our work, get grants, write papers, and get recognized in our field, and wikipedia doesn't fit our image of what recognition looks like. I worked with a man who was on the cover of Science with the discovery of the year one year and he's not in here, for heaven's sake. I would rather have a high citation count or a low grant score than a wikipedia article. But at the same time I think it is objectively true that an academic with one peer-reviewed publication has contributed more to human existence than any pokemon character or Gundam Wing mecha (speaking not of the overall value of the game or manga but of the desire to have separate articles for each separate morph of each monster). Maybe we scientists should start standing up for ourselves! <small>I'm sorry for making a fuss. I'll sit down and be quiet now.</small> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Just because Wikipedia is already infested with over-detailed articles about transient pop culture topic doesn't mean we should lower the standard to match. Yes this article is definitely more worthy than for example <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>, but I don't think it's enough -- <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a> 05:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as article have <u>no</u> sources, and does not explain why his models are important within his field of work! <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 01:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Per Mangojuice. I'm not convinced the award is notable, but a cursory examination makes it look plausibly notable and so would like to erre on the side of caution. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:29, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>abstain</b> I can not determine anything here, which might normally lead me to vote delete, but Eusebeus has a run of very poor deletion nominations, so my vote must be abstain. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 13:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Why should we be the first people to write about this guy? I've linked his vita on the article, and I don't see anything compelling. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 07:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> while there isn't anything here to sugges that the subject meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> some of the recent ADF noms in this category make me nervous, and so I will withhold my vote. The proftest is a very high bar. If "more important than the average actor" or "more important than the average band" were that standards for other bio-like articles then a lot of cruft would go. There are over a million schools in the US alone, if each one gets an article, then WP:PROFTEST seems an overly severe standard for scientists and other professional researchers. There is nothing wrong with PROFTEST, it's simply out of step with other WP standards of notability, where more inclusionist editors have sway over notability standards. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:58, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
