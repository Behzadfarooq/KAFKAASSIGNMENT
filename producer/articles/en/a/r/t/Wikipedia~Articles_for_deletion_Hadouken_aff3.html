<p>Originally, this article (as well as the others I'm nominating) was supposed to redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28series%29_9db9.html" title="Street Fighter (series)">Street Fighter (series)</a>, which I think is what it should remain. However, someone wrote articles, and while I don't doubt their good faith, it opened the door to all sorts of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>, and when you trim it all out, there's not much of an article left. I believe they should go back to simply redirecting to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28series%29_9db9.html" title="Street Fighter (series)">Street Fighter (series)</a>, rather than simply deleting them. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 21:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> May seem important and notable to a lot of people (including me), it just ain't encyclopedic. It is from a fairly simple arcade game from the 90's - if all games must be documented here with such level of detail, geeh...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why delete it? Some people may have questions on what some moves do. Besides, you don't see people deleting Super Mario, and God knows how long that's been around. Don't hate on Ryu and Ken's moveset. And I don't say this because I wrote one of these pages. I say it because I'm actually contributing useful knowledge. In any case, you're talking Street Fighter 1, which was simple, unlike masterpieces like Street Fighter 3/Alpha. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slammenhousa (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlammenhousa_9b26.html" title="User talk:Slammenhousa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slammenhousa_f5d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slammenhousa">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28series%29_9db9.html" title="Street Fighter (series)">Street Fighter (series)</a> is not <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28video_game%29_5649.html" title="Street Fighter (video game)">Street Fighter (video game)</a>. And you're wrong. Wikipedia is not a strategy guide. You go to GameFAQs to find out how to use moves like Shoryuken; the information is not notable enough for an all-purpose encyclopedia. Worse, the articles as they were before I edited them were extremely badly written and chock full of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>, mostly related to the whole "Goutetsu-ryu Ansatsuken" debacle. After editing out all the crufty nonsense, there's really not enough information that warrants an article. (And as for that last remark, don't get me started on the whole debate of whether SF3 is even worth playing.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 00:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I could easily comment on this. If Wikipedia's not a strategy guide, then how come there's a whole mess on video game characters having THEIR own web pages? Super Mario, Sonic...MEGAMAN! Geez, we might as well just give the ghosts off Pac-Man their own page. What I'm trying to say here is that SOME people actually do care about what some moves do. And how the things done are done. GameFAQs won't ALWAYS give an explanation, ya know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And Street Fighter 3 is highly regarded as one of the best Street Fighter games of all time. 3rd Strike is rated 2nd on the FAQ pages of the Arcade section of GameFAQs, and most of the reviews were positive. Therefore, any person would disagree with you on the debate of SF3's playability because more people like it than dislike it.</p>
<p>In any case, this is rather irrelevant. My point is, a lot of video game moves have their own sections. And yet you only strive to delete these. For what reason?--Slammenhousa 15:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah. No comment on the SF3 debate (parries suck&#160;;). Anyway, my point still stands. Mario and Sonic have their own sections; are there sections for the Mario Jump and Sonic Spindash? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So because no one's made an article this level deep in another video game series, we should take it away from here? That's like saying "we don't have <i>Bob Smith vs State of Arkansas</i>, so we should delete <i>Marbury vs Madison</i> and <i>Plessy vs Ferguson</i>." <a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiu_Bei_6738.html" title="User:Liu Bei">Liu Bei</a> 03:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not for those sections, but almost all of Mario's items have sections, and Chaos Control's got it's own little corner. So, in a sense, yeah, there are.--Slammenhousa 15:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - What do Ken and Ryu order when at the Take Away? Hadouken Chips - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 15:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not that convinced about the Hurricane Kick or Dragon punch articles though. But Hadouken seems to have found itself in other places in pop culture outside of Street Fighter. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 15:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, especially Shoryuken and Hadoken. These concepts are in nearly every anime series made and multiple other video games (Megaman X series for one). The articles show there is a wealth of information on the moves regarding their use and history, and I certainly learned more about the Street Fighter continuity than the main article. <a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiu_Bei_6738.html" title="User:Liu Bei">Liu Bei</a> 03:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hadoken and Shoryuken Pages - Somebody is being a freaking hater because there are many other video game, oops excuse me..."series" characters that are not nominated for deletion and pretty much contain the same comment, so to all those nominating this page for deletion can just shove it. And I'll have you to know that I contributed greatly to the information on the nominated articles, so if you delete it I'll just re-post it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, this pretty much sounds like he's stating his intent to vandalize Wikipedia, doesn't it?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The hadoken has become notable even outside the Street Fighter games, so it's reasonable for it to have a separate article. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 23:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Absolutely Keep. All three of the articles. The Hadou-Ken, ShoryuKen, and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku are pop culture. The Fireball, Dragon Punch, and Hurricane kick are staples in fighting games. And virtually any gamer alive knows about them one way or another. I'm not able to verify one way or another whether or not the information given in these articles is fan created, but I do know that there is a lot of information available closer to the source (Japan) that has not and probably will not ever be released officially here. How many Final Fantasy items are never released in the US. They don't believe there is a viable market here and more than likely wouldn't send it over here anyway. The point is I can't perfectly verify all of the information but I can't discount it either. Leave them up. They have viable info. I personally have owned every Street Fighter Strategy guide and most of the official art books that have been released stateside foremost on that list is the Eternal Challenge book and the content of these articles is in line with what is found there. Shun Goku Satsu and Satsui no Hadou being more recent additions to the franchise are a little more debatable but even they are relavent as they are pieces of the characters. Shun Goku Satsu has been parodied and copied all over the game world and Satsu no Hadou is one of Street Fighter's two takes on the Light side and Dark Side of the force (the other being Psycho Power and Soul Power). Perhaps it should be added to a pop culture references to Star Wars article or something. At the least the last two should be merged with Akuma and Ryu. Honestly Shun Goku Satsu and Satsui no Hadou should've been integrated with Goutetsu-Ryu Ansatsuken which would've made sense and made the article more substantial negating any need to delete it. But I've said my peace, please leave these articles be. Rayfire 19:42, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
