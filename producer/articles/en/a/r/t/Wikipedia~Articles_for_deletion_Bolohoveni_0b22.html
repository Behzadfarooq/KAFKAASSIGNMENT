<p><b>del</b>. the article is 100% false. There is no such English word. There is even no such Old Slavic word, contrary to the article. This is a Romanian ignorant mutation (quite possibly, quite recent) of the Old Slavic word: "<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlach.html" title="Vlach">Vlach</a>" in Old Slavonic is "Voloch". "Volochove" is plural from "voloch". "Volohoveni" is a brainless Romanian coinage similar to "Moldoveni" (<a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldovans.html" title="Moldovans">Moldovans</a>), seen only in Romanian websites. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 00:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It it is interesting to mention that a similar confusion happened with <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrians.html" title="Ingrians">Ingrians</a>, and quite very recently, too. There was land of <b><a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingria.html" title="Ingria">Ingria</a></b>. A person from Ingria was called by Teutons "Ingerman", and their land is "Ingermanland". The latter was borroved into Russian during the times of Russian Empire and Russified into "Ingermanlandia" And finally, some English-speaking smartass coined "Ingermanlandians"&#160;! (thx G.d, no one wrote this article yet&#160;:-) If you don't beieve me, check google. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 00:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article cites use in ancient chronicles, which makes this of some historic interest, and there are quite a few incoming links. A Google search for "Bolohoveni" -wikipedia searching only English results yields only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Bolohoveni&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Bolohoveni&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">9 unique hits</a>. It's certainly an obscure topic, but that still does seem a suspiciously low amount. Also, I don't think it really matters if this word is a "mutation" -- many words start out that way, including, I'd hazard, the majority of the English language. What matters is if the word, in this form, was the primary name for the topic described in the article, which I'm not sure of. I'm very much on the fence on this one, but I'd prefer to err on the side of caution here. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is very usefull as to disambiguate between the various mentions of vlachs -from southwards as the Haemus, to northwards as Halici-, prior to the foundation of any statal entities.

<li><b>Weak keep and rename</b> - Since the article deals with a kind of Vlachs (ie: living in a certain area, as per use of the term in Romanian historiography), and the article on Vlachs tends to lists generalities, the best solution is to keep the current Bolohoveni as a main article linked in a section of the Vlachs article, and the name in use be <i>the original used in the chronicle</i> (transliterated using present-day rules), <i>and not the creole term that has come to be used in Romanian</i> (the final "i" is especially intriguing, and does indeed display the provincial interests and superficial knowledge of the article's creator). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did you read what I wrote in nomination? It is not hoax/lie. It is ignorance. The evidence is the mentioned Slavic chronicles available online in the internet. There is <b>no such word</b> in them. There is old Slavic plural word "volochove" (волохове) (findable even in google in slavic manuscripts), which means simply <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> (singular: волох, modern Russian plural: <a href="../../../../ru/%D0%B2/%D0%BE/%D0%BB/%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8_ab10.html" class="extiw" title="ru:волохи">ru:волохи</a>; and as I see even some Russian internet posts don't understand the word волохове, because it is an archaic form of plural noun).</dd>

<dd>Cna you read my lips: it is <b>not</b> hoax. It is confusion. <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> in various latin and greek and slavic manuscribts were named by many names. There was no internet in these times, you know. Everything was by the word of mouth mostly. I may list you "Vlachs (also called Vláhoi, Βλάχοι, Wallachians, Wlachs, Wallachs, Olahs or Ulahs" (fom wikipedia), also волохи/волохове/волоховцы/болохове/влахи/власи, moreover Blazi (Latin), Blokumenn/Blakumen/Blakumenn (norse),... you want more? I am sure Arabic authors had more names. In summary, again, "bolohoveni" is mutation in <b>Romanian</b> language of what was written in slavic chronicles: <b>"volohove"</b>, i.e., <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>, and not some new mysterious ethnos at the roots of Romanians. Does someonne want to write the "blokumenn/Blakumen" articles as well? they collect quite a few google hits as well... I'd say even more than "bolohoveni" (if kill wikipedia mirrors) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:17, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There already exists the page, <b><a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a></b>. And there is absolutely nothing to move there from the discussed article, because it is false: "bolohoveni" are <b>not</b> mentioned in old slavic chronicles. Moreover, it is highly disputable whether "volohove" (<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volochs.html" title="Volochs">Volochs</a>) were used specifically to refer to population of moldavian/transylvania/etc. lands and not simply <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">vlachs</a> from anywhere.</dd>
<dd>On the second thought, it occurs to me now now that it would make sense to turn this article into a redirect to the article I've just noticed, "<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_term_Vlach_bacd.html" title="History of the term Vlach">History of the term Vlach</a>", which may be expanded with what I wrote in this discussion. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:50, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not mistranslation either. Let me put it in a yet another way: is is a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone_game.html" title="Telephone game">telephone game</a>: <b>(1)</b> in slavic chronicles there were "volochove" mentioned. Romanian books qouting the chronicles "romanized the word into "bolohoveni", a valid Romanian word. <b>(2)</b>And now someone tries to enter into wikipedia an <b>English</b> word "bolohoveni" , which, <b>(3)</b> if translated directly from slavic chronicles according to English grammar, would be "<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volochs.html" title="Volochs">volochs</a>". How can I give you qoutations to prove that item (2) moronic? I can give you quotations for items (1) and (3), the rest is pure logic. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 04:59, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the existance of these "Bolohoveni" in chronicles, they definetively appear. For example, I could give <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tale_of_Igor%27s_Campaign_0f18.html" title="The Tale of Igor's Campaign">The Tale of Igor's Campaign</a> where it says: <i>"Thou didst shatter the Galicians on the Vistula, Yarosláv; thou sittest high on thy gold-forged throne, supporting the Hungarian mountains with thy iron-clad regiments, barring the road against the [Magyar] King, closing the gates of the Danube, hurling thongs amid the Vlakhs, judging and ordaining as far as the Danube!"</i> <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/tai/tai40.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/tai/tai40.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This is just one of their mentionings. There are more, but most of them have yet to be translated into English or to be published on the internet. If this population didn`t exist, then how come there is even an article on the Eencyclopedia of Ukraine <a href="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\B\O\Bolokhovians.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\B\O\Bolokhovians.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>??? What reasons would they have to make such an article, if the bolohoveni didn`t exist??? The article says that they were actually slavs, and took their name from the city of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolekhiv.html" title="Bolekhiv">Bolekhiv</a>. However, a polish document from <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov.html" title="Lvov">Lvov</a> from 1472, still adreses that city with the name of "villa valachorum dicta". At the same time, the geographic position of the area where they were mentioned, in the <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivano-Frankivsk_Oblast_aae2.html" title="Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast">Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernivtsi_Oblast_656e.html" title="Chernivtsi Oblast">Chernivtsi Oblast</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinnytsia_Oblast_f70c.html" title="Vinnytsia Oblast">Vinnytsia Oblast</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmelnytskyi_Oblast_c02a.html" title="Khmelnytskyi Oblast">Khmelnytskyi Oblast</a>, coincided more or less with <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Bukovina_2b19.html" title="Northern Bukovina">Northern Bukovina</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herta_region.html" title="Herta region">Herta region</a>, to this day with significant vlach populations (see also <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutsuls.html" title="Hutsuls">Hutsuls</a>). But what if they were afterall slavs: another reason to keep the article. It`s still a stub, and certainly need attention from an expert. But it would be a mistake to delete it, because the very existance of it, albeit a stub, can`t do absolutelly no damage, and more than that, it stimulates further research on this matter... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">Greier</a> 10:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see any mention of Bolohoveni in the quote from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tale_of_Igor%27s_Campaign_0f18.html" title="The Tale of Igor's Campaign">The Tale of Igor's Campaign</a>; rather I see <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlach.html" title="Vlach">Vlachs</a> mentioned. This supports the reasons why this article should be deleted. Also, the Encyclopedia of Ukraine gives <i>Bolokhovians</i> as entry, which is the current name. As such, the contents of the article <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolohoveni.html" title="Bolohoveni">Bolohoveni</a> are very much in error, as they claim in the defining sentence that <i>Bolohoveni ("Volohove") is the name used in the early Kievan chronicles</i>, which definitely is not true, as you've proven yourself. And even if it were reason enough to keep the article, it should be moved to Bolokhovians. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 11:07, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why rename it? Only to be re-renamed when another source calls them <i>Bolochovians</i> instead of <i>Bolokhovians</i>??? As for arguing the deletion of the article because the Bolohoveni are identical to Vlachs, then that is not what the point is about. The article <b>already</b> admits the the Bolohoveni are Vlachs: <i>"Bolohoveni ("Volohove") is the name used ... to designate the Vlachs... "</i>. The arguments in keeping this article are 1.the article is used as toC in that time period, situated in very different geographical positions. 2. The term "bolohoveni" is already present in Romanian historic works, separate from the term "vlach" (and as you can see, even in Ukrainian histography) 3. What if the Bolohoveni/Bolokhovians/Bolochovyans/Volohovinians/etc. are not Vlachs afterall, as the EncyclopediaofUkraine article claims? Like I already sayd, the article needs an expert... For point 1, I could also argue that sources give much more info, which distinguish this population (both from the rest of the Vlachs or the rest of the Slavs, depending on their origin). For example, the <i>Ipatievskaia lietopis</i> mentiones a couple of rulers of this populations (e.g. a certain Stefan), as well as their relation with the Mongols (they were subdued and forced by the Mongols to cultiuvate the land, as to assure provisions for the Mongol army). Now if we would to make an article about that ruler, and say that he was a "ruler of the Vlachs", then question arise: Of which vlachs? Had he powers over all of the vlachs? Why of vlachs and not of slavs (as the Enc.ofUkraine claims)? etc... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">Greier</a> 12:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wonder if these guys who vote <i>Keep</i> have even taken the time to READ what this page is about? It is a two-sentence article which shouldn't have been created in the first place. Where are the historical sources? They don't exist, because this "people" that they talk about never existed. This is really not something we can vote about. It is plain common sense, guys. Do we vote on whether 2+2 equals 4, or 5, or something else? - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">Mauco</a> 03:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is proved false by at least two people who went thru trouble of doing some real research, and no one who voted "keep" provided opposite proof. User:Greier only proved that indeed <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> were mentioned in Latin texts as "valachorum". In order "to disambiguate between the various mentions of the vlachs" you don't have to have a separate articles. Wikipedia disambiuguates between different <b>meanings</b>, not between different <b>spellings</b>. I didn't see <b>any</b> article with such ridiculous purpose. Spellings are disambiguated using redirects.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But I see little reason to redirect from <b>foreign language</b>, unless one can provide, e.g., a 13th centrury chronicle with this spelling. Then it would make sense for researchers. We don't gave redirects to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> from Nemci, Alemanes, Alemaes, <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche.html" title="Deutsche">Deutsche</a>, Saksalaiset, Germani, <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alman.html" title="Alman">Alman</a>, Tyskar and 200+ more translations. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 17:11, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I vote for keeping this page. The fact that it is not more elaborated and documented now, does not mean someone whould not take the pain to do it in the future. We must connect it to Vlahs, Romanians, Proto-romanians, etc, and in time, but only in time it can be merged. I am affraid some people want to rushly erase it, and I am affraid they might have an already strongly biased POV. It would be advisable to avoid decisions based on bias.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> (<a href="../../../d/c/7/User_talk%7EDc76_dc8d.html" title="User talk:Dc76">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dc76_bb18.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dc76">contribs</a>).</small></li>
