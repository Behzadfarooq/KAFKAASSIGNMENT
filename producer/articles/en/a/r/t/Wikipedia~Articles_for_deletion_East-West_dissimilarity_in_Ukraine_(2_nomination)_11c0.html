<li><b>Delete</b>. The article's title is (1) <b>inflammatory</b>, (2) <b>biased</b>, and (3) <b>nonacademic</b>. There are countries with higher degree of regional dissimilarity, Canada, UK, Spain, India, Russia, to name a few, but for <i>none</i> of the countries, the regional differences have been listed in a separate article like Dissimilarities in Canada or Dissimilarities in Russia. Instead, the regional differences are commonly covered in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Canada_739c.html" title="History of Canada">History of Canada</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Quebec_eef9.html" title="History of Quebec">History of Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Canada_29c8.html" title="Culture of Canada">Culture of Canada</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Quebec_4ad4.html" title="Culture of Quebec">Culture of Quebec</a>, etc. This way, the similarities and dissimilarities are presented together, under neutral and non-inflammatory title. Thus, instead of creation of East-West similarity in Ukraine and East-West dissimilarity in Ukraine, the regional similarities and differences should rather be covered in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ukraine_0587.html" title="History of Ukraine">History of Ukraine</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Ukraine_f1bc.html" title="Culture of Ukraine">Culture of Ukraine</a>, or if it's necessary, in Regional policies in Ukraine. --<a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 18:37, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. This article survived 1 AFD already, no reason to overturn a community decision. Besides, there is nothing inflammatory or biaised in the title. As for <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ukraine_0587.html" title="History of Ukraine">History of Ukraine</a>, it is already huge and information must now be spinned off to child articles.

Obviously a POV attempt of deletion driven by the nominator's seeing Wikipedia as a tool to advance his political agenda. Totally valid topic, totally neutrally written. Could be developed and further improved but does not fit the AfD profile in any way. Article was started in order to avoid a really divisive way the topic was handled earlier as someone wrote the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_East_Ukraine_b0c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/East Ukraine">currently AFDed</a> extremist anti-Ukrainian article (see also this). Deletion and merging was discussed at talk here and here, respectively, and as discussions ended to the nominator's dissatisfaction, the new trick to achieve the same goal is being attempted. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly, a comment by an editor (who created this article in the first place) driven by his view of Wikipedia as a tool to advance <i>his</i> political agenda. The editor fail to recognize that this title is inflammatory, biased, and nonacademic. The editor rejects each and every proposal to change the title to neutral. --<a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 18:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I let the others judge. Besides, I said I was open to the rename suggestion but not to some kind of "merge" under the pretence that the topic is somehow not worthy an article on its own. It is worthwile to point out that both attacks on the article's existence came from two radical but curiously the exactly opposite ends of the political spectrum. The nominator of the previous AfD wrote an extremely inflammatory (by content, not the title) "East Ukraine" entry, now AfDed, that almost called for the partitioning of Ukraine. The second nominator, sees the mere acknowledgement of Ukrainian non-uniformity as "divisive", "inflammatory" and "biased" and launches an attack on it from the opposite end. <b>That radicals attack the article from both ends seems a good indication that the article strikes the right balance</b> --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Irpen's claim that "<i>radicals attack the article</i>" is nothing but a personal attack against everybody who somehow turns out to have an opinion different from his. Further response is moved to <a href="../../../i/r/p/User_talk%7EIrpen_8b93.html" title="User talk:Irpen">User talk:Irpen</a>. --<a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 00:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's blatantly false. I recognize and accept the POV that are different from mine and resolved hundreds of articles with my good-faith opponents. There is no personal attack in calling radical views as such. I can point to a good bunch of instances where you pushed views radically different from the mainstream in the country whose opinion you claim to represent as well as from the positions widely accepted internationally. That's exactly why such views did not find any backing. Finally, when you have nothing to say on the topic, accusing your opponent unsubstinantially in a personal attack just shows that you really do not have anything more to say. You just "disagree". --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unless the contribuitor quickly writes some sense in the article, I am going to vote for its deletion. So far it is some chaotic rant that different neighbors influenced Ukraine. But not a word how it actually created the "disiimilarity" and of what kind, and why not "north-south" nor NNW-SSE. Also the title is of dubious usage:no google hits besides wikipediatry. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:30, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This was discussed at Talk:East-West_dissimilarity_in_Ukraine#Delete. The article is open for anyone to develop it. I might if I get to it as well. As for the title/google hits issue, the title is descriptive. We have articles with descriptive titles, se eg. <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_contribution_to_WWII_6c65.html" title="Polish contribution to WWII">Polish contribution to WWII</a>. Also, I am open to renaming suggestions but merging is a poor solution with a clear political purpose. The topic is valid in its own. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:42, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You missed my major point: the article says <b>nothing</b>, zilch, <i>nada</i>, <i>nic</i> informative about the division. The provided external link is useless in this respect as well. If you want to store theuseful information collected here, you may place it, e.g. into <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election%2C_2006.html" title="Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006">Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006</a>, prefacing it with something like "The clear division of Ukraine seen in the map of the distribution of votes caused numerous comments about historical, political and social division of Ukraine ... <a href="../../../b/l/a/Bla_Bla_Bla_926b.html" title="Bla Bla Bla">Bla Bla Bla</a> ... " The voted article in its current state is void. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and discusses the possible reasons for a dissimilarity between the East and West in Ukraine rather than establishing that a dissimilarity exists. If it is expanded and sourced I would change my opinion. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 22:26, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The name contains practically all the information currently present in the article. The talk is several times longer than the text suggesting it is good as a magnet for wars. And there's much more than the binary East-West "dissimilarity" - there were many more states, peoples and political structures. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 00:09, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>An article must be written about geographical divisions within Ukraine, perhaps within the main <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ukraine_0587.html" title="History of Ukraine">History of Ukraine</a> articles. But it must have a different title than this one. But keep the content for now. Change vote from <i>Delete'</i> to <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>
