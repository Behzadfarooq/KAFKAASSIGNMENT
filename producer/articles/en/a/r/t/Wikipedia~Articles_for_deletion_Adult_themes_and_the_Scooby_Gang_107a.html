<li><b>Information</b>: The content of the article was originally a subsection contained within the article <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>. On 7-JUL-2004, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> cut the adult themes section out and placed it into the separate article. I have invited Marcus2 to come to this discussion and explain his reasons for doing so, since this discussion is essentially about undoing his work. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 03:29, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No objection</b> to merging into the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> article, as it could be legitimately be a subsection of the main article. <i>Full disclosure: I am a major contributor to the article -- I am convinced that Velma is a lesbian, and Johnny Bravo is just a beard.</i> <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 00:10, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Delete</b> as above. No redirect needed since I doubt anyone will type this particular header into the search engine. The subject matter is widely debated and worthy of being mentioned, though be cautious of POV. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:59, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although this is not supposed to be a strictly 'family friendly' site, there is something to be said for segregating discussion of adult themes (which in this case border on fanfic) from the main content of the article. But do add something about the theory that Scrappy-Doo is the illegitimate child of Scooby and Velma. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 01:37, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The idea of segregating adult themes -- especially on an article about a childrens' cartoon -- had ocurred to me when I first responded to Woohookitty's adding this to VfD. (I suspect it was probably one of the reasons the article was created separately in the first place, before I started adding to it.) That is, I believe, the only possible reason for not merging here, and I'm not convinced it's a strong enough reason. Especially if the section on adult themes is treated encyclopedically. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 02:55, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep and link from the article about Scooby Gang</b> (see BD2412's comment) <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygar_df57.html" title="User:Tygar">Tygar</a> 02:37, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If you guys do vote for keep, do we at least agree to change the name? I think "Adult Themes in Scooby Doo" or "Hidden Themes in Scooby Doo" are better titles...and much more likely to be searched for. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 02:49, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>If</i> the vote is to keep, then I concur with the change in name... personally I like "Adult Themes in Scooby Doo" better, but this is relevant only if the vote is to keep. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 03:00, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with the name change (although if linked from the Scooby article the name is not as important). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 04:38, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> back to the main article. It's really just fan-fic type speculation--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 04:19, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>either <b>Keep</b> or merge. What if Daphne is a lipstick lesbian? Why is Shaggy called Shaggy? Tune in next time for another edition of Scooby Scooby-Doo!! <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 06:23, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> separate from the main article so kids can avoid it more easily if they want to. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:56, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. WP does not censor for age categories. (see <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a>) <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:02, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Yeah if we start separating articles based on age, that is one massive slippery slope. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 09:26, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Concur. Also, I had forgotten about the specific policy relevant to this: <b><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored_for_the_protection_of_minors" title="WP:WIN">What Wikipedia is Not: Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a></b>. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 18:38, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> would be deleting the article altogether - having a separate article linked to the original page is hardly in the same category - more like segregation of material that (at least arguably) stands on its own as an article anyway. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 19:00, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I cut this article from the main <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> article because it is irrelevant to article as a whole and it had taken too much space in the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> 19:04, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Well since I don't think we're going to find a consensus, I think renaming might be the best thing to do once the 5-6 days have passed. I always love how minor things become life or death on Wikipedia.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 19:36, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going to buck the trend and argue to <b>delete</b> this as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverifiable</a> speculation about fictional characters. The fact that a lot of kids made similar guesses does not make them any less speculative. The few bits that are verifiable and encyclopedic should be discussed in the main article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:58, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Delete</b>; do not merge. While Wikipedia is not and should not be censored for minors, this is inappropriate content for an article on a major children's television show. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 09:18, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's amusing, but right now it looks like a mix of original research and idle speculation. Do we have sources for the interpretations assigned to the in-show events? Sourced comments from the series creators? Outraged press releases from Christian fundamentalists? If there is supporting documentation, then we should keep this article (with an appropriate link from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>). Otherwise, it's just a glorified Scooby-Doo fan forum post. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 16:17, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The phenomena of reading adult subtexts into Scooby-Doo is indeed a verifiable pop culture phenomena, and a very widespread one at that. It is encyclopedic and should be covered. Here are some verifiable sources:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Scooby+drug" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Scooby+drug" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Google search for "Scooby" + "drug" returns 97,000 matches. A large number of these are joke explanations of the adult themes in Scooby, conservative bloggers decrying the moral problems of Scooby, or stoner sites celebrating the Scooby drug culture.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/tv/kids/scoobydoo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/tv/kids/scoobydoo.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Nostalgia Central starts off it's review of Scooby-Doo with the following sentence: "Let's get one thing straight: Drugs! This show is about drugs, conceived by people on drugs, written by people on drugs and mostly watched by people on drugs."</li>
<li><i><a href="http://forums.toonzone.net/archive/index.php/t-37105.html" class="external text" title="http://forums.toonzone.net/archive/index.php/t-37105.html" rel="nofollow">Scooby-Doo Movie Drops Drug Subtext</a></i> The Associated Press ran a story in 2002 on the new Scooby-Doo movie and how the filmmakers were intentionally toning down the TV show's adult themes for the big screen.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.einsiders.com/reviews/dvd/show_dvd.php?review_dvd=143" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.einsiders.com/reviews/dvd/show_dvd.php?review_dvd=143" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Entertainment Insider's DVD review of the complete first and second seasons of the TV show (1969) talks at length about the show's subtext.</li>
<li>The phenomena is so widespread and recognizable in pop culture that <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Smith_0957.html" title="Kevin Smith">Kevin Smith</a> was able to parody it in his 2003 film, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_993c.html" title="Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So does the article need to be re-written to be more encyclopedic, with verifiable sources? Yes, I think it does. I will volunteer to do that, once a decision is made as to where the article is going: Is it going to be a subsection of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>, or will it be a separate article? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 17:44, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd say <b>Merge</b>. I'm not too sold on keeping this subarticle seperate from the main one, and I made the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> article shorter on purpose (by moving the info on the various versions of the show to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_series_guide_8ca6.html" title="Scooby-Doo series guide">Scooby-Doo series guide</a>) so that more information about the show could be listed here. --<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b. Touch</a> 03:49, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. While interesting and valid, this information is not important enough for its own article. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 03:49, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
