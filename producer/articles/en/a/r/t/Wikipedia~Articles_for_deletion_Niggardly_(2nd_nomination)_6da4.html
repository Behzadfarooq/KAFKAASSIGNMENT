<p>This article must be deleted because it has distressingly little to do with its subject. I like the word (an obscure and delightful vestige of an old Germanic tongue), but other than the David Howard incident, I <s>can't imagine anyone scavenging enough relevant encyclopedic content to sustain a real article</s>.</p>
<p>I have read the discussion from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Niggardly_e718.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Niggardly">prior nomination</a> and am not convinced. The rationale of the keep votes seems to be that a) the Howard controversy was notable and that b) people would have a hard time finding info about it without typing the word "niggardly" into the search box. That argument strikes me as bizarre, but if people still feel this way 2 years later, I suggest reducing the article to a prominent Wiktionary link along with a dab statement reading something like "For the guy who got in trouble for saying niggardly, see <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html#Near-homophones" title="Nigger">Nigger#Near-homophones</a>", or "David Howard incident" or some other article that doesn't purport to be about something it's not. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 19:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If possible I <b>would like to withdraw my nomination.</b> Noroton has done a remarkable job digging up more and more citations for misunderstandings resulting from the use of this word. It is still desirable, however, that we change the name of the article, given that it focuses exclusively on the word's unfortunate similarity to the word <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> and does not really treat any other aspects of <i>niggardly</i> as an English word. I'm going to start a page move discussion on the talk page when I'm not so tired. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 18:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ture, but do you really consider this a "full article?" If there was a significant amount of non-dictionary-style info about the word and its usage, I would agree with you.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and here's why: There wasn't just the incident involving the Washington, D.C. bureaucrat, there were two other instances: At the University of Wisconsin, a student complained about a professor who used the word. About a month after the David Howard incident, she brought up the incident at a meeting where the school's speech code was debated; as a result of what was considered the outrageous oversensitivity of her claim (she had earlier filed a complaint against the professor), the speech code was abolished. The student's In North Carolina, a teacher was reprimanded for using the word in her class of fourth-graders. It seems to me that the article could be renamed "Controversies over the word Niggardly" with a redirect from "Niggardly". <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — It's good to keep these type of object lessons around.&#160;:-) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 21:34, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Well referenced and many examples of usage (and controversy over its usage) that make this much more than a dicdef. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 22:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or move to David Howard Incident.

<li><b>Keep</b> It looks like Noroton did a lot of good work on this article. I think that a move to "Controversies over the word Niggardly" with a redirect from "Niggardly" as suggested is also a good idea. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunky_Rice_06d5.html" title="User:Chunky Rice">Chunky Rice</a> 23:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Thanks Chunky Rice! I think the new information shows that the Howard incident wasn't the only one and that there's actually a lot to be said about the matter. I wouldn't at all be offended if someone else wants to edit what I've written, which I can see some problems with (I'll probably edit it a lot more later). I've probably overemphasized some of the more unusual commentary on the controversy because they interested me more. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:32, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It would by a niggardly use of resources to delete this article</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: the current cultural context of the word goes beyond its mere dictionary definition. 68.190.48.20 02:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>: It seems to me that the entire problem arises from the fact that it 'looks' like a dicdef because the title of the article doesn't convey a person, place, thing, or concept. Change the title to something like "Niggardly as a precieved pejorative". Mensch 05:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, with a rename to "Niggardly controversy". Mensch's proposed title, though well intentioned, is not appropriate because it includes a negative term in the title, prejudicing the discussion when the reader comes to the article. <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHuskyHuskie_54da.html" title="User:HuskyHuskie">HuskyHuskie</a> 14:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Agree with the above rename. Interesting article though really not an issue outside the United States.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, If you want to perpetuate ignorance, remove the article. Wiki is fast becoming a google-level resource.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, with slight disinclination to rename; see <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tar_baby.html" title="Tar baby">tar baby</a> for comparison. --<a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogcow_c08a.html" title="User:Dogcow">moof</a> 16:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
