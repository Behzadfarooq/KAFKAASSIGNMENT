<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. This is a rather tricky one. 19 people expresed definate opnions. Of these 6 or 32% chose a simple keep as their first option, 3 chose a rename (which two others listed as a second choice), and 2 a merge to an existing article, for a total of 11 or just under 58% for keeping on en.wikipedia in some form, with a simple keep the most common chice among those 11. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:28, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and expand (with reservations)</b>. I think the main QM article should not be written as a popularization; if there's to be one, it should be a separate article. But I'm a little unhappy with the chatty style of this article; doesn't really <i>sound</i> encyclopedic. And I haven't checked to see if there are any clamorous errors, but popularizations usually have them, and these often result in extremely refractory misconceptions. Someone who's really competent to do so (not I!) should go over it with a fine-toothed comb. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:22, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

If the main article is so incomprehensible as to require a seperate page for the layperson, then perhaps the main article is of a more technical and less encyclopaedic nature, and would benefit from the less intense wording of the simplified form. otherwise, <b>delete</b> as redundant.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishxpride_6915.html" title="User:Irishxpride">Jesse</a> 13:46, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><strike><b>Delete</b> - The article as it stands is complete wothless garbage containing irrelevancies and inaccuracies and no sources. The contributors appear clueless as to the subject they purport to expound upon. There is nothing in the article worth keeping, expanding on or merging. People should write about what they know. This subject is legendary for its difficulty for good reason. Don't take my word for it; show the article to someone you know with advanced physics knowledge. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 13:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</strike> See my changed opinion for a changed article below. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:38, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The current article contains inaccurate information and thus is of little value. That being said, I can see what the author was trying to do; make an esoteric subject more accessible. The current <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Mechanics_e059.html" title="Quantum Mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</a> is understandable to many people, but probably goes over the head of many readers, and thus lacks some encyclopedic value...

<li>We are voting on the article. For a quick introduction to get the flavour of quantum mechanics one should mention the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence_principle.html" title="Correspondence principle">correspondence principle</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncertainty_principle.html" title="Uncertainty principle">uncertainty principle</a> – both of which are actually remarkably intuitive concepts. Those two can go into a paragraph of the main article <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. This article here has neither and a lot of waffle to boot. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 16:52, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I still don't think adding those concepts to the existing <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> will do much to make it understandable to the general public, but you are right the current article in discussion has significant problems. I'm not really the right person to rewrite it though, so I'll just abstain and see what happens.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> I was the one who started this, and then I got sidetracked by work, unfortunately. My apologies to the community. I happen to agree that this article is not anywhere near finished and I would not let all the contributions stand as they are definitely not good enough, but it was intended to invite contributions and get started. I requested that people woould contribute to the discussion as I was happy to take in suggestions and write up the article myself, and I wish people had done this. I <b>strongly</b> feel that there should be simplified versions of difficult topics. Frankly, as a physicist myself I hate some of the main QM article. It is not suitable as it is for an encyclopaedia article. It's written by phsicists for physicists, not for explanation. I am not convinced of merging it with <a href="../../../../simple/q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Quantum_mechanics">simple:Quantum mechanics</a>. That is for simple English, I was trying to use straightforward English and expand in some detail on the ideas, not quite the same thing. However, it would be better than nothing. I do NOT agree with abandoning it totally however. Remember Feynman? "If you can't explain it to a beginner you don't understand it". So, who understands the topic well enough to explain it, not regurgitate advanced textbooks? Instead of giving out, why not contribute? Paulc1001 20:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental scientific theory known to man. It underpins modern science and technology and even provides us with a blueprint for reality itself.

<li>Nice selective quote there WAS! You're trotting out cliched marketing-speak to decide on a serious topic. If the subject is writing articles that explain a topic, then it's not me who is clueless. Wanna try being a bit more constructive? Paulc1001 03:35, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a <b>mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles</b> — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to explore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularly successful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above any theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well understood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and why, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by describing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing performs the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one end is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what kind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; <b>there is very little agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics.</b> Minimally interpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the microscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our measuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language of classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a microscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed manner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those apparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the sort the theory describes." <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/" class="external text" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/" rel="nofollow">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> You propose to provide a simplified version of <b>mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles</b> by leaving out the math concepts that describe the behaviors? You propose to provide a simplified version of <b>what the world is like according to quantum mechanics</b> even when the experts can't? Or are you proposing others do this? It would be both useful and instructive for you to try writing a simplied version of quantum entangement (one tiny part of quantum mechanics). Posturing is easy. I encourage you to use quantum entangement to prove me wrong with an example of the type of treatment you propose for quantum mechanics. I hope this is contructive enough for you. If not, tell me why. I encourage your curiosity in quantum mechanic; I just think you should learn more about it before you jump into this task you have set for yourself. I believe the task as you have framed it will necesarily be a failure. I note that the content you have not deleted in the article is more along the lines of "history of QM". Another suggestion would be to write an article on that - the history of QM. I'm sure that would be a smashing success (if the article does not already exist - I haven't looked). Cheers. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:17, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>WAS, while I appreciate you are being slightly more constructive I believe you are missing the point - several times! If you would stop pasting in quotes from other people for 5 minutes it might help. (1) You seem to miss (more than once) where I wrote I happen to be an (ex-)physicist, and I spent a decade in the 'trade'. I have postgraduate qualifications from a prominent Physics Dept. I say this NOT as a boast; there are many many better-qualified physicists than me here and many better able to explain the topic to a specialist audience than I am. Rather I say this as a point of information, and also that my 'curiosity' is quite well-sated, thank you. I have already learned and forgotten more about QM than many people will ever learn (not referring to you, I don't know how much you know, you only ever paste in other's words). Actually this is an issue, I have forgotten lots of detail over the years, but I did learn it in the first place. I have never said I was the only or the best person to do this task, I'm certainly not the best-qualified physicist here, but I'm probably one of the better explainers, I would like to believe. (2) This whole idea all was meant (by me) to be a work that would take quite some time, probably by several people. You seem to think a fully-formed article just jumps out. I happened to get swamped with work recently, which is why I was not able to get back to the article, which was unfortunate timing! Maybe the article could be 'hibernated' or hidden while it's worked on - is there a way to do this??? That's why I tried to get people to contribute to the discussion, not the article itself! I know I won't personally able to do much for the next few weeks, so I would be ok with mothballing it somehow. (3) I believe it is perfectly possible to explain concepts with minimal maths. There is a grand total of 1 equation in A Brief History of Time. Of course this 'explanation' is not a full QM treatise. What I am suggesting is more like can we get across the ideas to an intelligent person who doesn't have a degree in physics. (4) These quotes you love are really not relevant, sorry. (5) On quantum entanglement, I would say that some of the article here is actually not that bad, barring the equations. It wouldn't be a terrible starting point at explaining the matter simply. (6) I think, contrary to you, that there are many decent attempts to explain QM ideas in an accessible manner, and I think it is possible to attempt to explain the nauture of the problems with it too. Of course I never said I could resolve all its problems, where did you get that from? But I can SPEAK about them! You really miss this point. What part of "non-technical introduction to QM" don't you get? I never said I was going to clear up the subject entirely, that's laughable. (7) What was left after deleting was just my own quick text, frankly that's all I want to stand over. I happen to agree with you strongly that much of the text submitted to the article was inadequate. What I did yesterday was just to revert to what I have had the time to do and called it a stub which seemed prudent. It's really very little as I'm well aware of. It wasn't meant to be a history <i>per se</i>, but an introduction to an article. I agree that a History of QM could be a fine article. Incidentally, I was about to remove the link from the main QM article to this, but I see it's been done, good! It can be put back later if warranted.(8) If we did a quick poll I think it is not me who would be described as posturing in this discussion. You are making great sweeping statements about how everything is impossible, pasting in quotes from other people all the time, so enough! If you can't/won't contribute then butt out and go contribute where you are able. Your confrontational tone is winning you no friends in this matter, and makes that quote on your user page hilarious! I was originally motivated by a desire to explain and invite collaboration; not to abuse, ridicule, and obfuscate. So, sorry WAS, I will reply to you no more, I have not the time or energy so don't bother trying to rise me any further. I have a life outside here. Take care.
