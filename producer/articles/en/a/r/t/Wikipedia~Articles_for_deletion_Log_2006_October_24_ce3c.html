<li><b>Comment</b> Not intending to belabor this, but as an established term in military vernacular, I'm not sure ghits is an appropriate measure of notability in this case. Yet, I get 38,000 ghits on "Walking Point". That's notable. The article needs to be tagged for improvement, not deleted.

If you meddled into my "West African type", I could take it as a controversal topic, but refuting such a well-established, well-measured fact like Nilotic physique is too much.

<li>Here's the problem, as I see it: statistical studies of body features <b>that do not reference underlying genes</b> are extremely susceptible to bias and preconceived notions, and to incorrect conclusions due to unobserved environmental and dietary factors. If this article classified atheletes by genotype, then I would have no problem at all. However, classifications by tribe, race, or body type are notoriously inaccurate, and subject to too many ways in which the conclusions can be slanted to favor whatever conclusions the author wishes to make, consciously or not. I am well aware that the scientific sports literature deals with such issues without reference to genes, in peer-reviewed journals, but speaking as a professional medical biostatistician I have to say that I question whether any of this "research" can stand up to close scrutiny. If this article were to admit in its first paragraph that concepts such as "Nilotic type" have no scientific basis in genetics, or alternatively, if it were actually to specify the genes that define the Nilotic type, then I would be much more favorably disposed. — <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAetheling_2659.html" title="User:Aetheling">Aetheling</a> 12:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to Wikipedia rules, personal attacks are used especially in cases, when a person uses it "as a means of avoiding discussion of the relevance or truthfulness the person's statement". However, I can document all what I say with exact numbers, from the skull length, face width, limb length, body mass index, muscle+fat width, even calf girth. What about you? Do you also know some other English word except "Delete"? It would improve our communication. Centrum99 09:07, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep and cleanup</b>:</s> the editor who wrote these has stated that he is having trouble understanding how to correctly cite an article. As he lists a dozen works in his references section, albeit incorrectly, I am not convinced this falls under NOR. If others would help him figure out how to cite the assertions made in the article correctly, we might be able to get past the NOR issue, and address any NPOV or bias issues. The works are dated from 1989 to 2006. I comprehend that those voting "delete" are concerned about OR, Bias, and inaccurate articles which present disproved science as though it were current, but this may not be the case here. I myself was only able to find a reference in a 1907 work; that does not mean it does not have currency elsewhere and until we figure out what sources Centrum99 is using and whether they support his article, we cannot judge whether it is OR. If there is bias, it can be addressed - and if the article is indeed OR and promoting a disused term, then we can address that. We do indeed have an article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_science.html" title="Racial science">Racial science</a>, and it is disputed and very poorly sourced, but IMHO it is not a candidate for deletion. Could it not be the case here? We have an article on <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">Flat earth</a>, which I believe just made FA. We have articles on many topics which are either proven false, disputed, or crank theories, but we <i>have them</i>. This term, dating to 1907, is most assuredly <b>not</b> a neologism. It may be outdated poor science, and then again it may be something else. Those voting "delete as OR" for an article with 12 books in the references, and "delete as neologism" for a term making an appearance at least by 1907, are surely allowing distaste for Racial science to affect their neutrality. We do not have to like something or agree with it in order for it to be worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 11:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that it is no longer in use and was never widespread even at the time means that this term also fails the standards of notability. Just because a handful of quacks promoted the idea in whatever form does not make it notable and falls more under the heading of a hoax masquerading as reality in the minds of some fringe groups. You are seeing the term and assuming that it was, at one point notable, but it was not else it would be more readily found in historical scholarly journals when, in fact, only a few instances can be found. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 12:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because none of those books deal with the idea of the nilotic type, rather they are used in order to garner data which the author is synthesizing into supporting another topic, the nilotic type. To quote <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, it is a "synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position." Here, that position is race science, an archaic pseudo-scientific inquiry which has repeatedly been condemned by all modern medical establishments.

<dd>You received no reply from me, because I must also sleep sometimes. The term "Nilotic/Nilotid type/race/physique" was regularly used by anthropologists until ca. 60-70's. Note that the large article of Roberts, Bainbridge "Nilotic Physique" that is still frequently cited as one of the most detailed studies on East African physique, was published in 1963. I can post maps from books of Lundman or Biasutti, which are authorities from 50's-60's, who use the term "Nilotid" or "Razza Nilotica" respectively. After this generation of anthropologists finished their lifelong work, the new generation born after WW II subdued to the demands of the new age and comparative anthropology was, in fact, buried. The anthropological division that was established during the first half of the 20th century was substituted by more "politically correct" geographical terms, so, for example, you no longer study a "Nilotic type", but "East African pastoralists" or simply "East Africans". Gradually even this division was discredited as "no more meaningful" and since a certain time, scientists in Western Europe/North America must pretend that racial differences don't exist all. This absurd situation probably reached its top in 2003 with the public TV fraud called "Race: The Power Of An Illusion". I am not the only one, who complains about it. Recently I was in correspondence with a French anthropologist, who apologized that he has no newer data on the physique of Europeans, only those from his study wrote in 80's, because a broad anthropological comparison of today's Europeans is simply unthinkable. So you shouldn't be surprised that many people - if they want to discuss physical variability in Europe - must quote Carleton Coon's Races of Europe, written in 1939. There virtually exist no newer studies or synthesis since ca. mid 70's, when Hiernaux book People of Africa was published. However, since some data are needed for medical reasons, there exist recent studies in which you can find some basic anthropometric measurements like e.g. height, sitting height, arm length, body diameters etc.</dd>

<dd>To Aetheling: I think your arguments are not appropriate. Body proportions are generally geneticly determined traits, adaptations to enviroment that don't change so plasticly like stature. Since leg length is bound with nutrition, you can observe a small increase of relative leg length (in comparison to stature) in industrialized nations during the last century. However, the increase is very small in comparison with height and obviously hitted a genetic limit during the last decades. For example, Japanese were notoriously known as small, extremely short-legged people. Their trunk index (trunk height/body height ratio) was around 54% 50 years ago. Now it is around 53,6% and appears to be stabilized. This is still far from the average of about 52% found in Europeans, 50-51% in West Africans and Ethiopids, and 48% found in the Nilotes and the majority of Australian Aboriginals. Note please, how the trunk index is bound with climate: numbers between 53-54% can be found in East Asians and Eskimos, 52% in Europeans, 50-51% in steppe-forest Africans, 48% in populations adapted to hot, dry desert. This is a climatic adaptation resulting from the need to handle with excessive or insufficient body temperature. Limbs have big volume relative to their height, hence they are the first part of the body that reacts to climatic change. In hot climate, long thin limbs better dissipate heat than short, volumnous limbs that, on the other hand, better preserve body temperature in cold climate. Since distal limb segments like forearms and calves are the thinnest, they are also most influenced: for example, Neanderthals had extremely small forearm/upper arm and calf/thigh ratio that can't be found in any modern human population, because modern Arctic humans still are not perfectly adapted to Arctic climate like Neanderthals. Nilotes and Australian Aboriginals represent the other extreme, with extremely long limbs and extremely long forearms and calves. And as for genetics, I would add that Nilotes are one of the most archaic human groups that can be well separated as a single race. They posess a special subclade of Y-haplogroup A (A3b2), a sub-branch of the subclades found in Khoisan. They must have separated from the Khoisan people a long time ago and since they have lived in their enviroment for thousands of years, their adaptation to hot climate is the most extreme of all human groups. Irrespectively if you like it or not, and irrespectively if the term "Nilotic" is "officially allowed" or not, this physical type still exists. The only way, how to erase the Nilotic type from the world is to go to Sudan with a sufficiently large army and exterminate all Nilotes. 82.100.61.114 15:56, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for the detailed response. Based on this, here is how I think you can clean up this article. (1) In the lead paragraph, document (with references) the genetic existence of the Nilotic as a "well-separated race", and describe what is known from genetics of its ancestry and geographic dispersal. Give a lot more detail (with references) on how they fit into the broader panorama of known genetic groups of Africa. (2) Shift the <i>primary</i> emphasis of the article away from physique, and towards the genetic identity of this group. Avoid any characterization that is not based in the bedrock of genetics, because every other aspect of phenotype may be heavily influenced by health, nutrition, environment, and culture. Why even mention height, when, as you say, it may largely depend on living style? (3) I recommend that you be very careful with your physical descriptions. You used the words "slim" and "slender", for example, yet this slimness may be purely nutritional. Is there any evidence at all that this slimness derives from genotype? (4) In your second paragraph, I suggest that you give some of the history of the word "Nilotic" itself. You might mention explicitly that the "Nilotic" concept dates back to the days when anthropological classifications were based on little more than physical stereotypes, as part of a program for establishing a heirarchy of races, from "primitive" to "advanced". Mention that the term has not been used since the 1960s, and tell us why it fell out of favor. Is there another term that is now preferred? (5) Push all the aspects of physique into a separate section, just before the sport section. — <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAetheling_2659.html" title="User:Aetheling">Aetheling</a> 17:23, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Nilotic type/physique" is no original research, but a well-known and established term, at least for those, who have ever read something about anthropology.

<b>Delete</b> I decided to check the references. Beall et al. do not use the terms "nilotic" or "nilote". Campbell, Leslie, Campbell (2006) do not use either term <i>and</i> their research is a comparison between nomadic and settled populations within one ethnicity, not a comparison of one ethnicity to another, and thus seems totally unrelated to this entry's nominal topic. Entiene and Hiernaux I could not check. The first Larsen, et al., the one from 2000, as far as I can tell does not exist: No article featuring Larsen as its author appeared in any 2000 volume, a search for "h.b. larsen" or "larsen, h.b." as an author yields no results, and searches for "kenyan" in the title of an article yielded me no results regardless of whether or not I specified 2000 as the article year. The second Larsen, at al. (from 2004) does not speak of "nilote" or "nilotic type", although it does state "In this light the purpose of the present study was to describe body dimensions, running economy, aerobic power, and related variables and relate them to habitual daily physical activity level of Nandi town and village boys in western Kenya. The hypothesis was that the characteristics of east African elite distance runners can be observed in adolescent Nandi boys regardless of where they live." The study identifies genetics as a possible factor in Nandi running. The Little and Rębacz sources I couldn't get, as the University of Minnesota doesn't have online access to the Yearbook of Physical Anthropology or Collegium Antropologicum. Ditto J. H. de Ridder, E. Smith, C. Wilders, C. Underhay, as the University of Minnesota doesn't provide me with access to the Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Conference of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry. Roberts (1963)... talks about a Nilotic group, although we have Ramdrake saying that a clinal approach has supplanted one of Roberts's fundamental assumptions. Both Saltin et al., I couldn't get ahold of: University of Minnesota doesn't give online access to the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports. So, what I could get ahold of gives me 1 source that as best I can tell doesn't exist, 1 source that someone disputes as reliable, and 3 sources that in my opinion only link to the topic at hand by violating a provision of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source." We have Aetheling's suggestions for a rewrite, we have the existing entry, and we have an author ascribing delete reccomendations and the apparent irrelevance of multiple sources to political motivations - that last something that always makes me think the lady doth protest too much. In all, while after I see it I might welcome an article along the lines of what Aetheling suggests, at the present time I think the entry requires deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 22:32, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To reply to the above two editors; the primary reason this is up for AfD is because it violates Wikipedia guidelines on notability and TV shows (I don't have the links at hand but may be able to be convinced to find them). Wikipedia is also not around to provide information on every conceivable random thing. TV show articles that are simply summaries are not supposed to be around; only articles which explain how a particular episode caused a controversy, was news worthy or was a landmark in the series or in television in general should exist. Again, the fact that other shows have many articles does NOT in anyway imply that this article should exist. Indeed, according to Wikipedia's guidelines most of these other TV show articles should ALSO be deleted and I may get around to nominating them soon. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Disk space is cheap, human effort isn't. Secondly, deleting something because "no other episodes are covered" is a profoundly stupid reason... Wikipedia always will have somewhat asymetric coverage because the editors/writers decide what is interesting to them. It is not a paper work, as has been brought out. The proper way to handle unreasonable asymetry is to focus on expanding the other content not to destroy what is already there! <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryce_2348.html" title="User:Bryce">Bryce</a> 14:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hopefully this is enough to end debate... In looking up specific Wikipedia policies you can find on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> the following rules which imply that this article should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Wikipedia articles can NOT simply be plot summaries. "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." Does this particular episode have a major, real-world context? Has it provoked controversy? Is it genre-defining? If not, then delete.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> Wikipedia is NOT a directory. "Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business" are not allowed. Essentially, having articles for individual TV episode falls under the category of 'TV guides' and amounts to a directory, therefore it is not allowed.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> According to Wikipedia's notability standards for fiction, "It is generally appropriate for a plot summary to remain part of the main article, not a lengthy page of its own." If the information in this article must be kept, then it really needs to be merged into the article about the television show itself. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: being "real" is not an issue (and is not a criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia—lots of real things don't have or deserve WP articles). The questions are: is it notable? (Does it meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>?) And is it a blatant ad? (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an advertising service</a>.) The refs may help address the first point (though I'd have to review them), but the second point is far more important! WP is being innundated with spam, and a new shoot-on-sight policy has been instituted (see <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G11</a>). An article about an internet advertising company, in particular, is going to have to bend over backwards to avoid even the <i>slightest</i> appearance of being spam in order to avoid being deleted. If you can rewrite the article to avoid even the faintest <i>hint</i> of spamminess, I will happily change my vote (but see <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>). I, however, have no interest in rewriting the article for you. Having this article deleted now will not prevent anyone from writing a non-spammy article in the future, so really, it's no big deal. Either fix it now, or just chill. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that the word has a variety of meanings does not make it 'more than a dictionary definition.' A lot of words have a wide array of meanings in English, let alone other languages. We can't have an article for every foreign word with a few different meanings.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> -- sorry to say, but unfortunately, large "group" AfDs like this tend to turn into a mess. It looks like there are strong camps in all areas -- merge, keep, and delete. If I happen to have missed a particularly strong consensus to delete any two or three of these pages, I'd recommend starting a second nomination for just those, linking to this one. Other than that, I'd recommend giving the mergists some time to do their work, and then starting smaller group (or even individual) AfD proceedings. The other trick is to put one through as a "tester" to establish a general consensus, before putting in the group. So again, rather than objecting to this close on my talk page, please feel free to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">head to deletion review</a> or start second noms for particularly problematic or other individual pages.

<p>There's a number of pokemon articles that say nothing except a plot summary (something just a one sentence long summary, as in the case of this squitle episode), an info box, and sometimes a cast list (=indiscriminate collection of information, what Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. We don't need 500+ pokemon episode articles (only a matter of time before someone makes an article similar to this one for each pokemon episode, not hard to do either) if all they're going to contain only plot summaries and an indiscriminate dump of cast information.</p>
<p>This isn't a nomination for deletion for all pokemon articles (just the ones listed here). Some, like <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Soldier_Porygon_85dd.html" title="Electric Soldier Porygon">Electric_Soldier_Porygon</a>, are significant for good reason. And has an article that does have commentary and real life context. With information which can be verified and sourced (although it currently is not). However, there is no evidence that the 500 other pokemon articles will ever reach this stage.</p>
<p>Actually, it seems like there just isn't anything to say about them - For example, even the very first pokemon episode <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon%2C_I_Choose_You%21_ba6b.html" title="Pokémon, I Choose You!">Pokémon, I Choose You!</a>, which is probably the most famous episode (being the very first) is just a plot summary. Although a far longer plot summary (which isn't a good thing. A scene-by-scene synopsis is something to be avoided as per <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a></p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with episode articles if they're good and well developed, but that isn't the case here. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information to do so, create articles on each season, or some other logical division, of the show.</i>"</dd>
<dd>"<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes, spin the information from episodes out into their own articles.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's no indication of there even being enough "independently verifiable information" to write articles on each season, let along articles for each episode. If people really have so much to write about, they should start with good season articles, (or articles for part of the season, so like episodes 1-20, season 1. since pokemon seasons are LONG), and then expand into episode articles only when there is more to say about an individual episode.</p>
<p>These are the articles i'm nominating:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only for the TV shows where the episode articles contain only summaries. And when they can obviously be merged into season (or other logical divisions) of episode articles. Defintely not planning to nominate everything. For example, i'm certianly not planning to nominate <a href="../../../b/u/f/Category%7EBuffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_fe04.html" title="Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">Buffy episodes</a>. Since the articles defintely have more than just a summary (See <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_to_the_Hellmouth_%28Buffy_episode%29_1b8b.html" title="Welcome to the Hellmouth (Buffy episode)">Welcome to the Hellmouth (Buffy episode)</a>, especially note the section on "Writing"). It's obvious someone's made an effort to actually write an <i>encyclopedic</i> article, rather than just an episode summary. They're all well organized, and the summaries themselves are actually good - as in they're detailed but not a dry scene-by-scene recall. With like...these pokemon episodes. I don't think people can even squeeze enough out of them to make decent <i>encyclopedic</i> season articles, let along encyclopedic epidosde articles. As for Star Trek, i'm not sure. I'm defintely planning to go in there and clean out the mass of <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">trivia</a> when i find spare time. As for actually nominating the articles for deletion, i am tempted to do so. They are also just a mass of summaries, although they are quite obviously a step up from the kind of articles in this nomination and in the 4400 episodes nomination. Using season articles for summaries of that size will cause article length problems. Don't suppose you could point me to something that explains where wikipedia stands with huge long detailed summaries that provide no commetary and otherwise encyclopedic information? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 04:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep All</b> TV episode articles are acceptable for most series, and Pokemon is more notable than most.

<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> The Wikipedia can't possibly be expected to have separate articles for every single episode of every TV show ever made; it would be ridiculous (not to mention the amount of server space required). Thus, allowing these to exist sets this as a precedent. Only the most notable episodes (particulary of highly notable TV shows, think I Love Lucy, Happy Days, etc) should have their own articles. The fact that full episode guides exist for other shows (including Star Trek, which I am a fan of) does not mean that these articles should be kept, rather it indicates those articles should be deleted as well. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment on Possible Compromise</b> I was thinking, this is an issue that seems to pop up here rather often and needs to become better resolved. Perhaps, rather than a simple total deletion (which is what I currently support) what about having, for television shows with many existing articles on their individual episodes, a number of pages dedicated to each <i>season</i>, rather than one page that has all the summaries (which would be too bulky) or many individual pages for each episode (which is too much and rather impractical)? It seems having the summaries placed in articles that discusses the season they occured in as a whole would be preferable and a good way of compromising what seems to be the two dominant positions here, plus it would have the added benefit of providing context for individual episodes. I also believe, but am not sure, that this is how the articles for the show <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost.html" title="Lost">Lost</a> are set up. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 03:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>This discussion is about only the articles listed in this AfD. Bringing up other television articles is off point. No one is saying that (insert your favorite show) should not have articles, rather that there is a process by which we build those articles. It starts with an article for the show, if the show is notable enough then articles on the seasons of the show, IF the seasons article warrants spinning off individual episode articles then we do that. Please read <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a> for a more detailed explanation. The articles in this AfD aren't even stubs they all have little beyond a 1 or 2 sentence plot summary. If and when the season articles are developed then we can create articles on the almost 500 episodes. L0b0t 17:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Case by case basis</b>; for those short, stubby ones; <b>merge and redirect</b> relevent info into a season summary. The longer ones need to be <b>merged, redirected, and compressed</b>, but since these episodes are more significant, they should take up more of the season summary. Finally, episodes like Electric Soldier Porygon, which have ample potential to expand outside of plot summary (which they already have, if I'm not mistaken), should stay. Plus, <i>external links to a pokewiki</i> in season articles will work wonders. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 21:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> (case-by-case) - Many of the articles contain valid information; certainly those with a Controversy section, even if duplicated elsewhere, cannot be said to be "solely plot summaries." However, if the articles cannot be expanded sufficiently (for my suggested qualifications, more than about two paragraphs, or 12 sentences) it may be better to merge them into a more generalized article, such as a "Pokemon Season 1 Episodes" or similar. Please note that by "Merge" I do <b>not</b> mean deleting a certain portion of the article and moving the rest; rather, I mean taking the whole content of each article, as most of the articles are what could be described as the perfect size for sections of a multi-episode article. Additionally, I would like to point out that just because one episode has its own article doesn't mean that every episode needs its own article. While it may look good for the sake of uniformity, I think it is highly possible that out of Season X (or however you want to break it down) only two or three episodes will have enough important content to deserve their own article, which can be linked to from the main episode list. Finally, one more time, for emphasis: <b>no content should be deleted</b>. Moved, perhaps, but it should definitely be retained. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 21:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, episodes that deserve their own article for whatever unique reasons should get their own article. Notice how i have not simply listed <i>all</i> pokemon articles for deletion.

<dd>I write this to bring attention to an important Web site that can be found through Google. The Web site I am referring to is that of the Jeff Rense radio talk show program. It is special because it has been singled out by the U.S. State Department as a site that contains "a great deal of unreliable information."

<dd>Getting the complete article costs $3, which I'm not willing to spend on a minor part of my Wikipedia hobby, but this header and length does not sound like an article as such. Note that 272 words is short - you've just read half the "article" right here. It is written in the first person, which is not a standard journalistic practice. It refers to the reader as "you", again, not very journalistic. It starts with "I write this to bring attention" - how many articles start like that? It reads like a "letter to the editor", or at best a poorly written editorial. The US SD mention seems to be that it was part of a long list of conspiracy sites, again, not something granting special notability to it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, rense.com is one of only a handful of conspiracy sites that the state department explicitly mentions: <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jul/27-595713.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jul/27-595713.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. I do agree that the article I listed might not be the best source - the more I look at it, it <i>does</i> seem to be some sort of letter to the editor - but I'm sure there are some substantial sources out there.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did find an article that is actually <i>about</i> Rense and his website in <i>BusinessWorld</i> (Philippines). Here's an excerpt:
<dl>
<dd>The aliens are not just out there in outerspace. They are in cyberspace, too.</dd>
<dd>If you still can't believe it, try Sightings site (at <a href="http://www.sightings.com" class="external free" title="http://www.sightings.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sightings.com</a>) and get a load of the stories and photos from many sources from around the globe.</dd>
<dd>The site is based on the Sightings on Radio (formerly The End of the Line) program by Jeff Rense, a television news director and anchor for 12 years, the site explained. "The show presents advanced information and alternative views that rarely, if ever, appear in the mainstream media," it continued. [...]</dd>
<dd>Under the heading HOAX!, Mr. Rense explained how the site Webmaster was able to analyze that the UFO photo turned out to be a photo of a stage prop, particularly, stage lights.</dd>
<dd>"My Webmaster, James Neff, a brilliant analyst in his own right... determined that the new photo is indeed a stage prop as you can see from his enhanced computer work," explained Mr. Rense. (Silva, Veronica C. "Cyberspace: Host to Host". <i>BusinessWorld</i>. 4 September 1997. p. 18.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, there are plenty of brief mentions in other sources, eg <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_4_28/ai_n6145277" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_4_28/ai_n6145277" rel="nofollow">this one from the <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i></a> and <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2002_Winter/ai_97116326" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2002_Winter/ai_97116326" rel="nofollow">this one from <i>Whole Earth</i></a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Without commenting on Jeff Rense, the bottom line is that this article previously received a Keep result in an afd discussion and nothing significant has changed in the article.

<dd>Perhaps, but the last discussion was tainted because I had nominated the article and some of the people arguing to keep were doing so because I had been in an edit disput with them at the time over a completely different article.

<dd>He's not a part of an area or field, he's a fringe conspiracy theorist.

<dd>Those are compendiums of theories. You're essentially arguing that conspiracy theorizing is a field. If he was notable in a particular conspiracy theory (as long as the theory was notable), either establishing it or making some breaking discovery in it then I would be more inclined to agree with his notability under that particular theory. Just because there is an industry around it doesn't make it an institutionalized entity which would make it a field of research. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 19:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article is of dubious notability; the only two sources do not give an account of where the phrase originated or how common it is plus the sources themselves don't seem like proper sources for an encyclopedia. The article, which is essentially a stub, doesn't even completely agree with its definition for the phrase with the sources it quotes. This is not a dictionary for phrases and articles need proper sources that can at least establish some notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I see mention of "National <i>Aspirations</i>" for the group, but no real evidence that they have <i>achieved</i> any notability beyond their local scene. There is one non-AZ source cited, but that one seems of dubious notability itself, not to mention questionable <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliability</a>. I think this group may well be on its way to achieving notability, but I don't think they've "arrived" yet. It won't hurt anyone to wait for a while before creating a Wikipedia article, so I counsel patience. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><span style="font-size: smaller">(Going offtopic, if this gets out of hand I'll move it to the talk page)</span> Indeed, the article deletionist would not be notable in the encyclopedic namespace; that's why it doesn't exist. But I'd also point out that dividing people into deletionists and inclusionists is not helpful; it only serves to create factions and undermines real discussion and concensus.

<li>Seems rather a lot to merge into the main Biker Mice page, which only has fairly brief descriptions of even the Mice.

<li>As a general rule, we like to keep fan speculation out of articles. This article says he is confirmed as a mad German scientist, so that's the info that should be included.

<li>You make it sound as if there is a conspiracy against Tecmobowl. I would say he is a vandal, according to my reading of the Wikipedia vandalism standards. Tecmobowl removes content from articles that should not be removed and removes vandalism warnings from his talk page. There is no conspiracy and I feel the problem is Tecmobowl. <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EOBILI_5e0f.html" title="User:OBILI">OBILI</a> <a href="../../../o/b/i/User_talk%7EOBILI_36c8.html" title="User talk:OBILI">®</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_OBILI_65c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/OBILI">±</a> 16:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

As far as this AFD is concerned, it's shaping up to be a witch hunt (or a <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEAT_8cd6.html" title="WP:MEAT">WP:MEAT</a> attack) and the vote stacking I linked to above bears that out. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nothing disallows his removal of warnings from his talk page, and readding them is probably vandalism itself.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Just because you might not like the use of a term doesn't mean that it should be deleted from dictionaries (that's directed at you Orwellian 1984 delete crazy psychos). If we're going to delete this entry then the entry for the "n" word and bitch should have to go as well. This term is as much part of american encyclopedic history as any other coloquial term. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.3.76.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.3.76.7_d040.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.3.76.7">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The previous "Do Not Delete" edit has an excellent point. If the stereotype <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigger.html" title="Wigger">wigger</a> is on Wikipedia, then there is no reason why this Chonga stereotype article cannot be on it. All this article needs is a little more editing and it will be acceptable. I see no reason why it should be deleted. - Simon H.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This should not be deleted for the same reasons mentioned above. the use of the "n" word, or even the term wigger, this is indeed a stereotype but is not to be deleted because someone does not like it.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete!!</b> In reference to the 1984 Orwellion bikeable. The fact that you counted the hours which this page had been in existence shows yours distatste for this entry, and your distant location in Boston probably adds to the distate which you dislpay towards this article. It just so happens that I researched wikipedia while this page was still under construction. If the terms "wigger" and the "n" word can be used as research items, than so should the term "chonga." -George H.</li>

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>- this article has been very useful to numerous friends of mine here in south florida who are not familiar with the term "chonga", those of you that dont agree, dont know the term and have nothing to do it, but as for the youth of south florida this word has become very popular and has grown extensively. i plead that this article <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be deleted.--<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.221.143.68.html" title="User:168.221.143.68">168.221.143.68</a> 17:03, 9 February 2006 (UTC) <b>Gabriel F.</b></p>

<li><b>This article should not be deleted.</b> It is, for all intensive purposes, similar to a stub. If anything, this article should not be considered for deletion: it should be considered for extension. References to the word chonga are difficult to find (in print, the internet, etc.) because it is not a word that has garnered world-wide usage. If you'd like references that you MIGHT be able to find, listen to radio station El Zol 95, a local station here in Miami. It's not easy to find references for a rather new term. Also, this is not a definitionesque article. If you'd like for it to be less "mockery-toned", by all means, go ahead and edit it. The way it stands now, everyone in Miami that I know that has seen the article (and in the past 24 hours, word has spread FAST) agrees that it is truthful and not in any way just a slang term with no relevance. This article contains the history, the evolution of said chonga, and is, in no way, offensive. If a girl is dressed like one, she knows what she's doing, and she knows what she's attempting to look like. If I wear a gold chain around my neck, 3 inches thick, with a spinner on the end, a thick Ecko sweater, and my pants around my ankles, you'd immediately say I'm trying to be "gangster" or "gangster-like". This is because I AM. You do not look a certain way without being able to be labeled. This is just a new label for a certain female demographic, primarily found in South Florida which has not found national usage yet. --Gmasterluis 00:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> — All these people who want to see this article become <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a> (and therefore acceptable for inclusion in Wikipedia) should focus their attentions on improving the article. Is is acceptable, encouraged in fact, for the article to be edited, expanded, and improved during the deletion discussion. The criticisms levelled above by the <b>delete</b> voters are common here. Many new articles suffer these same faults. Occasionally an article can be improved enough during the deletion process to cause people to change their votes. The faults noted above are somewhat subjective, but based on objective observations. Gmasterluis says <i>If you'd like for it to be less "mockery-toned", by all means, go ahead and edit it.</i> Articles should only be edited by people who understand the subject matter, the <b>keep</b> voters here claim to understand the subject, the <b>delete</b> voters clearly do not (from your POV). So the <b>delete</b> voters need to put their heads together and re-write the article to comply with Wikipedia guidelines. And they need to do it quickly before a deletion decision is made.<br />

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!!!</b> This article is extremely helpful to people new to South Florida who do not understand the term.</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!!!!!!!</b> THIS ARTICLE IS VERY TRUE OF SOUTHERN FLORIDIANS AND IS NOT IN THE SAME LEVEL AS THE OFFENSIVE N WORD USED TO BRING DOWN AFRICAN AMERICANS. CHONGA'S ARE PROUND OF WHAT THEY ARE, SOME OF THEM EVEN PURCHASE APPAREL WITH THIS WORD WRITTEN ON IT. PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES AND EVEN OTHER CITIES HAVE NOT YET HEARD THIS WORD THERFORE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT A REAL WORD, BUT TO US IN SOUTH FLORIDA IT IS VERY REAL. THIS ARTICLE SHOULD REMAIN IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BECUASE IT CALL HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND SOUTH FLORIDA'S CULUTRE AND PEOPLE.----HOTTEETS.COM
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> — You're still missing the point. No one is claiming that this is not a real word. The issue here is the article in question, and it's appropriateness for inclusion in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">an encyclopedia</a>. Try reading the comments and suggestions that I (and others) have posted here. Take these ideas to heart, and work to improve the article so that it meets Wikipedia standards. Coming here and bitching <i>(you) HAVE NOT YET HEARD THIS WORD THERFORE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT A REAL WORD</i> is not productive. And it won't do any good. The administrator that decides the final outcome of this discussion will not be swayed by TYPING IN ALL CAPS and moaning about how <i>you don't understand us.</i> The only issue here is the quality of the article. If you approach the phenomenon of "Chonga" from a sociological and cultural perspective, write an article from that POV, and write it at a level of quality commensurate with other articles, you will find that the word is kept, and you will win this fight. Read the comments by <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> above and use those articles as a guide to improving this one. Bringing in a bunch of your friends to scream <b>DO NOT DELTE</b> is not going to help. (And, by the way, the term we usually use here is <b>Keep</b>. Not "do not delete")<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> This article just needs to be worked on. It has not been here for very long, and requires INTELLIGENT people to work on it. I've been working on it a bit, even though it isn't originally my work, and I am not someone with all the background info, though I can ensure everyone that it's all true and valid information. The people complaining, I don't agree with them, because they aren't making valid arguments. However, this topic should not be for deletion, as I stated before. We (people who are well aware of the term) are trying our best to improve the article and continue make it grow into a more encyclopedic source of information.</li>
<li><i><b>do not delete</b></i> this article. it is <b>hilarious</b> and is very useful to people who do not know what a Chonga is. Everything in this article is true, i should know because i am a teen living in S. FLorida. But people who do not know what Chonga means can learn from this article. p.s. if you are intersted in seeing Chongas for yourself, go to International Mall or Santa's Enchanted Forest.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I was the one who nominated this for a speedy delete, when I was newpage patrolling. It was patent nonsense at the time--some in-joke gibberishy blather about somebody who happened to be named Jory. In the interim, however, all that's been entirely replaced by a legitimate entry about a legitimately-notable film. That this is being considered for deletion at all is just an artifact of the review system.

<p>Musician who made one album in 1973 before dropping out. Only reference a recent local newspaper article about him, but seems to have made few -- if any -- ripples on the music world.

<li>Just want to point out that the information in the article is verified by the informational booklet published by Capitol Records for the release of the album, which I will remind you was a nationwide release on one of the biggest record labels in the music industry. This can be confirmed by Capitol Records. Also, I checked this with Gary Paxton, who confirmed it. And Gary no doubt knows more about such things than Ed Ward. In addition, a quick yahoo search will show that Griggs' songs appear on country music playlists for radio stations all across the country. I would also suggest that it is unneccessary to take this discusion and debate so personally. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinkrivers_93aa.html" title="User:Justinkrivers">Justinkrivers</a> 06:24, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem with saying that this subject doesn't deserve an article simply because he hasn't done enough in your opinion to merit one is that since he is an artist it is impossible to gauge what merits his work will have to future critics. If Wikipedia existed in the 1860's and someone tried to post an article on Emily Dickinson, it could be deleted for the same reasons you are offering now. Because this man is an artist and because he is still living, and therefore able to offer future works, he deserves an article so that future researchers have a starting point.Skylark29 10:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Skylark29 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skylark29_0dda.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skylark29">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small> <small>Indeed, this was his first edit. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 11:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> on both accounts. The last time SRB2 was due up for AFD (four months ago or so) it was proven that the article needed some work, but was <i>far</i> from advertising. Googling "Sonic Robo-Blast 2" turns up 30,000 results, and several people have worked towards adding more information to the article to help prove it's notability (mentions in magazines, for example). Sonic: Time Attacked I'll give you - 470 results on Google. But I really like the fangame, and the website for it isn't even up anymore - how does that even constitute advertising if there's essentially nothing to advertise? Time Attacked is one of my favorite fangames, and, well, that's good enough for me. Here's a thought: If you're so worried about "peacock claims" (<i>man</i> I hate Wikipedia Slang), edit the article to remove them rather than jumping on the delete button. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 09:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

A couple fleeting mentions in single issues of publications don't exactly constitute notability in my view—neither do your subjective views of the game.

<li><b>Comment</b> Holy crap, you guys are like an inconsiderate, rabid pack of wolves! At the very least, keep SRB2. What might not seem notable to you might be very notable to somebody else, and the article has quite a bit of information on it. Besides, it's worth noting that Gamesmaster is actually a fairly popular gaming magazine in the UK, if I recall properly. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 21:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Bullshit. What's notable to you is might not be very notable to me. You think stuff about Wrestling is notable, so much so that you seem to support there being seperate articles dedicated to various <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Saturday_Night%27s_Main_Event_results_f165.html" title="WWE Saturday Night's Main Event results">WWE events and outcomes</a>.

<li>BlazeHedgehog is succinct at the very least. The assertion "Notability is not a [sic] opinion, something is either notable or its not," is so far off the radar that it touches the edge of psychopathology. Who would make such a self-centered statement except for a mind that exists in a universe of one or someone trolling for a bit of agro? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BS yourself. You may not like wrestling, but articles like SNNE ARE notable. I couldn't care less about things like Dora the Explorer, but they are notable. These fan games also fail <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 22:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TJ Spyke not only seems to have missed BlazeHedgehog's point but is now actually making Blaze's point and refuting the one TJ made earlier. I strongly suspect mere trolling for the sake of starting a heated exchange. Notability is in the mind of the beholder unlike the lunacy about absolutes asserted here. Some people need to review what they write before entrying the fray in such a defenseless state--if their goal is to contribute and not subvert the process of discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again. Gamesmaster isn't exactly a small, trivial publication publication. To quote it's <a href="../../../g/a/m/GamesMaster_%28magazine%29_4932.html" title="GamesMaster (magazine)">Wikipedia article</a>; "GamesMaster is the biggest selling multi-format video games magazine in the United Kingdom, even outselling its critically acclaimed rival Edge." So the largest videogame magazine in the UK isn't notable enough? Might as well get rid of it's Wikipedia article, then, eh? And get rid of articles like Metroid Prime 2D, and, well, every other game featured in that Gamesmaster article (most, if not all of which, have Wikipedia articles, and, no doubt, Gamesmaster found them <i>through</i> Wikipedia). Infact, let's torch all homebrew software completely! I mean, have you ever seen <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_Story_6d82.html" title="Cave Story">Cave Story</a> printed in a magazine? I haven't! Get rid of it! It's full of weasel words! I mean, "the game has received praise from gamers worldwide."?

<li>You might want to try reading <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, trivial mentions don't count. 1 sentence and a small picture is a trivial reference. Also, pointing out another article that shouldn't exist is NOT justification to keep another that doesn't.

<li>But I won't nominate it because I know it's notable. You see, I was being facetious. If I nominated it for deletion? A million Cave Story fans would come forth and smack me down, telling me "No, we like this game and it's notable". I'm sure SRB2 fans would likely do the same if they knew it was up for deletion, but guess what? I can't tell them otherwise I'll get accused of sock puppeting or whatever the hell it is you guys call it.

<li>I'd take on a million Cave Story or Halo Zero fans if I didn't already know about the substantial coverage of those games in game publications.

<li>I just find it confusing that, here at Wikipedia, whether an article like this gets kept or deleted depends soley on which side of the bed you guys woke up on that particular day.

<li><b>Comment</b> First off, I'll save the zealots the time in stating that this is a single-purpose account and I am involved with the project. Honestly, I don't give a damn whether or not there is an article or not, but it just doesn't make sense in the internet age to immediately delete anything that doesn't have a specific licensed publisher for a console. I've met two random freshmen that came onto my college campus that knew about the game, one even playing it frequently, without me or any of my friends mentioning it. If the word of mouth is that strong, I simply do not see how it isn't notable, despite not being all the rage at Gamestop in bringing in the pre-orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have said before, the article sucks. It keeps getting more and more fancruft added onto it every week, it seems, and its obviously subpar in terms of writing and setup. However, personally I'd consider that true on many articles about official parts of the Sonic series, and even worse, in many parts of the encyclopedia in general. Look at the article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sonic_452d.html" title="Super Sonic">Super Sonic</a>. There's clearly an excessive amount of fancruft with no citations or any standard Wikipedia policy. I agree that passing mention in magazines is not assertion of notability, and neither is decent results on the Google test, however, if the main thing that decides whether or not something is notable at this point is whether a company made it or not, then Wikipedia has seriously dropped from its ideals. Whatever happened to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a> and old fashioned common sense? If policy is the only reason this article should be deleted, feel free, but please make sure to delete the rest of the fancruft swarming around the wiki, starting with the deletion of the articles on practically every video game character, feature, and backstory on here. They're clearly fancruft with no assertion of notability. I don't care if this article lives or dies as long as I see some consistency around here. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 09:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I'll just respond to the last part. Believe me, we are trying. But as you can see here, it's not as simple as just nominating something. The fancruft is getting out of hand, and there a dedicated few patrolling trying to scrub non-encyclopedic content from good articles, but remember that pretty much everytime someone removes some cruft, two more people add some to other articles, making it an uphill struggle. Don't take this personally, as it's neither an attack on you or this game, it's about whether or not the article conforms to Wikipedia polcies, and some people think it does and others think it doesn't. The problem is that people seem to get hung up on one particular policy and ignore the fact an article fails on other issues besides that. (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a good example of one that people focus on exclusively whilst ignoring other issues.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Honestly, I don't see why there is so much enforcement of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> to begin with. Obvious vanity needs to die, but simply because something isn't the biggest thing in the world shouldn't nullify as it as important enough for an article. The real incredibly problematic part of notability, especially with web content, is how incredibly difficult it is for even genuinely notable internet material to find legitimate press coverage, especially in areas that simply aren't as gigantic as others. Unless something is some kind of gigantic runaway hit such as <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> or another similar phenominon and gets tons of press, I simply have no idea where I'd look to find sources. For instance, I have no idea where I'd find some press coverage, of, say, <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8-Bit Theater</a>, but I wouldn't imagine going and trying to delete it for notability, because it's clearly popular and well-known in many circles, but even it only has the official website and forums linked as sources. The issue is that I'm sure someone who doesn't read webcomics at all could easily come and find said article and try to delete it as vanity/fancruft because they simply aren't familiar with it themselves, despite being a very well-known website. Where would one draw the line between notable and non-notable on internet projects/websites? The entire system seems incredibly vague here, and it's obviously clear that even Wikipedia doesn't know, as something that was a complete blowout as notable one AfD is now a nearly complete blowout in the opposite direction, when honestly practically nothing has changed in terms of the article content (and in fact, I'd say it's vastly improved in structure since the first time it was put up on AfD). There really needs to be some kind of tangible way to determine what is notable and what is not that isn't based on anyone's opinion, and as far as I'm aware, that simply doesn't exist. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 05:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Why would this page be deleted, when there are far less worthy things included in Wikipedia. Granted, this is the type of thing that wouldn't make it into Britannica, <b>but isn't that the point?</b> 206.165.137.194 02:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep, renominate separately</b> I disagree with the lumping of these two articles together, which is totally non-standard; this is going the wrong about deleting two separate articles.

<li>Since that AfD in April 2005, we've gotten much, much, <i>much</i> more serious about requiring quality references from reliable sources. Plenty of articles from that era got kept as "interesting" or "cool" that would never pass muster today. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but meanwhile, I'm worried that "has no reliable sources" is used as a catch-all "<i>Hsssh!</i> ...and I've got more <i>hssssh</i> where it came from" kind of excuse for deleting content. Lack of sources is <i>foremost</i> a cleanup criterion, not deletion criterion. I <i>hate</i> it when people bring articles to AfD when it's obvious that articles have at least a good <i>possibility</i> of getting sources. Everyone gets terribly excited when they see "hey, if it's unsourced, you can delete it"; No one gets excited when they see "anyone can and should be constructive and add sources when they doubt the article's statements". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

That's like saying, for example, if a music is inspired by a popular artist, it would only be of interest to fans of that artist. Or saying "This jazz album is up for deletion, since it would only be of interest to people who want to hear jazz." In short, I see no reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">.V.</a> 22:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see much of an argument to actually "keep" (let alone "strong keep") the articles there, nor an assertion of the notability of the content, just a disagreement that fan fiction is only of interest to fans, which is pretty well established on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep, add headers requesting improvement.</b> You could always just place headers requesting sources and/or establishment of notability, rather than impulsively moving for deletion. Primary sources are in fact available. I'm mildly deletionist myself in my view of Wikipedia, as I see a lot of fancruft added all the time, but have also respected the fact that notable articles which are either stubs or do not contain the necessary sourcing typical of top articles have been kept with the intention of improving them, rather than deleting them as a knee-jerk response. I've struck through my earlier comments, specifically because of <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>'s comments of <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> itself not meeting notability guidelines.</li>

<li>If you Google "OverClocked ReMix" (with quotes), there are about 186,000 results, and "OC ReMix" (the common abbreviation for the site used in its music tags) lists 135,000 results. Google the word remix, and OverClocked ReMix is the second result out of 76,300,000 behind Remix Magazine. However, keep in mind <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Validity_of_the_Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Google is not a be-all-end-all litmus test</a> (<i>"In some cases, articles have been kept with Google hit counts as low as 15 and some claim that this undermines the validity of the Google test in its entirety. The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability. It is not and should never be considered definitive"</i>). That is specifically why search engine tests are not a factor in Web notability guidelines.</li>
<li>While merely a sub-culture (amateur video game music arrangements), OverClocked ReMix is the most popular and influential site related to that culture, with the largest collection of video game music arrangements on the internet. Especially given the additional information below, I would argue that it is a viable instance of genuinely notable fan culture rather than non-notable.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Industry_Recognition" class="external text" title="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Industry_Recognition" rel="nofollow">Support from video game industry professionals</a> - OverClocked ReMix has received praise and support from several notable musicians/professionals in the video games industry not limited to Video Games Live co-creator <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Tallarico_08dd.html" title="Tommy Tallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a>, Secret of Evermore composer <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Soule_b771.html" title="Jeremy Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> (who has contributed an arrangement to the site), Doom lead designer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romero_710b.html" title="John Romero">John Romero</a>, Donkey Kong Country series composer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wise_56ac.html" title="David Wise">David Wise</a>, 7th Guest composer <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fat_Man_6016.html" title="The Fat Man">The Fat Man</a> (who has contributed 2 arrangements to the site), and Secret of Mana composer <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroki_Kikuta_bbe4.html" title="Hiroki Kikuta">Hiroki Kikuta</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Press" class="external text" title="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Press" rel="nofollow">OverClocked ReMix press clippings</a> - I'd argue that coverage from <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">Salon</a>, <a href="../../../g/4/_/G4_%28TV_channel%29_6dd5.html" title="G4 (TV channel)">G4</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/c/TechTV_35ea.html" title="TechTV">TechTV</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_de96.html" title="Electronic Gaming Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>, <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, and <a href="../../../m/p/3/MP3.com_de19.html" title="MP3.com">MP3.com</a> are sufficient in terms of point #1 of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Web notability criteria</a>.</li>
<li>In terms of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Others" title="WP:MUSIC">Music notability criteria</a>, I believe OverClocked ReMix satisfies the first and fifth bullet points of the "Others" section in regards to the video game music arrangement genre, which is outside mass media traditions: <i>"Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre"</i> and <i>"Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture"</i> (in this case, magazines, television, and leading websites devoted to video games [Electronic Gaming Monthly, <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Informer_aab7.html" title="Game Informer">Game Informer</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge_%28magazine%29.html" title="Edge (magazine)">Edge</a>], technology [G4techTV], and online music [MP3.com], respectively). Though it's easy to do and looks convincing I'm sure, there's no excuse for <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> flippantly linking to the same music notability page in the deletion nom if a proper explanation isn't given as to why the albums would fail the linked criteria.</li>
<li>By extension, my conclusion is that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Albums" title="WP:MUSIC">since the music entity is notable, the albums created by it are notable</a>. As noted in the Albums section of the music notability guidelines, it is viewed by some as a controversial extrapolation, but one that I support in this case (and all other cases).</li>

<p>If the album articles are deleted and/or OverClocked ReMix is nomimated for deletion, I will have the decision taken up at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Deletion review</a>. I believe that the nominating admin is assuming bad faith on both the group's notability and the potential verifiability of the information listed in these articles, that the group's notability is legitimate thereby permitting the existence of these articles, and that the procedural action being taken should be to label the articles as needing improvement rather than deletion. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 21:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Pre-emptively threatening to take something to DRV is not, imho, terribly appropriate. Cross that bridge if-and-when. And instead of "Keep, add headers requesting improvement", how about "Keep, I created / love / cherish these articles and I'll be happy to add the citations, notable press coverage and whatever else needs to be done to demonstrably bring these articles in line with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>"?

<li>I definitely felt your specific observations were in good faith, <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a>, and didn't mean to imply otherwise. My issue is with the nomination and most of the conclusions drawn in the discussion being in bad faith, particularly the intention to AfD <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a>'s article. Which is why I kept it in mind to use 'if' regarding deletion review. Since it seems not many here are even familiar with OverClocked ReMix or video game music sub-culture, it would have been more appropriate to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Nomination" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">discuss questions of notability in the appropriate Talk pages first</a>. The articles can be improved, I agree. My end of the discussion aims to clarify that the subject matter of the articles is notable enough where the articles should be flagged to be improved by attaching <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_resources_f8d0.html#Verifiability_and_sources" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup resources">proper cleanup headers</a>. With my points stated, that's now left for others to decide. Contrary to your thinking, however, if the AfD discussion demonstrates that these topics pass the bar, the articles should be left to be expanded upon and better formatted. You're criticizing the nommed articles for not demonstrating notability enough, and that's fine. But there's no sense in taking any article on a potentially notable topic, especially if the attempt to clarify notability is in this discussion, and deleting it because it's not <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_perfect_article.html" title="The perfect article">the perfect article</a>. If an AfD established notability despite it not yet being established in the article, I find it hard to believe that the resolution would be to delete rather than to keep and subsequently establish notability within the article as well. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 04:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One does not have to be familiar with a topic to nominate it for deletion. Such things need to be looked at thought clear eyes, not the rose colored glasses of fans of a website or forum. The article currently reads like a press release and the usual "forum drivel" that tends to be amassed in articles about websites. i.e. "The site's mission statement explains how its members seek to prove that such music "is not disposable or merely just background, but is as intricate, innovative, and lasting as any other form...." and "Site-related sub-forums include Reviews, where members can discuss ReMixes posted to the site, ReQuests, where members can request particular pieces to be arranged, Judges Decisions, where the Judges Panel posts their decisions on submitted arrangements, and Site Projects, where members organize community projects and collaborative efforts that benefit the site." The nature of an internet forum is certainly not encyclopedic.... "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance</a>" I researched the topic prior to mentioning that I should nominate it for AFD. I always do a through search of the <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis_Nexis_3127.html" title="Lexis Nexis">Lexis Nexis</a> newspaper and magazine databases for multiple countries and regions of the United States. I found one "trivial mention". I also went through the citation list that you provided, most of them are blogs and do not meet the criteria listed in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Your google results are also bloated: "Results 361 - 361 of about 121,000 for "OverClocked ReMix" -Wikipedia . (0.15 seconds)" and "Results 271 - 277 of about 113,000 for "OC ReMix" -Wikipedia . (0.17 seconds)". This means that there are a few internet sites which mention the OC Remix multiple times. i.e. forums, blogs, and the like. If the article passes notability by citation, it's only by relaxing the interpretation of the reliable source guidelines to include blog entries. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:34, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or failing that <b>Merge</b> into one article ("OverClocked ReMix album projects" or like), or back to OverClocked ReMix article, with some trimming. Some of these have gotten media mentions (Slashdot articles for Kong in Concert, Relics of the Chozo (I think) and The Dark Side of Phobos, at least), so we're not exactly talking of an insignificant phenomenon here; OCRemix is famous among game music fans, and their projects do attract attention within the community. Like I imply above, we should rather try to clean these up and add references where needed; we're clearly not talking of an utterly marginalised phenomenon here and I believe the information could survive <i>somewhere</i>. I agree that these are not "real" albums and as such it's debatable whether or not they need articles of their own - some of these just <i>don't</i>, like RoFL - but merging them could be right in any case. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, add headers requesting improvement</b> or <b>Merge</b> I agree with Wwwwolf and Liontamer.

<li><b>Keep</b> One shouldn't assume that all the links on a page are from templates at the bottom. That's a joke. Could it be that those very links were removed from the main article because they simply reappeared in the navigation box at the bottom. Yes, because the Manual of Style stipulates that we shouldn't replicate links in a see also section if they appear else where. Don't kill the article for following good practice! Furthermore, have you actually downloaded the music for yourself? It is free after all, the community is not gaining anything for having it up here, which I believe the whole "not a directory" thing was about in the first place. Lastly, Hedgehog Heaven has been referenced by IGN in an article. What more reliable sources do you want? Articles served up on a silver platter?

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Alexa ranking of 646 580. Was not the subject of multiple non-trivial published works (sorry, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a>, but a brief mention in a single magazine article does not make it the subject of the article. Neither does occurrence in a list of links on a website.) As for the awards, that argument would be applicable if we were discussing deletion of Brother Jerome or Bildgesmythe, but we're not. Finally, this may be a vanity article, as <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a>'s only Wikipedia contribution at the time of this AfD was the creation of this article, and he is currently the only one opposing its deletion. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 06:56, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would like to stress that I did not make a keep recommendation, since I realise that this would be inappropriate for the article's author. I regard it however as legitimate to argue in favour of the article. I may also repeat that PF-based bots relie on PF's AI engine. Roughly speaking, their intelligence is provided by PF. It would be pretty strange to have articles about certain bots without an article about the AI engine behind them. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 07:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Possibly. But since the PF bots in question seemingly aren't notable enough to have their own articles, what makes you think that the engine behind the PF bots is? —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 08:00, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who said that Brother Jerome and Bildgesmythe aren't notable enough to have their own articles? They got silver and bronze at the ChatterBox challenge in 2006. Are you suggesting that I add articles devoted to them? I may well do it, but that would not make much sense without an article about the AI engine that they share and about the development model that spawned them. -- <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 08:11, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one said that. I was presuming their non-notability on the basis of their absence from Wikipedia. Of course, if you want some more rigorous evidence, go ahead and create the articles and see if they survive. At any rate, your using this argument in support of retaing the Personality Forge article is still flawed; it's entirely possible for an entity but not its ancestors to be notable. That's why, for example, there is an article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Lem_1bd3.html" title="Stanislaw Lem">Stanislaw Lem</a> but not on his father Samuel Lem. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 08:38, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's you interpetation which I dismiss.

<li>Thanky ou for clarifying, however after your past antics, I cannot assume you added it there in good faith. The spirit of AGF is not to be blind, but to assume at first the person is making a good effort, after your last stunt that presumption is gone. That is why I stated what I did, I believe Gabriel makes a good point and I do not wish to see an article get deleted simply because you are bitter, as per your past comments on the group you now are claiming you are attempting to contribute to.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I looked at the NY Times article you mentioned. They say the "Clinton Chronicles" is " a hodgepodge of sometimes-crazed charges that are thrown off with an air of knowingness but little documentation." Bill Duncan, who is shown in it , says "It was used by people for purely political purposes." The article refers to the people who made the film as "the Clinton crazies." Nothing in the article lends credence to the absurd and libelous claims made in the film. The Washington Post article calls it a "bizarre and unsubstantiated documentary." Both articles , therefore, argue for the deletion of the article as a gross violation of WP:BLP.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 05:14, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

This isn't really the proper place to discuss a user disputes, and even trollish nominations occasionally accidentally hit something. This isn't the first time I've seen that happen, and it likely won't be the last. Therefore, pending <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to document the notability of this, I have to say <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> And protect against creating it again. "Largely discredited account of circumstantial evidence and coincidence," per Tbeatty, 18:07, 25 March 2006, who created the article. It accuses a living person of murders and violates WP:BLP.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what you mean. LK and AS are non-notable and deletable as such. I believe I accurately described the video as a "largely discredited account." What you seem to be comparing is the "truth" of these articles rather than their notability. If we simply look at truth, LK was not killed, no votes are stolen by electronic voting machines and Bill Clinton didn't kill anyone. But if we talk about simple notablility, the publci spat between Joe Scarborough and Michael Moore is notable (LK is not). The Black Box Voting org and movement is notable, Andy Stephenson is not. Clinton Chronicles is notable, the producers/directors/accusers are not. If we treat CC like the 9/11 conspiracy articles, we could spawn off 10s or hundreds of articles on anyone who has commented or contributed to this video. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 08:09, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> wrote "It accuses a living person of murders and violates WP:BLP." The <i>video</i> accuses living people of murder, but the <i>article</i> does not.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> "National attention"? I missed that 15 minutes. But consider this. According to the article she was under 18 when convicted. This means she would have been tried in a Youth Court. Restrictions on reporting from Youth Courts mean that the press may not report details including the name of a juvenile who is a defendant or witness in any proceedings before the youth court or any other details including the printing of a photograph which would identify him or her. (Information from the Magistrates' Court Guide). So this article is either a lie or a criminal offence. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Speaking as a gaijin living in Tokyo five years now, I heard about it when I first arrived and I even rode on it last year. I've talked to a number of gaijin who have either heard about it, known someone who has ridden it, or have ridden it themselves. It's quite an established bit of Tokyo lore. Though the article says it started in the early 90s, the event may very well come back some years before that so it's a fairly well established event. The Ohmynews article in the link is not a blog, by the way, and I would think the pictures and video show that the event does indeed exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by on 87.75.6.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__on_87.75.6.127_87e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/ on 87.75.6.127">contribs</a>) 23:28, October 25, 2006.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why exactly is this article in debate for deletion? It is an event and a phenomenom that has been held almost every year for well over a decade. As the reporter for the original article (not Blog, mind you) linked from OhMyNews - not the wiki article - I can assure you that said event exists as I have witnessed and participated in it and later reported on it for OhMynews. Like the above UK poster who lives in Japan (why the identity of the ISP address became a minor issue is beyond me to fathom unless certain people don't beleive in travel anymore than they do in Yamanote halloween trains), I have lived in Tokyo for almost 5 years. While I didn't hear about it the moment I arrived (I arrived in mid-December), I did hear about it my first Halloween here and every year after until 2005 when I witnessed it myself. Before and after that event I spoke to a number of people to gather info on the background of the event and learned that the event had been held semi-annually for well over 10 years. I recently got an email on my Ohmynews account from someone who said they rode the Halloween Train in 1992. They had heard from participants that the tradition had started sometime ago before that - so the event could almost be close to 20 years old for all we know. For those living in Tokyo who haven't heard of this event, I suggest you get out more. Most people I know have heard of the event, participated in it, or know friends who have. In short - the Yamanote Halloween Train DOES exist and debates to contrary are ridiculous seeming to reveal more a biased prudishness to the antics of foreigners (and Japanese) on the Yamanote rather than a legit concern about the integrity of Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Crossfire (<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrossfire_96be.html" title="User talk:Crossfire">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crossfire_e69e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crossfire">contribs</a>)  at 13:45, October 27, 2006.

<li>Oh, brand new person? What are you babbling about Calton? Keep your remarks confined to the article in question and let go of your smarmy remarks that do little to further this (and I use the term lightly) debate. As to your question, how is OhMyNews not a blog, it is a citzen journalist newspaper. People report on events and the like then submit to OhMyNews who decide to publish their article or not. There is an editorial process. It's not a print up anything under the sun. Now my question - what have you got against this wiki article exactly? The event exists and has existed for over a decade and will continue to exist. As for the Ohmynews article, I reported it by speaking to a number of people before and after witnessing and participated in it myself. What I gave was an eyewitness account accompanied with photos and videos. You have yet to present a case for deletion other than your blind refusal to accept the reality of a proven event.

I can't see how two self-appointed expert gaijin can shoot down this article based on their inability to discover any "verifiable" evidence online.

<p><b>Keep</b> - yes, 'Exploding Guy' it was held last night and the difference from any other night would be all the people in Halloween costume and the general party atmosphere. If your only objection to this entry is that it is unverfiable, I can tell it does exist and I was there (along with a LOT of other gaijin). Perhaps you should have popped along and seen it for yourself. I apologise if I haven't followed the correct procedure for logging this but I have never before felt the need to comment on an entry and don't have a login and also thought this way my IP shows and you can at least verify that I am in Japan.

<li><b>Keep</b> I fail to see any reason for deleting this, anyway if the article is deleted but the event continues to take place every year then wont someone eventually just re-create this article? Look around, there are a lot of 'cultural' articles of WiKi that would never make it into a normal encyclopedia. I for one see these articles as a good thing, wikipedia is now a one-stop-shop for information and part of that success is because of it's huge store of 'limited interest group' articles like this one. Anyway thats my two cents... or yen.</li>

<p>(Breaking out the old-school deletion reasons) this is an idiosyncratic non-topic. This isn't a series; it's two games, one of which isn't even released yet. There's no content here; just some release dates, a brief lead, and a GameFAQs-esque list of characters appearing in these games.</p>
<p>Additionally, if this article is deleted, the associated {{Mario Soccer series}} should also be deleted. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 11:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I realize you're a bit new to Wikipedia, but not ever AFD is about notability. I'm not arguing that these "series" aren't notable; I'm arguing that they don't exist. They're two games long, and one of them has only one game released and the other is a single game and its enhanced remake. They're not series in the traditional sense, and their articles have no useful content at all. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:06, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you can argue over policies and guidelines all you like, but your managing to completely avoid the fact that this article fails nearly any guideline or policy you care to name. It since your the only person to vote to keep it (which is raises questions in my head) it WILL be deleted. And as for not afreeing with NN and BOE, all I can say is tough. They are there for a reason. I think the article should be deleted, you don't. Therefore the responsibility is yours to provide evidence for why this article should be allowed to remain. And I haven't seen anything so far. All you've done is acted pedantic over whether things are policies or guidelines, then said you don't really agree with the policies.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still having trouble ascertaining how notability is judged here, but it seems like significant mainstream attention is now required for all forms of entertainment, and while I sort of understand this, webcomics -- and comic artists in general -- often have trouble getting such sources to recognize them, even if they've done enought to warrant it. Artists will frequently have to settle for doing good things without becoming media darlings. That being said, Girly's a culmination of a lot of years of skill building and ballbreaking endurance in the field of comics, and I honestly don't know if it's actually noteworthy, or if it just feels noteworthy to me due to all the work it took to get here. In any case, it should probably be noted, in case this gets deleted, that this is certainly not a fly-by-night fancomic; it has over 15000 readers and I'm one of the few web artists making a living solely from his comic work. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 22:57, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Comic artists in general? I disagree; with effort, creativity and luck, you can be recognized by mainstream book press; <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Luen_Yang_724a.html" title="Gene Luen Yang">Gene Luen Yang</a> (who doesn't have an article yet)'s <i>American Born Chinese</i> was nominated for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Book_Award_03c8.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a>, one of the highest literary honours in the US. <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazu_Kibuishi_aaac.html" title="Kazu Kibuishi">Kazu Kibuishi</a> et al's <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_%28comic%29.html" title="Flight (comic)">Flight</a> is published by Ballatine Books, a mainstream publisher, and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Smith_%28cartoonist%29_1bab.html" title="Jeff Smith (cartoonist)">Jeff Smith</a>'s <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_%28comics%29.html" title="Bone (comics)">Bone</a> is published by Scholastic. Does it take skill, talent and luck? Sure. But writers have to go through the same process, and it's just as hard. I don't see how web publishing makes a comic more notable than other self-published efforts, so they should go through the same process (and I realize that you may see this as harsh. I didn't intend this.) We currently have some leniency for online sources (to address your concern that that mainstream press doesn't report on webcomics, even though it does; Megatokyo, When I Am King, Derek Kirk Kim's Same Difference have all been reported on), but they should be recognized as reliable (Gamespot can be a source for games; some comics news sites are used for comics). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 02:56, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, but I've been doing comics long enough to know about the mainstream comics and critical darlings. I hear the names you said repeated often enough and it's always the same names, and I stand by my opinion that the media's focus is extremely narrow. I know it's easy to dismiss this, saying I just feel this way because my own comic doesn't get the attention I feel it deserves, and I completely understand this. I stand by this conviction anyway. I don't see other decidedly notable comics like Scary Go Round and Sam &amp; Fuzzy get talked about much either. Incidentally, this AfD really should get linked to WikiProject:Webcomics, or is that project totally dead now?

<li>I see what you're saying and even agree up to a point, but surely you understand that what the media chooses to cover or not cover is not our fault nor is it within our control. As an encylopedia, all we can do is present verifiable facts culled from reliable sources. It's not an encyclopedia's job to "stand up for the little guy" or give a platform for those who want to get the word out about their cartoons. The alternative is far worse: imagine if our policy read as follows: "<i>Articles on topics within the arts and sciences must be fully referenced using reliable sources, except for webcomics where it's enough to find five people who think your strip kicks ass.</i>" Simply put, if an article about a congressional scandal needs reliable sources, then so does an article on a webcomic. We can't make exceptions. However, don't forget, the reliable-sources policy isn't there primarily to make it tough for cartoonists, it also protects cartoonists (and everyone else) from innacurate and unsourced claims. To remove it would be a libel suit (or two, or thousands) waiting to happen. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I do commend you for having the restraint to not edit the article heavily due to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. I, however, disagree with "mainstream" - Gene Yang, Derek Kirk Kim, and Kazu Kibuishi are hardly "mainstream", and they're not even in the "main webcomic culture" (to me that seems to be comprised of Keenspot and its ilk, and Megatokyo + Penny Arcade). <a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=64&amp;page=2" class="external text" title="http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=64&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a bit of an account of when Derek won his triple crown of comics awards and what that meant for the webcomics community (at least in the opinion of the commentators). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 22:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yang, Kim, Kibushi aren't mainstream, but they're certainly critical darlings, and yes, critics do talk about these same artists over and over. Girly's not exactly a "little guy", as I repeat, it has over 15000 readers. I don't know exactly how many other webcomics can claim this, but it's certainly a small percentage of the tens of thousands of webcomics out there. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 20:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wonderful detail in the article; I wish that editors could put that kind of loving attention into notable articles. The comic was just published in June.

The founding members of this station do meet the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> guidelines and I still contest that those interested in internet radio would have an interest in knowing about this collaboration on an informational level. Additionally, there is no promotion of the station in this article. It states mere facts. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInternetfignewton_4808.html" title="User:Internetfignewton">Internetfignewton</a> 15:03, 24 October 2006

<dd>It is <i>because</i> its a new station and new network that it <i>doesn't</i> yet deserve its own entry!

<dd>The point is that Fusion &amp; MakRadio are famous and the collaboration between these two entities is noteworthy. If Google would merge with AOL to form a new company, that new company would be *notable* enough for Wikipedia. Fusion and MakRadio are no Google or AOL I understand, however, to the internet radio community and those interested in internet radio they are, thus making it a worth while entry. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInternetfignewton_4808.html" title="User:Internetfignewton">Internetfignewton</a> 17:17, 30 October 2006</dd>

<li>A collaboration may be noteworthy or newsworthy, but that does not necessarily warrant an article in an encyclopedia. It may be important in the Internet Radio community, but "PopFusion Radio" only garners 6 google hits -- one is the site's homepage, two are at Wikipedia, two are at fusionchicago.com (the parent), and that leaves only one unaffiliated hit <a href="http://www.penguinradio.com/add/editstatics.php?StationID=5241" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.penguinradio.com/add/editstatics.php?StationID=5241" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> at a database where you can "add your radio station to our database".

<p><b>Comment</b> Please do not remove non-nonsense text from the discussed articles while the vote is going. May be useful for research.

<li><b>keep</b>. The autor of a dozen books with 22 reprints by <b>notable</b> publishing houses, meaning that the books do sell, unlike various e-printing and self-publishing, and therefore are used by people, hence notability. The article is surprizingly small to call it a "vanity page". I'd say it is a "modesty page". Also, just a little research would have shown <a href="http://www.automotive-technology.co.uk/software/software.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.automotive-technology.co.uk/software/software.htm" rel="nofollow">some third party recognition, too</a> for his shareware. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 17:58, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wrong. You (all of you) completely deleted a significant piece information about the person, namely his software projects, as well as a 3-rd party link to confirm the info. I can explain this only by the dedsire to bend your POV that the person is nonnotable. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 19:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The link is not 3rd-party. It is Denton's own website. There is already discussion of how it fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> on the article's talk page. Therefore the reliability and verifiability of the awards listed on the site are suspect without independent sourcing, like the award sites' own statements of recognition for the software. I am trying to discuss this issue on the article's talk page (as I created a section there to discuss the removed text when I removed it..not just deleting it), but nobody seems interested in discussing it there. There is a true explanation, which is my desire to see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> withheld, not bending anything to my PoV. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:52, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a self promoting article. Piggy bankrupt when typed into Google brings up the blog as the first result. In the UK Mark Davis is well known and has spoken about his personal bankruptcy a number of times in the press. I feel that having a wiki page can provide background information on him that may not be available on the blog or on other web pages. (posted by 2006 Bill4793611 (Talk | contribs) 16:32, 24 October )

<li>Assuming for the moment you're correct about his fame in the UK, it still needs to be established in the article using independent, verifiable sources. Anybody can create their own blog and claim to be famous. The hard part is actually being famous enough that you are talked about in a major, reliable, independent publication. If the article can be expanded to provide such references, it will go a long way toward verifying notability preventing a possible deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Almost all of the article is a game guide.

<li><b>Keep if independent sources added</b> The article might need to be trimmed or cleaned up, but that's not a reason to delete. Also, a quick search for "Natural Selection" produced many hits, so it's quite possible this is a notable product with a decent size fan base. I suggest an editor with some knowledge of Half-Life mods take a closer look to verify whether or not this is a notable mod expansion, and also check for independent articles or reviews of it from reliable gaming sources. There were a lot of hits, so I wouldn't immediately rule out there being such a source. If no sources are found, though, then delete and only recreate when the information can be independently established. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:56, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a computer game, in a notable series, from a notable publisher. If somebody wants to source the information, the official game guide exists, as well as the game itself (which is a suitable source for simply factual matters from a game, book, or other such work, IMHO) so it's not a real problem for this article, or for any of the other computer game articles. Now that said, I agree that it seems like there are far too many articles on Freespace ships, and perhaps too much detail, but that's a cleanup problem, not an immediate deletion issue. Like I said, I prefer to merge as much as possible, though to where is an open question.

<p>People keep proposing this for speedy deletion or deletion. This has been done enough tiems already to warrant a proper deletion discussion. The band has had 5 releases over 11 years, which is sufficient evidence of notability not only to me, but to other users as well.

<p>WP is not a collection of indiscriminate information (or a list of lists). This is an "article" about notable people who were architects (to some degree) and Masons, but these people already have bio articles where this information rightfully belongs. The talk page for the article also implies that the author is looking for help with research in this area rather than knowing about the topic, and I don't think WP is meant to be a collaborative research group that one person can then take credit for. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> whilst I would take issue with MSJapan's comment that 'the author is looking for help with research', infact I was looking for other contributors to edit and if neccessary completely rewrite the article, I do agree that the article does not fullfill the criteria of a standard entry and it could perhaps molre properly be included within the main entry on Freemasonry. My main reason for writing the article is that there is very little information on Freemasonic architects on the web that is both objective and verifiable, and I do think the subject matter warrants an article or sub-entry at least.<a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamboodragon_15d7.html" title="User:Bamboodragon">bamboodragon</a> 18:16, 29 October 2006</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> Nothing gives the school any notability. Nothing about this school makes it any more special or notable than a run of the mill school. It has no athletic teams of note, no alumni of note, nor anything else that might make it notable. Furthermore, the lack of sources makes it meet the most basic notability criteria of having multipe non-trivial sources. Indeed, the lack of sources makes there be a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem as well, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

As to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concern the issue is simple, with a single source we can't do much of anything that meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, all we really have is existence and not much else. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok.

<dd>Then why does the article only mention an alledged intention to destroy the state of Israel and not the many cases where this has actually happened? I'm sorry, but if I write a new article on the Atomic bomb and only write about Iran's (alledged) intentions to use it against Israel (e.g. "An Atomic Bomb is a powerful weaopn under consrtruction in Iran with the purpose of wiping Israel off the map...")then that article should be promptly deleted.

Google books shows 29 published books using or discussing the term,<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, almost all of which are the use currently discussed by the page, and google scholar show 39 hits,<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=policide&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, about 2/3 of which refer to the term in an engineering context, and 1/3 are the polysci.

If future editors expand one or both sections to the point where the article gets too long, however, that would be a good place to split. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 22:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Utter nonsense. There is nothing political about this AFD. The article in its original version was so nonsensical that it should have been speedily deleted. I did mention POV issues but actually the core of the problem was something else. As I mentioned above, the problem was related to POV issues on other articles about the Mid East.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's like someone starting an article on an in principle legitimate topic like the Atomic bomb for the sole purpose of making propaganda by writing that "an atomic bomb is an extremely power full weapon that the Arabs want develop in order to wipe Israel off the map". Putting such articles on AFD is not an abuse of wiki policies at all. Such articles are sort of "POV Forks" that according to wiki policies can be speedily deleted. In this case the situation was more complicated because the the topic itself in in principle legitimate but it was used as a POV FORK nontheless.</dd>

<li>keep - A usefull introduction and guide to a still growing mod. Planet Halflife thinks this mod is noteable, so does Halflife2.net and many other Halflife2 related websites. How can a mod that has over 3 years of development, very strong gameplay, regular bug fixes and a growing community not deserve one page on Wikipedia about itself?

If you want to actually help save the article (due to this NOT being a vote, as stated at the top), then how about providing a few links to news sotries or awards so people can put them in the article and address the reasons it was nominated. <b>How can a mod that has over 3 years of development, very strong gameplay, regular bug fixes and a growing community not deserve one page on Wikipedia about itself?

These two sources meet this requirement. This nomination for deletion was not about whether the article is a game guide. It was solely based around the "notability" of the subject. If other things about the article need correcting, then the polite way of bringing this to attention is to mention this on the discussion pages. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's Deletion Policy</a>, "Before nominating an article for AFD, please: ... first invite discussion on the talk page if you are at all unsure as to the article's worth. Just because you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it's not notable!" As you can see, Wickethewok nor anyone else has proposed any problems this article needs to correct in the discussion page before it was nominated for deletion. As for questions about my credibility, if you checked the discussion or history of this article, I've contributed to it before and did not create a new account solely to post here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Krenzo, thanks for the links. I have checked them out, but they only confirm my conclusion that this article is a "strong delete". First, they prove to my satisfaction tht the game does exist. Good, but I never doubted that.<br />
However, all we have is <i>two</i> links. One is a half-page story, and the other in German. Sorry, but that small a media footprint does <i>not</i> amount to notability in this field. The news-stands are stashed with mags on gaming, and there apears to be a lot of online coverage too: in that field, I would expect that a notable game would have at least dozens of articles, preferably hundreds or even thousands of readily-accessible coverage. The fact that we have had so much discussion in this AFD but only two references is, to my mind, rather overwhelming proof that whatever its intrinsic merits, 'Empires' is a long, long way from notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please bear in mind that the subject is not a retail product (it's freely downloadable user created content as opposed to a $50 professional developed and published game) and a feature (be it half a page in a foreign magazine) is a very big thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think you're right. People want more information about Empires, and they reasonably assume Wikipedia would have some sort of information on it. Krenzo asked people to voice their opinions, not blindly support the article, not indiscriminately flame. I do not see a problem with a Wikipedia article directing interested individuals to places where they can get more information. For the reason you pointed out, that much of the interest gets funneled through here, I can't help but agree that this article is a keep.<a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLittle_be80.html" title="User:MLittle">MLittle</a> 20:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)MLittle</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It doesn't matter weather its a game or not, wikipedia is a encyclopedia the wikipedia article on encyclopedia's actually states that "An encyclopedia, encyclopaedia or (traditionally) encyclopædia, is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." All this is, is just a record of the history and a rundown of the game and how it works. Which in turn is a part of a particular branch of knowledge. I fail to see how it doesn't belong here. Wikipedia IS an enyclopedia yes but this is a useful article FOR a particular branch of knowledge, I don't know about you but gaming is a particular branch of knowledge last time I checked, or at least a sub branch under technology.

<li><b>Quote</b> Nuka5 says that "what we do not need now is for our Player Manual to be deleted" (which breaches WP:NOT Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, item 4). Nuka5 also says "we are still developing a fan base" (which possibly breaches WP:NOT a social networking site). I have checked the article again, and it seem clear to me that the article is structured like a manual, rather than as a guide to the game's significance and history.<br />
As pointed out elsewhere in this AFD, there are plenty of free wikis available if the gaming community wants to use a wiki to develop their manual, but wikipedia is not the place to do it. I think that this is a useful opportunity for us to stress to gamers that we do mean what we say in WP:NOT: if you try to use wikipedia as a repository for your manual, the article will be deleted. Good luck with the game development, folks, but wikipdia is the wrong place for it. -BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs) 14:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)<b><br /></b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am noticing that, and this is not meant to belittle anyone, despite the large numbers of people claiming that the article does not meet WP:XY, there is very little solid argument that it does not. Claims in favor of the article mention references and other evidence as support. Claims against seem to be just that. Here is a characteristic response: "This is not a notable game, it is not a notable service, it is not an encyclopedic article, and is violates WP:RS amongst others." This is an acceptable claim, but the poster does not offer evidence in proof. If the question of the articles remaining on wikipedia is to be answered "on the merits of the arguments," then I feel that, despite the number of heads mentioning a certain claim, there is no solid argument behind them. The only solid argument used supporting its deletion, as far as I can tell, is in reference to mentions of the article as a game guide- which noone is claiming that it is- and the concerns of BrownHairedGirl on the subject's notability. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a></li>

This is not because i did not say it, but because i believed at the time that this was to try and delete the Empires own wiki, and not just the Wikipedia Page on empires. I also included this note to try and clear that up: nuka5 has edited to cross out this quote as he realises that it was made entirely wrongly, about the Empires own Wiki, not the Empires Wiki Page.<br />
Why twice? because someone... who i deeply suspect is an admin trying to win their arguement, went back and deleted the changes i had made, meaning that it looked again like i had meant the comment. Note to whoever so deleted my changes: i have saved this comment to my PC, and will reprint it if my changes get removed again without so much as a reason. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/u/k/User%7ENuka5_f7a6.html" title="User:Nuka5">Nuka5</a> (<a href="../../../n/u/k/User_talk%7ENuka5_01a8.html" title="User talk:Nuka5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nuka5_fe4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nuka5">contribs</a>) 15:17, 28 October 2006.</small>

<li><b>Another Comment</b> I am still waiting for argument, and evidence, supporting the "delete" position. After having read through WP:NOT again, I am still hard pressed to see how the article violates anything there: The article is not a definition; it is neither origional research, nor opinion, nor discussion; it is neither propoganda, nor self-promotion, nor advertisement (or, at the least, no more so than is necessarily associated with presence on wikipedia); it is not a collection of links; it is neither a personal webpage, nor file storage area, nor dating service; it is not a directory; and it is not an FAQ, guide, or instruction manual. As for the other objection, notability is an inherently subjective requirement which I expect will be evaluated based on the references already mentioned, by whoever posesses the final say in this matter. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a> 17:01, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Falcon, since this discussion started, the article has been edited to make it less of an instruction manual, and to fix some of its other flaws. Howver, the lengthy discussion above contains lots of evidence of how this game modification is non-notable, and that is not a inherently subjective test: the game's fans can find only two mentions of it in the specialist press, only one of which is in English, and that one is rather short. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

If this mod becomes notable outside of the modding community for your particular video game, then you might have a shot at an article. Do schools not teach sentence diagraming anymore?

<dd><b>Comment</b> "...prove to us that it is notable outside of the specialized world of Half-Life mods" you want proof from other fields. I don't know if you realize it, but Empires is a mod for Half-Life 2. By definition it exists in that world specifically, and in computer gaming in general. There are now 8 sources in the article supporting our claim, all of them being computer gaming-related magazines and sites. There is absolutely nothing in <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> suggesting that sources supporting notability must come from outside of the article's area of interest. Otherwise like FalconXVI said, no article would ever be included in Wikipedia since very few things are noticed outside of their area of influence.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Welcome and no pardon is needed for being new. The problem with this article is not the name but rather the content. This is an encyclopedia, not a game guide or a list of software mods. If this mod wins some major awards and gets some press outside of the mod community it might be worthy of inclusion but as it is, it fails for notability, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Arguments based on WP:RS, WP:V, and WP:NOT have been refuted. If you wish, post some solid argument against the refutations. On those issues evidence has been provided, and the burden of proof is then on you to show that those arguments are invalid. Unless, of course, you are so sure of your position that it does not bear argument. As far as WP:NN, numerous references from outside of the Empires mod community have been posted. Are they outside of the Half Life 2 community in general, or the video game community in general? Possibly not but then, they don't need to be. If they did, then, as I already mentioned, nothing would be notable enough to be included, as it would not be notable outside of where it was notable.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> If i recall properly, Counter-Strike, a half-life mod, also means the act against counter-terrorism, yet that article never gets any of this "delete and recreate into that", so why is this article about a mod of half-life 2 nominated for deletion? if it was the Counter-Strike article VALVe themselves would come over to prevent it. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolokiller_9e35.html" title="User:Solokiller">Solokiller</a> 12:10, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You apparently do not recall correctly. <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i> means nothing of the sort. You may perhaps be thinking of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterattack.html" title="Counterattack">Counterattack</a> which is a standard tactical doctrine for defence. Your example is apt however, as <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i> is a well written article about a <b>game</b> that started life as a mod and has gone on to be very notable outside of the modding community. That is just not the case with <i>Empires</i>. If and when <i>Empires</i> gains the notability and worldwide presence of <i>Counter-Strike</i>, then it should have no problem surviving the AfD process. As it stands, this mod is just not well known outside of the modding community the way <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Orchestra_%28game_mod%29_06cc.html" title="Red Orchestra (game mod)">Red Orchestra</a></i> are.

<dd>I point your attention to another Half-Life 2 modification <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystopia_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Dystopia (computer game)">Dystopia_(computer_game)</a>, which by your definition does not deserve its own Wikipedia article. Just like Empires, Dystopia is a mod rather than a stand-alone game, and does not have the "worldwide presence" of commercial titles you cited. P.S. By the way, the "download count" on the Dystopia article is a total number of <i>all</i> relared files including game updates and media such as trailers. Should we use similar criteria, the total number of downloads of Empired mod would be doubled. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a> 21:20, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, selective pointing out of things. You forgot to mention that Dystopia WON an award at the Independant Games Festival recently (as opposed to a mere nomination.)

<li>Ah, selective pointing out of things. You forgot to mention that Dystopia was first nominated for deletion (the first time, not the second time around), on solely the issue of notability.

When the AFD was resolved there was still no mention of third party awards, nor magazines, nor player statistics. In the AFD itself there is no mention of third party awards, nor concrete magazine references, nor concrete player statistics. The result of this first Dystopia AFD was <b>Keep</b>. (As the second Dystopia afd addressed questions of verifiability, it is irrelevant for the notability argument.) It seems that it would be irrational for an article with similar notability status to be deleted. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a> 05:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was talking about the original article before it was nominated for deletion. The one that me being a "meatpuppet" was based on. Yes, I did add the two sources in that section in response to the original push for deletion being lack of notability (measured by appearance in published works). No, I did not violate the Wikipedia guideline "Creating an article about software you have personally developed is strongly discouraged but not forbidden" as I had not created the article. <a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrenzo_e8b1.html" title="User:Krenzo">Krenzo</a> 04:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Krenzo, when it was notes above that your contribution to this discussion was your first contribution on wikipedia, you replied that you <i>did</i> make substantive contributions to the article. The only way to reconcle these statements is that either you ae not being truthful somewhere, or your earlier edits were made anonymously (or under by a sockpuppet).<br />
L3TUC3, I took Nuka5 on credit ([[WP:EGF[]), but Krenzo has just confirmed Nuka5's claim. And to add to the fun, Nuka5 then edited his/her comment above to remove the source of the quote. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 19:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A search for "empires" on Google will yield Empiresmod.com, the web site for this mod, as the #1 result. Wikipedia's article for "empire" appears as the 6th result for the search. It'd be rather backwards to have the article about the #1 result link to the #6 result for those wishing to delete the Empires article and have it redirect to the "empire" article. Also, a Google search of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Empires%22+%22Half-Life+2%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Empires%22+%22Half-Life+2%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"Empires" Half-Life 2"</a> yields 3,540,000 results. <a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrenzo_e8b1.html" title="User:Krenzo">Krenzo</a> 22:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>this section (comment, if you will) shows the outline of the charges against this page, and the reasons why the charges are not legitimate. This</p>
<p><br />
<i>This Wiki should be kept unless it fails one of the following</i> :<br />
-<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a><br />
Rebuttal: much of the information about the game itself is written by the game experts. there is also edited information from the manual (purpose: to describe how the game functions, important to any wiki). This is the equivilant of the makers of a movie writing their own plot summary. Thus, the information there is reliable/verifiable<br />

Rebuttal: Any wiki is likely to generate attention for the subject it is about, and this is one of the reasons that . however, it is certainly (and obviously) not the sole reason for the article, and so is not grounds for it's deletion.<br />
-<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html#Guidelines_for_writing_about_software" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">WP:SOFTWARE</a> Rebuttal: much of the information about the game itself is written by the game experts . there is also edited information from the manual (purpose: to describe how the game functions, important to any wiki). Thus, it is not violating this rule.<br />
-<a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a><br />
Rebuttal: This page <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> states that there is only a conflict of interest when the following occours:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 What is a conflict of interest?</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   * 1.1 Self-promotion
   * 1.2 Autobiography
   * 1.3 Close relationships
   * 1.4 Campaigning
   * 1.5 "Who's Who" directories
   * 1.6 Citing oneself
   * 1.7 Where "vanity" is allowed
</pre>
<p>As none of this occours on the article in question, this is not grounds for deletion. Furthermore, much of the information about the game itself is written by the game experts, and little directly written by the developers for wikipedia.</p>
<p>If any of these fail, then the artical should be edited</p>
<p>The artical should not be kept at all if it is not Notable <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. To know what level of notability is acceptable, we must first look at what wikipedia classes as notable. As wikipedia is unbias, it will be assesing all of it's wikis by the same line, above which level all wikis must be a certain notability. thus, to find the notability required for an article to exist, let us first examine other articles that are undesputedly notable enough for wikipedia, to see what level is acceptable.</p>

<p>These are just some random examples, but if any of these are less notable than the game <i>(<b>not mod</b>, as empires is a total conversion, meaning that all data is new, and only runs off the source engine as many seperate games do)</i> "empires", then the empires wiki should be allowed.</p>

<li>Of course, we can all appreciate <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a>'s statement where she declares that <a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrenzo_e8b1.html" title="User:Krenzo">Krenzo</a> editing an article about his own total conversion mod is a conflict of interest. Now, had he posted information saying something along the lines of "OMG TIHS MOD AER TEH LEET j00 AER NO CAN PLAY ANY OHTER," I could see her point. However, he posted changes relating to the history of the mod, and adding footnotes concerning relevant sources of information. Who would know better the achievements of a child than a proud father? Who would be better to categorize the trophies on the wall than the creator of the mod himself?

<li>Again, not so. Nuka5 is one a nunber of new editors who have mounted a massive campign here, as a result of external canvassing. The capaigning has raised serious doubts about the commitment of the editors involved to following wikipedia guidelines. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is there ANY chance that we can keep this discussion concerning deletion about the article itself, or is one of the main criterion for being an admin on Wikipedia an inability to keep personal issues outside logical debates? As ad-hominem as that last statement of mine is, it is most assuredly a valid question.</li>
<li>On another occasion, <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> goes out on a limb and says, "One is a half-page story, and the other in German." Does she mean to imply that an article in a German-language magazine (Germans not being native English speakers, the primary language the mod exists in) is worth less than one in an English-language magazine?--<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiarbeht_8b6e.html" title="User:Niarbeht">Niarbeht</a> 07:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. This is an English-language encylopedia. If a subject is mostly notable in Germany, that may make it less relevant to an englishlanguage encyclopedia. If thev game mod is reaalaly notable, why is there is so little covergae in the English-language press? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indeed, I don't know of any German documentation for the mod. It may exist, but if it doesn't then an article in a German-language magazine is actually worth a HELL of a lot more than one in an English-language magazine. I doubt most mods get that kind of coverage. But I'm not done yet! I've still got a few quotes to go through! I would bother to post some of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The_Kinslayer</a>'s comments relating to <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a>, but <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a> closed the argument nicely with the statement, "Personal squabbles have no place on Wikipedia." But let's keep on the positive notes, with <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a>'s successful ability to read the obvious red box at the top of the deletion page! "'deletion decisions are made on the merits of the arguments, not by counting heads (or socks).' Forgive me for thinking that this applied to all, rather than simply those who regularly edit wikipedia." Reason voices itself! Indeed, as you go further down the page, we hit a plague of comments concerning "is the only contribution by such-and-such." Are those in power blind to their own rules? Are words of wisdom spoken by a newcomer less important than words of wisdom spoken by your best friend? Words of wisdom are words of wisdom, regardless of who speaks them. --<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiarbeht_8b6e.html" title="User:Niarbeht">Niarbeht</a> 07:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes.

Here we have canvassing, sockpuppetry, meatpuppetry, an undeclared COI: the AFD rules are very pertinent here. It's a great pity that the many newcomers to this discssion did not take time to read wikipdia's guidelines and to explore the reasons for their existence before launching into this sort of diatribe against those who have sought to uphohld them. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, there are good grounds to suspect widespread [[WP:SOCK|sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry] in this AFD. It is important to wikpedia's functioining that this sort of misbehaviour be noted. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Brownhairedgirl? meatpuppetry and sockpuppetry would influence this decision in any way. so far all new users have posted valid comments that add to the discussion. What is your POINT by continuing to mention sockpuppets and meatpuppets? what have ANY of the new members done (with the exception of me, whose incorrections I've done my best to rectify) that is not a problem. Furthermore, COI is only a problem when it's in an article. there's no problem in a group of people defending themselves.</li>

<li>I am sorry to say this, but the behavior of several of the administrators has severely shaken my faith in the validity of much of the content on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am here just to further my thoughts on this absolutely ridiculous AFD, I share these sentiments with <a href="#hahnchen" title="">Falcon</a> and seriously believe that this AFD should be rerun. This page is full of worthless comments that belong to the talk page, just above this comment is an attack on the "validity of much of the content on Wikipedia". Yes, you've had some magazine mentions, but look at the <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" class="external text" title="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" rel="nofollow">stats</a>, it's <i>NOT</i> a popular mod, less players/servers than <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sven_Co-op_1f92.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sven Co-op">Sven Co-op</a> and less player minutes than <a href="../../../b/r/a/BrainBread_2d29.html" title="BrainBread">BrainBread</a>, which probably should have been deleted anyway. How Empires, can in its current state even begin to compete on notability compared to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Front_Line_Force_cc4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Front Line Force">Front Line Force</a> is beyond me. I would have voted keep, had the press mentions turned into player numbers, but this has not happened. Verified download counts are meaningless, if we went by them pretty much every single player half-life map would smash all notability rules. On a positive note, I commend <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">User:Chahk42</a>'s improvements to the article, and even given the incredible ill will the Empires community has generated here, it's why I didn't vote to delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article has been extremly helpful. I have referenced it every day for about a month while I work on my D20 campaign that my players are currently playing. Without this time line of events, it would have been more difficult to piece together from the other articles.

The main Castlevania wiki that links to this shows what year the games came out, but not individual games duration in cronological order with sited start/end dates. This story will expand, and this data is unique. My vote for KEEP is valid.

I'm sure he's a nice person, but the references in this article are not sufficient for me, as I saw no indication of his being notable outside of his immediate local area, and most of the references looked like corporate press releases instead of legitimate press.

<ul>
<li>Elonka, I take - maybe not offence - but certainly disapproval of your reference to "immediate local area" - you might come from a fanatastic large country and think that a British region of some "few" millions of people is only an "immediate local area", but in the real world, i.e. the non-American corporate media bubble, the North East of England is a fairly significant area with proud history and people, and Bob Johnson is one of its most respected broadcasters and a household name to millions. And I say all this as a non-native resident of the region. At the end of the day, I certainly think Johnson qualifies under the "cult" status of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> rules, and furthermore, people who are famous enough to meet the criteria, are probably too notable to be truly worthy of a WP entry anyway, as most people who want to know anything about, say, Madonna, probably would refer to other sources. Wikipedia is a great tool for finding out more esoteric than ubiquitous information - that is my attraction to the whole project - so to delete articles like this would be a real travesty. It is local colour and characters which make the world a great place, and to corporately wipe these people from Wikipedia would be a travesty. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperbfc_cd97.html" title="User:Superbfc">Superbfc</a> 18:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I mean no disrespect to Mr. Johnson, nor to England (where I myself lived for three years, and enjoyed it very much). However, in order to prove a subject's notability, we need more than statements such as "household name". On Wikipedia, a verbal vouching is not sufficient to prove notability -- it is necessary to provide verifiable external references, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. To my knowledge, no such references have been provided, to prove that Mr. Johnson is "famous", or that he has a large enough of a fanbase to qualify for notability. I've looking through news sites, I've Googled, I've been doing my own research, and I just haven't found anything. If you <i>can</i> provide verifiable references which prove his fame, I am open to reviewing them, but until then, my opinion stands. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>lol. How did I know you were going to respond like that ;) Someone doesn't need multiple fansites to be notable; the existence of some geocities or myspace page is a poor second to the reliable sources cited. That link to the forum is sufficient for proving that he's notable enough to be discussed. Check out <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_meteorologists_96e9.html" title="Category:Television meteorologists">Category:Television meteorologists</a> and look at all those articles, such as Storm Field, for instance. Most have no references, or even links, at all. Wikipedia is not paper. There are sufficient references in the article to verify Johnson's existence and that he's been covered by independent sources. He's broadcast regularly to around 2 million viewers for over 15 years. That is notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 21:05, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b>. The article was originally prod-ded (by me) with the reason <i>No need for articles on every Wikipedia spammer or vandal, and there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">outside sources</a> that discuss it</i>. The prod tag was removed with an edit summary of <i>this is a real company with a top 3K Alexa rating - just so happens they spam too</i>. It is in fact a real company, and Google lists over 10K results for the name. The Alexa ranking for city-data.com is just over 2,000. However, this article, as it stands, looks more like a "watch out for this company" warning than a legitimate Wikipedia entry. <font color="DarkGray">...</font> <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiscospinster_5902.html" title="User:Discospinster"><font color="DarkOrange"><b>disco</b></font><font color="DarkOliveGreen"><b>spinster</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDiscospinster_3a6c.html" title="User talk:Discospinster"><b><font color="DarkGray">talk</font></b></a></sub> 20:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Why is this not a legitimate entry? Because it lists bad things the company has done? It also gives an inventory of its holdings, its place of incorporation and contact information. Seems legit to me. Don't think you're promoting a spammer just because you have an article on a company that spams.

<dd>This company (Advameg) uses some pretty underhanded tactics, which were detailed in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like make Mahesh Pathak as an exception, (in my opinion) a mistake that has to be corrected. Just because one mistake had taken place, we need not repeat that. Till today, I am not able to understand as to how <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mahesh_Pathak_653a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mahesh Pathak">Mahesh Pathak</a> is non notable when <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_I._P._Gautam_2b30.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/I. P. Gautam">I.P.Gautam</a> is notable. If properly searched, we can show the press coverage for Mahesh Pathak. We should have some degree of consistency in an encyclopedia. Any how, it is a plain truth that Sanal Kumar is more notable (Sahitya award winner, which per se is a notable fact) than I.P.Gautam who apart from being the commissioner (which means they have a press coverage - coverage for commissioner and not for the individual) has nothing more to add. The opinion at that time was <i>decent press coverage</i>, <i>chief bureaucrat/manager of a city of 5 million people</i>(district collector also manages that amount), <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b> Doctor Bruno </b></font></a></span> 10:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please note that NO ONE who voted for keep in I.P.Gautam can say why the person was notable for reasons <b>apart from being the commissioner</b>. The only reason given was press coverage and managing 50 lakh people. Managing 50 lakh people is something like a Governor's job in many American and European countries and hence the value tilted the vote. But every collector does the same thing here <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b> Doctor Bruno </b></font></a></span> 10:07, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am pretty sure the purpose of the text bolded there is not to say that we should have overlap within a given subject. It's saying that some subjects are best served with catgories, some with lists, and some with series boxes, and Wikipedia as a whole should not universally favor one over the others. Further down on the guideline, it says that lists "may be redundant with categories if not formatted, annotated, or equipped with invisible links," which is true of the present list. (Also, both "Darth Imperius" and "Darth Xio Jade" have been previously deleted and should probably not be recreated as articles.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 05:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, it's pretty clearly stated that <b>These methods should not be considered to be in competition with each other. Rather, they are most effective when used in synergy, each one complementing the other.</b> I agree that lists may be redundant with categories, but the inclusion of red links of articles to be created (even allowing for the removal of deleted articles), means that this list is NOT redundant.

<li>Most of those redlinks are fannon or hoaxes, so they are unencyclopedic in the first place, and don't belong on a list anyway.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. A category is not a list and a list is not a category. The article serves several purposes. One is a list of airports that have had commerical service and not all airports. This is covered in the intro. The other is a source for listing an airport in other articles. Because of location and naming issues, it is not possible to create a guideline that covers this. So this list functions a source for this information. It also serves as a common point on the location of an airport in other destination articles. The order in this article is still being adjusted after several months of discussion as consensus is achieved. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename to List of cities with commercial airline service or List of airports with commercial airline service, probably the former.

<li>No objection to splitting. I would like to wait a while longer to make sure that we have all of the countries in the correct place. This is easier to see and discuss if everything is in one place. I suppose my concern could be addressed with a nav template that lists countries by continent. Maybe that would be the way to go. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 04:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> My only concern with this article is the constant changing of services in the airline industry and that this page would have to be rigorously updated or it would risk inaccuracy. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 17:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Once it's complete, it will need little updating. It's not like new airports are being built all the time, or that lots of airports without commercial service are constantly gaining it. From time to time it will need changes, but upkeep should be easy. Furthermore, it serves as a standard for other destination lists (most airline articles have destination lists now, but many do not follow a standard format). I would support moving it to project space, however. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 19:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've found this list useful, in part because many of these countries do not yet have their own list of airports and the existing country lists don't always indicate which airports have scheduled commercial airline service. We already have airport lists by <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_airports_0979.html" title="Category:Lists of airports">country</a>, by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_IATA_code_f126.html" title="List of airports by IATA code">IATA code</a> and by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_ICAO_code_7878.html" title="List of airports by ICAO code">ICAO code</a>, so why not this one too? Since it is getting rather large (192 kb), splitting it up would be a good idea - perhaps one list for each continent. - <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxw_6d94.html" title="User:Zyxw">Zyxw</a> 01:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have also seen some of her textiles being sold by felix and oscar. she is illusive but all the information seems to be correct.</p>
<p><br />
David Adam: I am from the other side of Scotland, but became aware of Hale as an artist whilst living in Russia. She seems to have great links in the art world, and many have spoken of her potential to have great impact with her range of new ideas. She just seems to be unsure about how to progress her work- which areas to specialise in.</p>
<p>Vikki Miller: I have been aware of this artist long before I started moving in the same art and design social circles. As a designer myself I have come to appreciate her work and her thinking process first hand. I have known of her multi-disciplinary talents for many years with her work being sold from a prestigious west end store.</p>
<p>She has travelled and lived in London, America and Russia, and uses these experiences to influence her artistic flare. She is a genuine artist and designer with a humble approach to attention.</p>
