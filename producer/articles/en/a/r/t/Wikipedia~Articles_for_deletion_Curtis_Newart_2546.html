<li><b>Comment to Administrator</b> Please note that Ronbo76's page lists entries that he has had successfully deleted. Furthermore, his "To Do List" states: "Create a kill list of articles that I have successfully nominated." I strongly question the merit of this deletion nomination, especially since a body of work such as mine stands on its own merits. Furthermore, I believe deletion of my entries would be a decided disservice to your readership. Regarding Ronbo76's above comment, I was simply following the instructions that appeared on my page to improve the content. Furthermore, the age of some of the reference material is simply not available online and exists simply as tearsheets or programmes. However, to avoid a conflict of interest, I have removed all copyrighted materials owned by Immaculate Records and Curtis Newart and recommend both sites "Curtis Newart" and "Immaculate Records" be deleted.IMAC001 01:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)(Curtis Newart, Immaculate Records Owner)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There appears to be numerous references from solid secondary source newspapers. The article names and writers of the newspaper articles would help substantiate the newspaper references. I googled, and found some fair references to the artist on indy sites. It is nearly impossible to find web links for things that happened before 1998 (like the newspaper articles). I know because I tried in vain to find verification links for an artist that was signed to the industry giant Atlantic Records for all of the 1990s, and all I came up with was generic listings at VH1.com and MTV.com. I have no problem with verification links being added after AfD nomination, as I would expect a contributor to find verification links to prove their case. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 08:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The use of the word "vanity" is in reference to Curtis Newton's creation of the Curtis Newton biography page as well as his company's page. Wikipedia is not a tool for self promotion, please reference <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> note 3 for details. Also user IMAC001 deleting his real name and replacing it with his new user name borders on misleading, as it removes some of the evidence that this page is blatant self promotion. User IMAC001 should definitely not be involved in editing his own page as it is a conflict of interest and probably should not be involved in this dispute either. In addition google hits are a common method of determining notability, even somewhat obscure but notable people will receive hundreds or thousands of hits, while non notable people will receive only a handful. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.
