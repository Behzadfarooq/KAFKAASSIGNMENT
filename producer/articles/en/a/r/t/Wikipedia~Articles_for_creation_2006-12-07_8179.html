<p>imafreehat! is the stage name taken by Rorix Thunderswift, an artist born in cyberspace in around 1990. He creates music in odd and random ways, often noted for using outdated equipment even recording via "Sound Recorder" on Microsoft Windows. His debut album, "yaarg," is expected to hit stores in February-April of 2007 on Sony BMG Records. His works have been commended for brilliant use of terrible technology, and amazingly catchy riffs piling on into a crescendo of "roaring awesome." However, he has been criticized for his unwillingness to capitalize the "I" in imafreehat!</p>

When aphrodite found out about Ares betraying her with another women, she took her revenge by asking her son Cupid to strike Patacaus with an arrow to make him fall in love with an ocean creature, a curse, because Patacaus was deathly afraid of water. With the forbidden love, vertually unbearable, Patacaus ventured to the sea to find is long lost love. His efforts failed as he sunk to the bottom of the ocean into a dark coral ridge. A young mermaid creature of posiedon came across the unconscience Patacaus and tried to pull him to safety. Patacaus awoke to his beautiful beloved mermaid, whom he had been cursed to love eternaly. Disagreeing with her, Patacus vowed to stay with her in the ocean, for he could not live without her. The mermaid expressed her flatery, but explained her dismay that she had already belonged to an important and powerful merman. In a blind rage, Patacaus murdered both the mermaid and her lover. Then driven by his own insanity, he tried to take his own life, but failed miserably,multupile times. After wandering the ocean floor for what seemed to be centuries, Patacaus merged from the water, in search of someone to help him carry out his dier need to end his misery,and kill himself. Longing to die, Patacaus searched for Hephesteas to use his blacksmith skills to congure him a machanical creature to mystically take Patacaus's life. However, his efforts failed when Hephestaus was missing. Patacaus then prayed to Hera, begging for her help. Hera agreed to tell Patacaus of Hephestaus's whereabouts only if he agreed to help her carry out her reveange on her husband Zeus, and sleep with her. After her revenge has been carried out, Hera kept her word by telling Patacaus where Hephesteaus was. Making the long jorney to an island, Patacaus began again to search for Hephestaus. He found Hephestaus and tried to convince him to create him a creature of distruction to end his misery and take his life. However, Hephestaus first made a request that Patacaus had to carry out before distrabution of his services. His terms were that, Patacaus had to first battle the god of war,Aries in an attempt to crush his pride and carry out Hephestaus's revenge on Aries for adultry with is wife,Aphrodite. Patacaus agreed, and did so. Despite Aries's many attempts to diable,and distroy Patacaus, it was impossible. With Hephestaus's anger and his own misery, Patacaus beat down Aries's pride and in turn beat his father at his own game by tricking him into a fight he could not win, forfilling the prophecy that he would beat his father.The deeds were then carried out, and Hephestaus began manifesting a machine of distruction. Meanwhile, having heard Patacaus's defeat over Aries, Aphrodite proceeded to Zeus's sanctuary and told him of Patacaus's plans, and mischief with his wife, Hera. Zeus then proceeded to join Aphrodite in her reveange, and granted Aphrodite's idea of Patacaus becoming full immortal,and adding to his dismay and suffering by immortality. Damned to suffer his eternal sorrow forever.</p>

<p>The Supercomputing Challenge is an annual state wide competition held in New Mexico for high school programmers. Begun in 1991 from a grant from Los Alamos National Laboratories, the Supercomputing Challenge offers students a chance to write a program and compete against different students from other schools. This program must simulate a "real world" problem, or solutions thereof, in an accepted language, ie. Java, C, C++, Starlogo, FORTRAN, etc. Around October, the participants attend a conference held in Glorieta, NM, to discuss their projects and confer with scientists to determine the feasibility and other factors concerning their intended project.<br />
During spring, usually in April, participating students and their sponsoring instructors attend a conference in Los Alamos, at the laboratories, to present their final work before a panel of judges. The finalists, previously selected from final reports submitted earlier, present once more in a closed-door session to another panel of judges.<br />
The overall winners are awarded generous prizes at the awards ceremony, which is usually held the very next day after presentations.<br />
The program also offers scholarships to all participating seniors.</p>

<p><b>Rejected</b>: Do we really need this to be separate from the existing <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_printer.html" title="Laser printer">Laser printer</a> article? Seems to me that there is plenty of room in that article for a section on high speed production machines without the need to create a whole new separate article. There would at any rate be a considerable overlap between the two. I suggest you contribute your material to that page (where I think it's very much needed) - and if that article gets too bloated as a result, we can consider splitting the page into the various kinds of laser printer at a later date. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 14:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article was previously declined as it does not answer the significance of the person. However, I have resubmitted it because Wikipedia has other articles on similar people - many of them only one or two lines in length and without references. For examples of this check out <a href="../../../1/0/0/100.7_Heart_FM_2378.html" title="100.7 Heart FM">100.7 Heart FM</a> and its various presenters.</p>
<p>Also, what are the rules regarding the type of biography from which this article was written? Can they be used as a source? After all, it is not her website, but the site belonging to the company for which she works. Can anyone advise? 217.44.164.92 12:48, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Largely, sources ought to be reliable, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. However, other sites are an OK substitution, and with the case of a disc jockey, it's not a huge deal if the sites aren't New York Times or the Guardian. A lot of times, we use those sites to establish notability as much as anything. Anyway, I'm not going to decline your submission, obviously, as I was the one who did it before.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-07_8179.html" title="Edit section: HAL Ajeet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">HAL Ajeet</span></h2>
<p>The HAL Ajeet is an Indian light attack aircraft and single-seat interceptor. The Ajeet was developed from the Folland Gnat (links to existing Wiki article) designed by W.E.W. "Teddy" Petter (link), and first flew in March 1975. Standard armament was two 30 mm Aden Mk 4 cannon (link) mounted in the outer edges of the air intakes (an unusual position) and up to 1500 lbs of disposable munitions carried on hardpoints, two under each wing.</p>
<p>In 1972, the IAF(link) issued a requirement for an improved Gnat II as an interceptor, but the specification was later modified to include the ground-attack role. HAL modified two Gnats for testing the new design and subsystems, and the first two test vehicles flew in 1975. The improved Gnat was named "Ajeet" ("Invincible" or "Unconquered" or "Unbeatable" in Sanskrit(link)). The two prototype Ajeets were modified from the last production Gnats built by HAL. The first production Ajeet flew on 30 September 1976, with deliveries commencing in 1977. At first glance, the Ajeet was difficult to tell from a Gnat, but it incorporated several differences and improvements. The most obvious change was that the Ajeet had four external pylons, with a total capacity of 900 kilograms, up from the Gnat's two pylons. Other changes improved some of the Gnat's control systems and its unreliable hydraulics. It was fitted with the Martin-Baker Mark GF4 (link) ejection seat (link) instead of the Folland-designed Type 2G (link) seat of the Gnat.</p>
<p>Other changes included:</p>
<ol>
<li>New avionics, including a modern Ferranti gunsight.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>A slab tailplane.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Improved landing gear with an antiskid braking system.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Fuel tanks built into the wings, with each integral wing tank storing 250 liters (66 US gallons) of fuel.</li>
</ol>
<p>This latter change and the two extra hardpoints meant the Ajeet was much better suited to the ground attack role. The Gnat, with its limited range and only two hardpoints, frequently was armed with only cannon, as the hardpoints had to carry drop tanks.</p>
<p>The unusual gun mounts might have caused the Gnat would be prone to engine flameouts from ingesting spent propellant gas from the cannon muzzles, but that did not prove to be the case. This suggests that the muzzles had been designed to deflect the gases out to the sides. Normal mounts on the pylons included drop tanks, 225 kilogram (500 pound) bombs or rocket pods.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the number of Gnats supplied to India, assembled or built by HAL, and estimates vary widely. This is likely because of confusion between the number assembled and the number built. It is unknown if the number built includes the two Ajeet trainers. Total production was 79 by the time production ended in 1982, plus ten Gnats modified to Ajeet standards.</p>
<p>One trainer prototype was built in 1982 and crashed the same year. A second prototype flew in 1983, but the program stagnated and was abandoned. Some sources claim that up to 30 Ajeet trainers were built, but this is unsupported.</p>
<p>The last Ajeets were phased out in 1991. No versions remain in operational service.</p>

<p>A new illness is sweeping across India, Sri Lanka, and nieghboring Asian countries. The illness, known locally as "Chicken Kunya", has symptons similar to the common flu, but more intense. Normal symptoms include extreme aching of joints -- to the point of near paralysis, headaches, fever, nausia, and vomiting. Victems are generally unable to take care of themselves and may require hospitalization for control of fever and replinishment of fluids. The duration of an attack appears to be about 7 - 15 days. Hospitalization of 2-4 days is not uncommon. It is thought that the illness is transmitted by mosquitoes. Travelers to areas where Chicken Kunya has been reported should be extremely careful to avoid contact with local mosquitoes. Although it would be natural to confuse this Chicken Kunya with the much anticipated Avion Flu of world-wide news broadcasts, it is in fact a different illness. Although its symptons are quite severe, it is not clear at this time whether Chicken Kunya should be regarded as deadly.</p>

<p>Pill raises Alzheimer's cure hope</p>
<p>The drug cuts build up of a key protein Scientists have developed a once-a-day pill that they hope could potentially cure Alzheimer's disease. Tests in mice have shown the drug, PBT2, prevents build up of the amyloid protein linked to the disease.</p>
<p>Protein levels dropped by 60% within 24 hours of a single dose, and memory performance improved within five days.</p>
<p>A team from Australia's Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, who are behind the research, hope the drug could be on the market in four years.</p>
<p><br />
Early results indicate this drug offers hope to people with Alzheimer's disease Professor George Fink</p>
<p>Human tests are due to start next month, followed by a major international trial next year.</p>
<p>Already preliminary tests in humans have showed the drug does not cause any major side-effects.</p>
<p>The researchers believe the drug has the potential to delay the onset of disease, or slow down its progression.</p>
<p>Spatial memory</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a progressive and fatal brain disease. It is the most common cause of dementia and affects around 450,000 people in Britain.</p>
<p>It is linked to the build up of deposits of amyloid protein - called Abeta - in the brain, which form plaques often seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients at post mortem.</p>
<p>The Australian researchers showed that PBT2 therapy quickly and significantly improved spatial memory in mice.</p>
<p>They used a water-maze test which involved the mice remembering the location of a submerged platform in order to navigate the maze.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Professor Ashley Bush said: "This data is compelling and very exciting because it shows that PBT2 not only may facilitate the clearance of Abeta from the brain or prevent its production, but more importantly may improve cognition."</p>
<p>His colleague Professor George Fink, head of the Mental Health Research Institute, described the research as a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>"Though much depends on the next phase of human clinical trials, early results indicate this drug offers hope to people with Alzheimer's disease."</p>
<p>Dr Susanne Sorenson, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: "Initial tests have shown that the drug improves cognition and memory in mice, and we hope the same results can be recreated in humans."</p>
<p>However she added: "These findings are still relatively new and many more tests and studies are now needed to prove the concept will work in people with Alzheimer's disease and ensure the best treatments for this condition are made available as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Promising leads</p>
<p>Dr Sorenson said the results of the PBT2 study were one of many encouraging discoveries presented at last week's International Convention for Alzheimer's Disease which showed positive steps were being made towards finding new and better treatments.</p>
<p>Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said PBT2 was related to Clioquinol, an ointment used to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot.</p>
<p>She said "Scientists still have a lot of work to do before a drug could be available for patients.</p>
<p>"Much more research is needed even to see whether preventing the amyloid build-up is really a true benefit for patients.</p>
<p>"It would also be necessary to develop a drug that reduced the amyloid without removing it entirely, since a healthy brain still needs amyloid."</p>

<p>The Man of Mode or, Sir Fopling Flutter is a play written by George Etherege in 1676.</p>
<p>Plot Summary</p>
<hr />
<p>Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dorimant is a womaniser and has several affairs. In the beginning he is having a conversation with Handy, a “Valet de Chambre”. Soon an orange woman comes and tells him of a woman intending to meet him. First, Dorimant tells her to take back the fruit and his friend Medley, who arrives in-between joins his opinion. He then learns that he knows the woman in question and convinces Dormant that she is ‘vastly rich’ and the ‘beautifulest creature [he] ever saw’. She moreover has wit ‘more than usual in her sex’. In the end, Dorimant sees it as necessary to make her acquaintance. At the present moment he has, however, another affair with Mrs. Loveit who is uncharmingly characterised as his ‘pis aller’ by Medley. But Dorimant has lost interest in her and desires to get rid of her anyway for which purpose he wrote a letter. He moreover has an affair with Bellinda whom he has visited the theatre with the day before and who is a friend of Mrs. Loveit. He plans to play the two women against each other to get rid of both. After a short intermezzo with a shoemaker, Young Bellair meets with Dorimant and tells of his sorrows: he is to marry Harriet (who is later revealed to be the woman intending to meet Dorimant) or be disinherited; he loves Emilia, though. In their conversation they, too, speak of “Sir Fopling Flutter” who has lately arrived from Paris and is ‘indeed the pattern of modern Foppery’ according to Dorimant. When Dorimant hears from Bellair that Fopling resides at Townley’s and ‘gave Mrs. Loveit a Catalogue of his good Qualities’ he decides to set him upon her to get fully rid of her. After Bellair leaves, Dorimant gets a letter from another mistress of his, Molly, who plays no further role.</p>
<p>The second act starts at Lady Townley’s where said lady has a conversation with Emilia and is soon joined by Young Bellair and soon after by his father (Old Bellair). The latter one knows not that his son is in love with Emilia (who loves him as well) and intends to marry her himself. After the men leave, Medley joins the women and entertains them with the latest gossip and of Dorimant’s last deeds concerning Mrs. Loveitt, II.ii starts with Mrs. Loveit reading a letter and complaining to her waiting woman about what Dorimant does to her, which is ignoring her. She is soon joined by Bellinda who manages to make her jealous by telling her of Dorimant’s visit at the theatre with a woman in disguise (who was no other than herself). Dorimant joins them afterwards and gets attacked by Loveit for his behaviour. But he in turn accuses Bellinda of being the source of all misery for telling Loveit. In the end, Bellinda got a ‘proof which [she]desired of His love’ but thinks it ill-natured: her friend is deeply hurt by Dorimant.</p>
<p>Act III starts at Lady Woodvil’s (Harriet’s mother). Harriet tells her waiting woman that she does not intend to marry Young Bellair and is very pleased to hear of him (entering soon after) that he does not intend to marry her either. They both agree to play as if they were in love before their parents in order to get some time to further their own plans. When Old Bellair and Lady Woodvil enter, they act their loving each other with double entendre but convincingly for the old ones. III.ii is back at Lady Townley’s where Bellinda enters to L. Townley, Emilia and Medley where the woman complain about Dorimant’s ill-naturedness. Said persona non grata enters soon after and they discuss with him. Bellinda complains apart to him but in the end agrees to meet him the next day. She then steals away and after some talk, Sir Fopling Flutter makes his entrance and greets Dorimant especially enthusiastic, talking about the newest mode. Dorimant soon starts to talk Fopling into wooing Mrs. Loveit III.iii sees Harriet and Young Bellair in the Mail. The soon meet Dorilant who recognises Harriet as the one Medley spoke of. Lady Woodvil appears and takes Harriet away so she cannot meet with Dorimant which Woodvil compares to plague, not realising he is standing in front of her. They leave as Sir Fopling enters, followed by Medley. Dorimant talks Fopling more into Loveit, they leave and Loveit and Bellinda enter and talk about Dorimant. They are joined by Fopling and some singing fellows. Sir Fopling flirts with Loveit and she decides to engage in it, too, leading to Dorimant becoming ‘jealous of a Counter-plot’. He manages to conceal it from Bellinda, though.</p>
<p>Act IV starts after a country dance with Dorimant (pretending to be a “Mr. Courtage”), Woodvil, both Bellairs, Emilia, Medley and Townley engaging in some talks and dancing again. According to Emilia, Lady Woodvil grows ‘a little fond’ of Dorimant (as Courtage), who is interested in Harriet at this point after she did not yield to his advances like other women. In an aside, Dorimant concludes that he loves Harriet, while talking to het. Sir Fopling enters and Dorimant and Medley make some more fun of him without him noticing it. After another dance, Old Bellair, Woodvil and Townley return. Ironically, Lady Woodvil thanks “Mr Courtage” for keeping an eye on Harriet, concluding that he ‘’s not a Dorimant, a wild extravagant Fellow of the Times’. Remembering his date with Bellinda, Dorimant steals away while the general singing continues. The next scene (IV.ii) begins after the date with Bellinda. Bellinda is to go away in a hurry because Dorimant’s friends are approaching. After some talk between Medley, Dorimant and Fopling, the scene changes to the Mail where Bellinda has accidentally been taken to.</p>
<p>In V.i., Mrs. Loveit encounters Bellinda in the Mail. Bellinda fears that Loveit might recognise the driver Handy and thus discover where she comes from but she succeeds to avoid this revelation and soon, Dorimant enters and talks with Loveit and making fun of absent Fopling again. He talks Loveit into meeting Fopling again when Bellinda appears who agains jumps to the side of her friend Loveit. In an aside, Dorimant confesses that he is to blame ‘in some circumstances’. He leaves, stating that Loveit would want to cool her temper. At Lady Townley’s house (V.ii), Young Bellair and Emilia have just got married by a chaplain who is hidden in a closet by Medley, Young Bellair and Lady Townley when Old Bellair arrive. When Harriet and her mother arrive, Harriet talks with Emilia about him and defends him against her mother. Dorimant enters after a song and Harriet blushes from love. He offers to marry her and in a quarrel-like dialogue she once again counters his wit with equal force. Then, Lady Townley re-enters and gets the parson out of the closet. Old Bellair now wants his son to marry. Obviously, the parson rejects since he just had married him to Emilia. Old Bellair reacts angrily being thus cheated twice by his son marrying the woman he intended to marry himself. Loveit and Bellinda enter and finally “Mr. Courtage”’s identity (Dorimant) is revealed to Lady Woodvil who held Courtage in the highest esteem but despised Dorimant. Dorimant concludes: ‘Believe me a Wife, to repair the Ruines of my estate that needs it.’; Bellinda and Loveit are deeply injured by his unkept vows.Lady Woodvil is finally talked into giving her consent to a marriage between Harriet and Dorimant and Old Bellevile gives his blessing to his son’s marriage. Finally, Sir Fopling enters and Loveit shows him her contempt leaving complaining about all men being villains or fools. The scene and the play end with a dance after Lady Woodvil agreed to have Dorimant wait upon her and her daughter when they return to the country and Dorimant stated that his ‘soul has quite given up her liberty’.</p>

<p>The C3 Algorithm is an algorithm used primarily to obtain a consistent linearization of an <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a> heirarchy in <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a>. This linearization is used to resolve the order in which methods should be inherited, and is often termed "MRO" for Method Resolution Order. The name C3 refers to the three important properties of the resulting linearization: a consistent extended precedence graph, preservation of local precedence order, and monotonicity. It was first published at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> <a href="../../../o/o/p/OOPSLA_72f7.html" title="OOPSLA">OOPSLA</a> conference, in a paper entitled "A Monotonic Superclass Linearization for Dylan"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Subsequently, it has been chosen as the default algorithm for method resolution in <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Python (programming language)">Python</a> 2.3, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl_6.html" title="Perl 6">Perl 6</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parrot_virtual_machine.html" title="Parrot virtual machine">Parrot</a>.

<p>Envoke are a five man, techno hardcore band from Essex, UK. The band first formed in January 2005. After promoting the return of true punk music, the band moved onto more experimental music, taking influences from their heroes Enter Shikari, another British band. Envoke is the evolved form of old punk band Brickworm.</p>
<p>The band first created a name for themselves, after appearing half awake and sober at a local Battle Of The Bands competition. Since then they have been able to rebuild their status into that of a more serious band, much to many people's suprise.</p>
<p>The band, since the release of their second EP, In Your Eyes, became widely recognised and began to attract fans from all over the UK and even a few from America. Their cover of The Buzzcocks classic, Ever Fallen In Love, gained them plays on the UK radio station, XFM.</p>
<p>After the EP release the band began to gain attention from record labels from the UK. Instead of signing to one of these major labels so early in their career, they decided to create their own record label.</p>

<p>Fort Neoheroka is the name of a stronghold constructed by Tuscarora Indians during the Tuscarora War of 1711-1715. In March of 1713, the Fort was laid siege to and ultimately attacked by a colonial force consisting of Yamassee and Cherokee Indians from neighboring South Carolina. Led by Col. James More, the 1713 siege lasted for more than three weeks, from around March 1, 1713 to March 22nd. Hundreds of men women and children were burned to death in a fire that destroyed the Fort. Approximately 170 more were killed outside the fort while approximately 400 were taken to South Carolina where they were sold into slavery. The defeat of the Tuscaroras, once the most powerful Indigenous nation in the North Carolina Territory, opened up North Carolina’s interiror to further expansion by European settlers. The supremacy of the Tuscaroras in the state was broken forever.</p>
