<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Doesn't Hahnchen have any sort of vocabulary beyond "This webcomic is not notable."? I mean, first he says this about Pokémon X, now this comic. I think we really need to just accept that Hahnchen is unfit to be in any position of power at Wikipedia due to his completely stupid bias against webcomics (don't like them? Don't read them. they aren't harming you with their existance, and neither are these wikipedia pages). I also quote from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Websites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28079761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Websites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28079761" rel="nofollow">proposed Wikipedia policy</a> about website articles, specifically the part about webcomics. "Unusually large readership. If a webcomic is exceptionally widely read, and this can be verified, it should be included. If this is verified by means of Alexa, it should have a ranking of 100,000 or lower." Now this is either a really stupid mistake on the part of the author, or it's currently proposed that GameCheetz is considered widely read due to it's Alexa ranking below 100,000. So biased idiot Hahnchen aside, get all of your useless policies on the same page. Furthermore, the google search with 100 links brings back the site in question first. Now, if it gave the link to this site, but on the 3rd or 4th page, then I could see the point behind that argument. But it's the first link returned when you google for gamecheetz, so getting 99 other links is really unimportant if you were looking for this site. Guess what, you google it and find it easily. No point in mentioning this google search except to create a false image of unpopularity. mjc0961 13:39, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>No Vote</b> As the creator of the comic, I've been asked by fans to put a few statistics here. As the creator of the comic, I doubt I have much say on the matter of the Wikipedia article's deletion, so I did not put a vote. Sites that link to mine: 231. Average monthly hits: Aprox 1,000,000. Unique IPs per month, range about 7,000 to 14,000, not counting the month it was 31,716 (during which I advertised). The reason for such variation is the dip it took when I ended it for a couple months (I later changed my mind about ending it). These numbers are all statistics straight from my webhost. 24.45.158.238 19:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC) 2:26PM</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. What makes this webcomic different than any others? The amount of hits you get from Google cannot accuratly represent the popularity of the comic. I assure that if you were to type in a search for any other webcomic, a good percentage of those sites will either be fan-made or have no relationship to the comic at all. Also, looking through the categories of webcomics that are listed, a good few of them have not been updated in quite a while and seem to not have a chance of ever being updated, while Gamecheetz is still being updated, and people read it. There's my two cents. 139.55.28.135 23:08, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just so you know, as an anonymous editor, identified only by IP, your vote in these discussions does not count. Anons and new users go through a period known as 'suffrage' whereupon they prove they are committed to the project, by staying on for a certain amount of time and/or edits. As it is now, you are just distracting from the true debate. -<a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> 01:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not <i>quite</i> correct. This isn't a vote, it's a discussion that's composed of two parts: examination fo the facts, and examination of editor's opinions about the facts, with emphasis on the former.
<ul>
<li>Very new or anonymous editors are always welcome to contribute evidence, and ten long-time contributor's recomendation of <i>"delete as not notable"</i> can be blown away by a single IP recomendation of <i>"keep as notable as evidenced by (insert link to new york times article)".</i></li>
<li>It the second half of the debate where very new contributors tends to have less say. Understanding of the complex interactions between the policies and guidelines takes time and experiance. Thus the closing admin will listen more to the <i>opinions</i> expressed by someone with two years and twenty feature articles than to those of someone new.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So please do join in, very new people, but best to do so by providing facts to sway the opinons of long-time contributors. And welcome to Wikipedia!</dd>
