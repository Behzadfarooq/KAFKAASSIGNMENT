<p>Zero Before Friendship is a Post-Thrashcore/Screamo band from Lymington, in the United Kingdom. The band started in 2002 but due to lack of a drummer and places to practice it was very hard to get started and get going. Things changed heavily in 2006 when originals members Dean Taylor (vocals), Jeff Lewis(Rythm guitar) and Callum Hulley (Lead guitar)found Will Rowley-Morris a bassist and began composing at there school, Priestlands.After months of practicing and composing with no drummer they have found a few people willing to be a drummer and have got drummer Dan Wales. They are a very diverse band with it's own style of music. Named by its vocalist Dean taylor as post-thrashcore, a mix between thrash metal and hardcore, and also screamo. These two are their main style of music with others being such like metal,death metal,rock,acoustic rock,hard rock and rap metal. Even though they have a very heavy emo genre and even alot of emo material the band themselves don't consider to be emo.</p>
<p>Most lyrics are written by Dean and Will and he composing of music usualy is written by Callum</p>
<p>They are working on a demo called Venus Element. Memebers include; Vocals-Dean Taylor Bass-Will R-M Lead Guitar-Callum Hulley Rhythm Guitar-Jeff Lewis Drums-Dan Wales</p>
<p>Helpers; Carl Thompson</p>

<p>“As to Negro Masons”</p>
<p>“Whereas, the question of the recognition of Negro Masons has been made more than usually prominent during the last year; and whereas this Grand Lodge has a well-settled opinion upon this subject, which she desires most respectfully and fraternally to express to her sister Grand Lodges everywhere, and especially to those of the United States; she deems the present a fit opportunity to set forth the reasons which impel her to that opinion.</p>
<p>1. It is indisputable that whatever theory we adopt as to the origin of Masonry- whether that which carries it back to the original Father of mankind, and his immediate descendents;, or to Enoch and Noah; or to the building of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Solomon_d3cc.html" title="King Solomon">King Solomon</a>’s Temple; or arising from the constitutions of <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagoras.html" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>; or if we trace it back to the Eleusinain Mysteries; or to those of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceres.html" title="Ceres">Ceres</a>, and the institution of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacchanalia.html" title="Bacchanalia">Bacchanalia</a>; or, what is most probable of all, the incorporation of the Roman builders under <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Pompilius_7cba.html" title="Numa Pompilius">Numa Pompilius</a> that theory carries us back to the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> Race. 2. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonry.html" title="Masonry">Masonry</a> was originally, what it is mainly today, a social institution; intended for those who daily mingled in the ordinary walks of life, in business, in pleasure, and in the family circle; into which it is not credible that anyone of the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro.html" title="Negro">Negro</a> or any other of the inferior races, could have been admitted. 3. That Negroes have of late years been admitted into <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodges.html" title="Lodges">Lodges</a> of Free Masons is due, it is believed, to the sympathy which has been excited for them by anti-slavery societies generally, and particularly by those of the United States; and that any were admitted during the revolutionary war by traveling Lodges belonging to the British Army, was due to the feeling which existed at that time against American patriots; a proceeding entirely at variance with the object of the formation of such Lodges, they having no right to confer the degrees upon any citizen or resident of the county in which they might be sojourning, but only upon members of the army to which such Lodges belonged. 4. Although it is usually said that <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonry.html" title="Masonry">Masonry</a> is universal, and that in every clime <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masons.html" title="Masons">Masons</a> are to be found; yet it is only universal in so far as the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> Race has carried it into every quarter of the globe; and if that race has sometimes admitted Negroes, and others of the inferior races, it has done so in violation of the original and fundamental laws of the Fraternity. 5. In view, therefore, of these facts, indisputable as they are conceived to be, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Alabama seizes the present as a fit and proper occasion, to acknowledge the legality of Negro-masons, such acknowledgement being foreign to the original purpose of the Fraternity, and introducing an element of demoralization into the society.”</p>
<p>Resolution passed</p>

After a few weeks Maiello and Adelman started to jam and Kevin(brother of Corey) joined. Once they had a few songs together, they thought they should start from scratch because they're songs had no structure. So they came up with a new song called the "The Media". Since then Maiello has come up with a few new songs that have yet to be rehearsed.</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<p>Corey and Kevin are twins. Mike collectes rocks. They are only 14 years old.</p>
<p>Band Members:</p>
<p>Corey Adelman- Drums Kevin Adelman- Guitars Mike Maiello- Guiats</p>

<p>The RUF "Yellowbird" was the infamous creation of Alois RUF. It debuted in 1987, capturing the title of 'the fastest production car'. The Yellowbird was capable of zero to sixty in 4 seconds, and a top speed of 211 miles per hour. In all 28 of the RUF 'CTR's were made, however the RUF prototype car, #001, Yellowbird was distinctive for its massive side air intakes, and infamous status on the nurburgring. There was a video starring the car,<i>Faszination on the Nurburgring</i> which shows RUF's test driver Stefan Roser behind the wheel sliding the yellowbird all around the track. This special 911 holds a special place in history as one of the fastest and most desirable cars ever made.</p>

<p>Forest Farming - Solution to Forestry Woes</p>
<p>The forests of the Northwest have not been managed well in the past. They have been utilized for one purpose---the production of wood fiber. Little care has been given to prevent habitat destruction and less to rehabilitating these abused forestlands.</p>
<p>Since the 1980's, several Southern Oregon forestland owners have been at the leading edge of a new generation of forest managers. These forest land owners have found that the best method of managing these cut over lands is to try to enable them to recover as a forest ecosystem, as they were prior to man's entry into the forest.</p>
<p>Many forest professionals and land owners think of these lands only as "secondary" forests of even-age stands which are to be left alone until time to come back in and cut them all again. Forest farmers believe that these forests have been so abused that they are completely out of balance and must be manipulated in order to bring them back into ecological balance.</p>
<p>They must be thinned, but no species is ever to be completely decimated. There must never be so much thinning that the crown cover is depleted leaving the forest floor exposed to excessive sun or rain. There must be a cross-section of trees of all ages. Trees are not thinned solely for the removal of the largest healthiest individuals- in fact wherever a healthy large tree can be left, it is left to grow larger and stronger. Only the weaker, sick or damaged trees are removed to give the healthy ones more space, food and sunlight so that they may thrive.</p>
<p>Today, forest farm owners take heart in the knowledge that, although their efforts may not bring them financial reward, it brings forth an even greater reward... a natural and varied forest habitat that can support many creatures and a healthier, happier earth. To forest farmers, sustainable levels of harvest are those levels that are sustainabile by the earth in her ability to recover from disruption of man's efforts. These levels are far less than those utilized by industry at present.</p>
<p>In 1984 Orville Camp published his book, "Natural Selection Forestry, A Guide to Natural Selection Forestry", which galvanized landowners to resist standard forest practices and allow nature to tell them how to manage forests.</p>
<p>In 2005, Ms. jeannie Kendrick wrote her book "Alex's Forest Farm", which chronicled, both verbally and photographically, the actual forest management activities carried on at their forest farm. This book exhibits an incredible array of native plants and animals actually living in their forest.</p>

<p>Gleipinr resembles an enormous stealth airplane with a conventional layout (wings in the middle of the fuselage, elevators and rudders at the very rear of the plane). It is painted flat black and and a shape that appears <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrodynamic.html" title="Hydrodynamic">hydrodynamic</a> as well as <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerodynamic.html" title="Aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a>. This is because the plane was first launched off land, but the scientists thought ahead enough to make the plane able to land on water as well as on ground. The aircraft is as large, if not possibly larger, than comparable aircraft in the Ace Combat universe, such as the <a href="../../../x/b/-/XB-0_Hresvelgr_9066.html" title="XB-0 Hresvelgr">Hresvelgr flying fortress</a>.</p>

<p>This aircraft is perhaps more stealthy than any aircraft before it. While the claim sounds unbelievable when the size and scale of the craft is taken into account, it is made reality because of one trick: the plane can make itself invisible to both standard radar and the naked eye. The craft has "Digital Optical Stealth," basically a form of <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_camouflage.html" title="Active camouflage">active camouflage</a>. The aircraft can cloak itself in its environment, no matter where it is or what it is doing.</p>

<p>Gleipnir is described as a "<a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-emptive_strike.html" title="Pre-emptive strike">first-strike weapon</a>," meaning it uses its stealth properties and ability to land in and take off from any large body of water to head towards targets quickly and attack them without hesitation. The weapon it carries to do this job is neither conventional or nuclear: it is sonic. It carries ballistic missiles called "SW Bullets" that use pure sonic booms to create destructive shockwaves.

<p>Until 2001 the grenadiers were simply the only offensive infantry-unit of Switzerland, trained to attack the enemy(in opposite to the other infantry units of Switzerland, who are trained mainly for defense purposes). With the restructuring of the Swiss Armed Forces in 2001 into "Armee XXI"(Army 21) the grenadier-units were restructured as well and given new tasks. From 2001 grenadiers are trained to be deployed up to 150 km behind enemy lines. They are therefore now a part of the special operations forces of Switzerland. Another change was, that the different grenadier units were united under one command, named "Grenadierkommando 1"(Grenadier Command 1) and are no longer under the control of a specific canton(state) of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The main tasks are:</p>
<p>Acuiring sensitive information Protection of troops and personnel The rescue of Swiss citizens abroad (and bringing them back to Switzerland) in case of severe danger. Offensive actions</p>
<p><br />
The Grenadier Command 1 is a specially organized light infantry formation with about 2500 solciers. These are structured in:</p>
<p>The grenadier command staff The staff company grenadier command The Army Recon Detachment (Armee-Aufklärungsdetachement 10), which is at the same time the only professional special forces group of Switzerland (all other groups consist of militia) Two active grenadier batallions One inactive grenadier batallion The grenadier school.</p>

<p>195.26.225.78 08:41, 1 September 2006 (UTC) Aldose reductase, is an enzyme that is normally present in many other parts of the body, and catalizes one of the steps in the sorbitol(polyol)pathway that is responsible for fructose formation from glucose. Aldose reductase activity increases as glucose concentration rise in diabetes in those tissue that are not insulin sensitive , ie , the lens (anatomy), peripheral nerve and glomerulus. Sorbitol doesn't diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates, causing osmotic damage which leads to retinopathy and neuropathy.</p>

<p>Quadrant Park was one of the best known nightclubs in Liverpool during the early 1990's. The club originally started as a mainstream venue much earlier than the introduction of new styles of music through DJ's in 1990. It was located on derby road in bootle away from the centre of the city in a converted warehouse.</p>
<p>Quadrant Park's Main Era in italian house, rave, and acid house music began in 1990 and survived until December 1991, despite considerable and persistent licensing issues and unfavourable media attention in newspapers.</p>
<p>The DJ's were essentially locally produced, Mike Knowler, John Kelly, Andy Carroll, James Barton (of cream nightclub origin)and Gary J, and in addition also hosted a wealth of guest DJ's that performed there during the 1990 - 1991 period such as Sasha, Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Frankie Bones and Nipper.</p>
<p>The importance of Quadrant Park in the development of house music in the UK cannot be emphasised enough, it was a forerunner to the worldwide successful Cream nightclub, Quadrant Park not only developed the DJ's that went on to feature at Cream But also influenced the music styles and creativity that would lead to the success of this superclub.</p>
<p>Quadrant park was not only influencial in the liverpool area, it attracted clubbers from not only the north west of England but also from all over the country due to its status as an all night club which was unheard of in this era for legal nightclubs.</p>

Laura Esplin, a 16 year old student at Cheltenham Girls high school, is becoming more famous as the days go by. After writing various songs and performing them at school events and at performance nights, Laura's music has been demanded more frequently by those around her. Many believe that she is capable of being the next "big thing" in the music industry, hitting the world of music at the tender age of 16. Her musical style is acousitic/ballads and all of the people who listen to her music have admitted to being spell-binded by her music. It is apparent that Laura could become Australia's next major success in the music industry.</p>

Dieudonné de Gozon (1346-1353), Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes. He carried the nickname of "Extintor Draconis" which means "The Dragon Slayer".</p>
<p>The story goes that there was a dragon in the island of Rodos, hiding in the local swamp, and killing the cattle of the local farmers.</p>
<p>Despite the orders of the previous Grand Master to not disturb the beast, Gozor slayed the dragon, and hanged the head on one of the seven gates of the medieval town of Rodos.</p>
<p>The head was on display until a hundred years ago, when a biologist pointed out it was the head of a large crocodile.</p>

<p>Bent &amp; Buckled Bikies Bureau also known as 4B's</p>
<p>Being the unique individuals motorcyclists are, it is necessary for us to look after our own. Lets face it the only advice an injured rider is likely to get in hospital is to give up riding. As the MRA began with an idea being kicked around a group of rides, so the 4B’s started when a couple of MRA members saw a need and decided to do something about it. They decided to organize support, both moral and practical, for injured riders.</p>
<p>The concept was developed around 1979/80 by two people who themselves, had spent time in hospital due to bike crashes. In the early 80’s, a couple by the names of Trevor and Glenda Kane really got the 4B unit up and running. In spite of some misconceptions, name changes and splinter groups in recent years, the 4B’s are, and always will be a sub branch of the MRA. For over 20 years, the thousands of hurt and broken motorcyclists have been visited by compassionate volunteers who give up their time to boost morale and assist in whatever way required. They were a routine sight in many hospitals up till the late 20th century.</p>
<p>Other duties performed by the 4B’s were data collection, about the crash that landed the rider in hospital. This information is used to help government understand this side of road trauma and to take appropriate countermeasures rather then the usual “Bikes are dangerous and should be banned”.</p>

<p>Having played different kinds of music throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>'s and early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>'s (such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, electronic, music for commercials), Michael Stearns began to compose and perform <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic music</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> as a resident musician/composer at Emily Conrad's Continuum Studio, in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<p>His first album was recorded in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> and followed by nearly twenty more, but also various collaborations (with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Roach_cb32.html" title="Steve Roach">Steve Roach</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Braheny_b3e8.html" title="Kevin Braheny">Kevin Braheny</a> or Ron Sunsinger)and lots of movies soundtracks, such as <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Fricke_0ea8.html" title="Ron Fricke">Ron Fricke</a>'s 35 mm <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baraka.html" title="Baraka">Baraka</a> or the <a href="../../../i/m/a/IMAX_89f5.html" title="IMAX">IMAX</a> movie <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronos.html" title="Chronos">Chronos</a>.</p>
<p>Many of his first albums featured the <i>Serge synthetizer</i>, its twinkling sound becoming a trademark of Michael Stearns. A good example is given by the album <i>Planetary Unfolding</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>) or by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronos.html" title="Chronos">Chronos</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>).</p>
<p>The sound of Michael's synthetizers evolved later toward whar can be heared on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baraka.html" title="Baraka">Baraka</a>'s main theme, the album <i>Encounter</i> (1988), and some of Michael's more recent records, like <i>The Middle of Time</i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>). He also often included background ambient sounds (nature sounds or native chants) and, since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>'s <i>The Singing Stones</i>, the musical sounds of sacred "ringing rocks" found at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native.html" title="Native">Native</a> American sacred sites in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwestern.html" title="Southwestern">Southwestern</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>

<p>The Catholic Witness, Official Newspaper of the Diocese of Harrisburg, PA</p>
<p>Retiring Teacher Brought to Life the Stage from the Page for McDevitt High School Students</p>
<p>By Sarah E. Adams of The Catholic Witness, August 18, 2006</p>
<p>Fall is peeking around the corner and Harrisburg’s Bishop McDevitt High School is preparing to call the roll for another school year – but this year with one notable absence.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Rempe, the former chair of the English department at McDevitt, has retired after a 38-year teaching career that spanned over 44 years. Over the years he has taught literature, humanities, advanced placement classes, journalism and even general science at the beginning of his career. He has also served as the moderator of the Twin Towers, the high school’s student newspaper, and has been involved in theater productions at McDevitt.</p>
<p>“Dr. Rempe will be dearly missed at Bishop McDevitt High School. He has instilled much more than knowledge into the students he has taught. With his humor, fun music, unique expressions and life’s little lessons, he has inspired students with true character,” writes student Kimberly Barbush in a tribute article from the Twin Towers.</p>
<p>However, his great love over the years has been Shakespeare, and the school will remember him for the Shakespearean drama classes he taught primarily to seniors toward his last years at McDevitt.</p>
<p>“I think his dedication to the students, his love of English literature, Shakespeare in particular [was his legacy]. If he could instill a love of Shakespeare in their hearts, that’s an incredible thing,” said Immaculate Heart of Mary Sister Mary Anne Bednar, Bishop McDevitt principal.</p>
<p>“I have taught the works of Shakespeare because they represent the very best humans have to say about themselves, in story-telling and narrative form…. I have taught Shakespeare’s works so my students could come to an understanding of the universal themes [of] love, hate, revenge, tragedy, hope and redemption, and [to] trace the unbreakable line between the stories we tell now and the stories human beings have always told,” Dr. Rempe explained of his emphasis on the bard.</p>
<p>His class frequently aimed at making Shakespeare accessible and relevant to students. Last year, he assigned students to create an adaptation of The Tempest, which generated performances with themes of “It’s a Barbie World,” “Mister Prospero’s Neighborhood,” “Shrek Style” and a Sesame Street spoof.</p>
<p>Students remember Dr. Rempe and the lengths he took to teach them literature long after they leave Bishop McDevitt High School.</p>
<p>“I think what impressed me about him is the profound influence that he’s had on our students. There’s not an alumni gathering that I go to that someone’s not asking about Bob Rempe. He has a profound and lasting effect on the lives of so many of our alumni,” said Sister Mary Anne.</p>
<p>While the list of his most notable alumni is too lengthy for even him to remember, he counts several diocesan priests including Father Neil Sullivan, Father David Danneker, Father Thomas Rozman and Father Michael Reid among his former students. Other students have become English teachers, drama critics, attorneys, coaches, pilots and politicians.</p>
<p>Dr. Rempe came to Bishop McDevitt High School in 1962 after graduating with a B.A. and M.A. in English and Education from the University of Scranton. He interviewed for a teaching position along with John Brixius, a former McDevitt principal and current teacher of English and history. Mr. Brixius will take over Dr. Rempe’s position as Chairman of the English department this fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Brixius recalls that, although he and Dr. Rempe had both attended the University of Scranton together, one of the first times they met was when another student invited the two of them to come along on an interview he had set up at Bishop McDevitt High School.</p>
<p>“We came to Harrisburg and interviewed and he and I both got jobs,” recalled Mr. Brixius, “[Dr. Rempe] was hired to teach general science and Spanish at that time, though he was an English teacher by trade. We took those jobs because that was what was available at the time.” Their third companion, who had initially arranged the interview at McDevitt, was still unemployed at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Following their employment, Mr. Brixius recalls that they initially roomed together with other McDevitt teachers to share expenses and eventually the duo team-taught a humanities course together.</p>
<p>Later in his career, Dr. Rempe was granted a sabbatical to teach English and Journalism at a high school in Venezuela, and was granted another sabbatical a few years later to finish his Ph.D. at Michigan State University. With his experience from his Ph.D. research he began a writing program across the curriculum at the University of Charleston in West Virginia. He also touts an impressive list of publications, many times having articles featured in the journal Shakespeare in the Classroom.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of his notable experiences in the realm of higher education, he always returned to McDevitt. “I always liked the students. McDevitt students are really special,” he said.</p>
<p>“People ask me what’s the best thing I ever got out of McDevitt and I answer ‘my wife’ because that’s how I met her,” he joked. Mrs. Rempe, now an attorney, was a Spanish teacher at McDevitt when Dr. Rempe met her.</p>
<p>And if you ask him why he felt called to teaching, he would direct you to a passage from Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons about Sir Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor of England from 1529-1532.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More: Why not be a teacher? You’d be a fine teacher, perhaps a great one.</p>
<p>Richard Rich (Solicitor General): If I were, who would know it?</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More: You, your pupils, your friends. God. Not a bad public, that.</p>
<p>Not a bad public indeed.</p>

<p>The Capping Sextet is one of the best-known student institutions and one of the oldest musical ensembles in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. The Sextet is one of the best-loved institutions of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Otago_82d9.html" title="University of Otago">University of Otago</a> and is often used in publicity material for the university and the city of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunedin.html" title="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>.</p>
<p>Otago University's<a href="../../../c/a/p/Capping_Show_80d2.html" title="Capping Show">Capping Show</a> is one of the few survivors of an important New Zealand student tradition. The Otago Capping show is the world's second longest continuously running annual student revue. The Sextet along with the Selwyn Ballet are essential parts of the Capping show.</p>
<p>The Sextet's six male singers are drawn from all faculties of the university. There has been a sextet-type group of singing men (sometimes there were more or less than six members) in every <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capping_Show_80d2.html" title="Capping Show">Capping Show</a> at Otago University since <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>. The Otago Capping Sextet pre-dates by three years another well-known all-male collegiate a cappella group at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a>.</p>
<p>Costumes For several decades the Sextet has worn two costumes: white tie and tails and a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clown.html" title="Clown">clown</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequin.html" title="Harlequin">harlequin</a> outfit in the colours of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">province</a> of <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otago.html" title="Otago">Otago</a>: blue and gold. In earlier years conical hats were worn with the clown outfits. The Sextet uses harlequin-style makeup.</p>
<p>Music While the Sextet's satirical and vulgar lyrics have stayed similar over the years the Sextet's music has varied considerably. For many years the Sextet sang accompianed by piano and the accompanist was an essential part of the group. Since the 1990s the trend has been to sing <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_cappella.html" title="A cappella">a cappella</a>. Unison, two or three parts songs were usual for the Sextet for many years. For several years four-part <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbershop_music.html" title="Barbershop music">Barbershop music</a> has been important in the Sextet's repertoire. Since the 1970s the Sextet has borrowed heavily from the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Singers_8bce.html" title="King's Singers">King's Singers</a> and therefore has increased the number of parts it sings in to five and six. Latterly the Sextet has tended to sing unaccompanied mostly six-part music. Many people have made arrangements for the Sextet, notable amongst arrangers are: Dr. Nigel Eastgate, Professor John Drummond and Associate Professor Patrick Little.</p>
<p>Since at least the 1970s the Sextet has toasted the University at the end of each Capping Show using first the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Lehrer_f6ba.html" title="Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> song 'Bright College Days' since the 1990s changed to 'Bright Otago Days', then to the tune of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudeamus_igitur.html" title="Gaudeamus igitur">Gaudeamus igitur</a> sings 'Sexiamus mania, frustrutatum randium(x2) prostitutem contraceptum, mastubatum manualem, satisfactor releivium (x2)', to finish the show the Sextet leads the cast and audience in singing Gaudemamus Igitur. The Sextet often sings at other University and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civic.html" title="Civic">civic</a> events.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been various female versions of the Sextet such as 'The Six Tits', 'The Short and Girlies' and 'The Sexytet'. The female groups have not developed a tradition to rival the male Sextet.</p>
<p>Some well-known former members of the Sextet are: Mayor of Dunedin Peter Chin, Dunedin Composer Richard Madden, Lucern-based singer Martin Snell and London-based singer Jonathan Lemalu.</p>

<p>Heat Rate 101: The basics Heat rate refers to the efficiency of an electric generating plant. Essentially, it is an expression of the number of MMBtus of natural gas that are needed to generate 1 kW of electricity. The lower the heat rate, the more efficient the plant and the higher the heat rate, the less efficient the plant. In Texas, marginal heat rates are generally lower in the winter and higher in the summer due seasonal differences in demand. Generally speaking, heat rates in the Texas market starting in May 2002 have remained between 7.7 and 9, which is fairly stable. These stable heat rates reflect two unique characteristics in the Texas market—excess capacity of approximately 35%1 and the fact that the recently constructed plants have been efficient users of natural gas.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Natural gas is also tied to heat rate because as natural gas prices increase, this creates an incentive for generators to run their most efficient generating units at higher capacity.2 This drives down heat rates as less efficient plants are run less often. Conversely, when gas rates are lower, generators will tend to run less efficient, older plants. From an economic standpoint, this makes sense, as a generator’s total cost to run older plants is lower because they have recovered the construction costs of the facility whereas the newer, more efficient plants have greater capital costs associated with them that must be recovered.</p>
<p>The above graph confirms two basic premises of the heat rate product. First, marginal heat rates in ERCOT since the summer of 2002 have tended to fluctuate between 7.7 and 9. Excess capacity and the movement of the natural gas market have been the key drivers in this fluctuation. Second, there is an inverse relationship between heat rate and natural gas prices.</p>
<p>Using a heat rate product for a retail electric contract A heat rate product in a retail electric contract determines final price through a formula. The customer selects a heat rate, typically between 8 and 9. The retail electric provider then provides an “adder” which will, in conjunction with the heat rate and natural gas price, determine the final cost of the electricity supplied under the agreement. The adder covers the retailer’s ancillary services, congestion costs, unaccounted for energy (UFE) costs, back office support, and margin. The customer then chooses a day on which to lock in natural gas for a period of time, which can range from one month to the complete term of the contract. Multiplying the heat rate by the price of natural gas and adding the adder to this result determine the final price. For instance, if a heat rate of 8.5 is chosen with an adder of $20 and the natural gas price is $6.00/MmBtu, then the cost for electricity would be $71/ MWh, or $.071/kwh.3 Understanding what the heat rate of a plant signifies as well as the relationship between natural gas prices and heat rates in the Texas market is an important first step for determining whether the benefits of a heat rate product outweigh the negatives</p>
<p>Heat rate products: Pros and cons In the Texas market, as natural gas prices go, so go electric power prices. In fact, there is a 90%+ correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in the ERCOT region.4 This means, especially in a market with excess supply such that generation is readily available, that the cost of natural gas will be the predominant determinant of the cost of electricity at both the wholesale and retail levels.</p>
<p><br />
Pro: Heat Rate offers increased customer control over final pricing The main advantage of a heat rate product is that it allows the customer increased flexibility to determine their final price when compared with a traditional fixed price product. This is especially important in the Texas market where gas prices are a significant determinant of overall electric costs. Assume that a customer enters in to a fixed price agreement on a Wednesday when the price of natural gas is $6.00/MMBtu on the 12-month strip. This would generate a fixed price of around $.066/kwh5 including all ancillary and other energy related charges.</p>
<p>Suppose that same customer enters in to a 12-month contract for a heat rate product. The heat rate is 8.5 and the adder is $16.50. The customer waits a week for the 12-month strip to fall. The strip moves down to $5.50/MMBtu when the customer decides to lock in gas. The total cost under the heat rate product would be $.063/kwh. This is a total decrease of 4.5%. Assuming an annual electric bill of $1,000,000, the customer has saved $45,000 on their electric costs alone. This cost savings was generated when the gas market moved down over 8%, meaning that the customer was able to capture a little more than half of the downward movement in the natural gas market.</p>
<p>Of course, the more sophisticated the customer, the more the customer is able to take advantage of this situation. Using the same heat rate contract from above, assume that the customer only locks in the first 6 months of the contract price at $5.50/MMBtu and the second six months at $5.25/MMBtu. The price for the first 6 months would be $.063/kwh and the cost for the second six months would be $.061/kwh. The average price that the customer would pay under this arrangement is $.062/kwh. This would generate a total savings of 5.75% versus the fixed rate contract. Using the same estimated spend, this would generate a savings of $57,500 per year.</p>
<p>As the above examples illustrate, a heat rate contract enables the customer to better control the price and to take advantage of downward movement in the gas market. However, there are potential pitfalls to this product that are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p><br />
Cons: Increased costs and risk for the customer, with no additional benefit While a heat rate contract can provide additional savings by allowing a customer to wait and lock in the natural gas price component of the total electric costs at a time when the market is falling, a heat rate product entails substantial risk. This risk manifests itself in three ways—first, what happens if the gas market moves against the end-user; second, the heat rate product makes it more difficult for the end user to budget their electric costs, and third, the customer does not have unlimited flexibility in a heat rate contract resulting in the customer being forced to take electricity at higher rates. Finally, there are contract tools available to customers to take advantage of decreases in the price of natural gas without incurring the risks associated with a heat rate product.</p>
<p>First con: The gas market moves against the customer In the above examples, the gas market moved down, meaning that the customer was able to secure a lower price through the heat rate product versus a traditional fixed cost contract. However, assume that the gas price increased during the heat rate deal. Once again, using the numbers above, if gas increased to $7.00/MMBtu from $6.00/MMBtu at the date the contract was signed, the price for electricity would be $.076/kwh. This is an increase of almost 15% in electric costs as a result of the gas market increasing by approximately 16%. This also illustrates that the customer’s price will move in almost direct correlation with the natural gas market if the natural gas market moves up while capturing only about half the percentage decrease if the natural gas market moves down.</p>
<p>In a fixed price contract, the customer would have no risk and all the risk would be on the retailer. If the retailer did not completely hedge the contract at the time it was closed, meaning that they did not buy all the gas they needed to generate the customer’s electric needs, the retailer would suffer the loss instead of the customer. Of course, retailers will typically be more financially sophisticated and have hedging instruments in place that would prevent, or at least mitigate, this loss.</p>
<p>There are options available to customers to guard against this kind of loss. Customers can purchase caps6 on the natural gas price such that it never exceeds a certain value. Suppose that the customer in the above example purchased a cap at $6.50. This would result in an overall electric cost of $.071/kwh, resulting in approximately an 8% increase in costs, corresponding to the increase in the price of natural gas. Of course, there will be additional costs because the retailer will have built in the cost for the caps on natural gas. Even more disconcerting is that if the natural gas market never reaches the level of the caps, the customer has paid for something that is useless.</p>
<p>Second Con: Budgetary Uncertainty One of the most troubling aspects of the heat rate contract is the budgetary uncertainty it engenders. A customer’s total electric cost consists of the price per unit and the volume. In a fixed rate contract, the customer knows the total costs and can use historical load data as a proxy for anticipated consumption. This allows the customer to predict their total electric costs with some level of certainty. However, in a heat rate contract, especially one where the cost may change several times, budgetary certainty is far from assured. For instance, in a 12-month contract, if the customer locks in half of the contract when the natural gas price strip for the next six months is $6.00/MMBtu, the customer will pay $.0675/kwh for the first half of the contract. If, when the customer decides to trigger the natural gas price for the second half of the contract, the price has increased to $6.33/MMBtu, the customer will now pay $.07/kwh. In other words, the cost of electricity may change in a heat rate product and the only way to obtain budgetary certainty is to look back after the contract is over and determine the actual costs.</p>
<p>Third Con: Flexibility is not always available Implicit in the above examples is the assumption that the customer has the ability to lock in the natural gas price component of the electric costs at any time. However, this is not an entirely accurate assumption. At some point, the gas price will have to become fixed. This will typically occur when the natural gas contract for prompt month closes on the exchange. If the customer fails to lock in the natural gas price before that time, they are stuck with the monthly closing price. Depending on the structure of the contract, the closing price may apply only to the next month or for the entire contract term. This can be especially detrimental if a customer was waiting for the natural gas market to hit a target price.</p>
<p>Alternative contract structure: Similar results without the risk The great advantage of the heat rate product is that gives the customer the ability to take advantage of a decrease in the cost of natural gas, especially in Texas. However, the Texas market has already evolved to offer a product with similar results without the risks. This can be accomplished through a “blend and extend”. Basically, this contract structure allows the customer to extend their contract beyond the initial term in exchange for a lower rate for the remainder of the term of the initial contract as well as a lower rate for the extension period. This allows a customer to take advantage of a decline in the price of natural gas while not exposing the customer to all of the risks associated with a heat rate contract.</p>
<p>A “blend and extend” option is actually attractive to both the customer and the retailer. It benefits the customer by lowering their costs and helps the retailer by avoiding any additional costs associated with capturing the customer again when the current contract expires.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The risks outweigh the benefits Retailers in the Texas market promote heat rate products by telling customers that these contracts give them more control over their final electric costs and empower them to take advantage of decreases in the natural gas market. However, the risks of this contract structure—cost increases if the price of natural gas increases, lack of budgetary certainty, and limited flexibility in terms of locking in electric costs—outweigh the potential benefit, especially because the benefits of a heat rate contract can be obtained without the risk through the use of blend and extend contracts. For buyers in Texas considering heat rate products, the adage caveat emptor should take on a whole new meaning.</p>

See ERCOT Report on the Capacity, Demand, and Reserves in the ERCOT Region, May 2003, pages 4-8. 2 Another factor influencing this dynamic is the decision to run alternative sources of generation as the marginal cost to run the gas plants becomes more expensive. 3 The formula works as follows: (8.5 * 6) + 20= 51+ 20=$71/MWh, or .0071/kwh. 4 Testimony of PUCT Chairman Rebecca Klein, Texas House Committee on Regulated Industries, February 25, 2003. 5 This number is based on numbers actually provided for a customer’s load. 6 This is essentially a call option meaning that the retailer will purchase an option to call for a certain amount of gas at this price. If natural gas never reaches this price, the option will never be exercised.</p>

A conscious endeavour is made to exploit the pre-verbal modes of communication that the group believes are deeply embedded in all human beings: sound, music and dance.</p>

<p><br />
<b>CAREER</b></p>
<p>Artist, Studio in Verona, NJ, June 1991 to Present; Currently works in oil, acrylic, encaustic and alternate materials on canvas and hard substrates, paper works, wall mounted and free-standing sculpture.</p>
<p><b>Biograpy</b></p>
<p>“The earliest memory I have of working at art, is from sometime around the age of five. I drew a baker in his kitchen and was going to give it to a friend of mine, but never did. I think I still have it somewhere."</p>
<p><br />
Jo Motyka received his Bachelor of Arts degree from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montclair_State_College_0eb6.html" title="Montclair State College">Montclair State College</a> in 1991, with concentrations in drawing, painting and color theory. This was the last time he had an institutionalized format of study in the arts. Well before the end of his college studies he had developed a reputation as one of Calcia Fine Arts Department’s most prominent members and was one of the longest consecutively showing student artists. During the years between 1989 and 1992, Motyka participated in a number of well-received exhibitions.</p>
<p><br />
“I felt I had a rather unique position in college. I had held a job relating to the arts since I was in high school and I found that this gave me a slight advantage over many of the people who were studying with me. By the end of my college career I was helping to manage what was, at the time, a pretty good art gallery that also did art auctions as well as off-the-wall sales. When an artist approached the gallery I was one of the people who would give the thumbs up or down to all their hard work. All we had to do was say yes or no-nothing more. We either said we could sell their work, directed them to another gallery that we thought could sell their work with a recommendation if we liked them, without, if we just wanted to get rid of them but still be nice. But, most often we just told them that we didn't think that we could sell their work. Some we just plainly dismissed from the gallery floor. So when everyone who took fine arts like I did, thought that they were going to be the next big thing after graduation from the artist mill, well, I just turned my part time job into a full time one, at least it was one in the arts."</p>
<p><br />
Upon completion of his Bachelors in 1991 he took a full-time position at David Gary, Ltd. that soon placed him in the number two position. It would not be until he left the employ of for profit gallery culture in 1997 that new horizons in the art world would be realized. At the time, the artist undertook a small number of transitional works in an effort to fill the gap that time had left from his last portfolio without having a giant leap of progression to account for in imagery or statement.</p>
<p>Concurrently another transition was taking place. Motyka left his gallery position and formed a company of his own, Äpomo, Associates. Seeking to broaden his prospects, he took a position with Professionals for Non-Profits (PNP), a NYC based agency that provided temps exclusively to non- profits; from cultural centers to major museums and international philanthropic institutions. PNP was his first real insider's view into the museum culture, its workings and the people who worked in it. Within the year, Motyka had left PNP and went to work independently for institutions such as The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Museum_8b84.html" title="Jewish Museum">Jewish Museum</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_6786.html" title="The Metropolitan Museum of Art">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and privately for a gambit of clients that range from collectors to the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation.</p>
<p><br />
“I had been dealing in the light restoration of paintings since 1989 and more extensive restorations since 1992. I studied the practices of Gustav Berger, the internationally recognized painting conservator and theorist in the field, but have mainly used the traditional methods employed by Max Doerner, the noted professor of The Academy of Fine Arts in Munich at the turn of the last century. I just sort of picked it up and then set about trying to get better at it because I was interested in restoration, just to see if I could do it. I spent a number of years studying rather esoteric books and papers on the subject. My attempts to put out a transitional portfolio chronically fell along the wayside. From 1997 to the middle of 2000, my artwork was going nowhere at all. I did a couple of pieces now and again, but nothing was right on. Then it dawned on me that maybe the materials that were used for my restoration projects could be manipulated to construct my art."</p>
<p><br />
In March of 2000 Motyka turned to the world of high end picture framing at Knight Works, framers catering to a very select client base in NYC such as: <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_Bourgeois_bc78.html" title="Louise Bourgeois">Louise Bourgeois</a>, Cheim and Read, Todd Eberle, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Erwitt_35ab.html" title="Elliott Erwitt">Elliott Erwitt</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Fuss_112d.html" title="Adam Fuss">Adam Fuss</a>, Houk Gallery, Pace MacGill, Robert Miller Gallery, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Webber_a378.html" title="Bruce Webber">Bruce Webber</a>, as well as the estates of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Arbus_246f.html" title="Diane Arbus">Diane Arbus</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Michel_Basquiat_67ad.html" title="Jean Michel Basquiat">Jean Michel Basquiat</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mapplethorpe_62c0.html" title="Robert Mapplethorpe">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Haring_fd19.html" title="Keith Haring">Keith Haring</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. Also during this time, Motyka taught a gallery and museum studies class at <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Paterson_University_4e4f.html" title="William Paterson University">William Paterson University</a> and was the Student Projects Coordinator of their Power Arts Center, during of the fall and spring of 2000 - 01 semesters.</p>
<p><br />
“So here I am, the new adjunct for the fall semester for a class that was originally taught by the Dean of Fine Art, no pressure. I haven't produced any real artwork in years and I've committed to Midland Gallery of Montclair for a works on paper show in October of 2000, a media I haven't worked in actively for many years, no pressure. My nine to five job is slowly killing me mentally and physically, it's only a question of time before my head or body quits. Pressure, there's a lot of pressure."</p>
<p><br />
In August 2001, Motyka returned to work on his own art making. By October the first elements of his latest work were being unveiled to the public, with an overwhelming response. The work consisting of mainly encaustic and resins on linen and cotton canvas. More works on paper and a number of encaustic and resins encapsulations of found object assemblage sculptures were now in the process of being completed for 2002. Over the summer of 2002 the first showings of the new portfolio began at Midland Gallery with the portfolio being shopped around to New York Galleries for the first time in years by the fall.</p>
<p><br />
‘I remember the first time I met Ivan Karp. I was meeting a friend outside his gallery, O.K. Harris in SOHO. I knew a bit about him from art history classes and books, but after all these years had never been inside the gallery – I had been in the cigar shop that is built in to the front of the gallery, but never the gallery itself. He was standing in the foyer of the gallery mopping the floor, in his <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks_Brothers_a835.html" title="Brooks Brothers">Brooks Brothers</a> suit, smoking a cigar; little did he know or care that I was stalking him today for a review of my work. The gallery prides itself on reviewing everything that it is sent to them, but only affiliates about one in ten thousand applicants. This was my first day out of the house with the new portfolio in hand and when I had a good look around and he was back at his desk, I presented my portfolio for his review and asked him to send it back to me when he was done with it. To my surprise he said, “Let’s do this now, just give me a minute to look this over.” I just walked off nonchalantly to look ant some photographs in the back galley and thought ‘Boy he can’t wait to kick me in the ball today, can he!” As it turned out he called me back over and said,”Mr. Motyka, I see something here.’ to my further surprise. He asked me, “You live in Verona?’ I replied, “Yes.”, he continued, “Your studio’s in Verona?’, I, “Yes!”, he said, “Well I ain’t going to Verona, but you get together some work to bring in and I’ll look at it, also take this to Stephen Heller and tell him I sent you and he should have a look at this it’s just his thing and get some others to come and see the work at the same time.” “OK.”, I said, and thanked him for his consideration. Now I didn’t get a show right off the back…..It took quite a bit of not so gentle persuasion to get Ivan to come see the work, especially since we couldn’t get anybody to come out and view the work with him; it is nearly imposable to get two art dealer’s schedules to sync at the same time even if they were mildly interested in the first place. Eventually we coxed Ivan into a meeting, at the <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> building, in mid-town Manhattan and in fifteen minutes he declared to all present that I was to have a show within the next year or two……..this was going to be a rough couple of years.’</p>
<p><br />
In the early part of 2003 a number of the Paper were exhibited at Midland Gallery. The fall of 2003 fostered new wall mounted and paper works and early in 2004, Innuta, a NYC design firm, incorporated a number of Motyka’s works into their collection at their East Village location. More and more research and technical development of paints and finishing was the total focus now that the O.K. Harris show had been set for the first month of 2006. In the late spring of 2004, a number of large scale canvases where accompanied by a series of large works on paper. A small selection of these works on paper where shown first at Midland Gallery in 2005. One of the largest paintings from this time, ’Mass Yellow Field’ was to be included as part of Motyka’s largest show to date at O.K. Harris. In 2005 we also saw the launch of a new web site for the artist, [http//www.jomotyka.com].</p>
<p>The exhibit had full page ads for January in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artforum.html" title="Artforum">Artforum</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_in_America_2d8a.html" title="Art in America">Art in America</a> and the December/January issue of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Painters_efaf.html" title="Modern Painters">Modern Painters</a> magazines and ran from January 14th – February 11th of 2006. The schedule also included galleries of work by Richard Friedberg, Moses Hoskins, Lilyan Aloma, &amp; Ellen Stavitsky. Motyka’s exhibition of large abstract paintings, comprised layers of powdered pigment and glass in polyurethane and methyl-cellulose on canvas and medium density fiberboard, where in, the artist imparts brush stroke and pallet knife effects that build the layers of the work and then uses physical and chemical reduction of the materials that enhance the monochromatic surface of the painting. The series of works formed the back bone of the show at Harris.</p>
<p><br />
‘Together we brought in some one thousand people, by Ivan’s estimation that first night and between three to five hundred people on the subsequent Saturdays. Sales were dismal though nothing went and only local press coverage, don’t get me wrong the news stories were great some of the best writing that I’ve ever seen on the work, they just didn’t get very far a field. Knight Landsman stopped in at some point and left me a note that he enjoyed the work and requested that I keep him apprised of my future endeavors which was nice of him, but I found a number of bones to pick with the ‘NYC Metro Area’ out of work poets that fashion themselves ‘Art Critics’ and told one or two what I thought of the bullshit that surrounds them and makes fertile their subsidiary existence.’</p>
<p><br />
January of 2006 was to be spent in research and reflection, but two new works on wood panel somehow came to light and are on displayed over the summer with a few works of paper and sculpture at Midland Gallery. The second work in The <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medusa.html" title="Medusa">Medusa</a> Series is set for production over this same time period and should be on offer for viewing sometime in the fall of 2006.</p>

<p>The Brick Project is a website that allows kids from different countries to communicate to each other via message boards. Tis is not to be confused with a regular online chat room; this is a website that spans from the USA to countries like Kenya, Poland and China. The topics relate to each countiy's culture, and worldwide problems like child slavery and global warming. The way countires are added are by 'bricks'. Each brick has four countires in it. Each brick communicates within it on topics like the ones listed above. Each year, new bricks are added. The goal of the Brick Project is to aquire as many bricks as possible, and to keep up the Project for as long as humanly possible.</p>

<p>The French Federation of <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_Science_89c8.html" title="Cognitive Science">Cognitive Science</a> Students and Young Researchers (Fresco) regroups, in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, all the associations of Cognitive Science Students and Cognitive Science young researchers.</p>
<p>The Fresco is a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit-making_organization.html" title="Non-profit-making organization">Non-profit-making organization</a>, directed only by students and young researchers (PhD) who are, for most of them, voluntaries &amp; unpaid people.</p>
<p>Playing a hard role in the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdisciplinarity.html" title="Interdisciplinarity">interdisciplinary approach</a> of the Cognition study (cause of the french disciplinary traditions), the Fresco have the ambitious goal of keeping its community the most dynamic it can.</p>
<p>For it, since the middle of the 90's, the founding members of the federation organize the young researchers [<a href="http://fresco.risc.cnrs.fr/CJCSC_2007/|french" class="external text" title="http://fresco.risc.cnrs.fr/CJCSC_2007/|french" rel="nofollow">Cognitive Science symposium</a>]. That's the organisation of that <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symposium.html" title="Symposium">Symposium</a> that federated some young researchers. In 2002, they've created the Fresco which officialy exists since the 2003 year.</p>
<p>Now they've diversificate, and are still diversificating, their activities just keeping one only goal that contains several sub-goals: to make growing an unbreakable interdiscplinary, dynamic, creative, interactive, french community around the cognitive science fields. To achieve this goal, they are organizing: - the annual organisation of the <a href="http://cognivence.risc.cnrs.fr/projets/forum2006/|National" class="external text" title="http://cognivence.risc.cnrs.fr/projets/forum2006/|National" rel="nofollow">(french) Cognitive Science Forum</a> (CSF/FSC), that is the biggest ever seen event around the cognitive science in France - during each november, an annual french young researchers conference - the elaboration, in colaboration withe the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) of a database of all <a href="http://www.risc.cnrs.fr/formations.php|vocationals" class="external text" title="http://www.risc.cnrs.fr/formations.php|vocationals" rel="nofollow">trainings in France</a>. That database is still operational and will be probably internationalized. Next step? - the elaboration of a dedicated website to "enterprises and professions behind the Cognitive Sciences" (not finished in 2006 september) - the elaboration of a tool (an other database in fact) to follow the professional becoming of ex-students in Cognitive Science. (not finished in 2006 september) - a logistic and intellectual help for all its members (associations) - mobilisation of new groups of students and young researchers in the cities where there aren't any Cognitive Science Students or young researchers association - the publication of the youngs cognitician's magazine</p>
<p>and several others activities, always with the same goal.</p>

<p>In 2004, the European Community passed directive 2002/95/EC, which is also known as the "RHoS" directive. It requires manufacturers of eletrical and electronic equipment to remove certain harmful materials from all their products. These materials are:</p>
<p>- Lead - Mercuray - Cadmium - Hexavalent Chromium - some Brominated Flame Retardants (PBBs) - Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs).</p>
<p>The directive went in effect on July 1st 2006. As of this date, no electronic product may be sold in the European Union which contains any of these components.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-02_442b.html" title="Edit section: Sohail Rana">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sohail Rana</span></h2>
<p>Sohail Rana, who is the son of renowned poet Rana Akbar Abadi, was born in his native city,<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, in 1938, to a highly literary, academic and respectable family.</p>
<p>Rana Akbar Abadi migrated to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.Soon after partition, young Sohail, who was in his ninth year at that time, resumed his education and subsequently passed his intermediate examination.</p>
<p>He demonstrated an unusual aptitude for music as a teenager. He learned music from various experts and familiarized himself with numerous musical instruments, which added to his experience.</p>
<p>During his primary education days, he was admitted to late A.M. Qureshi's Mary Colaso School, Karachi, where Sohail Rana and <a href="../../../w/a/h/Waheed_Murad_4ed2.html" title="Waheed Murad">Waheed Murad</a> were class fellows.</p>
<p>Thus started a durable friendship between them, which lasted up until Veedu's death in 1983.</p>
<p>Although Waheed Murad's first film as a producer ‘Insaan badalta hai', (Director: Munawwar Rasheed, music: Zafar Khursheed) was a success, still the music could not come upto the expectations.</p>
<p>Hence, for his second production, ‘Jab say dekha hai tumhain', Waheed made two changes: He selected Zeba instead of Shamim Ara as the lead lady and handed over the delicate task of music to promising Sohail Rana, instead of Zafar Khursheed.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, ‘Jab say dekha hai tumhain' was far more successful for its melodious songs than ‘Insaan badalta hai.'</p>
<p>Huge audience were drawn to its two highly popular numbers:</p>
<p>‘Ye khushi ajab khushi hai' (singer: Ahmed Rushdi) ‘Jab say dekha hai tumhain, dil ka ajab Aalam hai (singer: Saleem Raza)</p>
<p>Movie zealots agree that ‘Jab say dekha hai tumhain' proved to be a stepping stone in the fabulous career of Sohail Rana.</p>
<p>Readers, let us draw near and listen to his gift:</p>
<p>Ko-ko- korina, Bay taab ho udhar tum, Jab pyar mein do dil miltay hain'</p>
<p>In 1964, Sohail Rana composed the super hit songs for the golden jubilee film, ‘Heera aur pathar'. That is part of what sets the quality so far above its competition.</p>
<p>Its music is so innately appealing, so fresh-spirited, that one has to admit that the standards were set for a much grander scale.</p>
<p>‘Heera aur pathar' became a musical phenomenon, and Sohail Rana became a necessity in the burgeoning music industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, he accepted every new challenge which required a concerted effort and always came out with the appropriate stuff, what people wanted to hear.</p>
<p>By the mid-sixties, Sohail Rana had become such a success, where he was able to fathom the depths of emotions through his musical masterpieces.</p>
<p>At the end of every accomplishment, he raised his levels of aspiration and expectation. One could discern that every piece of music were torn straight from his soul.</p>
<p>Sohail Rana earned plaudits from his fans for the superb composition of ‘Mujhay tum say mohabbat hai' (Film: ‘Heera aur pathar' singers: Ahmed Rushdi-Najma Niazi) which figuratively added fresh elements to his stew.</p>
<p>Pakistan's first platinum jubilee film, ‘Armaan' was released in 1966, which may be the finest and most gripping movie to date.</p>
<p>It is an epic tale of broken hearts and broken dreams.</p>
<p>Sohail Rana's excellent composition for the songs of ‘Armaan' are, indeed, his greatest achievement as a music director, which will stand as a musical high point as long as the Pakistan film industry exists.</p>
<p>Further, he won the Nigar and graduate award for the best composer for the film ‘Armaan'.</p>
<p>Furthermore, movies like ‘Heera aur pathar' and ‘Armaan' also shows that the best of the human soul has not yet died.</p>
<p>According to the proponents of music, Sohail Rana's contribution to the cause of music is immense and that it ranks him among the most acclaimed composers in Pakistani music history.</p>
<p>To listen to the musical genius, Sohail Rana, is an experience like no other.</p>
<p>Over and above, his compositions seems to echo his sentiments.</p>
<p>By the end of 1966, music maestro, Sohail Rana, had reached his zenith with astonishing rapidity.</p>
<p>In the words of the film journalists of the 1960s. ‘Sohail Rana is growing by, well leaps and bounds'.</p>
<p>Parables of love, vividly caught by Sohail Rana, while composing the songs like ‘Akele na jana', not only brought fresh laurels to him but also rekindled the old flames which is much easier with Sohail Rana's music than one may think.</p>
<p>The rhythm of sound is music and Sohail Rana can best be described as maestro of the music.</p>
<p>His is a music which can lift people above particular circumstances and inspire them.</p>
<p>Sohail Rana, who is widely known as an extremely decent human being, worked diligently and came out with yet more superfluous compositions for the film ‘Ehsaan' in 1967. The idea which keeps him motivated is the glory of his remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>His charm and musical virtuosity had won every heart.</p>
<p>The film ‘Ehsaan' attained silver jubilee with such favorites as ‘Ik naye maur pay', ‘Aye mere zindigi aye meray hum safar', ‘Do akhian, ye do sakhian'.</p>
<p>Sohail Rana's musical career is a success story with few parallels. Celebrated composer, Sohail Rana, unleashed all his artistic talents, while composing songs for the film ‘Doraha': ‘Mujhay tum nazar say gira to rahay ho', ‘Bhooli huwee hoon dastaan' ‘tumhain kaisay bata doon tum meri manzil ho'</p>
<p>The songs he composed for ‘Doraha' also evinces that he is an extraordinary musician and an authority of the highly specialized realm of composition, where his competency and artistic skills are unmatched.</p>
<p>His adorers are surrounded by a lifetime of numerous memories of his immortal compositions.</p>
<p>Over the years, he worked his magic throughout Pakistan and across the borders. His magnificent compositions for the Nazm ‘Qasm us waqt ki, jab zindigi karwat badalti hai'(film: ‘Qasam us waqt ki'(Director: A.G. Kardar,Lyricist: Josh Malih Abadi, singer: Mujeeb Alam) is a corner stone of Pakistani entertainment, that reflect reality.</p>
<p>He produced lilting music for director Pervez Malik's movie, ‘Meray hum safar', three of its popular numbers are listed here below:</p>
<p>‘Wada karo milo gey' (Mujeeb Alam) ‘Hai bay qarar tamanna' (Mujeeb Alam) ‘Tujh jaisa dagha baaz' (Runa Laila)</p>
<p>In 1970, he composed songs for the film ‘Baazi', two of those songs were recorded in the voice of Habib Wali Mohammad, namely, ‘Raatain theen chandni' and ‘Aashiyaan jal gaya', which happened to be inspirational entertainment.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that if some one were to ask Sohail Rana what he thanks God for most, then presumably his answer would be that he would thank God, for giving him the gift of composing songs and the ability to listen to them.</p>
<p>During the early 1970s, he took a job with the Pakistan television corporation and redoubled his efforts to compose national songs.</p>
<p>His musical masterpieces, ‘Sohni dharti' (singer: Shehnaz Begum, lyricist: Masroor Anwar) has become part and parcel of Pakistani culture.</p>
<p>Additionally, he devoted his time and energy to compose songs for children and immortalized each and every song:</p>
<p>‘Sung sung chaltay rehna'. ‘Dosti aisa nata'. ‘Shawa bhy shawa'.</p>
<p>Given here below are the names of some of Sohail Rana's bright students who attained name and fame for themselves and for their mentor, as well.</p>
<p>Riffat. Late Nazia Hassan. Zohaib Hassan. Afshan Ahmed. Nazneen. Fatima Jafry. Tehseen Javed. Yusuf memon (Who achieved fame in mahafil-e-na'at and milad)</p>
<p>The film ‘Badal aur bijli' was a huge success, essentially due to Sohail Rana's effective music.</p>
<p>‘Badal aur bijli's all time favorites:</p>
<p>‘Bansiri bajanay walay' (Noor Jehan) ‘Aaj janay ki zid na karo' (Habib Wali Mohammad) ‘Dheeray, dheeray paoon rakh gori' (Runa Laila) are still fresh in the minds of theater cine-goers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, he also rendered music for the films ‘Phir chand niklay ga,' Esay dekha esay chaha', ‘Sau diwanay' and ‘Shehnai'</p>
<p>He did worked at the art academy of Pakistan international airlines for a while.</p>
<p>Sohail Rana is still boyish of expression at 63, and smile lines radiate from his eyes which are bright with inquisitiveness and beaming with pride.</p>
<p>Moosa Reza, a loyal fan of Sohail Saheb and an authority on him,as well, asserts: 'A nation is,indeed,very poor, which do not value its artists and in case of Sohail Rana, the music lovers should be all the more indebted to this extraordinary composer, because Sohail Rana not only impressed his contemporaries but he has proved resourceful, ingenious and pioneering.</p>
<p>Moving beyond songs, Sohail Rana had the common touch and he used it well, perhaps, peerlessly so. He paved the way for the launches of numerous jingles for the commercial companies and most conspicuous among them was an advertisement for Binaca.</p>
<p>During his twenty five monumentally influential years as a composer, he also composed a national song 'Allah-o-Akbar for the Pakistan television corporation.</p>
<p>Pakistan's most powerful purveyor of popular music, all his compositions carry a sweet,open tone and a freshness that never sounds forced.</p>
<p>He lent background music for the documentary film 'Moenjodaro'.</p>
<p>Beloved by audiences as well as a new generation of listeners, Sohail Rana had a knack for finding the best in music.</p>
<p>Consequently he received the prestigious Presidential award of excellence, EMI gold disc award for the vinyl album,'Khyber Mail' and also the United Nations peace messenger award.</p>
<p>Along the way, he achieved legendary status by influencing and shaping the Pakistani culture- He participated and represented Pakistan in various international music festivals.Prominent among them were jashn-e-Kabul (1977) Carnival,Australia,(1978), Cultural Troupe,Fiji islands (1981), Cultural Troupe to Romania and Russia (1983) Children festival,Jordan (1987), Pacific traditional music,China (1987).</p>
<p>Sohail Rana is a flame.It is a flame that burned its best and brightest for over two decades.During which he served in the ministry of culture as director general (1976-78) and headed the project of national orchestra and choral ensemble of Pakistan.</p>
<p>He has done what I do not think anybody else has done: be victorious in both Urdu and English films:His superfluous composition for Javed Jabbar's bilingual movie, 'Musafir' , whose English version 'Beyond the last mountain'is the first Pakistani film produced in English language.</p>
<p>Moreover, 'Beyond the last mountain' won the critical acclaim by the renowned Indian actor,Raj Kapoor, at the Bombay film festival.</p>
<p>The film 'Hesaab' which was released in 1986, happened to be the last movie for which Sohail Rana composed songs.</p>
<p>The choices he made, helped ignite a renaissance of quality that lives on today.</p>
<p>During his memorable music career,he composed songs for merely twenty five movies.Two of those movies, 'Guriya' and 'Pagal' could not be released.However, popular numbers from the film 'Guriya' are available on cassettes and vinyl EPs.</p>
<p><br />
Though Sohail Rana has settled in Canada and does not take active participation in music today, the human spark, spirit, compassion, love and understanding which are the basic ingredients of his music and which have been imbibed in the hearts of a myriad of music lovers the world over, will never go away.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-02_442b.html" title="Edit section: Dick Scott, Music Busines Icon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dick Scott, Music Busines Icon</span></h2>
<p>In 1989 and 1990, Mr. Dick Scott was named "Manager of the Year" by the music industry Poll Star Magazine. It was not only a title for which he had worked diligently - it was an honor for which he had prepared exetensively and richly deserved.</p>
<p>Dick Scott has been the manager of some of the hottest and most successful artists in the music business. In Fact, he is known throughout the industryas a merchandising and marketing genius. One of his great successes was the management of The New Kids On The Block, who made merchandising history by generating more than $800 million dollars in merchandising income alone in 1990. His concepts revolutionized the way recording artist and motion picturea are now being marketed. Some of his other successful artists have included; Boyz II Men, Marky Mark, James Ingram, Patti Austin and Teddy Riley, all of whom continue to have distinguished careers.</p>
<p>In short, Dick Scott not only knows, but understands talent and its requirements to be nurtured. Having worked in nearly all aspects of the music business, he has guided artists to achieve more than they even dreamed of doing.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott's path to artistic management and development began in Macon, Georgia. Although he graduated from the historic Talladega College with a degree in chemistry, his love for music and drama won out and set him on his course. Among his many early endeavors, he served as a Band Director at his former high school, organized a touring A'cappella chorus for the military; and became Assistant to the President and Director od Public Relations for Talladega College.</p>
<p>In 1960 he moved to Detroit, Michigan, and after serving as the Assistant to the President of the Detroit Institute of Commerce became the Assistant Station Manager at WCHB-WCHD FM Radio Station - the first Black owned and operated radio station in the country. Incidentally, it was during this period that Dick honed his merchandising and marketing skills by developing concepts for the station that won many national merchandising awards.</p>
<p>He then joined the staff of Motown records as Assistant to President Barry Gordy, and ultimately became the road manager to the number one female singing group of all time - The Supremes. He then went on to a string of achievement. He became the first black manager of the Michigan State Fair, including responsibility for overall entertainment and space allocation. Next, he was the Director of Administration for CBS Records (now Sony Music), which then became the most successful marketer of Black Music in the history of the music business.</p>
<p>Deciding to get involed with the motion picture production, Dick moved to Los Angeles to gain knowledge of the film business. He aligned himself with Martin Poll, considered to be the Dean of Hollywood Producers, where Dick learned the business from his most repected mentor. His first original idea was bought by Universal Studios and palced in development. Recently, he joined forces with long-time friend Russell Rocke, and acquired the rights to "Tom", the best selling biography of Tennessee Williams, which they palm to film, either as a motion picture or as a television documentary or mini series. Going back to his roots in Macon, Georgia, he is planning a film based on the amazing story of the Douglas family, who created a touring show called "Salas Greene from New Orleans." This touring show show palyed all over America traveling via a lavish railroad train, which served as living quarters, rehearsal space and tranportation. During this period, Blacks were not allowed accommodations in major hotels.</p>
<p>Dick is an amazing writer and conceptualist himself, but has surrounded himself with brilliant young witers with whom he served as mentors. Several scripts by his group are in development and are being submitted. It is generally agreed that his entry into the film business will be as spectacular and successful as his other ventures.</p>
<p>As a Producer, Dick has been responsible for several acclaimed productions:</p>
<p>At the historic Pasadena Playhouse his 1996 production of Larry Hart's "Sisterella" became the most successful production in the eighty-year-old history of the Playhouse. The following year, the life story of the famous sisters, The Emotions, who became platinum selling recording artists, was told in an oringinal musical, "Bigger Than Bubblegum". It too, was an acclaimed success at Pasadena and subsequently palyed Lincoln Center in New York.</p>
<p>The next Dick Production being prepared for the Los Angeles area is "Ciao Bella" written by and starring an amazing actor and singer, Karen Abercrombie. Dick will also direct this production.</p>
<p>Barry Gordy, founder of Motwon, often says that Dick Scott was the most brilliant and talented person who ever worked for him. His list of current projects is extensive and all of the best quality, and emphasize Mr. Scott's high caliber, quietly effective, consistent, and perseverant approaches to approaches to achieving success in the entertainment business.</p>
<p>Dick Scott is survived by one son, Furqan Raschke of My World Entertainment. Furqan has followed in his father footsteps and has managed several successful artists and is on his way to several of his own sucesses.</p>

<p>Longtime record executive Richard "Dick" Scott passed away Tuesday, August 29, 2006 after a long illness in Los Angeles.

<p>In addition, he was a trailblazer, launching some of the early corporate/brand marketing deals in this industry.

<p>MARKY MARK AND THE FUNKY BUNCH</p>
<p>Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch are Mark Wahlberg (alias Marky Mark), Scott Ross (alias Scottie Gee), Hector Barros (alias Hector the bootie inspector), Terry Yancey (alias DJ-T) and Anthony Thomas (alias Ashey Ace).</p>
<p>Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch were founded by, then New Kid, Donnie Wahlberg in 1990. Donnie also produced much of the group's material. The group was managed by New Kids on the Block manager, Dick Scott. The group was fronted by Donnie's brother Mark Wahlberg, who did the bulk of the rapping. Scott, Hector and Anthony were dancers for the group and Terry was the DJ for the group, all of whom rapped occasionally. All of the members were from Boston, Massachusetts (U.S.A.).</p>
<p>Because of Donnie, the group quite easily got to be the opening act for New Kids on the Block (who were then at their height of fame) and New Kids on the Block fans willingly embraced the group. Members of the media who liked New Kids on the Block tended to be supportive of the group as well.</p>
<p>In 1991 Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch released "Good Vibrations" of their debut album "Music For The People". This proved to be a huge hit, providing the group with its first number 1 single and album. The album went on to go platinum. Then came the backlash. Mark was often criticised as living off his brother's popularity, particularly by those who didn't like New Kids on the Block. The group's racial set up would be criticised by some who saw the presence of Scott, Hector, Terry and Anthony as just there to give Mark street cred. When the group's second album was released the effect of the backlash was noticed in a drop in record sales.</p>
<p>Throughout the existence of the group Mark did remain the focus of attention, with the others appearing to play second fiddle to him. Although the group never formally split up, Mark's popularity took him onto a solo career quite separate from the group (recording with Prince Ital, modeling for Calvin Klein and later acting). In 1995 Mark dropped his stage name "Marky Mark" and concentrated on his career as an actor.</p>
