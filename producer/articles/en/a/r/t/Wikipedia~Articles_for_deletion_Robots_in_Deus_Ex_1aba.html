<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. It's a powerful set of multiple server farms, constantly expanding, and able to hold far more than the editors can create. Deus Ex is a real-world game, one of the most popular in the genre, one of the cult cyberpunk games, one which elements are frequently referred to in speech among computer games players. To avoid bloating the Deus Ex article, information about bots was put into a separate page. It is not a one-user page; significant interest from multiple editors keeps it improving. It has a log way to go yet, including only robots in one game, but it does improves and expands, and today is only a fraction of what it will be in the future. And, despite that, even today that article is not a stub, but a good overview of representation of robotics in Deus Ex. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 19:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not paper, but neither is it a project to abridge every single piece of text ever. This article isn't about Deus Ex in the real world, but instead <i>extremely minor</i> elements of the fictional world that appears in those two games. This is nothing more than plot summary (fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), is additionally trivial plot summary of zero interest to anyone but hard-core Deus Ex fans <i>who will already know where to get the info anyway</i> (fails <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>), and cannot be written from anything but an in-universe perspective due to the total lack of commentary outside of the source work (fails <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and cannot be cleaned up to work with that). If it ever becomes a "description of robotics in Deus Ex", it will be pure original research, because <i>nobody has ever written a non-trivial work in a reliable source about robotics in Deus Ex</i>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 19:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Deus Ex is one of the most famous CRPGs and one of well known cyberpunk works today. The article fits the policies, and the topic has interest outside fans. as it's just a split-off part of <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_80b2.html" title="Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> article. Did you already get rid of all individual articles about every minor pokemon? If not, better attend them - this is an article merging numerous units, and potentially in two games. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 20:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is there a single word of this article that isn't directly sourced to observation of the subject (in this case, Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Invisible War)?

<dd>Sure. Quoting: "<i>In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources</i>". Since the article makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, and is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge (and, I'd add, here it is verifiable even by a child), it satisfies the policies.
<dl>
<dd>So you're admitting that it's nothing more than abridging the source works, something called out in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (not a repository of source material or plot summaries). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Admitting? Nope. I'm just quoting the policy - it confirms that this article is OK. No speculations, just a separated section for Deus Ex with pure facts. It's not just source material, it's well condensed and concentrated info. Do you suggest to merge it back into <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deus_Ex_80b2.html" title="Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a>? This will bloat it. Del? It will be not a bit different, because interesting and relevant info will get its way there anyway. So let's just keep things as they are.
<dl>
<dd>I suggest we delete it, because it serves noone for Wikipedia to be the only source describing these fictional objects save for the work in which they appear. It's not info, it's story, and <i>Wikipedia is not the place to retell other people's stories</i>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:55, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whatever you want it to be, it is what it is. It is information about robots in a game, which is far more that a story. Furthermore, in a quite influental in CRPG world game. So it's interesting, verifiable information, and the number of editors confirms that it serves many. There's no need to remind that you suggest to delete it; have you ever suggested <i>not</i> to delete something? Your userpage clearly states that you are an extremist deletionist, aimed at fiction-related information, and specifically that you hate whatever you define as cruft. But it is your personal position, one that policies don't agree with. --<a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 21:10, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The game is influential. Every single minor aspect of this game is not necessarily influential, and you've made no case that this aspect is influential. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not famous, but, as a part of well-known game, has significance to warrant interest. We could debate over this for a year or two, or maybe for 30 or 50 years if we stand on the positions. However, I'll raise another question.</dd>
<dd>What purpose would deletion of this article serve?</dd>
<dd>Deletion of non-neutral articles saves WP from bias. Deletion of non-verifiable or pure OR articles saves it from being false. Deletion of vanity pages saves it from becoming an advertising site or a soapbox. Stop here. It doesn't mean we should delete everything. Deletion of FAs would do only harm. Deletion of GA as well. Deletion of articles which do not harm Wikipedia would also serve no purpose for us and harm WP.</dd>
<dd>So, respond to the question above, or, repeating, what purpose would this deletion serve? It's not like a typical deletion candidate. It isn't a biased, non-verifiable, vanity or original research article. It is an article like many others, fitting well into schemes adopted long ago by most editors. So? <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 23:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you haven't checked my user page, I am a military engineer, so let me ask the question I'm most used to - how would it help? How would this deletion help the world? How would it help Wikipedia get an edge over other encyclopedias? How would it help anyone?</dd>

<dd>Why would I seek it? There's a lot of articles about topics with no works specifically about them - in fact, we wouldn't need Wikipedia if it covered only subjects already well covered outside of it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is typical behavior from A Man in Black. As some one has already mentioned, he is just trying to set a precedent with this deletion with his ultimate intention being the removal of all <i>Deus Ex</i> related pages aside from the main game page. Even with his specious and illogical arguments this is obviously his one and only intent (he has already deleted the 'Sihouette' page without so much as a vote).<br />
<br />
As has already been said, the robots of <i>Deus Ex</i> are much more important to its gameplay and story than most other videogames. They are an interesting combination of traditional first-person shooter enemy and game weapon, and as such deserve mention just as much space as other character and weapons pages do. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandpafootsoldier_a9c6.html" title="User:Grandpafootsoldier">Grandpafootsoldier</a> 01:33, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Silhouette page was deleted after being prodded for five days. As for the rest, the fact that Deus Ex is interesting or important or whatever is reason for there to be an article on the game itself, not every single object, character, and concept appearing in that game. Currently, we are up above two <i>dozen</i> articles devoted to two games, and this ridiculously high level of detail is not appropriate for this project. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and it seems very likely to me that you didn't waste a moment after the time ran out on the prod to delete the offending article. There certainly wasn't nearly the same amount of discussion for that page as ther has been for these. That aside I agree with the other assertions so far. This page does not deserve deletion, but the <i>Deus Ex</i> pages do need reorganization. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandpafootsoldier_a9c6.html" title="User:Grandpafootsoldier">Grandpafootsoldier</a> 23:03, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would think that would be up to the editors of the project, and not you alone. Policy is very sketchy at best on this matter.

<dd><b>Comment</b> MiB has a knack for assuming he is the enforcer of wikipedia policy and scope, particularly in areas which are currently in debate or do not, in fact, exist as actual policy. While I appreciate some of his efforts to point out certain articles which need work, he has repeatedly and consistently crossed the line between being "bold" and attempting to force his narrow view of things on everyone else.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd like to respond to that by pointing out that WP:CVG specifies <b>guidelines</b>, not policy.
