<li><b>Comment.</b> It seems to be real, but it appears to be some sort of foot-fetish thing. It’s pretty obscure with only 26 unique Google hits. Kind of funny, actually. You can buy this bread and get a video of a gorgeous model kneading the dough with her feet.

<li><b>Comment</b>: this article is about "footbread Kenny" and his product, does not cite any sources that claim this is a well-documented technique, and only has a passing mention that Footbread Kenny "claims it is a traditional Siberian recipe and not perverted in any way".

<li>My apologies, I was thinking of his actual website where he explains that bread was kneaded in this way in Serbia. Perhaps Jcuk's suggestion of adding the info to the fetishes article would be better. Changing my vote to <b>delete</b>.

<p>I'm bringing this over to the AFD rather than marking it for speedy as NN to get some feedback on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same article under <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Alan_Shields%2C_Jr._1ec3.html" title="Robert Alan Shields, Jr.">Robert Alan Shields, Jr.</a> has already been marked twice for speedy delete today</li>
<li>Does the team think that being an executed murderer in itself qualifies for notability? The murder itself seems rather banal (If you'll excuse me)</li>
<li>The information on the page asserts notability through This article, but that has been created by the same author today. 'Uncensored' gets plenty of google hits, primarily from anti-death penalty organizations</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a memorial. We delete articles for soldiers who died for their country. We certainly ought to delete this.

<p>BTW - Why would anyone delete a soldiers memorial? As if sitting here writing articles on Wiki-pedia matter more than the life of a young soldier (In any country).</p>

<li>If it needs cleanup, or NPOV, there are numerous mechanisms on WP more appropriate than AFD .

<li>No, sorry, I didn't. I would not strongly oppose deleting a page about a victim provided an otherwise nn murder victim, provided they didn't become well-known because of their death. Murders, on the other hand, with their exposure in the media and many people's strong emotional reactions, enter the public consciousness, just usually not on a national or international level as with Albert Fish. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charlie_Keever_cecd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charlie Keever">Here</a> was a AFD debate on a convicted killer and two victims from a few weeks ago. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't follow your reasoning. If a murderer becomes encyclopedic because of hometown news and television coverage and government records, then why not the victim as well and for the same reasons? Why not a dead soldier who receives the same attention? Your standards are inconsistent. On December 15 we voted to keep <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cory_Maye_2261.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cory Maye">this</a> article because a particular convict received the death penalty under unusual circumstances.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Executed murderers should not automatically be considered notable (Per Malthusian and others) ... this is not a memorial. In addition, POV statement in the article that attempts to establish notability by claiming that the subject had a role in significantly raising public awareness is disputable.

<p>This is the worst page I have seen on Wikipedia, and should be <b>delete</b>d. It is not worth salvaging, since this index could be, and already is, covered far better by the category system.

<p><b>Delete</b>. This page seems to address a catchphrase-like usage which I've never run across in the past. Careful Google checking shows this use only being popular on the dslreports.com website. A page on the use of "box" as slang for a computer, including the pluralization "boxen", could provide something more than a dictionary definition, and document its historical use in computing in general. Having a page for such a recent, underused, and non-descriptive term seems pointless, I don't think this article belongs on Wikipedia, and there's no good reason to start a new page from the existing "more boxen" article. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlata_90d6.html" title="User:Flata">Flata</a> 03:32, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. (For what it's worth, my impression is that "boxen" (by itself) is <i>obsolete</i> hacker terminology. In the days when the VAX was the measure of all things, there was a cultural device between VMS programmers, who pluralized "VAX" as "VAXes," and UNIX programmers, who pluralized it as "VAXen," hence by extension as non-VAX boxes began to proliferate they were called "boxen...") <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxen.html" title="Boxen">Boxen</a>, currently a dab, could potentially be a borderline but legitimate article topic. The phrase "More boxen" is not. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:43, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. My parents were killed by oxen when I was very young(although the doctors insist they had dysentery); this article just exacerbates the problem. Also, the plural of box is boxes. Whoever wrote this article isn't very good at English grammar. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperking_ceb7.html" title="User:Superking">The Amazing Superking</a> 00:20, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with dpbsmith. A mention in the "Boxen" page as this being a phrase used irregurly is sufficient. There is not enough (nor I doubt will there ever be enough) content to warrant an entire article on "More boxen" specifically. As a second argument, should we also create pages for "Less boxen" and "Adequate boxen"? Taking an alternative route, I've got a friend who's always making up new phrases because he thinks it's funny. Let's create Wikipedia articles on them ALL! /failedattemptathumour 203.173.24.43 03:42, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><i>Current participants brag of being above the law, and much evidence exists of complicity on the part of local fire and police departments which act as actors and anchor men of sorts when the latter are used to complete the job. The final phase is complete when the target makes the mistake of verbalising to the authorities some of the events that have transpired and are dismissed as being paranoid.</i></dd>

<dd>...</dd>

<dd><i>The above free web assessment tool helps the stalking victim assess the degree of mobstalking. Also more importantly it helps to recognize a case of MultiStalking and what actions to lookout for. There is a button gangstalkpersecutioncomplex This gives a list of feelings obtained from these actions to be used for medical consultation. Another button shows HowTheGangStalkVictim feels. This gives a great analogy on how the victim feels and is perceived by others. This is important to show family and friends to see what the victim is going thru.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Apparently, the author is upset about the replacement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Street_theater&amp;oldid=28931365" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Street_theater&amp;oldid=28931365" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> by a redirect. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 04:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone seeking to redirect to Street Theater has not read the article, which should be obvious even to non-readers that gang stalking is so much broader and more mainstream a concept than street theater. The effort at a redirect is designed to gut the concept of gang stalking of its more substantive meaning.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Gang stalking is a genuine tactic of harassment participated in by</li>
</ul>
<p>many individuals targeting one sole person. All across the world, the tactics used are similar. This crime is coming to the attention of the public through the internet and publications. This is the time to insure that this covert crime is retained in the Wikipedia for reference. Delete all reference to persectution complex. This IS NOT a medically recognized diagnosis or sympomatology. R. Ross. RN</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an excellent description and resource of a widespread phenomenon which is being conducted not only in the US - particularly Texas, California, Massachussets - but also in the NATO countries. This is being used as a method of political control which has been used for centuries by the Catholic Church, the Nazis, Ku Klux Klan and now widely associated with the "War on Terror" which seems to also be targeting citizens of countries who are opposed to political changes leading to Police State policies. Gang stalking/electronic harrassment is primarily being organized and run by retired police, firefighters, military, coast guard, and paramilitary types and is funded partly by HUD as well as black budget money probably coming from drug sales. There have been many important articles in journals, books, and websites on this activity and the best way to fight it is to expose it. Gang stalking is also widespread at University campuses - particularly the University of California where I have observed it, nuclear weapons labs (managed by the Univ. of California), and has been used against soldiers who want to leave the military or are opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Interviews available on the internet with Kay Griggs describe how her husband, a US Marine Colonel developed this and other practices to use against American citizens, and she has the manual for it. This should be taken seriously and the article definitely belongs on Wikipedia as it provides an important resource to the public.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Gang stalking is a recognized Internet phenomenon. It is a related but distinguishable form of cyberstalking in that it cannot be explained purely on the basis of Individual Psychology. Gang stalking requires causes and conditions that transcend the individual, and social psychologists invoke such principles as groupthink, social facilitation, and deindividuation to analyze the structure and dynamics of stalking gangs.</li>

<p>"Gang stalk persecution complex" implies people who experience gang stalking are mentally ill. That is DEFINITELY not the case, as anyone who has read the literature or experienced gang stalking knows only too well.</p>
<p>Anyone doubting gang stalking itself is a real phenomenon needs only to read David Lawson's book "Terrorist Stalking in America". A review, with a link to purchase the book is here:</p>

<p>Please keep Gang Stalk Persecution Complex From Dictionary.com There is no imaginary and no mental illness word or implied mental condition in the definition of Gang Stalk Persecution Complex</p>
<p>The Gang Stalk persecution changes the behavior of a person (a complex) and creates a set of feelings the victim has.</p>
<p>Complex - In psychology, a group of related, often repressed ideas and impulses that compel characteristic or habitual patterns of thought, feelings, and behavior.</p>
<p>Persecution - punishment or harassment usually of a severe nature on the basis of race, religion, or political opinion in one's country of origin</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Please Keep the entry on Gang Stalking</b> - Gang-Stalking is a real phenomenon. I should know. I am being stalked. The stalkers rely on the public perception that people who report (gang) stalking are "nutcases." The police routinely ignore this crime. People find it hard to believe that something like this could happen. That is an unjustifiable conclusion-belief. People need a more available public resource to learn about this crime. I don't care what you do about the [Gang Stalk Persecution Complex] entry, because this entry incorrectly feeds the idea that victims are mentally ill. The stalkers get a psychological "thrill" out of hurting people. Only increasing public awareness is going to stop or slow this phenomenon.</p>
<hr />
<p>KEEP, i am a victim of gang stalking and electronic harrassment. by the grace of god ive survived this abuse for two yrs. i am stalked daily by large groups of people so when i hear of things like the deletion of this page i start to lose alittle hope that someday these life destroying crimes will ever be brought to justice. i can only speak for myself but i cant understand why anyone would want to dismiss something that so many of us Americans are claiming to be true. we are good people with familys that deserve the benifit of the doubt. please keep this page in tact.

Keep change name and explain more about this, as NEWBIES comming in do not fully understand what you are saying or what is really going on with this. Me i do understand. Even though the author is giving a medical term. for his or other's sake.. he/she is basically saying there isn't a madical term. for this as THE PUBLIC EYE has refused to see what is going on. And call the "victims" of this Looney or whatever the medical profession decides to term it. I do know know this happens. I am also a victim. although I am in a small town that just moved here just over a yr ago. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE&gt; REALIZE IT! Get the word out! Help the ones who are victimized. www.groups.yahoo.com/group/cause_stalking</p>
<p>Keep this entry. This IS really happening in the United States today. With a government that thinks it's okay to listen to your telephone conversations and read your private e-mail as authorized by the president, why would you doubt that stalking of private citizens by more than one individual could be happening? It is very easy to simpy write the victim off as being "mentally ill" when in fact that is not the case at all. People need to wake up to what is happening in America NOW.</p>

<li><b>Keep or rework and /or move <i>Gang Stalking</i></b>.<br />
Why is it so hard to accept that stalking does not need to be done by one person? Some people do join to make a targets life miserable. In that mission these groups use whatever methods they can come up with. The goal -destroying the targets life - is what counts.<br />
Maybe change the name to group stalking and delete or rework the electronic stuff. Maybe rework the whole stalking subject: how many stalkers, their methods, if there is a group: how they form and how tight the group forms, their why´s for stalking and then the implications for the society.<br />

<p>KEEP THE ARTICLE ON "GANG STALKING" AND DELETE THE ARTICLE ON "GANG STALK PERSECUTION COMPLEX," WHICH IS SEPARATELY ADDRESSED. My comments are as follows:</p>
<p>The practice of gang stalking, or group stalking, is widespread both in the United States and abroad. The intent is to terrorize and intimidate selected persons purportedly for "kicks." In certain venues, gang stalking is referred to as "bullying."</p>
<p>This type of discriminatory stalking (which appears to have a religious element) is invariably accompanied by violence. This is nothing new. One needs only recall the heydays of the Know Nothing Party in the 1840s, the events following Kristallnacht in 1938, and the lynchings which punctuated the segregationist policies of the Deep South during the early half of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>Persons who are gang stalked these days must also deal with violence, including but not limited to recurrent breakings and enterings, recurrent vandalism of their property, thefts, and extremely brutal harassment by electromagnetic and acoustical weapons systems.</p>
<p>This topic must be addressed, as it is a part of our "encyclopaedic" history and cannot be disregarded. The practice, so long as it continues unconstrained, shows holocaustic potential, which no doubt will be of interest to future generations of Wikipedia readers.</p>

<p>KEEP: Gang stalking is a legitimate form of social crime and has been documented and reported on over the past 50 years using other terminologies. Current nominclature is "gang stalking." It is a serious psycho-social crime similar to mob violence but executed in more skillful and controlled manner. There are victims of this type of crime all around the world who seek public awareness of this crime. The Wikipedia has been timely in it's inclusion of this problem. Unfortunately, the water became "muddied" with the addition of "persecution complex" and brighting. Your responders who appeal to you to "keep" this page all agree that the "persecution complex" and the "brighting" needs to be delete....all except for the one misguided (perhaps) person who conceived of it and entered it. Please give the victims and those who work with them the benefit of the doubt long enough for further information to be forthcoming and posted. I am aware of TV reports and books pending and already available validating this problem. It's relevence in society seems to warrant giving this at least the benefit of the doubt.

<p><b>Keep</b> GANG STALKING (but remove “GANG STALK PERSECUTION COMPLEX".)</p>
<p>As many very high on the food chain knows, but cannot or will not admit, Gang Stalking is quite real. As hard as it is to believe, even the tactic of the perpetrators using their children against those of the target has been confirmed by a child psychologist dealing with the resulting depression. Apparently, many of these kids start liking the people they are being used against and enter their psychological practice in order to assist with the resulting guilt.</p>
<p>Why do some appear to have a hard time believing that what <b>is widely known</b> to exist in the school yard and work place has in fact transcended both?</p>
<p>Mobbing is an important aspect of this crime, and the resulting pathologies are also well documented, but predominantly by occupational therapists. This was also proven by Dr. Leymann by using the same treatment modalities as those used for traditional Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p>As this has provided ample criteria for a differential diagnosis and treatment there is no need to create a new "wheel" as in the case of the persecution complex. Respectfully submitted. Rick Williams</p>
<p><br />
<b>KEEP</b>GANG STALKING (but not "GANG STALKING PERSECUTION COMPLEX").</p>
<p>There have been so many cases of gang-stalking in the last 10 years or so that there should be no question about whether the term describes a real criminal activity. Anyone on the street and in the know has probably heard about it is already so why would you not include it? The crime works because it is usually an ongoing stalking of many against one individual and so hard to verify easily. But many have managed to get investigators to verify the facts of this crime. Also there have been videos capturing the crime in action. Any crime of many against one will be easy to dismiss and so dismissing this entry will help the crime to continue more easily. Please leave the entry so that victims of the crime can point to this entry as some type of evidence that they are not the only one making the claim.</p>
<p>As far as the added "persecution complex", it seems to me that if you are unsure about the crime itself it is way too early to turn it into what the perpetrators have attempted it to be from the start--a tool to discredit individuals' reputations. We have "paranoia" and "persecution complexes" since Freud on. A crime that is perpetrated on an individual by a group is already heinous enough without helping them inadvertantly by creating a new name for a new "mental illness". If someone is in fact a victim of a "hate crime" would we also come up with a term like "hate crime persecution complex". I don't think so. It would be adding insult to injury. So I hope you decide to keep only "GANG STALKING" and wait for the mental health field to add the skeptical term add-on of "persecution complex" if they decide to. As far as I know the mental health profession has no intentions of creating this term at all. So it appears to be one persons' idea based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of the words "persecution complex". Thanks. T. Josephine</p>

<p>I agree that this article is extremely idiosyncratic and a lot of the edits are rambling, perhaps even from a troubled mind. That being said, many of the tactics mentioned and cited are a serious issue, and someone who wanted to do these things (for political, personal or psychological reasons) could certainly make life hell for an individual. I think such behavior would almost certainly come from a disturbed individual and/or a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Flies_1843.html" title="Lord of the Flies">Lord of the Flies</a> scenario, but the tendency of people to be cruel is well known, whether from movies like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrie.html" title="Carrie">Carrie</a> or real-world <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution.html" title="Persecution">persecution</a>. I do <b>not</b> envy whatever person wants to try to clean this up and keep it up, but I think there is enough good material in here to keep. <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorybowman_5a57.html" title="User:Rorybowman">Rorybowman</a> 04:49, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The expansion of the article with the section of new tools provides an objective and verifiable statement of evidence for gang stalking and should not be removed. The individual aggressively removing this content is comporting himself like a stalker. Many Usenet-philes occupy roles as Wiki admins and abuse that authority for the purposes of preserving an unimpeachable image of Usenet. They even use words like kookish and screed, words used by alt.usenet.kooks kookunters to stalk all sources of unconventional wisdom on the Web, to describe perfectly objective and verifiable content that does not mesh with their personal preferences and loyalties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, absurd or hatemongering articles like Alt.usenet.kooks, Catholic Church of Wikipedia, and snuh receive support from Wiki admins. And not just support for the existence of the article -- just try to append a subsection that qualifies or deviates from the Primrose picture of the content. You will be edited with extreme prejudice and threatening with banning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wiki is another resource for gang stalkers, and principles of group psychology can be applied to make sense of some rather bizarre behavior from Wiki administrators (especially those who are anonymous).</dd>

<p>KEEP, The information people state is correct, only the devices used against those who have been victims have had the concept of deniability built into the weapons. This was at the governments request. The government made the mistake of giving the information to industry, who have used these military style weapons against those considered undesirables in our society. In my home town the former mayor used these devices against anyone he wished, why? To shut them up, to dissent his wishes was to be a whistleblower and a troublemaker. He ran the city like his fiefdom, this has got to come out. The actions of our gov't against its own citizens. That is why I laugh when Bush touts his freedom and liberty comments in his speeches.Gov't at all levels know this is happening and do not want the general public to know what is going on, niether do the local thugs carrying out their commands. Little do they know that they also and their children will suffer under this, for when we are gone, the stalkers will look for other prey,, it could be you. That is equality what can happen to me can happen to you. No one is exempt. Look at Bush he's scared poopless, military missiles on our buildings, radiation detector's in Va. maryland and D.C., NSA active and domestic spying, Osama really got Bush on the run, I know one thing, I was and am terrorized by these thugs, and I wonder how Bush feels and congress feels being terrorized as well, I am not alone anymore. That is equality, so you see what can happen to me, definitly can happen to anyone as well. I say keep this on stalkiing,harrassment,, because it gives us a voice and when this does come out and it will, then we can use this to document how many were killed, abused, robbed, and their lives destroyed by these high tech weapons used domestically,, maybe then we will have justice.This in itself will be part of the record.. We must, You must keep this at any cost. B.J. Guillette</p>

Feel free to move it to the most appropriate place, but could we preserve the link to it from <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_Links_a762.html" title="Dancing Links">Dancing Links</a>? <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrage_984a.html" title="User:Krage">Krage</a> 16:14, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just want to add here.. The source code here is not a software, but rather a document describing the algorithm. Many complained that the page for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_Links_a762.html" title="Dancing Links">Dancing Links</a> doesn't explain the algorithm itself thus it is useless. This java code explains the algorithm in the term familiar to every programmer. The original paper by Knuth is somewhat difficult to understand. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrage_984a.html" title="User:Krage">Krage</a> 21:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can't we include the core of the algorithm in a more abstract way in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_Links_a762.html" title="Dancing Links">Dancing Links</a>, without posting the whole Java code? I think there is likely to be a need to explain the algorithm. The complete code will only help Java programmers. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 10:06, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - unless Zwölf has some cultural implications, it should probably be deleted.

<li>It can all be verified pretty easily, though. All highly notable info. You don't go deleting a notable article because no one has bothered to source it yet; you add the sources yourself, or you wait for someone else to do it.

<li>I would say that a religion which has existed for more than 40 years and has thousands of followers, a lot of who live together in communes, I'd call that notable (at least more so than the regular religious internet movement for which you just have to post to join). I would like to see some sources, before I vote to keep this, though. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I chose The Move: Sam Fife because you get more google results for the religion with both "The Move" and "Sam Fife" in the search than with either alone. "The Move" is too common of a phrase. "Sam Fife" is too common of a name. Anyone who is looking for information about this group will likely type both into Google Search.</p>

<p>This page, as seen below, was nominated for deletion in December, partly because the group is unnotable and partly because it read like an advertisment. The article has been recreated and speedy-deleted twice since then I believe, and yet still it's here again. I don't see how it's become more notable in a month, and it still reads like an ad to me. It does not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite good sources</a> justifying its place here and I consider it to be <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>. I could be considered an inclusionist, but it appears to me that the majority of editors are not and so there is no justification for EF having a page of Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 13:11, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems to be nothing more than self-promotion by the group's creator. If EF is as successful as he seems to indicate then perhaps an article on it would be a worthwhile addition to Wikipedia, but I don't see it coming from this and as such, would recommend a deletion. It's very badly written and inconsistant in its presentation. Perhaps one day someone can make a better article on the subject but at the moment, it's just trash on the server. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 12:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Something odd about this article. It reads like a little chunk copyvio'd from somewhere -- no hits on Google but could be from a book.

<p>Recently-ish killed Christian minister in Iran. I speedied this originally as there was no assertion of notability - now there is (questionable) notability asserted per some media attention. Google pulls 47 hits, just 2 with quotes for Ghorban Tourani - Ghorban Tori pulls more. But with due respect, every murder victim is not inherrently notable - while this case may be slightly different, I do not believe it is enough. --Jeffrey O.

This has been now under the new president rapidly worsened. His murder happened to co-incide with a new attempt by the EU to engage Iran on Human Rights, was widely reported and led to diplomatic protests. 3) Importance for Iranian/Middle Eastern Church - huge. The first Turkmen martyr amongst other things. In summary: the man is notable and important enough to warrant an entry unless Wikipedia wants to be centred on what and who is important in the West. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 10:25, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I nominated this a few weeks ago, and it was kept because of a lack of consensus (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Great_Serpent_of_Sumeria_21c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Great Serpent of Sumeria">first nomination</a> and talkpage). The article has gone through superficial cleanup and some "references" have been added. The problem is that the references do not actually support the content of the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> The references simply do not support the article. It is currently unverified. The third reference is total deceptive - no page numbers, just a pointer to a book. In any case references to myths found in modern fictional works would not support the key contention that this was an ancient myth. The article could be true (I don't know) but unless it can be verified (and it has been given plenty time without that happening) it ought to be deleted.

<dd>The issue is not whether there are mythological serpents, in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, but whether evidence can be found of a particular one that fits the name and description in this article. <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiamat.html" title="Tiamat">Tiamat</a> already has an article. Let's get rid of hoaxes, unless they are notable enough in the world at large to be kept and described as such. To be clear, we need evidence of a serpent that:
<ul>
<li>fits the description of "a giant snake that was said to encircle the Earth, and to control various natural elements and cycles", and</li>
<li>is Mesopotamian and known by a name resembling "Great Serpent of Sumeria".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Anything that fits only parts of this description just doesn't count, because those creatures are all already covered elsewhere.

<dd>We <i>could</i> redirect this to Tiamat (although it wouldn't be a great redirect) but, since I'm now sure it is a hoax, let's delete it first. The 'encyclopedia of religion' ref doesn't work for me, what I can read seems only to verify that Tiamat of Sumeria was called a 'great serpent' - add that to the Tiamat article if you want, but it does not verify this article. What is the rest of the 'lots of evidence' that JJay mentions? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 08:59, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>JJay can correct me if I am wrong, but I assume he just looked at the "references", each one of which appears to verify one minor part of this article (just as the Enc. of Rel. may seem to do), but none of which actually verifies the main points. My frustration comes from having to nominate an obvious hoax <i>twice</i> to get it deleted, and still getting "keep"-votes in the second nomination, despite two clear explanations of the problems with the article earlier in the discussion. The hassle in having to do this makes turning the next hoax I find into a bad redirect to something vaguely similar a very attractive alternative. It showcases a fundamental weakness in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is half-decent in the Natural sciences, as the <i>Nature</i> evaluation showed, because creating a believable hoax or adding some other crap to an existing article there is just much more difficult, but it will never get good in the Humanities unless this weakness is dealt with in some way. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I don't really see this as a hoax because there are so many different descriptions of these serpents floating around depending on the source.

According to <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">WIKI:STUB</a> (which I realize is a guideline and not policy), states, "A stub is an article that's obviously too short, but not so short as to be useless. In general, it must be long enough to at least define the article's title, which generally means 3 to 10 short sentences." This article, in its current state, does not satisfy those criteria. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 14:18, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You didn't answer my question. And you can be "sure" of whatever you want, but I know nothing of autism or autism therapy and did not feel comfortable adding to this article. My concern is that people come to Wikipedia for information, and if they arrived at this article such as it was when I nominated it, they would think, "Wow, that was stupid. I'm never using Wikipedia again." This is why I said to delete <i>unless improvements are made</i>. Thank you for adding the appropriate information to avoid that. I'm still not sure if the topic is notable, but most people in the wiki community probably lack the expertise to make such a determination. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 15:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks for withdrawing your nom. I'm not an expert on autism, I merely took some info from your link. Your point about visitors to wikipedia is well taken, but my concern is more about not driving away contributors who might be able to improve the contents or add expertise, starting with the many tens of thousands of stubs. You never know when the odd visitor is going to see a stub, think "wow, that was stupid", and then spend the rest of their day improving the article. I hope some of those people will be able to bring substantial improvements to the TEACHH article in the future.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is my first article, so I don't really know completely how the site functions. I got all of my information about the band Rainwound at the official websites. There are samples on the internet and a thousand views to the MySpace page alone, which is a pretty new page. It is not an article to promote <i>my</i> band, because I am just a fan providing this for informational purposes. I would appreciate any help you would be willing to give, but please do not delete this speedily for it was a lot of work, typing, and figuring out how to work this system. Thanks!</li>

</ul>
<p>Thank you MisterHand! Now I just must figure out how to get there! ;) As far as notability goes, there are a few things <i>notable</i> which I will list for your viewing pleasure, and you can decide from that wether the article may stay or not. I understand it is up to you and I will hold nothing against you for doing your job, for you seem to do it honestly and very effectively!</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Has been prominently featured in any major music media.</i> - Rainwound has been featured in some internet magazines, and participated in interviews. You can't quite call that Major media, but it is underground media... Rainwound is an underground band working it's way out into the public musical conciousness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i> - Brandon S. is a member of a local band called Terranova, and also a band called Harvist localed in West Virginia. Harvist is distrobuted by a label called "Dark Horizon Records". Their work can be purchased from Amazon.com apart from other various locations. A side-project by Brandon S. called Satanic Dirge is to be featured on a <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a> compilation sometime in January and also recording a full-length debut for label Appalachian Stronghold. It's not extremely notable as far as <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> or the current popular superstar or whatnot, but as far as <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_music.html" title="Underground music">underground music</a> goes, it's probably somewhat notable. :)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</i> - ...I think the style is unique, but I don't want to toot my own horn here.. It's a mixture of progressive rock and black metal, and video game music.. something that is not commonly done, so it may be prominently representative of a notable style. Rainwound and <a href="../../../t/e/r/TerraNova_0791.html" title="TerraNova">TerraNova</a> are both located in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgettstown.html" title="Burgettstown">Burgettstown</a> (City) and are the most varied as far as musical content (rather than the basic <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> that dominates the area).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</i> - Radio appearances are currently in negotiation and being sorted out. I think there is an internet radio that already plays songs, and also songs by Satanic Dirge. Still, not major radio network, but depending on who listens it may be heard nationally since it's on the internet and available for anyone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here's one more, I don't know if it applies - <i>Has been a significant musical influence on a musician or composer that qualifies for the above list.</i> - I was notified by a member of Mourning Glory (note: not the wikipedia one) that they were influenced by Rainwound, and wrote a song called <i>Raven Dawn</i> which was more progressive than their usual material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, and I hope this helps out a bit. Of course the band is working to become more notable, I think that is the goal of most bands, if not all. Everyone wants to be heard! When the final recording is finished, it will be sent to a major record label like <a href="../../../i/n/s/InsideOut_Records_24f4.html" title="InsideOut Records">InsideOut Records</a> (Prog label), Nuclear Blast America, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century_Media_d920.html" title="Century Media">Century Media</a>, or <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a>... pretty much the top heavy labels at the moment. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 19:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge difference between sending a recording to a major label and having it released, especially for a band's first release on the label. "No contract" usually means no release, especially so on the major national-level labels. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 20:20, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Errr ok just a quick clarification here, when I say <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a>, I am referring to United States Black Metal. Sorry about the confusion. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 19:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Withholding "vote" 48 hours</b> in light of above assertions.</s> However...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) All of these assertions would be more effective if they can be distilled into the article and documented with appropriate references. It may be difficult for underground bands, but then again, notability is a part of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and that means demonstrating notability is difficult for groups in this genre of music. Underground media by its nature precludes this as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Notability is not based on what a band (even a one-person band) is <i>going</i> to do. It's "What has it done?" or "What is it doing now?" If you're conceding that it hasn't been discussed in major music media yet, that hurts the article's case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>So I just need to add all the accomplishments of the band into the article? --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) If the band has not yet made a release on a nationally-distributed label or charted on a national sales/airplay chart, notability cannot be attained on this count.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Does it count if the release is distributed nationally by the band? CDs have already been sent to all corners of the U.S., and overseas! --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) A one-person band reflects the notability of the person who is it. To assert notability of the band is to assert it of the member as well. This has yet to be demonstrated here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) Harvist is equally difficult to demonstrate meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as you can't use yourself and your connection with Rainwound to satisfy the notability criterion when you're using your membership in Harvist to establish notability of Rainwound. At least one must stand by itself in order to use that provision of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The same is true of Satanic Dirge.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6) Your article doesn't demonstrate that your act has become "the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city" - and, again, the city itself must be considered. If the city is New York City or Seattle or Miami, it would have much more weight than Huntington, West Virginia, or Chillicothe, Ohio... or Redding, California.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) Negotiations for radio performances are different from actual performances. "Major radio networks" must be at least regional, not local, in scope... and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> specifically mentions "national."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Wouldn't internet radio count as national if the stream is viewable from any country or area? --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>8) As for the last category that you cite, since Mourning Glory's article has yet to demonstrate that Rainwound is one of its influences, this cannot be applied... yet. Also, I am not sure that the Mourning Glory article would survive an AfD vote should one come up... yet. I'll leave that issue for others.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Mourning Glory</b> The Mourning Glory I speak of is not the one featured on Wikipedia, but one from Texas. All I have is a quote from the songwriter saying he was influenced by Rainwound's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> can be demonstrated in the article with the appropriate references, I'll be returning in 48 hours to urge a speedy delete as a vanity article written by the one member of the band.

<p>I am Roger Rothenberger the writer of the page Demos - A new fourth branch of American government proposed in book "Beyond Plutocracy". I agree that this page should be deleted. It is not written as well as it could be written. When I received the Wikipedia notice that the page was below standards I attempted to improve it by rewriting its text and by using a better name for the page: The Demos.</p>
<p>My principal purpose in writing the page was to introduce a new definition for the term demos. If you think this is too promotional, then you should delete the page The Demos as well. But please read it first before deleting it. I really am attempting to introduce a new definition for the term demos. Whatever your decision, thank you.</p>

<p>This page is currently a redirect to "Tomb". A tomb is a place for the dead, a Dargah is a place where Sufis live, train, worship, the nearest European equivalent being a monastery, except a Dargah would not normally be somewhere to live permanently in celebacy. There may be tombs there, but it is not itself a tomb, anymore than a house is a bathroom or a motorway is a signpost. Therefore it should go.</p>

<p>This article should be <b>deleted</b>: Poorly written, POV, self-contradictory, unreferenced article about a fairly unknown song, that is above all not even notable. Any note-worthy information on this song might as well be included in the appropriate album articles or the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Corporate_0998.html" title="Something Corporate">Something Corporate</a> article, but the song itself does not qualify for an article of its own. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 18:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The song is not unknown because "the band traditionally shunned publicity", but because it was never released on an album with a print run larger than 1000 copies. Also, your saying it is "well known inside band circles" stands in direct contrast to the second sentence of the article ("The song is relatively unknown, largely because it has not been released locally to the brunt of the band's fanbase."). As for the band's history, I find it far less significant than any of their singles, for instance. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 13:15, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm in agreement with this. It is a song that, upon listening to, people (such as myself as I did just now) may go directly to Wikipedia via url hoping to find more information on. This is not just any old song, as anyone who has listened to it can testify to.

<li><b>Keep, Clean or Merge</b> TheDriver959 This article is about an amazing song that the whole fanbase of Something Corporate knows. I myself started with this one and worked my way into the band. Andrew McMahon so much as said himself that if it wasn't for the number of fans that adored the song, the band would never play it because it's so long. The article explains the depth of the song and just how many different points of view one can see by listening to the words. And everyone can relate something in their life to this song, be it happy or sad. Konstantine deserves an article of it's own, and if not then it at least deserves a fair mention in the Something Corporate entry.</li>

<dd>I think he may have been involved in the development of GOST. He's cited in the appendix of Applied Crypto by Schneier. Other than that, it looks like he's just implemented a few things in the early 90's. Is the goal to list any modern cryptographer, or only notable modern cryptographers?

<dd><a href="../../../g/o/s/GOST_37f9.html" title="GOST">GOST</a> was a Soviet Union government standard, so I very much doubt if Plumb was involved in developing it — I suspect he merely wrote an implementation of it. The goal is to list notable cryptographers, but, on Wikipedia, deletion of articles is often more trouble than it's worth; my usual tactic is to ignore non-notable topics. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The title is plainly unsuitable for a redirect as it is inherently going to imply POV on its target. Those opting to merge should be aware that there is virtually nothing in the article that can be usefully merged. The title also implies that the content of the article results in potential: this is pure interpretation, and original research which is explicitly disallowed. The delete arguments made here are significantly much stronger than the keep. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:13, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> What do you mean <i>that kind</i> of encyclopedia? Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia and the insensitivity to this is of great concern. These pages were created out of respect for both living and fallen warriors and your wish to delete them concerns me. You have made this a political issue, which it is clearly not. A few rogue Vandalizer admins who are trying to shape Wikipedia in their own image should not be able to wield power in such a negative way. Who is watching the admins? Have their backgrounds been checked to ensure they aren't prone to disrupting the ongoing development of a true open-source encyclopedia. Seems some users and admins here have been abusing their power beyond reason. As you can clearly see by this category here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers</a> , there are others who are working to provide information on both living and deceased law enforcement officers. Please do not delete pages before you are aware of the full political implications of such an action.<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> 17:56, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: A police officer doesn't deserve an article just because they exist(ed); out of the four articles filed directly in the category you note rather than subcategories, only one, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gordon_Cheverie_d667.html" title="David Gordon Cheverie">David Gordon Cheverie</a>, strikes me as a person clearly deserving of an article. And even then, he's notable because he was a recipient of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_of_Valour_314a.html" title="Cross of Valour">Cross of Valour</a>. "Killed in the line of duty" does not make a police officer automatically notable -- that argument only holds water if the officer being killed in the line of duty somehow had lasting real world effects, such as inspiring a major new federal law that stiffened the penalties for killing a police officer. Valérie Gignac, for example, simply does not merit an article at this point. The RCMP officers killed in Mayercourt back in March don't merit individual articles (although the <i>incident</i> probably deserves one.) Wikipedia is not a memorial; it's an encyclopedia with specific standards for what belongs or doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also, in googling for this person, if you exclude the word Haiti, you get a number of articles written in the 1990s about his work related to international drug trafficking, which writers found signficant long *before* his death (the article I linked to was written after his death, but others were written before). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:03, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I cannot understand why this article would be deleted. The death of this peacekeeper in Haiti was widely covered in all major Canadian media as a top story. To Canadian readers, the topic is quite relevant. If this is not relevant then most of Wikipedia would also need to be deleted. I thought the point of wikipedia was that it would be more broad than the typical bound encyclopedia. There are a great many people who would benefit from this entry. I am a little skeptical about the political motivation for deleting this. The article itself does not seem to take a position on Canadian peacekeepers in Haiti but it is plausible that someone opposed to such a mission would be unsympathetic to the death of this man. It is an important fact to note.Someguy963 01:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>. As a member of a family with people in uniform, I feel I should step up and explain a couple of things here. I have no political agenda to which Someguy963 referred. We need to start with the premise of <i>my</i> vote: <i>Wikipedia is not a memorial</i>. This rule is put into place so we don't have thousands of articles for people who were murdered, died of accidents, or died while in the service in a country's military. My vote is <b>not</b> a lack of sympathy on my part - far from it as several relatives of mine have died in the service of their/my country. So, let's put that argument aside once and for all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While that premise holds, it doesn't mean that the deaths of specific military personnel cannot be mentioned in Wikipedia. It means that: A) if their activites prior to their death <b>set them apart from other military personnel who died in service</b> to make them sufficiently notable while alive, they should have an article; and B) if the activity that caused their deaths is itself sufficiently notable, then the person should be mentioned in the context of that activity and in the article discussing the activity, not necessarily in a new article for that person. When I look at these articles, I ask myself, "Which is the bigger story? Was this part of a bigger picture?" and go from there as to the proper location of the article in question.</dd>
<dd>In addition, references and mention of instances of A or B above must be made <i><b>in the article itself</b></i>, not here as the AfD reviews primarily the article, and many people participating in an AfD judge the article as written first, last, and foremost. Those who are saying there are additional references (and information) to further justify keeping the article should add them to the article NOW, before close of the AfD. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 12:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an article on what would seem to be a most bogus sport which exists between a few friends.

<li>'<i><b>Do not delete'</b></i> We are not students. The main group consists of a two policemen, a stockbroker and various other workers. It is an insult to suggest wwe are bored students! Although the number of google hits is not very high that doesnot mean that toetapping is not a real sport. All extreme sports have to start somewhere. Give us a break guys. If we weren't for real we probably wouldn't bother defending our right to the page. However even if you do <i>have</i> to delete us please <i>stop</i> suggesting we are students!! Thank you.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - that is all very good. But Wikipedia has certain standards for the articles. One of them in notability. And while your sport might be real, it is not notable (not popular, not well-known) to be included on WP.

<li>How do you know that the Guardian author is even the same guy??? The Guardian article was <i>about</i> bloggers, but nowhere do I see the author identify himself as a blogger. Crabtree is a very common last name, and James is one of the most common first names. His supposed claim to fame is that he's written about Iraq, so the relevant Google hits should mention "Iraq" along with his name - but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" rel="nofollow">only around 600</a> do. Hmmm...well maybe some list his writing about "anbar" provence but not "Iraq," (Only 2 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>) or perhaps the city of "Fallujah" (Only 7 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>) or even his home town of "Austin" Texas (Only a little over 300 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, and I'm not even sure all of these are about the same guy). (Note - I excluded "Iraq" for all of those searches to avoid duplicates of hits from the original search.) But at any rate, even a non-noteworthy blogger would be likely to have a whole lot more relevant Google hits than this Crabtree guy does - given the nature of blogs and their ability to create a lot of redundant Google hits. So I have yet to see anyone give any evidence that this blogger's inclusion here is anything but vanity! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 22:01, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Everything mentioned here is already (or should be) mentioned in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_nomination.html" title="Strategic nomination">strategic nomination</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - your removal of the links from <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_voting.html" title="Bloc voting">Bloc voting</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_Transferable_Vote_c914.html" title="Single Transferable Vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> made it harder to see why this is actually useful in context.

<li>Can you expand on that? I see no reason why anything mentioned in <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_%28voting%29.html" title="Clone (voting)">clone (voting)</a> wouldn't end up being duplicated from <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_nomination.html" title="Strategic nomination">strategic nomination</a>. Even worse, the exact definition of a clone is a very delicate technical issue, with me even just now having tightened it up in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_nomination.html" title="Strategic nomination">strategic nomination</a>.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - As it stands now, the clone article does look like it should go in Strategic Nomination, however if there is a use for clones not relevant to strategic nomination and not currently mentioned in the clone article, then that should be mentioned in the clone article.

<li><b>Keep It</b>. Rebel Alliance is a young board, but one that is growing. It is indeed unique in it's management, and the democratic nature of it's member participation. The constant attempts to malign the board are tiresome, and more than a little sad, really. Regardless of people's personal opinions/history - the last thing the left needs is fewer voices and forums for discussion. Attempting to have Rebel Alliance deleted from Wiki is foolish, vindictive, and counterproductive. Keep it.
