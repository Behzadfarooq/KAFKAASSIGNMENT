<li><b>Strong keep</b>, This has come up before and been defeated. The underlying phenomenon, rapid growth in disk storage per dollar, is real, important and distinct from Moore's law, which deals with ICs and CPUs. However tentatively, SciAm coined the term, not us. That we picked it up and added credence does not violate NEO, indeed if we tried to make up a different name on our own, <i>that</i> would be NEO. If the industry settles on a different term, a simple move is all that is required. ASR is an editing issue. Deletion is totally inappropriate.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 15:39, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>The term was not coined by Scientific American; it was coined by Wikipedia's article.</b> It was used only once, as the <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=30&amp;articleID=000B0C22-0805-12D8-BDFD83414B7F0000" class="external text" title="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=30&amp;articleID=000B0C22-0805-12D8-BDFD83414B7F0000" rel="nofollow">title of an article</a>, without even the implication that the term had a real meaning of its own, and no mention or definition in the text. The Wikipedia article was the first instance of the term being used as if it referred to a scientific law. Even if the term is now in widespread use (which it is not), it is only due to the Wikipedia article. We can't create articles for made-up terms and then deem them notable <i>after</i> others start mimicking our article. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 16:17, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not a scientific law, it's is an empirical observation and rule of thumb, as is Moore's law. The SciAm article identified a distinct phenomenon and gave it a name.

<dd>A <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_law.html" title="Scientific law">scientific law</a> <i>is</i> an empirical observation. That's what "scientific law" means. We define it as "a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior". SciAm did <i>not</i> define the term or claim anywhere that it represented the law that they spoke of; they simply used it as the (whimsical) title of their article. Wikipedia was the first to use it as if it were an actual law, and it is therefore a Wikipedia-created neologism that needs to be killed. We are not in the business of creating new terminology; we only report on terminology that already exists. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 21:26, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Rules about not pushing points of views apply to the content of articles. Decisions *about* articles, like deleting them for non-notability, are not subject to the NPOV rule. Otherwise, we could never delete any articles, because all deletions imply a point of view that the subject of the article isn't notable. We must decide whether the use of the term is a real use; we can't avoid making that decision. Such decisions don't violate the rule about points of view. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 05:01, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The Scientific American article didn't give anything a name. Just because the title reads "Kryder's Law" doesn't mean the article is actually proposing Kryder's Law. It's as if I wrote an article about Wikipedia titled "The National Enquirer of Web Pages" and we later had an article which stated that Wikipedia was also known as "The National Enquirer of Web Pages". The article's title is a form of rhetoric which is phrased as if it's naming something; but it isn't really suggesting a name at all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that disk space growth is a real phenomenon, but it's a real phenomenon that is not in any meaningful sense associated with the term "Kryder's Law". If you want to keep this article because you think we need a disk space growth article, then rename it to "disk space growth" and take out the references to "Kryder's Law". (But I suspect nobody would even think the article was worth creating if it wasn't for the name.)</dd>
<dd>(Incidentally, this doesn't violate <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. A self-reference is saying something like "In this Wikipedia article..."

<li><b>Keep and comment</b> Omegatron, the article does not state that wikipedia invented the word, as you lead me to believe. You have misquoted the article. In fact, it was someone else claiming the article has created the word. The article includes this claim, per NPOV I guess. I do not see it as violating "neo". The article explains the word, making it "understandable and clearly defined". It is not violating OR because of the other article that the information is cited to. If anything, this article needs to focus more on the LAW instead of the origin and acceptablity of the word.--<font face="Parade"><span style="border:1px solid MediumSlateBlue;"><a href="../../../d/o/g/User_talk%7EDogNewTricks_4ee9.html" title="User talk:DogNewTricks"><span style="background-color:PaleVioletRed; color: LavenderBlush;"><b><big>&#160;¢²</big></b></span></a><a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogNewTricks_2e96.html" title="User:DogNewTricks"><span style="background-color:LavenderBlush;color:purple;">&#160;Connor&#160;K.&#160;</span></a></span></font>&#160; 20:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know Omegatron said it, but whether the article itself states that Wikipedia created the term isn't really relevant. We need to figure that out for ourselves. And Wikipedia did, in fact, create the term as a name for a law. The Scientific American article is titled "Kryder's Law", but that's an attempt to write a clever title, not an attempt to name a law.</dd>
<dd>Even if you insist, beyond all sense, that Scientific American created the term, it just isn't a widely used term. It's still a neologism, all you've done is insisted that it's Scientific American's neologism rather than Wikipedia's.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the sentiment behind deleting this article is, in a sense, an attempt to right a wrong (if one believes that hasty WP editors were to blame for this coinage). Unfortunately, the foop happened and is done. While the actual term may never be used in reality, the event was newsworthy and relevant to anyone, and the term itself has been discussed in contexts besides WP.
<dl>
<dd>If it were actually notable or newsworthy, I might agree with you, but it's not. I haven't seen any evidence that anyone significant is using the term except a blog and Slashdot entries that criticize Wikipedia for inventing it. And no, the criticism is not notable or newsworthy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">The Siegenthaler Wikipedia controversy</a> is notable and newsworthy; this is not.

<li>Request for clarification. I see a lot of people are claiming Wikipedia created this term, but the article states that "Mark Kryder of Seagate Technology, a former Carnegie Mellon University professor, named the law after himself." Which one is correct? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:28, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't find the claim that Kryder created the term anywhere in the Scientific American article. The other two online sources don't even mention Kryder, let alone Kryder's law.

<li><b>Possible compromise?</b>:I have no problem with a move or merge as Omegatron proposes above.

If <i>the concept</i> of hard drive size is given its own article, that's fine, but it should not be called Kryder's Law.") I think the SciAm article should be mentioned, but there is no need to imply that Kryder's Law is the accepted term for this phenomenon. If the material is merged into Moore's Law, it should be made clear that this is not part of the original Moore's Law, but an extension to other technologies.

<dd>I understand you think that deleting the article is the best way to go about this. I'd agree with a merge, but the point of this isn't to right a wrong. Wikipedia is never out there to "save face". Wikipedia is not trying to win over billions of people. It has not once made a press statement about it's "credibility".</dd>
<dd>All that aside, what do you suppose would happen if the law becomes will known by that name? Would you then want wikipedia to never have that article, because it would send the "wrong message". What is the point of deleting this article, Omegatron?</dd>
<dd><i>Generally speaking, neologisms should be avoided in articles because they may not be well understood, may not be clearly definable, and may even have different meanings to different people. Determining which meaning is the true meaning is original research — we don't do that here at Wikipedia. Articles that use neologisms should be edited to ensure they conform with the core Wikipedia policies: no original research and verifiability.</i> Where in there does it say that we should delete all "neologisms". I am not asking for the term to be defined. That would be against WP:OR. I am asking for the article to state it's sources, and say what it is. If "Kryder's Law" is a copy of another law, state it. State your sources. If I say it is a new word, I have to state my sources.</dd>
<dd><i>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from reliable sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term.</i> Lets not state the term is <i>THE</i> term.

<dd>Can we try to cool this down? I don't agree anyone made a mistake. The original editor chose the same name as an article in a respected publication. But Omegatron has a point that we shouldn't imply the name is widely accepted when there is no citable authority that says it is. Should that change in the future, we can adjust. In the meantime, if Omegatron and his supporters can live with a move or merge, I think it is time to move on.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 19:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Depends what you mean by "move or merge". Of course I have no problem with the concept of increasing hard drive size being presented; it's already presented in <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_law.html#Formulations_of_Moore.27s_Law" title="Moore's law">Moore's law#Formulations of Moore's Law</a>, and it would be great if it was expanded with the relevant content from this article (but not including the term). If people really want to keep the stuff about Wikipedia inventing the term and criticism of Wikipedia, it should be moved to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> (though I imagine the locally-active editors will delete it pretty quickly for being a trivial/unimportant example).</dd>
<dd>And yes, I would still like Kryder's law deleted. Turning it into a redirect gives the impression that it's a real term, when it's really just the title of a Scientific American article.</dd>

<p>I agree with Isotope23 and now support <b>Merge and redirect</b>. Let me make one more comment on why deletion is not the way to go. This article has been criticized externally. One of the strengths of Wikipedia in response to criticism is the transparency of its editing process. If someone wants to verify that the term "Kryder's Law" first appeared in Wikipedia only after the Scientific American article, they currently can. If they want to know when criticism of the term first showed up in the article they can look that up too. If they want to follow the debate on the talk page and see who took what postions when, they can. However once the article is deleted all that edit history will no longer be accessible to the public. It will look like we have something to hide.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 11:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> While it may well be true that the term was invented by Wikipedia, and that invention did in fact violate Wikipedia's rules, the fact remains the term does now exist and is used. You can't unring the bell. The topic now warrants inclusion in Wikipedia, even if it is Wikipedia's doing that made it so. This sort of thing happens. The <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a> accidentally invented the word <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllabus.html" title="Syllabus">syllabus</a>, but syllabus is now a sufficiently common word to warrant inclusion in any dictionary. --<a href="../../../l/l/e/User%7ELlewdor_f4c9.html" title="User:Llewdor">Llewdor</a> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. While I don't object to an eventual merge (which seems to me the most likely outcome of this discussion) I still would like to see hard evidence that the term was coined by Wikipedia. However, I'd strongly object to an actual deletion of the edit history, especially if content is merged into Moore's Law, per GFDL concerns. I may also point out that the term has been indexed by both <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_of_Science_3edd.html" title="Web of Science">Web of Science</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> (giving as only hit the SciAmer article, but still) so I'd seem contrary to logic to nuke the article completely. It would seem that, if this is indeed a neologism we created, that it is beyond our reach to stop its spread (Google "Kryder's law" -wikipedia). So much for that. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Run</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">e</font></a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> 17:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
