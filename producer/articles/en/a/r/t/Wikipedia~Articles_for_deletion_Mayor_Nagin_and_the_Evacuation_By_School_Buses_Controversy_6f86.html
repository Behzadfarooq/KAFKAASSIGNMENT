<p>User:JimmyCrackedCorn, a particularly uncivil editor, has created this article as a way to circumvent consensus-building on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Nagin_a73c.html" title="Ray Nagin">Ray Nagin</a>, which has been protected over his insistence upon inserting this same inadequately sourced and biased information into the Ray Nagin article. Several editors are currently working toward a consensus on how best to include information on the flooded school buses and criticism of Nagin inside the Ray Nagin article itself. Instead, JimmyCrackedCorn has created this fork without notifying anybody as a way to circumvent Wikipedia's policies in general and the discussion on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Talk%7ERay_Nagin_406f.html" title="Talk:Ray Nagin">Talk:Ray Nagin</a> (in particular see <a href="../../../r/a/y/Talk%7ERay_Nagin_406f.html#Forks" title="Talk:Ray Nagin">Talk:Ray Nagin#Forks</a>).

<p>Not at all. I am supporting consensus building at the Ray Nagin article as anyone can see by looking at the Ray Nagin discussion page. Your personal attack against me as "uncivil" has een noted as reported. No one has even tried to explain what is POV about the article on the article's discussion page. The fact that this article is factual and does not repress inconvenient fact is understandably irksome to those with a proNagin POV. However, as anyone can see this article is well balanced with Nagin's responsibilities, the event, Nagin's POV as well as the POV of both defenders and critics of Nagin. To delete this article would be a clear attempt to repress fact for no other reason than fact does not comport with an admitted "libertine's" POV. --JimmyCrackedCorn 23:10, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Amazing how every person who says delete appears to have a left wing POV. Most even admit this on their user pages. Examples:</p>
<p>Guettarda Politics Economic Left/Right: -4.13 Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.54. [1].</p>
<p>Peter: Bias Leftist social democrat</p>
<p>Katefan0: Libertine</p>
<p>Wikipedia will never see articles with NPOV if they allow such one sided contributors drive their content. I was told this place was a cesspool of leftism but did not believe it. I am becoming more and more convinced with each passing day I should have. --JimmyCrackedCorn 06:06, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
