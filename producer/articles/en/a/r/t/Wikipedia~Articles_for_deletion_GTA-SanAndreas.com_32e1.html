<li><b>Keep.</b> The idea that this article is 'non-noteable and not fit for an encyclopedia' is a matter of point of view. As far as the members of the forum the article is about are concerned it is extremely notable. We, as a whole, have worked to keep the entry in the correct writing style and with links to other Wikipedia article as needed. Also out of the three images in the article the one of Jack Thompson does in fact contain a caption, and the other two are obviously self-explanatory. The first image is the <i>main</i> image of the website and the second is the main image of the forum. As for the 'no other WP articles link to it' issue, the article has only been up and running for 2 days now, so that's not exactly very much time to be linked to by other articles. However we <i>are</i> listed in the Bulletin board systems, Virtual communities, &amp; Internet forums categories. This article is just as useful as others in those categories. –OptimumPx of GTA-SanAndreas.com 10:38 PM (EST), 12 January 2006 <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 4.153.232.121 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.153.232.121_5fd5.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.153.232.121">contribs</a>) 04:41, 13 January 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

It's the biggest GTA fansite on the internet, according to Alexa, and will soon be merged into GTAGuides.com. It's a notable site with more than 25,000 members.

<dd><b>Rebuttle:</b> By all means correct me: I was under the impression that Wikipedia is a resource for information about an entity. This article aims to give a description of the site in question and gives background information which may be of interest to other potential website administrators, as well as users interested in the site. It is unlikely that the article would be accessed through any other reason than in a quest for information, and therefore is hardly advertising. On the contrary, it often shows the problems that sites go through - <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenTie_0071.html" title="User:GoldenTie">GoldenTie</a> 23:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've taken the liberty of massively ripping out all the stupid forumvanity cruft. Nobody cares who had a forumwar with whom.

But <b>keep</b> as a generally notable site. If the cruft comes back, my vote may change. Seriously, people.

<li>Perhaps a section on <i>Forum Subculture</i> might be an appropriate place to put recurring themes within the forum - e.g. the Redism movement.

<li>No, it's just plain not interesting to people that people got pissed off at each other and banninated each other. There's nothing unique or interesting about it to anyone outside your forum. I would suggest creating your own wiki if you want to create a complete and detailed history of every single thing that ever happened on your forum. The "Redism controversy" is... two groups of people getting pissed off at each other on a forum. They had no impact on the broader world and they hold no interest to anyone outside your community. It's not going to help webmasters because it happens on every single forum, everywhere. Don't take this the wrong way, I'm sure it's of amazing import to you and the people on the forum... but to everyone else, it's just more forumdrama that happens on every single forum ever opened. You could write Ph.D dissertations on the forumdrama at some places I participate in, but it really doesn't belong on Wikipedia. What would be FAR more interesting and important to people on Wikipedia is a larger section on what GTA-SanAndreas.com offers to people who play the game - what sort of help can they get, what resources are offered, walkthroughs, whatnot. Every Web site with a forum has forumdrama, that's not unique. GTA-SanAndreas.com appears to offer a lot of great GTA:SA resources, and that is probably more unique, not to mention more interesting to anyone who's never visited your forums. Remember, Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:10, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the advice on what to include on the article: it's much more helpful to me and to those involved in the article to have suggestions as to what to add, as opposed to a nomination for deletion per se. I'll put something up! <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenTie_0071.html" title="User:GoldenTie">GoldenTie</a> 18:57, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't take it too personally - one of the things that's broken on Wikipedia is the "cleanup" system. The quickest way to get attention for an article that is questionable in terms of content is... to put it up for deletion and get a consensus from a lot of people looking at the article. It's not elegant and it's way too confrontational but there you have it, until we come up with a better way of doing it. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 19:10, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>True enough: I've put a brief paragraph on what the site contains. I'd like to expand it, but I'm not sure where the line is drawn between explaining the site's content, and just recreating the site navigation menu. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenTie_0071.html" title="User:GoldenTie">GoldenTie</a> 19:44, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Non-notability is not an official policy for deletion of Wikipedia articles. 80.249.48.45 13:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But websites can be deleted for being non-noteable. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html#Criteria_for_web_content" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Criteria_for_web_content</a>. Unless you believe that it meets the mentioned criteria, the site's non-notability <i>is</i> reason for deletion. --<b><a href="../../../r/6/m/User%7ER6MaY89_7c88.html" title="User:R6MaY89"><font color="#000">ʀ6ʍ</font></a><u>ɑ</u><a href="../../../r/6/m/User_talk%7ER6MaY89_8555.html" title="User talk:R6MaY89"><font color="#000">ʏ89</font></a></b> 20:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
