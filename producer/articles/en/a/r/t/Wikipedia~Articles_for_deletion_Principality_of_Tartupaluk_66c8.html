<p>A student and his project, and basically un-important satire, in lack of a better word. You can’t call it a hoax. Someone claiming Hans Island as a new “nation”. Indorsing something like this on wiki is not only demeaning for an encyclopedia, it is to open the door for every two-cent fun property claim out there. Normally I would put something like this up for speed delete, but lets hear what others have to say. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 02:40, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is neither real nor notorious! and in no way comparable to Sealand. At best half a dozen obscure online news outlets spend a few words on this. They don’t do it because “Principality of Tartupaluk” is news, but because “Hans Island” is in dispute and apparently news worthy. This student who “invented” this 2 month ago, is only trying to cash in on the fuzz. The very best indicator that this is rubbish and not notable at all, is that it is only the “project manager” himself that is trying to get it on wiki! Just tab in Principality of Tartupaluk in goggle = what story? <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 17:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this is a classic case of an article that did not require a listing at AfD. I suggest the nominator reads <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed</a>. A simple bit of merging and redirecting would have worked fine. I would do this myself, but it is inappropriate to do so while the deletion debate is in progress. However, if the article is deleted, how can the information be retrieved to put at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a>? I would urge the closing admin to consider this. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:45, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Because some clown looking for cheap publicity does not belong in a serious encyclopedia? There are a lot of individuals who do silly things like this to get into the papers, almost none of which are notable, all of whom are forgotten five minutes after the reader gets a little chuckle at their expense. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are focussing on the notability of the person, which is the wrong thing to focus on. I agree that the person is non-notable. The notable thing here is the history of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a>. Like it or not, this attempt to declare a micronation is part of the history of Hans Island, hence it should be noted at that article. I am not suggesting an article about the person, though if you want examples of people who generated media interest and have their own article, see <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_Urban_Shirk_a0b9.html" title="Amos Urban Shirk">Amos Urban Shirk</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pulsifer_7baa.html" title="Simon Pulsifer">Simon Pulsifer</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:44, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment to Carcharoth. Unfortunately it is not this simple. In fact redirect should never be used in such cases. If redirected two things happens, I indorse Hans island = Principality of Tartupaluk, which I absolutely don’t. But much more important wiki, the worlds largest encyclopedia, is now propagating that Hans island = Principality of Tartupaluk. That simply is wrong. You come to wiki because you are notable, wiki does not make you notable. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 17:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that redirects can be a problem if they imply the wrong thing. But I am not sure that this is consistently enforced. I can't think of a good example right now, but I am sure that similar cases in the past have been redirecte. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:54, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> User <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> has repeatedly removed all mention of the Principality of Tartupaluk from the "Recent events" section of the Hans Island page and attacked people who have objected. Just check the article's history. He/she seems to be of the OPINION that the Principality of Tartupaluk is a "satirical" exercise, but he/she doesn't seem to have any evidence to back this up. Unless he/she has some special knowledge not available from the primary sources, his/her arguments appear to be pure conjecture. Why is he/she now also pushing for this page's deletion? Its content is verifiable, appears to be neutral, and has appeared in several reputable news sources--not "obscure online outlets" as he/she claims. What's the rush to suppress it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, User:Tartupaluk yet again as a “new user” whose first action just happened to concern this issue. Hehe. Never mind. I have neither removed nor attack anybody, and there is an entire history log for anybody to see if they wish. On the issue however, “Principality of Tartupaluk” is an un-notable fun “project”, the likes that 10.000 students make in the parents basement each year. 9999 of them never sees year two. That simple does not belong in “Recent events” on a serious article on a serious encyclopedia. It should not be necessary to explain why this is so. You inserted it; I catapulted it to the satire section, cause there is no other place for it on the Hans Island article. This is btw not the place to discuss this; it goes on the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a> page. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 02:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
