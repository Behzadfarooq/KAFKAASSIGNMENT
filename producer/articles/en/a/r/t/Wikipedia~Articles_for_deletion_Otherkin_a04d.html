<p>This is an <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Obscure_topics" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">obscure topic</a>, as discussed in WP:V. To quote that section, <i>Subjects which have never been written about in published sources, or which have only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility should not be included in Wikipedia. One of the reasons for this policy is the difficulty of verifying the information. As there are no reputable sources available, it would require original research, and Wikipedia is not a place to publish original research. Insistence on verifiability is often sufficient to exclude such articles.</i></p>
<p>The sources here are various websites of dubious credibility. I think Otherkin would be a great topic for a <a href="http://wikinfo.org" class="external text" title="http://wikinfo.org" rel="nofollow">Wikinfo</a> article, but I don't see enough verifiability for this to be included here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:14, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>No vote</b></s> <i>(changed to keep, below)</i>. I'm confused. Doesn't a website count as a published source?

<li>That's not what the nominator said. The article's sources are websites <i>of dubious credibility</i>, and the article seems to be built up from a lot of first-person stories on the Web. The veracity of those primary sources cannot be verified by Wikipedia readers, who are thus required to take the article on faith. Wikipedia needs to report the results of other people who have studied otherkin; right now, this article collects the experiences of otherkin, which makes it original sociological research. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> notes that it is rare for an article to be built from primary sources alone, especially if it is a contested topic. Ideally the article would be severely stubified but given its history I don't think the regular authors would be willing to do so, so <font color="#FF0000"><b>delete</b></font> to send the NOR message, and possibly write a new stub based on secondary sources until more can be found to expand the article reliably. I'd consider changing my vote if the article is cleaned up to not take primary sources at face value. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 14:49, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't imagine how deleting an article could <i>not</i> send a message, unless the contributors are known to have left Wikipedia. The message is "Do not put this sort of thing in Wikipedia". Sometimes the message is even made explicit with the "This article is deleted, please don't recreate it" template that I can't find right now. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 23:52, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is not that deleting it will not send a message, but that it is not the appropriate way to send the desired message. It seems kind of agreed upon that otherkin is a real topic, just that there is the issue of getting proper sources and an article that reflects those sources. So wouldn’t deleting the article and putting up a warning to not recreate it be effectively hiding from the issue instead of trying to fix the issue itself? And if you intend to replace the article with something else, then I don’t see the point of deleting the article instead of normal editing. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 00:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's a "sociological truth"?

<ul>
<li>A sociological truth is one that we need a sociologist to declare before we can acknowledge it as a truth. =P You seem to be working so hard to make sure the Wikipedia-specific definitions are remembered you're forgetting the functions they were intended to serve; we follow the "no original research" policy not as an <i>end in itself</i>, but to keep Wikipedia free of crackpots and cranks who want Wikipedia to publicize their pet theories. To say that people are not credible sources for statements about <i>what their own beliefs are</i> and that we must wait until a "reputable publication" has covered them and then take that publication's word over the word of those they're reporting on just shows the hazards of taking any policy and following it too literally too long. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:35, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b> -- There are core facts that are easily verifiable here: a number of people consider themselves to be otherkin, the exact specifics of which change depending upon who you talk to. The only parts that are unverifiable are whether what these people claim to be true is actually true (though common sense should tell us otherwise). The fact that these claims are made is undeniable, well-documented, and widespread. I severely question the rationale in interpreting the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy in such an exaggerated way. If we keep things down to object facts and avoid the weirdness we get periodically where certain editors claim it's real, that certain otherkin are better than others, that they are psychic and reinarnated and have animal DNA and yada yada yada as if they were proven, then there is no problem. Documenting nutty fringe beliefs is quite verifiable, as this particular one is not so small that there's any problems involved on that end, assuming we can get past the people constantly inserting their own POV and making false claims that rewriting for NPOV is "disrespectful" shos "bad faith" and whatever other nonsense they come up with. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:12, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've never heard the term Otherkin before, but conceptually I will agree that as a sub-culture these people do exist... albeit in small numbers.

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b>. The dubious sources are not being cited for their dubious veracity, but as products of a subculture. There's a significannt, if fringe, subculture of people who think they are elves or vampires or whatnot, and the existance of a market in books and such about and being sold to such people is evidence that such a subculture exists. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 01:32, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The main problem with the article (not just this version, but anything about the topic) is that it needs, perforce, to lump together a very broad spectrum of beliefs, ranging from simple alternate spirituality to pseudoscience to outright lunacy. So some of it is verifiable as much as anything in the realm of religion, spirituality, or philosophy; while other parts are very difficult to source reliably or at all. But it is worth keeping as, at least, a verifiably notable phenomenon (although until reading the article I had never actually heard the term "otherkin", even though instantiations of the belief system had been related to me). <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 01:51, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> There may be little point in commenting further, but I still want to clarify. Of <i>course</i> there are lots of them; what does that have to do with anything? I know there are also lots of people who, for example, like to eat jello. However, if someone wrote an article describing these folks and giving information about them, I'd want verifiability there also. There is a difference between what exists and what's verifiable. In theory, WP is meant to include only things that are verifiable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:38, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Same old Communists vs. people with red hair distinction. Self-described "otherkin" have a shared culture and influence each other (unless you want to get anal about whether there's a larger "otherkin" culture or if it's a series of distinct, discrete subcultures, but then you're into content issues and not whether or not this article should be deleted), instead of just having a shared attribute (a belief/delusion, depending on your POV). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 15:44, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As for the content question of one subculture v multiple, that's a good, valid question. I'd be tempted to consider the spiritual side of the Otherkin movement to be a subset of modern shamanism. The problem with these kinds of content questions is, there has been no way to resolve them. With no proper sources, it's just up to editor's opinions. Thus, this article functions as a magnet for original research. We haven't even been able to resolve fundamental questions, such whether "Otherkin" is the proper blanket term for things like "Vampyres", "Dragons", "Elves", and "Therianthropes". When the Otherkin community has a variety of different definitions and beliefs, there's little hope of consensus on this article. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:36, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>By itself, the number of othrekin means little, but combine with their self-describing nature yields a lot of material written on the group from within. Many attempt to describe the group as a whole, noting various observations. To me, that seems to be the point most of the original research is being done, even though WP has to attempt to combine information from several such sources (doesn’t this happen, to some degree, for most subjects?). Looking at the bigger picture, in my opinion, an article on this would add to WP’s encyclopedic value, as many people do stumble upon it and can benefit by seeing a general overview of the subject that is confirmable at the basic level in various otherkin sources. The details are much harder to work out, and as MCB already mentioned, such a diverse group is very hard to talk about as a whole, but that is a matter of cleaning up and not deletion in my opinion. I may be misinterpreting policy though, so I’ll only comment instead of vote for now. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 17:50, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This entire nomination seems to me to be a complete misunderstanding that we only demand verification, and bar original research, <i>to the degree that a claim is questionable</i>. To delete this article implies that we cannot verify <i>any</i> of the claims contained therein, not even "people who describe themselves as Otherkin exist"; to say that we cannot verify that, despite being able to go to hundreds of websites where people <i>are</i> describing themselves as Otherkin, because we cannot quote some professional source who has also read the websites affirming that yes, Otherkin exist -- if the nominator didn't appear to be entirely serious I would suspect an attempt at <i>reductio ad absurdam</i>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:38, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I think it's rather clear from even a casual reading that the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> rule exists for preventing wikipedia from becoming a platform for cranks or <i>pet theories</i>; the Otherkin article is neither. Otherwise the article describing <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">Brights</a> would need to be deleted as well: it also explains the nature of a term used by a group to describe itself, and from primary sources at that. I'm sure it wouldn't take much effort to find other examples. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoren_fcf0.html" title="User:Coren">Coren</a> 21:54, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So all of the people claiming to be otherkin simply do not exist? Are all such accounts that come up in my web-browser an optical illusion, since you seem to claim that they don't exist? And you are right that no scientist would likely write a paper on this in a science journal, since this is a <i>cultural</i> topic, not a science one. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 16:55, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I realize you are trolling, but I will bite. I never say people who suffer from dellusions do not exist, simply that the dellusion is just that with nothing to back up the claim but angsty blogs. FYI: Sociologists write plenty of scientific papers on cultural topics, it's their job. Psychologists likewise write plenty of papers on similar dellusions, their job as well. <a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">Agriculture</a> 17:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, all I am suggesting is that as long as this group actually exists, there is reason for this page to not be deleted as an actual factual article can exist on it. If the article simply states verifiably what the people are (and hence listing what they claim, as claims not fact) and any recorded counterpoints to it, then that would appear to be a factual article to me. At the moment, the word trolling appears it can go both ways, so please avoid such attacks and so that we can move on and actually discuss a compromise on this.<a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 17:26, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article could be reworked, I'd agree, but the POV pushers have so far prevented any factual additions to the article. On the issue of trolling, I am simply posting my opinion and stating it as such. You're making shit up and wildly and purposefully exaggerating my statements so you can troll for defenses to your strawman arguements. Nice to meet you AtomicDragon, now stop trolling because I have no tolerance for trolls. I will not respond to your trollish statements again. <a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgriculture_50fc.html" title="User:Agriculture">Agriculture</a> 17:29, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have both made some exaggerations in the end as an attempt to illustrate a point. That worked out poorly, so it is at least a mistake on my part. Nonetheless, we will need to have some actual discussion to work this out, and simply not state that our own view on the situation is clearly the correct one.<a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomicDragon_d755.html" title="User:AtomicDragon">AtomicDragon</a> 17:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please remember <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>, Agriculture, and stop making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Neither your original argument nor your subsequent argument hold up. Your first argument was 'no reputable source will ever say "Yes, what Otherkin claim about themselves is true"; therefore, we must delete this article as unverifiable.' The enthymeme there is "all articles about Otherkin must describe their claims as truth, rather than as their claims." This is not the case. Your subsequent argument is that "POV pushers will always prevent the article from being maintained in an NPOV state." The number of articles that are actually worth deleting simply because we cannot come to agreement on them is minimal. Since you yourself have only edited <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> twice and one of those edits was simply to place three cleanup tags on it at once, I question whether you have sufficient knowledge of what happens when you <i>try</i> NPOVing the article to declare that it could never possibly work. By the way, speaking of verifiability, would you mind giving us details on the University of Minnesota study you refer to in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Otherkin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24031138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Otherkin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24031138" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? Since much of the discussion here has been made under the assumption that no professional study of those who believe themselves "otherkin" has been made, and since your edit (which I'm sure you marked 'minor' by accident) contradicts that, I'm sure providing details would be appreciated. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:38, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think an important distinction was made: scholarly treatment of Otherkin is NOT going to amount to a scientific effort to prove or disprove their beliefs. That would just be silly. Christianity (or any major religion) is obviously verifiable as a belief system without needing to prove or disprove their beliefs. FWIW, the closest thing I've seen to a scholarly treatment of this is over at <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_lycanthropy.html" title="Clinical lycanthropy">Clinical lycanthropy</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:32, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Article is controversial and certainly has its problems caused by warring POVs, but this is a topic not covered by other encyclopedias but worthy of inclusion in this one. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodfox_2c77.html" title="User:Todfox">Kit</a> 22:10, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Stong Keep But Clean Up</b> For many, this is a spiritual path. No religion on the planet is independantly verifiable and yet there's nothing wrong with providing a basic set of information on what it's follower's believe. Writing a book on the subject doesn't make it true, it just makes it published. There are significant and serious sites which address the subject which act in the same manner of highlighting and defining the term. It doesn't matter if you share the belief or not. What wiki is supposed to be about is giving information on a variety of subjects. Why is otherkin not a valid subject to give information on? One need not share it's view to still acknowledge it is a valid viewpoint/belief/path for some people. It is, therefore, it should be discussed. You can't simply remove something because you don't believe it personally.</p>
