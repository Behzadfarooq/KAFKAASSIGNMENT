<li><b>Keep</b>, I disagree with the above. The character has been in the feature film as well as the short fillm that inspired it, a series of promos for a farm competition out in the Western United States, and a number of TV appearances as the character.

<li>I wouldn't oppose it if you did, honestly. I think the appearance of the <i>character</i> in so many non-film contexts confers even more "notability" than meets the grasp of the movie article.

<dd>Customer experience is not customer service, I would not suggest a merge. Customer service -contributes- to the customer experience, just as satisfaction with the usage of a product does. The article is not self-promotional. Whether the author is "well known" is relative, and whether he is "professional researcher" seems to be a personal judgement. Agree on removing the external link. Apart from that I feel as it is there is not sufficient reason to delete this article. -- DavidJacques 05:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Having won the NWA Great Lakes Jr. Heavyweight championship doesn't make him notable. It's just a small regional title. The title itself is notable, but people who have won it are not, unless notable in some other way of course. Also OWW is not really a valid source since it has many factual errors, as its contributions are apparently not verified. ↪<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakes_4216.html" title="User:Lakes">Lakes</a> <span style="font-size: 80%">(<a href="../../../l/a/k/User_talk%7ELakes_cbed.html" title="User talk:Lakes">Talk</a>)</span> 07:05, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Move this article to a wrestling wiki. Also: as stated above, OWW isn't a reliable source. It's a glorified fan site.

<li>Well, if you want an article here at Wikipedia, it needs to follow the guidelines for Wikipedia. This article, as has been demonstrated here, fails to do this.

If you can't do this, my&#160;!vote stands. If you feel otherwise and it gets removed, take it to deletion review.

<li>Simple answer: no. More complex answer: we're pretty much trying to maintain a standard here, and while those rules are a bit on the stringent side on the surface, said rules give that standard a basis - so in short, there's a method to the madness. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes thats true. But you guys can have that right to delete anything offensive, like i said before. If theres anything claiming that type of stuff on their page, it has the right to be deleted. And for the garage bands thing, that would be good for the website. It could show which ones are in what area of the city, country, etc. And some people have heard of small ones that are just performing at fairs, and maybe they ant to know more about the band. And some people cant afford to make their own websites, and basically if this is a free encyclopedia, they would at least put up their page right here while trying to makeing their own and they would eventually delete this one. Just give everyone a chance. And if somebody keeps overdoing their rights, they lose the privelage of making anything at all or everyone loses it instead and it goes back to the way it was in the beginning. What have you guys got to lose? I know that before maybe you guys had that feeling to promote a little something when you started this yourself. And since you couldnt, instead you just stuck with the rules. Like everyone says, rules are made to be broken. Whats the danger in doing that right now? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.83.6.10 (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.83.6.10.html" title="User talk:75.83.6.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.83.6.10_8a8e.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.83.6.10">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>I certainly acknowledge that we have a clause about <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring all rules</a>, and certainly you're right - rules are definitely made to be broken. But this is one of those cases that would violate the spirit of that link. To respond point by point to you, though: Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>, so offensive material will be found. Garage bands and the like must still adhere to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and therein <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> comes into play too. Making a website is easy - HTML is not hard, and there are sites that let you publish for free; Wikipedia is not such a site, it is not a means for a band to get their name out. What we have to lose is the integrity that we continually strive to maintain, and by allowing advertisements of this fashion, we lose that integrity. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:14, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I can only find minor, minor references to this artist online . . . some sources suggest that he might indeed be working with Timbaland, but they aren't necessarily reliable sources. Amazon.com lists one single for sale, but no album. The kicker for me was that the article for the supposed album {The Long Road Ahead) claims that "The Album Is Certified Gold At The End Of It's First week ending January 23, Selling 120,000 units in the USA" and I couldn't find any chart mentions at all for Nicholas Strunk on billboard.com (note that his myspace.com reference lists MULTIPLE chartings for various songs). <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 03:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I went through the first three pages of Google hits (with and without quotation marks) before I nominated the article for deletion. I certainly don't think this is a complete hoax. I believe that the subject does have at least one single. Notice, however, that the Google hits contain zero or virtually zero media mentions. Everything is either a lyrics site (and many of those are open-submission, aren't they) or some sort of message board posting. And billboard.com returned nothing when I searched for the subject's name. At the very least, the claims of notability are inflated. Also, one account has made all the edits for both the subject and the supposed album, which is very odd for an artist who is supposedly certified gold. With the absence of sources, I'd say that this fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 03:39, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Stokkelandsvannet</i> is in no way notable, neither for it's size (approx 4 km all the way around), it's levels of pollution or for any flora or fauna living there.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a normal combination of words, so there will be plenty of hits. The article doesn't establish that "Academic Citizenship" has been used as a special phrase with unique meaning. To put it another way: "X citizenship is a special case of the more general condition of being a citizen. Specifically, X citizenship refers to the rights and responsibilities of someone who is a member of an X community, owing allegiance to that community and being entitled to protection from it." Fill in the blank. There's <i>something</i> here, but it belongs in a larger article such as <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">academia</a> (and it needs to be sourced.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 21:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the author, Glenys Livingstone, and I am sorry if I have done something wrong in the procedure as I gather I have by the warning above, but by what was said here about "your vote on the deletion policy, and vote only once," I understood that it <b>was</b> a ballot - and particularly so on this page. Please explain. I thought then that the discussion was really happening on talk pages elsewhere - which is where I have posted my comments thus far, and waiting dutifully to come to this page only once and "vote" as we were apparently being told to do. So can you please clarify what is correct? I thought it was <i>encouraged</i> to alert people who might care about the outcome of ths AFD to come here and support it, and also to edit the topic itself, as I have encouraged them to do. Like me most I know need encouragement to come to this auspicious site and edit or say <i>anything</i> ... in case it is <i>wrong</i> or feeling like they don't have "clout" and don't bother.Pagaian 22:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Glenys, perhaps I can clear up some of these issues for you. When most people hear the word "vote", what they think it means is "oh, each person comes by, casts a 'ballot' for one of the choices, and then an answer is calculated solely from the totals of the ballots." A deletion discussion is definitely <i>not</i> a vote in that sense, because the answer is <i>not</i> calculated solely from the totals of the ballots. The totals of the ballots will be a <i>factor</i> in the decision made by the admin who closes the discussion -- but other factors include how well those who support a particular fate for the article support their argument with reference to deletion policy, and how much reason we have to think that the opinion of someone who supports a particular fate for the article is an educated opinion based on a real understanding of Wikipedia's goals and its standards. I couldn't begin to count the deletion discussions, for example, where a horde of people showed up to assure us "X is good! X is great! X is wonderful!" which had absolutely <i>no</i> effect in their favor because it showed that they didn't understand the <i>real</i> crux of the issue was not "is X good?" but "is X already notable, or only expecting to <i>become</i> notable? is there enough reliable information from trustworthy sources to write about X or are we only getting a few opinions, all from parties with personal stakes in how X is presented?" That is why, if someone who we've never seen on Wikipedia before comes in and makes a good argument, not only valid but sound, about how the article on X fits Wikipedia's criteria and should be kept, it <i>will</i> have an effect on the outcome, whereas if someone who never showed interest in Wikipedia before this deletion discussion shows up and says nothing but "I think this article should be kept" it's not going to have much effect at all. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To answer the first question, no, you should not and <a href="http://pagaian.org/news/pagaian-cosmologywikipedia" class="external text" title="http://pagaian.org/news/pagaian-cosmologywikipedia" rel="nofollow">this</a> may be the reason for the warning above, although I'm willing to assume you did not know you were doing anything wrong and that it is a simple mistake. Whether an article should be kept or note is generally based on certain longstanding policies and guidelines, and especially the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines. It does not really matter how much "clout" you have or how many people you can bring to a debate. It's the arguments that count. Editors can make multiple comments, but should only put forth one <b>delete</b> or <b>keep</b>. Also, if you have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict-of-interest</a> in the subject matter (as you very definitely do here) it may annoy some editors if you are seen as actively campaigning for the article and cause them to view the article as <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamicruftisement</a>.

<li><b>Retain</b> I object to the deletion of the article on ‘PaGaian Cosmology’ because it meets Wiki’s three cardinal content policies. It has been written from a neutral point of view, representing its views fairly and without bias, it has been researched, reviewed and published by a substantial number of reliable secondary sources and does not contain any unpublished material. The word PaGaian is well defined within the article as a unique synthesis of two well known words ie ‘pagan’ and ‘Gaia’, which in my opinion rules out any need to define it as a ‘neologism’. The book is based on 30 years of research and development involving many participating groups and is an outcome of the author’s doctoral thesis. The book <i>PaGaian Cosmology – Re-inventing Earth-based Goddess Religion</i> published by iUniverse, Inc in 2005 '<i><b>together with numerous independent reviews</b>, is made freely available via a creative commons licence at <a href="http://pagaian.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://pagaian.org" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> an open source website that is increasingly attracting notice with a total of 11404 hits and 4261visits within the past five months. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalpagaia_103e.html" title="User:Malpagaia">Malpagaia</a> 12:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the term is "defined in the article" as a "unique synthesis" then it definitely would be considered a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> for present purposes.

As for my experieces, I was concerned when I noticed that this term was up for deletion (It is a term that I use to describe my spirituality) and decided to do my own independent research on line to see if Glenys Livingstone was a notable personality and if her work has actually been peer reviewed and referenced by other authors. I found significant evidence that Glenys and her PaGaian work is widely recognized in Australia and that she is a notable personality in that country in the Neo-Pagan community. Her work has been reviewed by several peer journals (see comment above). I would like to be able to post specific areas that Glenys and/or her work on PaGaianism is noted on line. I'm not sure where to do this. Please advise. .<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosewelsh_4316.html" title="User:Rosewelsh">rosewelsh</a> January 30, 2007 UPDATED: I've just verified that Glenys has been quoted in Matthew Fox's book The Coming of the Cosmic Christ on page 12. The quote was from her Master's thesis. She was also invited by Starhawk a notable pagan author from the US, to help her organize an event in the Sydney area. Furthermore, most of the information about Glenys can be found by Googling her exact name and spending about an hour researching the links provided. User:rosewelsh|rosewelsh]] 2:20pm MST 1/30/07</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> . First, about me. As you can see, I've been a member on wikipedia for a while (I don't remember how long - more than a few months, less than 2 years). I haven't posted much at all, but do read wikipedia and donate money to wikimedia. I check on the veracity of wiki articles partly because I'm a scientist myself. Pagaian Cosmology is a new, important, and notable term. It's not New Age - New Age relies heavily on pseudoscience and supernatural ideas like reincarnation, crystal power, astrology etc. Quite the opposite, Pagaian Cosmology explicity has a naturalistic worldview consistent with science. As a scientist myself, I've noticed a terrible dearth of spiritual approaches that are based on a verifiable, scientific worldview. I think approaches like this hold immense promise for the future, and as such are very notable. The New Age movements don't stay consistent with science, nor do the many rapidly growing Pagan movements. Calling Pagaian Cosmology "New Age" shows a lack of understanding of it's basic ideas. As far as my untrained eyes can tell, the article is neutral, well researched, traceable, and fits wiki criteria. Even if it didn't, it seems to me that the best response would be to fix any perceived problems instead of deleting it. While I don't use Pagaian Cosmology myself, it's clear to me that it is notable, important, timely, and enhances wikipedia as a resource on relevant terms in today's world.

<li>I think you've hit the nail on the head when you mention your "untrained eyes". You say you've "been a member on wikipedia for a while" but [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Equinox2|two" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Equinox2|two" rel="nofollow">edits</a>] made on a single day over twenty-five months ago is really not much at all -- and the fact that you talk about how "approaches like [Pagaian Cosmology] hold immense promise for the future" when that has <i>absolutely no relevance to an AfD</i> doesn't give us a lot of reason to think that you've been accumulating an accurate idea of what "wiki criteria" are. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Retain</b>. To label Pagaian cosmology as unnotable new age is seriously to miss the point of this thoroughly well researched and documented approach to ecospirituality which is grounded in the ancient Earth based Pagan traditions and augmented with a thoughtful retelling of Goddess based metaphor and narrative. Does Wikipedia exist to promote knowledge and inquiry that complements and supplements that available in more orthodox reference works or is it intent on censoring, editing and deleting that which its editors and contributors do not immediately recognise or understand? The naturalistic, ecospirituality movement is a growing force in the world, an idea that has found its time, and, in my own personal view, is both noteworthy and notable for the way in which it has influenced culture, politics, business and society in the last twenty years or so and for the manner in which it continues to influence thinking people across the globe today.</li>

<li>It does seem to be the case that there is a thing near "Zhonggang" (itself a quite obscure location at best) which one postermaker, several travel agents, and one Wikipedia editor believe is named "Pyenzhangling". Personally, my guess is that this thing is actually Pelgye Ling; it might be interesting to speculate on where the misspelling first arose. However, the situation remains that, of the sources we have found which verify its existence none qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. What are we going to merge? There is certainly not a single piece of information in this article which should appear in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milarepa.html" title="Milarepa">Milarepa</a>.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 17:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we have a case of ambiguous transliteration it would help to have a clear idea of what it is also transliterated as. As for Pelgye Ling, I can't find a link with both it and Zhonggang outside of this discussion. Does anyone have an alternate transliteration for Zhonggang? -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangelv_5bf8.html" title="User:Strangelv">Strangelv</a> 18:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the existence of the monastery is not in doubt, and I get a bunch of good links both to (Nyalam) Pelgye Ling and Pelgyeling, then it's acceptable to include it and keep the redirect in place as a feasible misspelling. The questions here are really: 1. Is Pyengzhangling a different monastery from Pelgye Ling? So far we found no evidence for it. 2. Is the monastery, under whichever name, notable enough for a standalone article? My hunch right now is no, since the only notability is has is derived from the proximity to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milarepa%27s_Cave_9cf1.html" title="Milarepa's Cave">Milarepa's Cave</a>. And 3. What's the most common name we should use in the article? Evidence points towards Pelgye Ling. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's sort of an interesting philosophical question: if there is a monastery that a few people think is called Pyenzhangling, but it is not actually called that, does "Pyenzhangling" exist? In this instance, whether it does exist or not, we have no reliable source of information about it. The reason I would hesitate to describe this situation simply as ambiguous transliteration is that "Pyenzhangling" is not a very plausible Tibetan or Chinese word, since nothing resembling the sequence "py" occurs in the modern standard forms of either. It could be some kind of regional variant Tibetan, but that's purely speculative. As for Zhonggang, it appears to be a Chinese word, so there wouldn't be another spelling of the Chinese name, but it might also be known under a similar or completely different Tibetan name.</li>
<li>Everything we've seen about this Pyenzhangling so far links it to Milarepa's Cave, so let's just make it a redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milarepa%27s_Cave_9cf1.html" title="Milarepa's Cave">Milarepa's Cave</a> and be done with it.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 21:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm sorry to be brusque, but I haven't gotten the impression that any of the participants knows anything about the subject so far.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nat_Krause_5656.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nat Krause">What have I done?</a>)</sup> 04:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just discovered an entry in the article namespace named "List of criticisms articles." Every entry in the article namespace must qualify as a self-standing encyclopedic entry, and thus satisfy article naming conventions. So I moved "List of criticisms articles" to "List of articles on criticism in Wikipedia" a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Note in the Wikipedia namespace there is a section entitled <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a>.</p>
<p>Was I correct in moving the entry, or should I have followed the procedure for speedy deletion? In my years of making editorial and administrative decisions on Wikipedia, I'm not usually so stumped. So I'm going here for feedback, even though my position so far is <b>neutral</b>. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 05:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The moved name makes the article a <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self reference</a>. This list is missing a number of WP articles, such as <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_BBC_83f4.html" title="Criticism of the BBC">Criticism of the BBC</a>, but if the AfD is merely to determine a better name for the article, wouldn't the article talk page be a more appropriate place? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 06:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Why do I have to have a position? On one hand, the content is currently more relevant to the project namespace than the main namespace. On the other hand, there are many articles related to Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Maybe the original author (User:J.J.) intended to start an article complimenting coverage in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> entry on organization of the encyclopedia?

Laziness never triumphs, I suppose. Anyway - to the point. Removed PROD. "Combat Rock Promotion" results in a number of geocities sites, a few bios on nn websites, an official website which is, despite the redirect, actually hosted on an Earthlink site, and so forth.

Google search does generate a few example of this term being used in very selected forums as a part of casual vocabulary - but it does not appear to be anything more than a swear-word introduce by a group of school friends.

<p>This article is of a corporation that is not notable. Only primary sources (FTC pages, Better Business Bureau, and the company's website itself) have been used as sources to construct this article. Nothing of consequence ever seems to have been written about this company by third parties. This constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Further, the primary editors of this article seem to be the principals, and various people upset at the fact that the principals have edited the article.

<p>Stumbled upon this page when doing new page patrol. It's completely in Spanish and I've tagged it for translation, but from my (admittedly poor) grasp of Spanish it appears to be talking about a Spanish hip-hop musician who allegedly sold 100,000 copies of one of his records in Mexico. Google search finds nothing from reliable sources to verify the claims or that there is a Spanish hip hop artist named "Eddie Bi" or "Eduardo Castillo". <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 08:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Armed with Google and my high-school Spanish, I went search for confirmation of notability for this artist, and found nothing that even confirmed this artist's existence.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> under db-notenglish. My reasoning is very simple: if this fellow were notable, he would probably have an article in the Spanish version of Wikipedia. Of course, that's not so much a reason as a supporting argument.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can not see what Strangelv means, at all. Something no longer exists, and so is notable?

<p>The organization is very much alive and has an active web site. References to it have recently appeared in BBC, International Herald Tribune, and New York Times articles. FreeMediaOnline.org articles are widely republished on the web. Analysis: Kremlin seen cracking down on US-funded radio stations in Russia BBC Monitoring Media, July 12, 2006; FreeMediaOnline.org founder Ted Lipien: "The soft power of information and news is grossly under-appreciated." International Herald Tribune: Voice of America's new leader faces changing times, November 26, 2006; Ted Lipien, who retired in April as a marketing director for Europe and Asia, created FreeMediaOnline.org, a Web site and foundation to support independent journalism. He is lobbying to maintain Voice of America programs in Russia, which are scheduled for elimination under the budget cut plans. “They have focused on the Middle East and taken money away from programming for other regions,” he said. “Once your audience goes down, it creates a vicious circle.” A New Leader at a Voice Long Familiar to Listeners, The New York Times, November 27, 2006. 76.21.127.25 21:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reference to FreeMediaOnline.org being bought out by Newsweek was totally false and probably designed to cause confusion. This is a nonprofit, public benefit organization designed to promote media freedom. It is totally independent, not for sale and cannot be bought. Its news web site is active and updated daily. Its reports are picked up by independent media organizations and bloggers around the world.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The bases for considering the deletion of this very notable organization have been disproven in this discussion. -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangelv_5bf8.html" title="User:Strangelv">Strangelv</a> 18:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article is strongly POV, but founder Lipien's (VOA) history and "free speech elsewhere/or propaganda" nature of the groups activities makes this organization notable. Article needs criticism section and wikify. I added a <a href="http://www.freepress.net/news/19334" class="external text" title="http://www.freepress.net/news/19334" rel="nofollow">link</a> to FreePress.net as a source that documents at some length Lipien's history and the founding of this site. Site is clearly up and running as all other current references point to the cite. This can doubtlessly be cured. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 20:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>addendum: I just noticed that article from FreePress.net is actually reprinted from New York Times (November 24, 2006 by Doreen Carvajal.) That should help. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 20:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>further addendum: The article in the NYT immediately above, the article Strangelv cites above with a slightly different date, and the note (5) cite in the article from the International Herald Tribune all seem to be the same article. I don't want to seem to appear to be over representing sources.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 22:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm gonna have to think about this, but my immediate reaction as with Brianyoumans, is that Hastings Street is a big <b>keep</b>. Sperling I can see, and although Willingdon's a much more major street there's not much to report; Kensington also, other than the Burnaby Lake Rec Complex and its freeway exit (as with Willingdon). The tricky one is Cariboo Road (Burnaby) - it has a history behind it, and like Douglas Road was one of the original after the area's survey was carried out; both are obscure now, but at one time were all there was. Hastings, though, has to stay for all kinds of reasons, whether it's the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Eastside_%28Vancouver%29_403c.html" title="Downtown Eastside (Vancouver)">DTES</a> or the West Hastings banking district, and everything that lies between; as well as what lies along it as it runs out to end in Burnaby (just past Sperling, and nearly right in front of my porch, as a matter of fact...).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> If they are all that important, they would have been the primary subject of nontrivial coverage in reliable sources. I do not agree that all streets are inherently notable, or that things people like do not need multiple articles about them to prove notability. If several good references are added where the subject if the street per se, and not just a mention of a store on the street or a car accident on the street, I might change my mind. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>Well, with Hastings Street the problem is that the article is still just a stub. It's one of the main axes of the metropolis and will have all kinds of non-trivial coverage once someone can spend time on the article and "flesh it out". The others are much more marginal, although as noted there's history behind Cariboo Road (which needs to be added/written, granted, but it's not a simple arterial like Willingdon or Kensington/Sperling; that Hastings also happens to Hwy 7A, in the same way that Kingsway is 99A, is a further factor.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:36, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hastings is possibly the most important street in Vancouver's history. By building a road to Hastings township, the CPR's Gastown/Granville/False Creek (modern "downtown") Vancouver severed the area, essentially modern East Vancouver, from the older New Westminster, from which it was built as an extension where the New West coach met the Burrard Inlet ferry. I would definitely <b>keep</b> the Hastings article. I'd probably delete the rest. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 00:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>quibbles</i> on historical geography of Hastings Street I'll save for outside this discussions, but Hastings does have to be a "keep"; it would be like deleting Yonge Street from Toronto, or Ste. Catherine's from Montreal....I still have strong reservations about deleting Cariboo Road (Burnaby), because of existence of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cariboo_Road_94ce.html" title="Cariboo Road">Cariboo Road</a>, about-to-be <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Cariboo_Road_85ca.html" title="Old Cariboo Road">Old Cariboo Road</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cariboo_Highway_56d8.html" title="Cariboo Highway">Cariboo Highway</a>, and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Cariboo_Highway_cb66.html" title="Old Cariboo Highway">Old Cariboo Highway</a>. Ppl might look up Cariboo Road, meaning the Burnaby one, and not find anything; could just be a subparag on the others, though; not as major an early road as Douglas Road or Westminster Road or North Road - or Hastings Road, for that matter - but from the same era (though Hastings Rd was more like Powell-McGill than modern Hastings Street).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC) PS the difference with Lillooet Road (North Vancouver), in case anyone brings it up, is that it's actually built on the road bed of the <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillooet_Cattle_Trail_9418.html" title="Lillooet Cattle Trail">Lillooet Cattle Trail</a>; the Cariboo Road in Bby didn't connect with the actual Cariboo Roads, either the one from Yale or the one from Lillooet.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Donteatyellowsnow's "contribution" to the AFD discussion here is IMO largely petulant and destructive; from railing against Vancouver's and BC's mere existence in the Hollywood North AFD, he's now presuming to pontificate on street articles here, and even on a BC mention in <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_towns.html" title="Ghost towns">Ghost towns</a>, which was my addition and apparently found by "stalking" me through my Edit Contributions.

They have released three albums, but none of those on a major label or recognized large indie label; Godfather records is described as a label they founded themselves. As far as directories, these are considered to be works that provide only trivial coverage: release dates, titles, and so forth. If the albums were released on a major label, or they had won a major award, or really any of the other criteria, that would be one thing, but the absence of any major coverage by a non-trivial published work trumps all other concerns in the meantime. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Meh I didnt say keep them just because they sound like them, but the fact there mp3s were being disguised on filesharing programs as their songs and people were believing it, just like james labries solo album was mistaken for the new dream theater and that ayreon song with bruce dickinson was labled as new iron maiden. I am sure both those instances are probably mentioned somewhere on wikipedia. I didn't even say that was the only reason. They have 3 albums, also when adding bands to a list, most lists require the band to have a page, so for example the list of christian metal bands page would not be allowed to have eternal decision on it since they do not have a page, even though they are a very notable band for that genre. --<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 10:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point taken. In this case, though, I think the claim according to the nominator -- and I don't think this claim has been proven false as of yet, hence my vote -- is that no acceptable sources exist, and that therefore the article's central claim of notability cannot be validated. So putting the unreferenced tag on the article wouldn't have solved anything. The article is up for deletion on the grounds that there are no reliable sources to reference. At least that's my understanding. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 08:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, and television documentaries except for the following: Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves, and advertising for the musician/ensemble." One entry in Allmusic, which Wikipedia does certify as a reliable guide or source, does not constitute multiple non-trivial published works. Now, if that entry certified that the band hit any of the other criteria, such as two albums on a major or large independent label, or a charted hit in any country, or had won a major music award, or had a record certified gold or higher in any country, then, once again, that would be another matter. Furthermore, the biographical entry you cite is so blatantly laudatory that it reads exactly like a press release, which is clearly disallowed by the direct quotation above. So far, the fact still remains clear that this band has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, and the one work you have cited does not confirm <i>any</i> of the notability criteria being satisfied. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The difference between the two articles you cite is that, in the case of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Trash_3bd0.html" title="Heavy Trash">Heavy Trash</a>, the Allmusic entry confirms notability according to the criteria established for bands on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> The band's existence on the internet consists of media promotion. The same press release is seen over and over again. They are listed on various websites - usually with the comment that there is no further information. This looks like a band and their fans using the internet to promote their name - nothing wrong with that, but the guidelines on music notability are worded to exclude such bands from being on Wikipedia. After some considerable time researching this band on the internet, I have yet to see any comment on the band that could be identified as having been written by someone other than the band promoting themselves. There is nothing significant at stake here. At the moment it appears this band is fairly clearly of little interest to the average music reader, so there would be no loss if the article were deleted; however, when the band manage to secure a name for themselves a Wiki article can be written at that time. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 23:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> is my vote I guess for reasons I have stated above and on the article itself. No they might not be of interest ot the "average music reader" if there is such a thing, but for somone who is interested in their style of metal and more specifically <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Metal_35a0.html" title="Christian Metal">Christian Metal</a> they are noteable and are worth reading about. Noone seems to get that though, and just say my sources are a joke, but it is beyond the point of me really caring anymore. So I will refrain from discussing the article on this page and let the people who know what they are talking about sort it out. I hope you all have a nice day and I apologize to those who I apparently have offended. --<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 23:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I reviewed the article again after your edits and I still don't think <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has been met. I believe that the bios on CDBaby are submitted by the artists themselves.

<dd>One more note: I can't find anything to verify the "Pure Rock Report", only on CDBaby bio which of course is not a place to actually confirm this assertion, so that reference should probably ultimately be removed. I am also unclear if the album reviews are professional, doesn't look like it. Still again, the AMG reference and independent interview seem enough to me. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 09:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The interview is unreliable, it is hosted on freeservers. I could have an 'interview' on there in a matter of hours. The CD baby pages appears to be user-submitted, certainly, towards the bottom of the page, it asks for user-submitted reviews. The other two are possibly valid sources, but they look rather short.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: All points taken. I didn't notice the interview was on a web hoster as well. I'm learning.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Yeah, that certainly looks valid to me, but my only concern is its length. I don't believe there are sure fire rules for situations like this, and that is why we have these debates. I personally still don't think that it is quite enough. This band just does not seem notable enough- they seem like they are on the verge of being notable, have every intentiom of becoming notable, and are doing all that they can to do so. Maybe in a few months, but not yet, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 18:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: Admittedly, I do see a problem with not being able to reliably source the notability assertions of the "Pure Rock Report" and "16 different countries". I do know that you can easily google information in other languages regarding an artist's releases in other countries, but I haven't the time to delve that far. I still support <b>keep</b> but if this article is deleted, I would encourage the author to bring it back when able to better prove notability, it is an interesting genre. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 19:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: "It was in 1997 that Eternal Decision's first album hit the record stores in the U.S. and 16 other countries, achieving considerable acclaim and providing the band with even more notice" from a neutral source (AMG) seems pretty notable to me. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Long_a032.html" title="User:Tim Long">Tim Long</a> 00:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The sources seem to be within the guidelines from what I can tell. The band is certainly notable to anyone who listens to the genre, I've heard a lot of their music before, so they're not entire obscure or irrelevant; they really are relevant in the Christian metal scene. The information is valid, and the sources that the information is coming from are also valid and reliable. I don't see any reason why this band should be considered irrelevant in regards to some of the other bands here on Wikipedia. A band doesn't need ten million record sales on a huge label to have an impact on a music genre. They've got the longetivity, the impact on a genre, the international release, the multiple albums, and everything else that you could possibly want a band to have in order to be notable. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralTreyDavid_08ae.html" title="User:AdmiralTreyDavid">AdmiralTreyDavid</a> 03:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Understandable bitterness over inappropriate actions is not a good reason for more inappropriate actions. I for one do not share Dolari's wish to drive a stake into the heart of Wikipedia, especially with no shortage of people who are working so diligently at doing just that already, deliberately or otherwise. Wikipedia HAS demonstrated an ability to manage an impressive amount of inclusiveness. If you want an RIAA, MPAA, et c. centric list of notability, you have no shortage of alternate sources. Trying to turn Wikipedia into just another one is akin to torching the Library of Alexandria. -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangelv_5bf8.html" title="User:Strangelv">Strangelv</a> 18:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In my opinion the user SubSeven is biased against these Dolari-related wikis for some reason. He or she has already nominated this page for deletion once. The community decided it was relevant and to keep it. It is inappropriate for the same user to renominate for deletion. If the community really does feel these webcomics aren't noteworthy then someone less biased should nominate for deletion. Regarding notability criteria, these webcomics have been recognized by several cons including TrinocCon which have invited the writer to be on panels as a result of the notability of these webcomics. Clearly then their articles have a place here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Structured spirits (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Structured_spirits_b0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Structured spirits">contribs</a>) 16:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> for the regular Simpsons contributors. Why do you allow yourselves to be vulnarable to such a nomination. Do as WP:LOST and don't "allow" article creating before an episode is definitively announced. Much safer, and prevents these kinds of discussions. Might also save in page moves etc. I agree there is little point in removing them now, because they are garuenteed to return. But why not just be patient. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 21:34, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>: All of these episode titles have been confirmed in the copyright database. And, I used to nominate pages for SD, but either admins wouldn't do it, or people would just recreate them the next day. People always rush to be the VERY FIRST to create an episode page. Either way, it's not WP:CRYSTAL because being in the copyright database is about as close as you can get to being official. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 01:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've added many links of reposted reviews that bands use in their bios and press pages. Please consider this as being notable.

<li>It's the contrary on the copy-and-paste thing. That was taken from the Music Emissions Wikipedia page that that person created. We weren't aware there were so many guidelines to being included in the greatest online encyclopedia. Now we are aware and trying to comply.</li>

<ul>
<li>As for "advertizing", I don't think there is really much of a difference between Music Emissions write up and <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purevolume.html" title="Purevolume">Purevolume</a>'s. Let me know if we are going at it the wrong way. We can work at rewriting the article to be included. Thanks, Dscanland 22:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>PinchasC should have identified himself on this AfD page as the creator and primary author of this article.</li>
<li>PinchasC claims that there are multiple independent reviews of his book. There are not. The "reviews" on the publisher's page (Wiley and Sons) are basically promotional blurbs, likely from associates of the authors, as you would see on the back of the book jacket. In fact, at least one of these is on the back of the book jacket. I am an IP professional and I own this book, and it is not a seminal work in the field. The other "review" (the pdf from SSTLR) is not so much a review as a chapter-by-chapter topic summary. There is no analysis or criticism in this document. I have not seen what I would consider to be a single independent review of the book, in the spirit of what is intended by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. E.g., a critical review of at least a few paragraphs in length from a reputable newspaper or periodical.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not say that a newspaper has to have given the review.

<dd>I didn't say that it did. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline; to follow the spirit of the guideline we have to determine for ourselves what is meant by an "independent review." I don't consider a (probably solicited) promotional blurb found <i>on the publisher's website</i> to be an independent review. I don't consider a chapter summary with no analytical content to be a review. I consider a critical review of at least a few paragraphs in length from a reputable newspaper or periodical to be a reasonable minimum standard for what is meant by an "independent review," and I think most other WP editors would probably agree. This article has failed to provide that, so I re-assert my vote to <b>Delete</b>.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 04:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So I guess we disagree, whether the publisher publishing a review makes it non independent or not. I would respectfully disagree and say that even if a publisher publishes the review, if <i>the review was by someone other than the publisher</i>, than it is an independent review. So I re-assert my vote to <b>Strong Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 12:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

The liner notes of a music album are typically written by someone other than the musician or producer, but that would rarely be considered an independent review of the album's contents -- the publisher and artist solicit someone whom they know will give a favorable description for the consumer. Likewise, these promotional blurbs published on the back of the book jacket are not "independent reviews".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As you wrote above, you own this book and only one of these are printed on the book. So I guess that would kind of prove yourr point wrong. Nowhere in WP:RS or WP:IS does it say what you are saying, and my point from above stands that although the publisher put these reviews on their site, the reviews were by someone other than the publisher and therefore independent. Additionally, this that I am the only editor of the article is not a criteria for deletion, and I'm not sure your point of bringing this up in all your comments. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I own the paperback version of this book; all three promotional blurbs on its book jacket are shown <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471209422.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471209422.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The link that you furnished has the promotional blurbs for the e-book, shown <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471273295,descCd-reviews.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471273295,descCd-reviews.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since it's an electronic book, I would consider these blurbs on the publisher's website for the ebook to be on its electronic book jacket. It's published by the same publisher for the same reasons as a book jacket, regardless.</dd>
<dd>The reason why I bring up your relationship to this article as the creator and only editor is:
<ol>
<li>Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" rel="nofollow">Wikietiquette for an AfD discussion</a> requires that you disclose whether you are the primary author and whether you have other vested interest in the article.</li>
<li>I believe there may be some <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> issues in play, and I think it's useful to those commenting or voting on the AfD to be aware of it. Along those lines, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" rel="nofollow">rationale for the notability requirement</a> says, "In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors."</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It comes down to this: promotional blurbs are not reviews, and a publisher's site is not an independent or reliable source for unbiased book reviews. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/_/WP%7EIS_7734.html" title="WP:IS">WP:IS</a> are indeed relevant, as is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, especially where it says: "The "independence" qualification excludes all self-publicity, advertising by the subject, self-published material, autobiographies, press releases, and other such works affiliated with the subject, its creators, or others with a vested interest or bias."</dd>
<dd>The farther this goes, the more convinced I am that this subject is not notable. If there were existing independent reviews, they would have been produced by now, rather than having to defend such weak support. You would be hard-pressed to find any book today that does not come with the support of its publisher and a few short promotional blurbs; having these does not make the work an important one, nor does it make its subject notable. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 11:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reviews under the reviews section are not printed on the book, only the ones in the description section. I hope you understand this distinction. You have not shown how these review would not conform with WP:N, you are just quoting sentences without showing relevance. Proving that an article or person is notable does not violate WP:OWN, I suggest you re-read this guideline together with the other guidelines that you seem to be interpreting to fit your viewpoint. I forgot to mention that I was the creator and primary editor of this article, but you did point it out so that took care of that. Continuing to use that as an argument for deletion shows a gross misunderstanding of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policies and guidelines</a>. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 13:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't in fact understand the distinction -- especially since the quote by Lawrence Udell is under both tabs, of "description" and "reviews". Can you explain what differentiates these "review" blurbs from the "description" blurbs? In length and content they appear very much the same.</dd>
<dd>I think I've described quite enough for you on the relevant policies; if you choose to continue to deny their spirit and relevance, go right ahead. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 19:19, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Those brief citations by Choate and the Russian translation (presumably by the Russian co-author) do not add much to Lerner's notability.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Horible nomination for deletion; poorly written and misleading - Mike Hunt ("my cunt" joke) seems like a hoax. Harris is clearly noticed as she appears frequently on the Fox News Channel. There seems to be an onging confusion betweeen Notability and Importance.

<li><b>Comment</b>: How dare you, Mike Hunt is my actual name, I was born and named well before that word meant anything, I am sick of people assuming my actual name is some sort of joke. And this is not a horrible nomination, as I said, the only thing this anchor ever does is host 30 second news updates for a few hours a day (and FOX recently cut the number of news breaks in half too, meaning she is seen less!)- she warrants a line or two on the FOX news page, not her own article! I am NOT a sockpuppet either. I have being editing wikipedia for a while now, under my IP address, and have watched AFD with interested, and when I stumbled upon this article by the genious 'random article' feature' i felt this wasn't a needed artcile. Once again, this is not a hoax, and please take this nomination seriously.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeHunt35_21c9.html" title="User:MikeHunt35">MikeHunt35</a> 17:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am renominating this article for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> There isn't (and, due to the nature of the beast, likely never will be) any hard and fast way to state who did or didn't flop.

Is <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Trickle_8458.html" title="Dick Trickle">Dick Trickle</a> a flop because he just took a long time to get his shit together? The article names a dozen Edmonton Oilers first round draft picks, without qualifying that even first rounders are only prospects with less than a 50-50 chance at a prolonged NHL career. And for that matter, is <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Falloon_40c9.html" title="Pat Falloon">Pat Falloon</a> a flop just because he wasn't <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lindros_83b4.html" title="Eric Lindros">Eric Lindros</a>-esque?

<dd>Tony wasn't talking about the longevitity of the website. He was talking about how long real indy feds last on Wikipedia before they get deleted. Searching ECWF on Google finds the website on page 6 on 981 results (with this article more nearer the top than that). The Dailymotion videos as you claim only get "in excess 70, at times well over 100 views". Articles based on notable webcast videos are usually at those on the hundred-thousands. The website or the videos are simply not that notable. --&#160;<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakster_3aa4.html" title="User:Oakster"><span style="background:black; color:#8888FF"><b>&#160;oakster&#160;</b></span></a><a href="../../../o/a/k/User_talk%7EOakster_e6bd.html" title="User talk:Oakster"><span style="background:#4444FF; color:white"><b>&#160;TALK&#160;</b></span></a> 16:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Nomination</b>: Back in October of last year, I prodded this article on the grounds of lack of notability. The prod was disputed with the edit summary "remove {PROD}: conspiracy nut or not, notable". The resulting discussion stated that Carr's notability was due his impact on other conspiracy theorists, and conspiracy theory in general. I commented (see <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_Guy_Carr_755c.html#Why_is_this_person_notable.3F" title="Talk:William Guy Carr">Talk:William Guy Carr#Why is this person notable?</a>) that while this might be a valid reason to keep the article, the article did not, in fact, discuss this aspect of his life ... it barely mentions his impact on conspiracy theories (the article cites only one conspiracy theorist influenced by Carr, and that in passing). I asked that this information be added to the article. I recieved no reply, nor was the article edited to include this information. Now, after waiting several months, I re-submit the article for deletion based on several grounds: Notability (Dispite the reasons for opposing the prod, no evidence has been presented that he has had any great impact on onther conspiracy theories), <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> (his claims are definitely on the loonier side and do not meet the criteria for inclusion), as well as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (the only references are to Carr's own books; other statements are completely unsourced). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Pawns in the Game</i> has a reasonably good sales rank and number of reviews at Amazon, and it is impressive in itself that the book is still in print after more than 50 years, especially since there is no shortage of fresher conspiracy books to choose from.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pawns-Game-William-Guy-Carr/dp/0911038299" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Pawns-Game-William-Guy-Carr/dp/0911038299" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, lacking sources and citations don't make me usually vote keep. The subject of the article is definitely notable for his (believed) conspiracy theories that get quoted over and over again.

<li><b>Delete</b> The absence of any independently verifiable sources which indicate the importance of the theories and attribute them to the author undermines the majority of content in the article. Tracing the history of the article those who assert notability have been unwilling, or unable, to provide substantiation for this notability. There has been plenty of opporunity to demonstrate it and there has been plenty of opportunity to avoid the need for AfD.ALR 15:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> After reading the article, it seems the only notability is his WWIII claim; he was alive during the actual two wars and served, so those statements are undeniably accurate. However, the WWIII claim sounds just like Nostradamus or any of a hundred other predictors of doom (Revelations, even), and therefore, there's no assertion of notability. A lot of people don't know things until they read books; that alone does notr assert notability. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd question who the reprints are by, the Amazon link up above is to a 28 year old version printed by a niche, almost private, press. One non conspiracy theory book does not constitute notability.ALR 18:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the copies of <i>BGBG</i> are not reprints, but subsequent printings by the original publisher. Nor was Hutchinson some dinky basement press (e.g., they were the UK publisher for <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i>), before they were swallowed up by Random House in 1989. In the US, an edition was published by Doubleday. And while I'd contend that one book can establish notability if it sells well enough, in fact that was not his only book. He wrote more naval books, also published by Hutchinson. His <i>Checkmate in the North</i> was published by Macmillan. Only later in his writing career did he become a full-time conspiracist.</dd>
<dd>I've also added a quote from a University of Kentucky Press author describing Carr as "the most influential source of the American Illuminati demonology," providing the mainstream validation of his importance that has been clamored for. With Berlet and Pipes and the others I cited above, one had to infer that they believed Carr was "influential" from the fact that they were writing about him; Ellis calls him so explicitly. Some may still not be satisfied, but frankly, I think it's already been demonstrated that he is more notable than many entries. To me, it seems like the skepticism about his notability boils down to the following logic: "His theories are plainly too loony for any person in their right mind to believe. The vast majority of people are in their right mind. Therefore, it's impossible that enough people take him seriously to make him notable." However, the human capacity to believe has allowed many "loony" beliefs to find millions of adherents (sometimes even a society's majority). Carr authored a meme that has lasted fifty years, and looks more prescient than ever to his believers with what is going on in Iraq; how many of the internet memes and the bands that survive AfD by having two measly albums on a middling indie label can say the same? --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 01:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've just added two links to the article, about two pieces I've found on how Iraq fits into World War Three, by Henry Makow (designer of the Scruples game)<a href="http://www.rense.com/general30/strat.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rense.com/general30/strat.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> and Abid Ullah Jan<a href="http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/3942/" class="external autonumber" title="http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/3942/" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>.

Interested parties have had since early August to scrape together some sources - either they aren't there or open source projects have a magical policy/guideline shield (I don't think so).

</ul>
<p>Regardless of the software's age, WP remains a tertiary source and requires secondary sources so it isn't just repeating what is already available from the primary source. <i>If</i> the MMOG/Indie game communities are <i>that</i> bothered about featuring on WP then they need to band together and form reliable review sites like <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Tunnel_5278.html" title="Game Tunnel">Game Tunnel</a>, which can give the software some critical review and in turn give us something to write about.

<dd>In fairness I must point out that though two developers were involved in the last AFD, only one voted and both were extremely above-board.

Lots of celebrities and leading figures have dropped out of college/university early; this is often an important factor in their later lives.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The WP Bio standard is for a person to be "noticed" specifically not famous, important, or newsworthy. Ghits are a reasonable standard for asserting that someone is being noticed. I see very high g-hits. I randomly checked the hits to see wheter they were about him, by him or related to someone else.

<p>This page was originally created as a breakout of the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life_fb9f.html" title="Benevolent Dictator for Life">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a> (BDFL) article. It has since been decided that a BDFL article is unneccesary, as there is only one BDFL in the world: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido_van_Rossum_04a7.html" title="Guido van Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>. There is also the SABDFL <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Shuttleworth_b9fb.html" title="Mark Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a>, but I don't think these two people alone can be spun out into an article. The previous BDFL article was mostly original research on the presumption that many people call themselves "BDFL". In reality, many open source leaders call themselves just "benevolent dictators", not "benevolent dictators for life".</p>
<p>The list of Benevolent Dictators for Life is a list with only one valid entry in it. I was <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBenevolent_Dictator_for_Life_c1f6.html#Concerned_about_accuracy_-_BDs_versus_BDFLs" title="Talk:Benevolent Dictator for Life">originally of the opinion</a> that this list should be renamed to "List of open source project leaders", however I now think it would be a difficult job in reliably defining such a list that would be useful. Hence my request simply to delete this page as a no-longer necessary adjunct to the defunct <a href="../../../b/d/f/BDFL_2d2a.html" title="BDFL">BDFL</a> article. --62.31.67.29 13:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> While I respect your desire to clean up the article, the <i>Satellite News</i> articles are primary sources, which, although not objectionable, should be used to supplement third-party sources, not substitute for them. From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.</i> And I'm afraid the other sources don't work, either: self-published websites are almost never considered reliable.

<dd>All the current books on science fiction and fanfiction at my library are currently out on loan. In the meantime, while I recognise and agree that no single webpage is a reliable source, it does seem to me that the 27,000 google hits <i>in the aggregate</i> do add up to something fairly reliable. I find definitions of MSTing in the official FAQs of at least two non-MST3K newsgroups (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.startrek.creative/browse_frm/thread/9ed200b390ec668f/" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.startrek.creative/browse_frm/thread/9ed200b390ec668f/" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> for a Star Trek one, and <a href="http://www.usenet-replayer.com/faq/alt.drwho.creative.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usenet-replayer.com/faq/alt.drwho.creative.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> for a Doctor Who one); in addition, I find definitions of it in three languages other than English: <a href="http://jims-guide.blogspot.com/2005/10/genre-msting.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jims-guide.blogspot.com/2005/10/genre-msting.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> in German, <a href="http://otakunosekai.free.fr/sectionmstings.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://otakunosekai.free.fr/sectionmstings.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> in French, and <a href="http://www.mitrania.se/visaen.asp?valdid=294" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mitrania.se/visaen.asp?valdid=294" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> in Swedish. This last, moreover, is on the website of what seems to be a regular science-fiction/fantasy literature magazine.

<dd>I've done a fairly substantial rewrite/rearrangement of the text, references and external links in the article, and have included citations to the Sequential Tart and Mitrania pages. I certainly hope it's enough. "Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources." (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) Claims about scientific subjects certainly need scientific references; but on the other side of the "appropriate" coin, I think widespread agreeing definitions on the web should be enough to support an unexceptional claim about a web-based phenomenon. --<a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZeborah_fa6d.html" title="User:Zeborah">Zeborah</a> 09:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep <s>and rename</s> or</b> Merge. I was the one who contested the prod. There are hundreds of authors and thousands of pieces of work that fall under category of MSTings. That being said, my initial search produced no sources outside of the actual community of MSTers that talked about the practice. The works are verifiable by going and looking at them, though the terminology is sometimes inconsistent and the only claim to notability is the number of pieces of work. I do remember some off the hand remark about the term in a scholar publication, but can't seem to find it (As well as it wouldn't make much difference). My suggestion is to either merge the practice into the MST3K article or rename it along the lines of "Effects of MST3K...", keeping a redirect from MSTing as we are the top result for that term on google.--<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayc_f2ee.html" title="User:Rayc">Rayc</a> 22:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- The notability has been established by references, and can continue to be so. I have noticed that the nominator likes to subjectively deflect references though. Is WP:IDONTLIKEIT now a valid policy as well? Rebochan 16:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The references given are fansites, not <a href="../../../r/s/s/WP%7ERSS_8662.html" title="WP:RSS">reliable sources</a>. Notability does not exist within a fandom, it exists when those <i>outside</i> the fandom take note. Also, one of the references is to a Wiki, which is absolutely not a reliable source. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 21:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I presume you meant to link to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">this page</a>, as the significance of Really Simple Syndication to this debate is not entirely self-evident. To your first point: those outside the MST3K fandom have certainly taken note; the current article includes references from Star Trek fandom, anime fandom, fanfic-in-general fandom (Ms Nitpicker), and sf fandom as a whole (two of them, on sites with <i>editorial overview</i> for frick's sake). You can't argue that MSTing is not notable until it's known outside of <i>sf</i> fandom unless you also argue that <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apophony.html" title="Apophony">apophony</a> is not notable until it's known outside of linguistics. To your second point: the reference to the wiki is to source the claim that wikis and YouTube have been used to create MSTings. Sure enough, that wiki (including its discussion, history and links, of course) shows that wiki and YouTube technology have been used to create MSTings. The history of <a href="http://www.capperwiki.com/wiki/index.php/WikiMsting/Episode_2" class="external text" title="http://www.capperwiki.com/wiki/index.php/WikiMsting/Episode_2" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is clearer, perhaps, but I prefer a link to the page with broader scope as it requires less interpretation. These pages are certainly a primary source, but the Reliable Sources policy says that primary sources are allowed; it also says that non-scholarly sources are allowed; and saying you can't use a wiki as a primary source to verify the existence of something which exists on that wiki is like asking someone where your keys are and refusing to accept the fact that they're pointing right at them as verification that the keys are in fact there. Nevertheless, if it is really felt that this particular reference is not sufficient for this particular claim then simply delete the sentence. The article as a whole, however, is perfectly well referenced. This is not an extraordinary claim and so does not require extraordinary measures to verify. --<a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZeborah_fa6d.html" title="User:Zeborah">Zeborah</a> 06:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> We have one solid test of notability - the <i>subject</i> of the article needs to be the <i>subject</i> of multiple reliable third-party sources. If reliable third-party sources have not taken it upon themselves to study and research the niceties of fandom, then such information does not have a place on Wikipedia. In other words, Wikipedia is not the place for information that cannot be found in reliable sources. Fanzines border on reliable. Fansites, blogs, newsgroups, and other wikis are anything but. <s>The <i>Satellite News</i> is a primary source, as it is written by the producers of MST3K</s>. So we have one single borderline-reliable source in this article. That's not enough to establish notability. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 07:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Both Sequential Tart and Mitrania are edited webzines, so we have at least two secondary sources. --<a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZeborah_fa6d.html" title="User:Zeborah">Zeborah</a> 09:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Chardish, you are absolutely wrong about <i>The Satellite News</i>. It is <i>not</i> written (or even vetted) by anyone from <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Brains_8083.html" title="Best Brains">Best Brains</a>, the producers of <i>MST3K</i>. The only connection BBI has is to endorse it as an official source. It is essentially the same thing as any TV show's official website, except it's actually independent of the show and its producers. I agree that we may have no compelling set of multiple independent sources for this article, but please don't push the argument to extremes. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apologies on the <i>Satellite News</i> - I didn't realize that it wasn't produced by Best Brains. (A cursory glance couldn't find anything on the website saying that it isn't, but I'm taking it on <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> that you know what you're talking about.) My belief came from the fact that the "MST3K Info Club" - the same group that registered the <i>Satellite News</i> domain (<a href="http://mst3kinfo.com" class="external text" title="http://mst3kinfo.com" rel="nofollow">mst3kinfo.com</a>) - was advertised on hundreds of episodes of <i>MST3K</i>, during the show itself. Regardless of the writers of the content, the criteria for notability require <i>third-party</i> reliable sources, and I doubt that anything officially endorsed by BBI could be considered "third-party." - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:26, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

(I feel sure more can be found; I just ran out of time to search for now.) All of them give credit to <i>MST3K</i> as the archetypical (if not necessarily original) purveyor of irreverent "ironic commentary" in modern (American) culture, and many specifically talk about <i><a href="../../../v/o/x/Vox_populi.html" title="Vox populi">vox populi</a></i> use of this technique. The article may not currently reflect information from these sources, but this gives serious support to the idea that this phenomenon is well-known, even if the term itself isn't. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 22:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If they don't reference the term, then it's clear the term does not meet notability. If the citations can show the <i>phenomenon</i> has notability, then at least the article needs renamed. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We already have one reliable source that defines the term. We have no other specific term for the phenomenon. I'm open to suggestions for alternative names, if we come across more sources. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 04:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is why I suggested a rename, since the practice has been known as rifting, riffing, MSTing, meta-MSTing, meta-meta-meta-MSTing (yes, really), MiSTing, MST, Mary Sue torture, Etc. It isn't always confined to fan fiction as well. The practice is an extension of the concepts found in MST3K, fan fiction being the most notable side effect.--<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayc_f2ee.html" title="User:Rayc">Rayc</a> 05:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do we have any reliable sources for any of those terms? I suspect we don't for any except possibly "riffing", which has the much broader meaning of "improvising on a given theme". (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/riff" class="extiw" title="wikt:riff">wikt:riff</a>.) I see the possibility of including some of the material in this article in a broader <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff.html" title="Riff">Riff</a> article, which currently only speaks to the musical connotation. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 14:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My memory, google, an a host of other non-reliable sources. The renaming I was talking about was repurposing the scope of the article as a content fork of MST3K in some way, since the people writing the main MST3K don't seem to want to have it dumped back into their article. I'm writing this from my university's library and have found it has at least two of the books you listed. One is checked out, I'm off to find the other one.--<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayc_f2ee.html" title="User:Rayc">Rayc</a> 23:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article survived a VFD in 2004, as outlined on the article's discussion page. The template for <i>2nd nomination</i> does not appear to work, perhaps because that was before AFD replaced VFD. He is described as a popular singer in New York City in the 1980's but I can't find any articles about him in the New York Times from that or any any period. He is described as a friend of two notable musicians, but that does not satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. To have an article, he should have been the primary subject of articles multiple independent reliable sources. He should have issued popular records, or had other claims to fame than being described as a good and popular singer without good sources to show that was so.

<p>I am Roberto Tirado and although I am considered for deletion at Wikipedia, I am not in any way disappointed or upset at the consensus for deletion. Although it appears that there are criteria to be met for maintenance of an article in Wikipedia, there are actually much more contributions that have not been written about me here. In addition, I am a published authored and songwriter, among other talents. There have been numerous newspaper articles in the Spanish media written about me, of which I conserve copies, and a new biography about singer Lucecita Benitez will also contain a section about me. All things considered, I remain available for any questions or comments at erosben@hotmail.com. Thank you!</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Spanish language newspapers or magazines could be good sources to show in a verifiable way that someone is notable. And Wikipedia's policy is that notability does not go away; if Roberto Tirado was a notable musician 20 years ago, and if there were several articles in "reliable sources" <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> where Mr. Tirado was a primary subject, and they were substantial and not just, say, a mention that he was appearting somewhere, but a review, that could clearly support keeping the article. I did check the New York Times, but I have no idea what might have appeared in the Spanish language papers. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I agree that Spanish language media should be considered - and encourage those with the knowledge to pass on references - I do find it curious that Mr Tirado, "a popular singer/musician" and "hot item in the latin night club circuit" escaped the notice of <i>The New York Times</i>. I'm afraid I can't give too much weight to Mr Tirado as a published author since his book, <i>The Chosen Journey</i>, was published by <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafford_Publishing_6214.html" title="Trafford Publishing">Trafford Publishing</a>, a vanity press in Victoria, British Columbia. I can find no listing for any biography of Lucecita Benitez (new or otherwise) at the Library of Congress, abebooks, or amazon.com. While I think the article could be strengthened by the inclusion of information on Mr Tirtado's album, I note that a goodle search for "Lando records" (the label mentioned in the article) + "Tirado" garners one ghit - that being this very article. The album in question is not held by the Library of Congress. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 00:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The New York Times is NOT the defintive source for Latino or Hispanic artists, actors, etc. Rarely does this NY newspaper write reviews on Latino or Hispanic artists unless it's a funeral such as Celia Cruz' or perhaps Jennifer Lopez' latest films. Once more, I have no problem with deletion of my post. Yes, Trafford Publishing IS a vanity press, but Amazon does sell my book and although Victoriagirl does make excellent search, my two recordings were published under Richport Music Company, of which is registered with the State of New York as a legitimate business. One English language newspaper that I have appeared in was the Daily News on Friday, March 5, 1993, when an ad appeared for my Sweetwater's cafe concert in the Entertainment section. Otherwise, the following newspapers and magazines have written articles and notes about me: NOTICIAS DEL MUNDO, FARANDULA, ESTRELLAS, EL EXPRESO HISPANO, EL VOCERO. Obviously, I keep copies of most of the articles written about me. In fact, I have been contacted by various people to make a comeback, most notably by Ray Rodriguez and his Latin Jazz Band, of whom is freely available on the net. Nonetheless, I appreciate Wikipedia's writers and volunteers' efforts to verify the veracity of its contents. Roberto Tirado</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The articles that you mentioned are similarly impoverished and serve as examples of why this article should be <i>deleted</i>. Given the scope of their topics and the clear lack of quality, they should also be rewritten or purged from wikipedia. While the topics themselves have merit, the articles lack research and credible sources, and in their current state they are likely to be a source of misinformation.

<dd>How long should we wait? I've seen articles survive an AfD for just that reason, and then stay unchanged for a <b>year</b>.

<p>To be honest, this is speediable, as no claim is made for significance. As, however, someone "prodded" it, and an anon removed the template without making any attempt to improve the article or discuss it at Talk, but claiming that it ought to be discussed, I've brought it here.

<dd>She's having a third baby... this makes her notable? It suggests to me that the tabloid newspaper in question was having a slow news day. And you miss the point about the BBC; companies often put profiles of their employees on their own Web pages — that isn't a sign of notability.<br />
Note that I'm not trying to do her down; I'm sure that she's an excellent person, good at what is doubtless an interesting job, pleasant to be with, a good mother, and so on. I'd very likely rather spend an evening in her company than in that of most of the people with Wikipedia articles. But can you imagine any other encyclopædia having an article on here?

<ul>
<li>Not true. <i>The News Letter</i> is more than a "blurb" or "trivial mention" as the free preview shows 262 of 1,759 characters. Plus <i>The Daily Mirror</i> article is also more than a "blurb" with that free preview showing 94 out of 677 characters, and the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> article is even more than both. And <i>The People</i> is still a published work satisfing WP:BIO notability guildlines - "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. This criterion includes published works <b>in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles</b>, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries except for the following: Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths."

<ul>
<li>Right, the <i>News Letter</i> is the only source of any length for this. 677 characters is under a hundred words. <i>Fresh</i> magazine is put out by the Health Promotion Agency and its brief interview was about her childrens' eating and exercise habits. And you are ignoring the part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says that the sources must be reliable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are confirming that the <i>News Letter</i> article is more than "just mention[ing] the person in passing." 100 words is well beyond "mentioning in passing". And the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> is a published work under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and doesn't fall under any of the "exceptions". Who publishes the magazine is irrelevant as the "source is independent of the person." As for the reliable sources, that refers to accuracy of content, not notability. If the National Enquirer writes several article about someone, that someone is notable, no matter how light weight the articles are. And there are two new published works from the national charity <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland_Trust_0154.html" title="Woodland Trust">Woodland Trust</a> that are primarily about her <a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" rel="nofollow">[62]</a><a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>.

<ul>
<li>I confirmed it in my first post and in each subsequent post. The problem is we still don't have multiple articles of which she is the subject that are longer than blurbs (and yes, 100 words is just a blurb). The Fresh magazine piece is just one in which she, along with other minor celebrities are asked questions about their children's diets. A typical example is "Do your children like fruit and veg.?" It doesn't provide any information about her. Honestly, how are we supposed to use that as a source to write the article: "Angie Philllips, whose children like fruit and veg., is a weather presenter for the BBC"? The Woodland Trust pieces similarly do not talk about her, but contain quotes from her in support of its mission. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the confirmation of the confirmation&#160;:). A 100-word peice, whether someone labels it a "blurb" or not, is beyond <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "passing mention." Even if you feel like excluding all three of <i>The People</i> articles about her, plus the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> and the Woodland Trust articles, there's still two published works (i.e. "multiple") cited that are primarily about the subject.--<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 21:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, sources are supposed to be reliable — but more importantly, many of those sources are saying no more about her than that she had a third baby... If this were an article about someone notable for having three babies(!) then I suppose that those sources would provide verifiability and notability. Any presenter on local radio or television is likely to have been the subject of mini-article in newspapers on slow news days (I've been the subject of a couple — one in the <i>Times</i>, one in the <i>New Statesman</i>, because even academics get this sort of thing — should there be an article on me? Articles on academics are constantly being deleted on grounds on=f non-notability, because it's deemed that what they've done doesn't raise them sufficiently above their peers. Apparently they don't need to have written a successful book, just had an artcile about their child-bearing capabilities in the <i>Sun</i>); are we to have articles on every such person? They're not even micro-celebrities. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe there should be an article on you, Mel.&#160;:) (unless your real name is different, you didn't come up on a G-news Archives search like Angie Phillips did several times). Articles on academics are also constantly being kept because they pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But you're missing the point. WP:BIO is passed here. Whether an editor is assuming a news outlet is "having a slow news day" is irrelevent. How do you know that major events weren't occuring on those days anyway? It's 100% speculation and that is in no way a basis for deciding if a subject is notable. And as stated above, even if you feel like discounting 3 of the published works about Angie Phillips you don't like, there's still 2 more non-trivial published works about her that are not just "passing mentions". --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 10:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do come up (my real name is a dark and deadly secret, known to a very few...). The point is, though, that those articles on me wouldn't demonstrate my notability (and neither or them was a passing mention). Note also that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> only offers guidelines; editors are free to delete an article that meets the criteria there, and to keep an article that doesn't. (And I wasn't saying that my belief that it must have been a slow news day was grounds for ignoring it, incidentally.) Do you think that she's more notable than all the other presenters, newsreaders, weather-reporters, <i>et al.</i>? If not, should we have an article on each of them? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But the primary criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is met.

<dd>I'm just confused.

<dd>Have a look at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, notability isn't newsworthiness and sources must be reliable. Tabloid journalism doesn't, in my view, qualify. 23:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But if someone is the subject of multiple non trivial published works, whether it's from a tabloid or not, they qualify as notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If a extemely popular tabloid-like newspaper such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a> has an article about her, she's notable per WP:BIO. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the second paragraph of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it very clearly states that sources must be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. According to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> a reliable secondary source is "the informed and expert interpretation, interpolation, extrapolation or corroboration of primary sources to synthesize a conclusion".

<dd>Oakshade seems to be arguing that being in a tabloid isn't <i>evidence</i> of notability, it <i>creates</i> notability (or else I don't see the relevance of the circulation figure, popularity, etc.).--<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Dave -- what you need to do is provide independent sources establishing notability -- e.g., reviews of his books in major newspapers, or non-trivial news coverage of Dick in general. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 22:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I will look for this - help me to understand why this is necessary since his most significant role was not as an author, but as a missionary, professor, and founder of a world-wide missions organization.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveDV_6434.html" title="User:DaveDV">DaveDV</a> 04:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not quite sure why this is being subjected for deletion. I put this up here to try to get more people to know one of my favorite bands, especially since there has been some international controversy over the group's name. i'm extremely new to wikipedia and still just trying to figure out how everything works here. there isn't really a conflict of interest since i'm just someone who likes the band and not anyone who is to gain anything from the article being posted. i tried to put up pictures that i got from the band's website but didn't know how to exactly list them as licensing. i asked the band about posting them and they said it was fine. if someone could help me out with keeping this page up i'd really appreciate it. thanks! --Jesscosca (<a href="../../../j/e/s/User_talk%7EJesscosca_ba0f.html" title="User talk:Jesscosca">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jesscosca_d92f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jesscosca">contribs</a>) 18:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, outside of these criteria they do not appear to be signed to any label at all (feel free to correct me though) and a search on allmusic seems to return results only for a 60's band of the same name, so it doesn't appear as though many people are listening to them. The only criteria they begin to match is number 9 - "has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page)" - but playing on the TV commercial of a personal finance company seems to stretch the concept of notability to its very limit. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewartriot_5d9f.html" title="User:Newartriot">Newartriot</a> 03:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm certainly favorably disposed to keeping what seems to be a worthwhile cultural project, and I understand the Web may not be the best place to look for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> in this situation, but there need to be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sorurces</a> indicating notability to avoid deletion, and there currently aren't any. The one independent link provided, the Brooklyn College News article, is on recent alumni and mentions the project only in passing as part of a brief paragraph on an alumnus.

<li><s><b><s>Delete</s>Weak delete</b> as we're having real trouble getting it cited. And it's somewhat annoying as I too would be favourable disposed to keep and have been searching for cites in my own time to save this article but so far can't find any as it's not really my field. For some reason I came over this article whilst backtracking an edit to a template which broke the template and saw an unusual pattern of edits by a user <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Betesh_0168.html" title="User:David Betesh">David Betesh</a> and an IP address <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.46.79.2_6295.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.46.79.2">216.46.79.2</a> (who are the same IMHO). Their idea of what constitutes "notable" hasn't really changed since this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brooklyn_College&amp;diff=81270602&amp;oldid=80515872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brooklyn_College&amp;diff=81270602&amp;oldid=80515872" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> back in October last year from now where they added themselves as "Notable Alumni" to the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_College_ad4c.html" title="Brooklyn College">Brooklyn_College</a> article; err wouldn't the date of graduations of the other notables give you a clue&#160;?. I must admit I've added a TEST3 and a LONGTERM4IM on their talk page as stuff gets changed without any talk. I want people to stay as editors so quite willing to remove any warnings if I saw a pattern of edits that drew a line in the sand and started from afresh but yesterdays edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emanuel_Jaques&amp;diff=101620603&amp;oldid=101596274" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emanuel_Jaques&amp;diff=101620603&amp;oldid=101596274" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> broken the references in that article: does this person even know about watchlists and edit reviews&#160;?. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 20:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

I've thus discounted my delete to a weak delete as I can't trust what's been added, though it seems on the surface better. If we can get a CD ASIN or similar ID for that CD they made then that would make it a keep IMHO. I'm just really disappointed about the way the editor has gone about it.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Mr. David Betesh, a great-grandson of Gabriel Shrem, received these tapes [of pizmonim] as a Bar Mitzvah gift from his grandmother, Florence Zeitouni, the daughter of Gabriel Shrem, and resolved to pass on this treasured gift to the entire community. He re-released and upgraded both the published and the unpublished works of his great-grandfather to create an inclusive and wide-ranging recording of pizmonim. The CD set, which is distributed by the Bnai Yosef Synagogue, also includes an explanation of the origin of each maqam, as well as the perashah or occasion during which it should be used and why."</dd>

<p>While this reference certainly illustrates the <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">importance</a> of the Sephardic Pizmonim Project, it does not illustrate its <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> at all. One short paragraph within a veritable tome of information about the Syrian Jewish community does not constitute notability - not even among Syrians - and definitely not for Wikipedia's standards. As for the article in Community Magazine, all it indicates is that the Project was an idea that sparked interest in 2004 in the editors of Community Magazine, a publication with an exceedingly limited readership demographic. It is not an <a href="../../../i/s/_/WP%7EIS_7734.html" title="WP:IS">independent source</a> to boot. The Sephardic Pizmonim Project is a nice and noble endeavor (kudos to David Betesh) but it is simply not notable. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 16:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Per discussion above, I feel the subject simply does not meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines. There is not enough outside sources to discuss the matter, yet. Perhaps when it becomes more notable, an article would be appropriate here. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 20:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I was for a delete but have stuck out my delete (see a few entries back above) and given the cite in the book I feel that there is sufficient traction for a weak keep with a stub on it so people can see it's coming along. This is a niche topic (we're not talking manufactured Europop songs after all) and after some searching I feel it would be a loss to Wikipedia to remove this article. We really need a different criteria to judge this type of "cultural artifact" from more modern or more commercial content. Like recordings of the last person to talk in a niche spoken language it is important to humanity but no one is expected to make much money from it. Compare that to a garage band recording - probably same low cashflow but I question the value to humanity (kind of said jokingly but it's the best analogy I could think of right now). I personally think we need to look at how to judge notability of this niche content so we don't set too high a hurdle and lose culturally valuable content. As long as the "author/web site owner/wikipedia editor" tries to stay detached from what is probably quite an emotive and engaging subject for them and thinks critically about how what they add will be viewed by others who have only a tangential concern about the topic (e.g. like me). <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 12:10, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<div class="messagebox"><b>Closer's rationale:</b>
<p>This case is principally about whether "Socionomics" is – currently – a sufficiently notable scientific concept (or term) to be included in Wikipedia. As this issue has been discussed here in great detail and with extensive references to policies and guidelines, and as this is not a matter of applying core policies that override any possible consensus, the numerical consensus is determinative. With eight to four editors in favour of deletion, the consensus to delete is also clear. I'm discounting the opinion of the account with seven edits, but not that of <a href="../../../r/g/f/User%7ERgfolsom_7131.html" title="User:Rgfolsom">User:Rgfolsom</a> even though he is apparently in a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> here.</p>
<p>The content is available on request for mergers, subject to consensus of editors at the target article. I don't think this deletion will prove to be an impediment to the current ArbCom case, as all arbitrators are admins and will be able to access (or make accessible if required) the deleted history.</p>

<p>Vanicruftspam of a somewhat "cloaked" sort. The article is correct in stating that "socionomics" is a term coined by the (barely notable) crank stockmarket "analyist" <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Prechter_34ac.html" title="Robert Prechter">Robert Prechter</a>. What may mislead discussion here is that Prechter has been pretty assiduous in inventing apparently independent attention to the idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a> is cited as a source for comment on Prechter's coinage, but that article is actually not on "socionomics" but rather the kooky (but possibly notable) <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_wave_principle.html" title="Elliott wave principle">Elliott wave principle</a> which Prechter seems to be piggybacking on.</li>
<li>The next independent source cited for mention of "socionomics" only mentions the book in the bibliography and nowhere uses the term in the text (i.e., the article's claim that the article "describes [socionomics] in detail" is false.</li>
<li>As with all good vanikookery, "socionomics" has a website/foundation (founded, of course, by Prechter) where "papers" are posted -- there aren't that many (looks like six total?), and the journal is not peer-reviewed. (There is also a different "Tuscon Center" <a href="http://rob.com/afi/tuc.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rob.com/afi/tuc.html" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>, described as an "an internet educational organization" that carries five additional PDFs generously described as "papers".</li>
<li>There is the claim that <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Political_Science_Association_e5ee.html" title="American Political Science Association">American Political Science Association</a> has somehow endorsed the theory of socionomics -- this is false. Actually, it appears only that Prechter (along with dozens of others) contributed an unspecified question to a "pilot survey" (and it wasn't the APSA, it was the American National Election Studies project.)</li>
<li>Once you get beyond these very specious claims -- which in the end amount to (generously) two or three peer reviewed papers (the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Behavioral_Finance_6b11.html" title="Journal of Behavioral Finance">Journal of Behavioral Finance</a> published one paper by Precheter, and let's be generous and say he has two more somewhere in the wings) in a field that produces thousands on thousands of such papers a year -- there's not much left to say about the theory. The rather nonsensical material detailing the nature of "socionomics" is unsourced.</li>
<li>An apparent claim to notability comes in the "criticism" section where it appears independent researchers have considered it significant enough to criticize. Not the case -- the two quotes that might be said to be directed at socionomics come from a documentary comissioned by the foundation itsef (i.e., the two independent scientists didn't write a paper or anything -- just said a few words for the camera.) A paper supposedly directed against socionomics actually debunks the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_wave_principle.html" title="Elliott wave principle">Elliott wave principle</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, OK, there you have it. I don't have a beef with socionomics the theory (personally consider it just another crank theory.) The question is whether or not it is a <i>notable</i> crank theory like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> or possibly the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_wave_principle.html" title="Elliott wave principle">Elliott wave principle</a>. I believe the points above demonstrate that the apparent institutional and independent attention socionomics receives is fictional and the actual impact comes down to one or two personal websites and possibly one or two peer reviewed papers -- neither of which are sufficient criteria for notability.</p>
<p>Crucially, "<a href="../../../i/m/o/IMO_b6f6.html" title="IMO">IMO</a>" and "<a href="../../../y/m/m/YMMV_5c6c.html" title="YMMV">YMMV</a>".

<dd><b>Search engine</b> --</dd>
<dd>A Google search for "socionomics" brings more than 26,700 results -- and those exclude results from elliottwave.com, socionomics.net, and socionomics.org. Around 2,300 of the Google search results are non-English language, thus socionomics has some international notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The evidence above makes it obvious that socionomics is being studied, written about, and discussed independently of Robert Prechter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Journal of Behavioral Finance is indeed peer reviewed, and has published respected economists such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Shiller_4ff4.html" title="Robert Shiller">Robert Shiller</a>. The quotation from John Nofsinger in the Socionomics article plainly <i>does</i> describe how socionomics works, by detailing how mood drives the business cycle -- that's why he included Prechter's book in the bibliography.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>John Casti is an often-quoted author on complex systems; click around at the link for the conference mentioned above and you'll see that Harvard is one of the two sponsors. His article in Science <i>does</i> discuss socionomics in detail, and I'll be glad to post fair-use excerpts here if anyone cares to read it.</dd>

<dd>Finally, the COI issue has already come up here about me. This immediately prejudices opinions of the evidence I've presented, which is why the COI guideline says, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:COI#Conflict_of_interest_in_point_of_view_disputes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:COI#Conflict_of_interest_in_point_of_view_disputes" rel="nofollow">it may be easy to make claims about conflict of interest.

<ul>
<li><b>Response to Rgfolsom</b> -- who is, it should be noted, a paid member of the "Socionomics Institute". I took a quick look at the new sources provided -- many of which I've already dealt with (this response is cut&amp;paste from an RfA he's involved in.) For example, the <i>New Scientist</i> article he suggests covers Socionomics does not, actually do so (it is focused on <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Wave_Theory_773a.html" title="Elliott Wave Theory">Elliott Wave Theory</a> and not Prechter's new coinage. The "institutional support" he claims is nothing of the sort, as I already explained. He does well in referencing all of the six self-published papers on socionomics.org, none of which I believe establish notability. I took a look at a few of the new references he sprinkled in -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behavioral-Trading-Measuring-Confidence-Expectations/dp/1587991640/sr=1-16/qid=1169499685/ref=sr_1_16/104-3952358-4532733?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Behavioral-Trading-Measuring-Confidence-Expectations/dp/1587991640/sr=1-16/qid=1169499685/ref=sr_1_16/104-3952358-4532733?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, for example, simply has a bibliographic mention of a book with the word "socionomics" in the title and the word "socionomics" appears nowhere else, and I have to say that doesn't inspire confidence that it's mentioned "non-trivially" in any of the other books he's found. For example, this book <a href="http://www.ftpress.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0131345974&amp;rl=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ftpress.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0131345974&amp;rl=1" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> doesn't mention the word socionomics in the abstract, which strongly suggests it's not treated in any detail in the book itself. Nothing, in other words, in this slim list, seems to establish that socionomics is anything that vaugely meets <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCI_649f.html" title="WP:SCI">WP:SCI</a> (which I encourage Rgfolsom to actually read, as it explicitly says that having one or two peer reviewed papers is no where near a sufficient criterion.) Having a guy who said the word socionomics in a conference somehow related to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> doesn't cut it. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 03:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Response to Sdedeo</b> -- Interested parties please note: After my call for editors to respect Wikipedia's policy to "discuss the article, not the editor," user:Sdedeo's very first remark was to discuss me, not the article. This is more ad hominem argument, i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_as_logical_fallacy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_as_logical_fallacy" rel="nofollow">one of the best-known of the logical fallacies usually enumerated in introductory logic and critical thinking textbooks</a>. Curious indeed in a discussion about standards and science.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sdedeo has also twice disputed my claim about John Casti's article in <i>Science</i> magazine. But, I say again: the (~2300 word) article does cover socionomics in detail; this time I invite other editors to decide for themselves. I posted the relevant quotations from the article (~600 words) on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Socionomics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Socionomics" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for the inferences about the books I cited, I politely suggest that quotes are more informative than speculation. I posted the relevant quotations from those books on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Socionomics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Socionomics" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>. Again, editors can decide for themselves if the mentions of socionomics are "trivial."</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And, yes, I did use some of the same evidence here that I've offered in my RfA. In that dispute I face similarly uninformed, ad hominem arguments -- nostalgia from the 1970s about how the efficient market hypothesis is <i>the</i> academic orthodoxy. Back then it was safe to call technical analysis "astrology" (sort of like non-mainstream ideas today are labeled a "crank theory" for "kooks"). But things change. A generation later we've seen traders use technical analysis and become billionaires, not to mention academics who reject the EMH become Nobel Laureates. Things <i>do</i> change.</dd>

<li>All "delete" votes thus far come from a small group of editors who post to the <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCI_649f.html" title="WP:SCI">WP:SCI</a> talk page. They've been hunting for a "test case" for deletion, and, complete with mocking and put-downs of socionomics as a topic, this group contemplated a "test" on the socionomics article. The editor who nominated socionomics for the AfD said this to the group: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28science%29#Here.27s_an_interesting_test_case" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28science%29#Here.27s_an_interesting_test_case" rel="nofollow">All right, I gave it a shot: see here Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Socionomics</a>."

<li>Three editors from the "delete" group have focused negative attention on the editors who voted to "keep," undermining them via accusations of vanity editing, conflict of interest, single-purpose editing, and even noting the number of edits to Wikipedia.

<li>The facts offered here and in the socionomics article are verifiable, presented neutrally, and not originally researched. The editors who voted to "delete" mischaracterized or ignored this evidence, and imposed after-the-fact objections that are irrelevant and frivolous -- such as the absence of socionomics in JSTOR, and how the word "socionomics" violates WP:NEO. This is not consistent with the attitude called for in Wikipedia's deletion policy, namely that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Background" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Background" rel="nofollow">the purpose of a discussion is to bring out a 'sense of the community' and the valid points for or against each view</a>."</li>

<dd>Ha. I'd say the "crank" was maybe out of line, as about the rest, having a prior opinion on a topic does not amount to bad faith unless you're closing the discussion. Also, it's pretty clear from the <a href="../../../s/c/i/WT%7ESCI_e311.html" title="WT:SCI">WT:SCI</a> that that was the first time we noticed the topic and clearly, being atuned to science discussions around here we're usually able to recognize a duck when it walks and quacks like one. That doesn't mean the sources shouldn't get due attention and a certain effort should be put into determining the reach of the new term. A proposed guideline simply means editors can invoke it, as long as it is based on policies, but it is not binding. And btw, <a href="../../../c/s/k/WP%7ECSK_91ce.html" title="WP:CSK">WP:CSK</a> certainly doesn't apply. ~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">Trialsanderrors</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrialsanderrors_1896.html" title="User talk:Trialsanderrors">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trialsanderrors_5d84.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trialsanderrors">contribs</a>).</small> 04:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Under the WP:SCI guideline this seems about the only way to do it. I've given my views on how socionomics is a non-science many times before. I'm not sure of the etiquette, but the deletion should probably wait until the RfA is done (another week?).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not, in general, a deletionist - if there were a way that this article could be included and the reader alerted that this is an entirely new, untested, and perhaps untestable theory that does not come out of the scientific or academic world, I would not vote for delete. But given that the academic world ignores socionomics, then how can it be shown that it is non-scientific? If we leave it in, readers will be misled.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>BTW, the "textbooks" given above are not the type of textbooks written by academics and used in classes. There is an adjunct professor as one author. "Books" is probably a better term.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I support a keep resolution for a couple of reasons. First, it seems that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28science%29_196b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (science)">Wikipedia:Notability (science)</a> and the <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCI_649f.html" title="WP:SCI">WP:SCI</a> projects need to first work together to see if they can get their two sets of 'proposed guidelines' to work in synch. However, as neither guideline is (yet) a Wikipedia policy, it seems premature to utilize proposals as a basis for article deletion as I perceive Sedeo's basic argument. Also, as a grad student in economics, I have touched some of this material in standard academic literature searches. Before my research into social economics took me a different direction, I had even checked out and scanned Prechter's two book titles on Socionomics from the university library. There are many items of social science and social philosophy covered in Wikipedia that have a much smaller basis than does Socionomics.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps most importantly, I think we would do well to heed <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Kuhn_2da8.html" title="Thomas Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a> in his book "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions_1b25.html" title="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>." He shifted his own career from Physics to that of studying the History of Science. He noted "...problems about the differences between [communities of social scientists] and those of the natural scientists among whom I had been trained. ...I was struck by the number and extent of the overt disagreements between social scientists about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods." [he doubts the natural science practitioners are firmly out of these woods] "Yet somehow, the practice of astronomy, physics, chemistry, or bilogoy normally fails to evoke the controversies over fundamentals that today often seem endemic among, say, psychologists or sociologoists" (pp. x) Since 'Scientific revolutions', or paradigm-shifts, emerge gradually out of scientific work that was not, in general, intending to produce them (Kuhn, 62), I think it is best if an online open encyclopedia like Wikipedia set a reasonable, but not excessively high, bar for topic inclusion. This is especially important in any of the relatively 'fuzzy' fields of the social sciences. I believe Socionomcis meets that reasonable bar. I further believe it would be a mistake to have a group of well-intentioned Wikipedians from a new project use a draft proposed guideline to eliminate articles using that early draft guideline.</dd>

So, if someone had gone to the socionomics talk page and said, "Needs lots of attention," I would have agreed in a New York minute. But now I'm arguing a death penalty case. The punishment is absurdly disproportionate to the article's crimes. I understand and appreciate that your suggestion offers a post-delete solution, but the truth is that this RfD was overkill.

<dd>The "evidence to the contrary" clause is not an exception that devours the rule -- you <i>must</i> assume good faith unless the evidence is clearly to the contrary. Examples of times when evidence is clearly to the contrary include "vandalism, confirmed malicious sockpuppetry, and lying." None apply here.</dd>
<dd>I don't think WP:AFD addresses insults to a living person; you probably mean <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (though it also doesn't say that). In any event, that guideline does not require that anyone who comes along with a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> not feel "insulted." I assume you are Mr. Prechter, since you say you've been identified by name? As such, you have a pretty large <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. If you don't want to see your theory critiqued and your sources analyzed (and potentially found to be phony or invalid), then you should not participate here. That's the gist of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> - if the article is about you, and you therefore cannot separate criticism of the article from criticism of you as a human being, then you're too conflicted and should step away. It is in no way bad faith to question, challenge, or analyze a subject, and you should not assume that such questioning is anything other than a good faith desire to build the encyclopedia.</dd>

<dd>Ah, you are Robert Folsom, an employee of a related institute rather than the author himself - my apologies for not noticing that previously. In any event, the COI problems remain, as does the failure to assume good faith. Do I think referring to the subject of an article as a "kook with a crank theory" exhibits a good faith desire to build an encyclopedia? Yes. It's not particularly civil, but it is good faith. This is a request to delete the article; that the article is about a "crank theory" put forth by a "kook" (in whatever more civil terms we could say that) makes it more likely that it should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>Now, <i>should</i> he have said that in a less confrontational way? Sure. The nominator perhaps violated WP:Civil (though I'd argue that you took it more personally than you should, because of your conflict).

<li><b>Comment</b> <s><b>Keep if rewritten and independent, non-trivial reviews provided, delete otherwise</b></s> I think this case is at risk of spiralling out of control and personal issues might override factual issues. As I expressed it earlier, I believe Socionomics as a scientific neologism is still too feeble to be covered in Wikipedia, but the book might very well be notable from the sources provided (I'll leave the proof to the editors). On the issue of science or pseudoscience, it's business research, so the rigorous standards of the hard sciences don't apply. So I would recommend as a peace offer that is hopefully acceptable to all that this article be rewritten to be about the 1999 book on Socionomics. Books by notable authors have low thresholds of inclusion, and the listings above strike me as sufficient to meet them. This way the issue of science or not? will also go away, and rgfolsom's awkward role as COI editor might be alleviated. I recommend that the article on the book stay in line with its relevance within the fields, which is very small in academic circles but at least moderate in practitioner's circles. What ultimately has to be remived is the impression that Wikipedia is used to further corporate goals. A neutral article can achieve that, an article with exagerrated claims about importance will probably not find favor with the editors. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Have to disagree here -- the 1999 book is published by "New Classics Library, a division of market forecasting firm Elliott Wave International ... an independent publishing company owned by Robert Prechter." <a href="http://www.newclassicslibrary.com/about_us/about_us.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newclassicslibrary.com/about_us/about_us.aspx" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> i.e., it's a vanity press when it comes to Prechter, and the bar for independent articles on a vanity press book is I believe set quite high. Do we, for example, have multiple independent reviews of the book? If not, really can't do much with the article except post the blurb, which is the problem with the subject as a whole. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm very grateful for your good-faith effort to find a compromise, TE.

<li><b>Delete</b> With all apologies to the closing admin, I was asked to clarify my position above since my bolded opinion reads like a line from a James Joyce book, so here we go: The argument that rgfolsom and others have brought enough evidence that the term meets our basic standards for neologism is underwhelming. For a comparison of cases that were discussed under <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_WP%7ENEO_ff9e.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/WP:NEO">Special:Whatlinkshere/WP:NEO</a>. As a quick scan will show, we delete the vast majority of them even though some have a pattern of infrequent use. In this case we have the advantage that we can be very certain that all positive evidence of its use has been offered, so we don't have to speculate whether there are hidden sources and we might make a wrong call just because we can't access them. The evidence is extremely underwhelming. The book with the core claim to notability has been released eight years ago, and even if we take the provided evidence at face value we get about one mention per year of the term Socionomics. That is less than the number of mentions the term received <i>before</i> Prechter coined it (usually to denote some hybrid of sociology and economics, but completely unrealted to Finance). So the claim that the term is used by at least a "significant minority", as required by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> is unsupported by the evidence. Undue weight goes on to say that "[i]f a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article)", which seems to be the criterion here. So the question is always, is there an matching ancillary article where this information can be presented in accordance with the weight the term carries in the world? And the answer to this is clearly yes: the article <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Prechter_34ac.html" title="Robert Prechter">Robert Prechter</a>. The core guidelines were never meant to be interpreted in the way rgfolsom does above, or we were held to carry every "Bear Fell Out of Tree in Santa Cruz" story that makes the local news on a Tuesday evening. Does this restate my opinion above? Not really, I think an article on the book might be possible, but the evidence of independent reviews still has to be brought (the mentions above I could check turned out to be mentions in passing or authors with connections to the Socionomics Institute). If the book, like the term has not proven enough heft in the world of academic finance or Wall Street, the book as well as the term should be mentioned in the Prechter article. This article here grossly overstates is significance and therefore fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>. None of this takes into account whether the theory has any scientifc merit or not, as it is immaterial to this debate. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>First</b>, WP:NEO is a guideline, not policy.</dd>
<dd><b>Second</b>, WP:NEO says:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term -- not books and papers that use the term… Neologisms that are in wide use -- but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources -- are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia</i>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have provided multiple secondary sources that go beyond mere "use" of the term -- five books from reputable publishers, two academic journal articles, four trade press magazine articles, an article from a reputable academic in a reputable science magazine, conference papers, a conference proceeding co-sponsored by a prominent university -- each one is either <i>about</i> or includes <i>a non-trivial treatment of</i> socionomics. A term that receives 25,000+ results from a Google search cannot plausibly be described as in use only "by an extremely small minority." Please show me an article that was deleted because of WP:NEO that had anything remotely resembling the evidence for notability that socionomics offers.</dd>
<dd><b>Third</b>, you quote from NPOV undue weight -- yet that essay also emphasizes this: "None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them. Wikipedia is not paper." I respectfully but candidly say that your admirable attempts to compromise -- and your "maybe it does, maybe it doesn't" comments regarding notability -- show a degree of doubt.

<p>Reason for deletion: I feel that this is probably self promotion. There is little indication that the artist has had much impact beyond a small circle of friends. The article seems to be written by acquaintances of artist. There is a dearth of citations; most sources are unreliable, trivial, and/or unrelated to the subject of the article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is no reflection on the quality of the artist's work, which I would find a good reason to have an article, but unfortunately our guidelines are other and this article fails to meet them. Self-promotion isn't a reason in itself to delete, nor is material by friends. Failures to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> are reasons.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I seem to remember this "NeoPopRealism" from a year or two ago (so, yes, there is a bit of self-promotion among the group.) Right now there appears to be only one or two notable sources, and those mention Russ only in passing. We should delete without prejudice to later recreation if, indeed, she garners significant attention from independent sources so we can actually write an article. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 21:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "NeoPopRealism" is a marketing term. It has nothing to do with visual art whatsoever. No scholarly use for the term exists, and none ever will exist. Wikipedia should not be exploited to promote mundane products, especially by lending it's tacit support to coined terms with an art cachet to them. To do so is to obscure the distinction between real terms applicable to the visual arts and marketing terminology without any real meaning at all. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 22:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Er, this AfD is about Nadia Russ, not NeoPopRealism - that's already been deleted. Also your argument is not a reason to delete anyway.

<li>Okay, okay.

<p>Subject is only borderline notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is often mentioned in the news but apparently only because of alleged improper sexual relationships (e.g. <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>, <a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" rel="nofollow">[77]</a>). Since the subject or his publicist has been blanking most of the article and he's only notable due to a single incident, this entry should be deleted. I disagree with the talk page reasoning that "Bruce McMahan is notable on account of wealth combined with the fact that the legal conflict between him and his daughter has made him a public figure" - there aren't that few multimillionaires who are more notable than him.

<p>Note from Type Five:</p>
<p>I agree with Flying Toaster and the Wiki editor who removed this entry last round. Perhaps subject is clearly notable in the mind of poster Exeunt because he is a related party to dispute in question and trying to do damage. How does he know about a PR firm, how was he contacted via email, how is that he refers to the damage to this person's reputation as justifiable in user talk. If this is indeed notable, then Wikipedia should list all wealthy people, and all people who have been accused of sexual impropriety, include all tabloid newspaper and televison content on this database. In my humble opinion, poster is biased with an agenda, not a true contributor to Wikipedia.

<dd>So you're telling me you're a neutral contributor with no ties to Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine &amp; Regenstreif LLP who just happened to blank the page for the third time after it was restored? It's disingenuous (very lawyer-like!) to accuse me of being someone with an axe to grind with McMahan; I frequently edit Wikipedia, have no agenda other than improving this project and protecting it from <i>private interests</i>, and I have the advantage of not being a sock puppet and lawyer hired by Mr. McMahan to protect his image.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Be careful what you are accusing people of TypeFive, it is ironic to accuse someone of being 'not a true contributor to Wikipedia', and then fill your comment with poor logic, and not sign your post correctly. As for the article in question- Exeunt, you say that there is much coverage, <strike>do you think you could link to/cite some more directly?</strike> As for the matter of whether people WANT the information on Wikipedia, if information is properly sourced and relevent, removing it constitutes vandalism.

<p>I am not able to answer you Kesh.

Wikipedia policies regarding biographies of living persons presume that the articles can affect the subject's lives (two parties in this entry), show some degree of sensitivity, are unbiased which I don't believe the author is from his comments and references to law firms, etc.), presumption of privacy, criteria for non-public figures, justification, verifiable sources of high quality, etc. Kevin, I am not kidding about anything, I am a newcomer, I admitted that I blanked a page before I understood how to improve an article, and I was unsure of how to do the signature. I will try to keep this neutral however.</p>

<dd>I appreciate your efforts at trying to explain. There are a few misunderstandings here, though. First, the policies state that the <i>article</i> must be unbiased, not the editors! I have my own personal biases on many subjects, but I still try to maintain neutrality in all my edits. I do have some concern that the reference cited are not of high quality, I'll grant that. And it needs rewritten to be more encyclopedic. However, as of yet, I don't see that it violates policies. It's weak right now, and if the references <i>are</i> shown to be of poor quality, then I would agree that it should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 01:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Type Five, my appologies. Welcome! You are wrong on this though, and with all due respect, you are trying to push rope uphill at this point. The best that can be done is to try to diversify the article to demonstrate the subject's finer points. Rich doesn't make him notable, and incest doesn't make him notable, but the two are sysnergistic. Per WP guidelines what is noticed and documented is notable, and this poor fellow has definately been noticed in major way.

<p>If you click on discussion on the article page today there is a warning box regarding controversial and potenially libelous content for bios of living persons. In an effort to create an encylopedic quality quality article, the entry is now really reading like a tabloid. The vibrator entry is particularly troublesome.

<li><b>Rename</b> this article should be renamed and merged with a vice president page. If you noticed the title directly above the chart does not mention "Acting Vice President". I tried to avoid using that alleged title because it is not a real title. The U.S. Vice President page also shows vacancies. This article basically fills those gaps. Someone even linked those vacancies to the article. The table listed shows how they became "next in line" which is the basic source. Also some of the first several people in the article were mentioned as "Acting Vice President" in their own articles after this one was created. I would say "next in line". Those should be revised as well. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 01:48, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the article per GoodDay. The list already exists. Renaming to List of Presidential Successors would be inappropriate unless its re-written to include every Vice President. List of Successors to the Presidency of the United States in the Absence of a Vice President is an absurdly long title which frankly no one would ever search for. If people are looking for succession, they would likely search for presidential succession and go from there. I had never heard that any of these folks were ever addressed as Mr. Vice President. Is there a source for that? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 06:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Found a source, but I don't know how reliable it is. suite101.com/article.cfm/presidents_and_first_ladies/116788 (apparently suite101.com/ is a blacklisted link) It sounds like it was an unofficial title until 1886 when the line of succession changed. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 07:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just when I get too sure of my own convictions, I surprise even myself. While its true that there is no constitutional office of Acting Vice President, the US Senate web page uses the title Acting Vice President when referring to Samuel Southard and Willie Magnum who were Presidents Pro Tempore under Tyler. I still think the list is better placed under the page I earlier posted, but I guess the term can be used. Regarding jjmillerhistorian's link, I guess its ok. High school teachers don't usually rate high in my list of "experts" but I don't see that the author has any incentive to lie and he is independent. <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm" rel="nofollow">[80]</a><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 07:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>But we have sources which verify that it was a <b>real thing</b> -- title, symbolic role, or what have you -- and contemporaries agree that it was considered a solemn responsibility.

<li>We have sources that indicate that on 3 or 4 occasions a significant person used the term. The Senate never "created" this position. I wouldn't object to including this information somewhere else (the name proposed by <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">User:Dhartung</a> is a little unwiedly.

<li>The first citation you've given explains the problem in a nutshell, it refers to William Rufus King as being "<i>in effect</i> the acting vice president." It does not say that he <i>was</i> the Acting Vice President, because there is no such office. As <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">User:GoodDay</a> has pointed out, unlike an Acting President (who assumes all of the powers of the Presidency), the "Acting Vice President" is not empowered to break ties in the Senate. At the very least, this article needs to start off with a sentence that acknowledges that this is not an actual position in the United States Government, and instead, is a term that has, in the past, been used to describe a situation where there is no Vice President. <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 15:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've made some changes which I think address some of the concerns. The list, as it stands, is needlessly long, as it includes people who were next in line to become Acting President, but who, even according to the entry, could not be referred to as "Acting Vice President" because they were not the President Pro Tempore. Perhaps renaming the article would solve that problem. <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 18:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We should mention 'in a revised version' however, that the president pro tempore, can't assume all of the VP duties (a ppt can't cast a tie-breaking vote). This fact, makes the 'Acting VP' title questionable. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 18:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I moved the table to the Presidential Succession Act page, and reduced it on this page, such that only Presidents Pro Tempore are included, as they are the only ones who could be referred to as "Acting Vice President."

<ul>
<li>I concur with your interpretation (that the office could only be held by Presidents <i>pro tem</i>), and I believe verification will come in time. The move of the other next-in-line guys helps. The quibble about the AVP being unable to cast a tie-breaking vote actually seems to have been a debated issue in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, by the way.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article itself says that the title isn't an actual title. The fact that the list in there has the title "List of people who <i>could</i> have been referred to as 'Acting Vice President'" doesn't help as well. The "position" isn't even anything more than being next in line when there is no vice president. It doesn't really matter to me that people used the term once or twice. I'm sure more than one Senator has been called an "asshole" by the President, that doesn't make "asshole" an official title.

<li><b>Note</b> The movie contains footage of birth certificates, tomb stones, etc, that are easily missed on first viewing of the film. Also between production and DVD sale of this movie a commentary, by the producer, has been recorded, this divulges more off screen/alluded to information. Adding to this, the actors, predominantly Garrett, have been increasingly interviewed and asked about their previous characters, whereby they have divulged previously un-marketed information.

<li><b>Note?</b> Heres the info that was lost due to User:Jack Mercer's blanking of the page. It's the reason for the AFD.
<ul>
<li>None notable character from a movie. More important characters in the movie don't have a article. All relevant info is found in the main movie article. Full of speculation over sexuality.--<a href="../../../m/8/v/User%7EM8v2_b3d5.html" title="User:M8v2">M8v2</a> 22:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Jack Mercer is one of the four main characters in this film. The actor, Garrett Hedlund - relatively unknown, who portrays Jack is credited aside the well known names of Andre "3000" Benjamin and Mark Wahlberg on the movies jacket and opening credits, and the character of Jack himself appears multiple times in all manner of movie jacket, advertising and trailer... Jack is a main character. Secondly to say that more important characters in the movie don't have an article is false, Bobby Mercer (Jack's oldest brother ~ Mark Wahlberg)has an article, and I've read several sites attempts at compiling information about Angel and Jerry for publish in this forum. Thirdly, all relevant info is not found in the main article; indeed being new to and inspired by this fandom, I found out about Jack's birthdate, the plans for the roof scene and that Jack was originally supposed to survive the shoot out, all from this article. Finally it is correct to state that Jacks sexuality is speculative at best, Bobby converses with Jack; "How have you been, still sucking a little cock left and right?", and latter in the bathroom scene Angel askes a question about a rash, concerned that he has contracted an STD, and Bobby states; "Ask the cockologist here" referring to Jack in the shower. Jack's sexuality was discussed un-biasedly here, in indeed, a more correct forum than the "Four Brothers" main page ~ that doesn't even report the movie divulged history of each character.Lyeac 08:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was happily wikifying this page when I thought I'd check out google to see if I could put a link in to the band's homepage. I hadn't even considered that they'd be non-notable considering their output but I can find absolutely no trace of them on google or their current record company's website. So I guess they fail <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> miserable.

<p>Surely this information could simply be merged into <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. I don't believe that there is enough depth of information here to justify an independent article. Indeed, a lot of it is made up of things that might happen or are scheduled to happen. Until enough info is amassed to surpass something as simple as a brief mention in the parent article, I don't see a need for this. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 23:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the changes but still recommend deletion as I do not feel a redirect would be worthwhile.

<p>Re-creation of an article recently speedily deleted, so I'm bringing it here in good faith. Original speedy reasoning was that it reads like an advertisement, and that still holds true. Also, some real <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest</a> concerns - article was created both times by SBComics, whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SBComics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SBComics" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> are few and all involve promoting Silver Bullet Comics.

<li><b>Explanations</b> Article was attacked by person in voilation of the Silver Bullet Comics <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78631022" class="external text" title="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78631022" rel="nofollow">trademark</a>, causing edit war. Article was deleted. New entry was created to correct that, but entry's contents were lost, so a quick version was posted till further expansion could properly be done. Article suffered speedy delete too hastily, and was reposted. Article only reads like ad because it has not been fleshed out to it's proper state where it was before edit war deletion. Conflict of Interest comes from attempts to protect trademark. Aditional editing will adjust article back to the informational entry on this battle and it's results, removing it's current "reads like an advertisiment" issues.71.71.113.156 09:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - If I'm understanding what you're saying, then it is being claimed that an article was deleted due to an edit war - which to my knowledge does not normally cause an article to be deleted. Edit-warring articles are generally put up for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProtection_policy_0bbc.html" title="WP:Protection policy">protection</a> or go through arbitration; it is not a valid reason for deletion (especially speedy deletion). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Silver+Bullet+Comics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Silver+Bullet+Comics" rel="nofollow">deletion log</a> show this article to have been deleted twice, both for concerns of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertising</a>. Admins are supposed to check an article's history to make sure it is not the target of sudden, drastic revisions before acting on any speedy deletion request (and I believe they do). If protecting your trademark is truely your number one concern, you should realize that allowing this article to be deleted and <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a> (essentially, protected from re-creation) will accomplish that quite nicely. I doubt this is solution you're looking for, however.</dd>

<dd>None of this addresses my concerns of this article failing Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> criteria, however. The cornerstone of that important policy: "<i>A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other.</i>" Please note the specific wording of that phrase and follow those links for explanations of just what we mean by "independent" and "reliable" sources. Note also that "non-trivial" means that it is more than a passing mention or quote in an article about a larger or different topic. I was unable to find such sources myself in relation to either incarnation of Silver Bullet Comics.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article now has more sources and info than the current Wikipedia entries for 'Comic Book Resources', 'The Comics Reporter', 'Comic Shop News', 'Funtime Comics', 'Million Year Picnic', 'Newsarama', and Hundreds upon hundreds of other entries covering comics websites and stores, all of which have been allowed and are not up for deletion. As this entry's subject has long been BOTH a US Trademarked site AND a store, making it unique, and founded by a person with many ties to the comics industry, it shoud be allowed to be fleshed out, not deleted. If every imaginary character that ever appeared in a single comic can have an entry, this unique company more than qualifies, with it's rich history of exclusive stories quoted all over the internet, and current legal battle. Many articles on Wikipedia utilize this website as the source for their article's information... so having this entry be significant enough to qualify as a trusted source, but not accept defining it, is completely contrary to what an enclyclopedia accomplishes. To delete this entry is to disqualify all entries quoting this source as a valid resource. This entry should be allowed to be expanded, as deleting it serves no purpose, in light of other similar content rampant on Wikipeda. To not let it have the chance to expand is to favor other sites' ability to have entries over it, under the same criteria.71.71.113.156 06:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please note that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>, so the existence of other similar articles is completely irrelevant to this discussion. Also please take a look at <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>, as you've made quite a few of those above (note that "arguments to avoid" is not an official policy, however, it gives a pretty good idea the types of arguments that closing admins are likely to ignore, IMO). As for many of the "sources" that have been introduced to the article, they all seem to be more about nationwide events that Silver Bullet happened to participate in (especially the 24 Hour Comic sources). This is also true for the Newsarama sources - These do much more to demonstrate the notability of Free Comic Book day than this particular store, and does nothing to demonstrate the notability of the website this article was originally promoting (and yes, I still feel your aims are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">promotional</a> in nature). Also, these sources are somewhat dubious in terms of what we consider a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> - The Comics Journal links, especially, seem to be in the form of a blog, where short blurbs tend only to link back to Silver Bullet's own site. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 18:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list with far too broad criteria for inclusion. Any music video that has so much as a single word bleeped by any of the listed stations is subject to inclusion. Limiting the list to just those listed stations is improperly POV as there is little or no justification for including some videos censored on some shows/stations and not others so paradoxically the list is simultaneously too broad and too narrow in scope. The article is completely unsourced and it's doubtful that reliable sources could be found for most of the entries (partcipants on the talk page even note that they have conflicting memories of seeing the videos censored vs. uncensored. Noting some of the videos as "extremely offensive" is also impermissably POV. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:41, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral, leaning delete</b> properly referenced and with clearer criteria for inclusion, I don't think that it would be such a horrendous list. But I agree, the current list is ridiculous. I think the lead sentence <i>"If the video's title is in bold, this means that the video is extremely offensive."</i> is pretty funny.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would have to agree with the analysis by the nom.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's valid and factual. Censorship exists and can be documented. There are plenty of other lists on Wiki that are allowed to stay simply because of their popularity and not based on the validity of their editors' arguments for existence (see the absolutely worthless and misguided, vague and deceptive lists/POV and nonsense at the "Hollywood North" page which is really just advertising for the Canadian film industry). That page is allowed to exist even though there is no documented clear use of the term "Hollywood North" which is just a bastardization and cannibalization of the true, original Hollywood, California name.

I've been putting some effort into getting this cited and cleaned up with an eye towards nominating it for featured list in a few months. I thought it sort of strange that other people had suddenly taken off with the sourcing but was glad - now I see the reason, it's on AFD.

But the point is, it was a DICTIONARY, not an encyclopaedia. This list suffer several faults, notably that the first few links I followed go to irrelevant articles (e.g. Abella &gt;&gt;&gt; 14C female <b>Italian</b> physician; Abreu &gt;&gt;&gt; Abreu Camp in the USA).

(The term "Hispanic" also seems problematic, as would be the articles in Category:Lists of surnames by ethnicity or nationality per Sable's concerns about OR/V. In this case though, that can probably be fixed just by renaming to "List of Spanish Surnames."

<p><b>Comment</b>: April 24 circular is a "cited event" which is included in the literature (both sides). It is the most important, the milestone, even in the history of Armenian Genocide. It is not an original research. The day of the "April 24 circular" is recognized with the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide_Remembrance_Day_07e6.html" title="Genocide Remembrance Day">Genocide Remembrance Day</a> as the beginning of the Armenian genocide. April 24 circular is not the Armenian genocide itself to be claimed as a "parallel article", it is part of the Armenian genocide. It is not a fork, it is included in the article like the many other sub-articles. It is "genocide deniers", propaganda to eliminate this event, or other milestone events, from the history of Armenian genocide. Elimination of this article will bring a big gap in the storyline Armenian genocide, which genocide denier's main policy to eliminate the "milestones" from the "history of genocide".

<dd><s>Moreover, as <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">User:OttomanReference</a> has noted, the circular carries the title <i>BOA. DH.

<p><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a>. Sorry, but I have said <i>There is no such thing as an 'April 24 circular', <b>having any notability.</b></i> You have, I assume, involuntarily distorted my message by adding a dot after the term circular and by mistake deleted my words. (check diff).</p>
<p>I do not deny the claim of a circular, I have said a second time in this very same page: <i>There is no such notable thing as April 24 circular. This notability, YOU cooked it,…</i> April 24 is recognized as the day when intellectuals have been arrested, most killed. What OttomanReference did is taking the Turkish government claim on the event (the very same page from the Turkish government website you have footnoted). Check the article on its state before Serouj edits, check the footnotes OttomanReference had provided and the text and compare them with the one from the page you have linked here. This page was created as a fork of the Armenian genocide article, check the genocide article section about April 24. OttomanReference created this parallel article by recycling the official Turkish government claim on April 24 events by cooking some notability over some obscure 24 April circular and completing it with original research. He created two parallel articles about Armenian casualties, in parallel to the already existing Armenian casualties’ article. The article he has worked on titled: <i>Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915</i> which seems as a good intentioned article, while the large majority of the notables who have been deported have been murdered, those mostly cited are those having survived. Ottomanreference had a history of disruption on the Armenian genocide article, having created documented socks, and the article still suffer of the disruptions he has created by using his socks to implement his changes.</p>
<p>Just as evidences, this is what he wrote above: <i>The title of the article is April 24 circular, if anything that is not related with the Talat Pasha's order was not included in the article. The version [2] version before Fad (ix) edited proves this point.</i> Now check April 24 on google, and see what are 99,99% of the results you obtain in connection with the Armenians, is actually not related to Ottomanreference cooked event, and thosefor can not be used to justify the existance of his cooked article, which is a FORK, the reason I have provided for its deletion, and not the reason you report I have given. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 06:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>My apologies for the misunderstanding. I thought you had nominated the article for deletion on grounds of <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a>, but after rereading your comments above, I see now your point revolves around <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. I am, for now, changing my "keep" comment to "undecided" until I can look into this topic some more. Thank you for pointing out my error and assuming good faith.

<li><b>Delete</b>. You won't find any mention of an "April 24 circular" in academic papers on the Armenian Genocide. OttomanReference has not provided a <i>verifiable</i> source in accord with <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> and his arguments are considered Armenian Genocide denial which only has one place in Wikipedia: the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide_58d2.html" title="Denial of the Armenian Genocide">Denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> article, where its claims will be debunked anyway. April 24 is to the Armenian Genocide what <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> is to the Holocaust. If anything, an article named "April 24 (Armenian Genocide)" should be created, not one title after a non-existent "April 24 circular". <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 07:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Moreover, <a href="http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/yayin/osmanli/Armenians_inottoman/1b_001a.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/yayin/osmanli/Armenians_inottoman/1b_001a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/yayin/osmanli/Armenians_inottoman/1b_001a.htm</a> is not "material that has been published by reliable sources" and therefore fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. The government of Turkey is <i>known</i> to be a denier of the Armenian Genocide, and therefore this type of argument belongs in the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide_58d2.html" title="Denial of the Armenian Genocide">Denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">Serouj</a> 07:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - sources do not assert notability of the April 24th Circular. It is apparent that April 24th is, in fact, a notable day in the chronology of the Armenian Genocide. However, it is not apparent that this circular is notable or important, outside of topic itself. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 10:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>: <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself</i>. Though Talaat's order is often noted in books on the Genocide, it is always done so as part of giving the history of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">24 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. Thus, due to the lack of "non-trivial, reliable" sources that treat the circular as their primary subject-matter, I am changing my original vote (see above) to delete. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I support <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerouj_b8ee.html" title="User:Serouj">User:Serouj</a>'s idea to create some kind of article about April 24, 1915: e.g., 24 April 1915 purge of Armenian intellectuals or 24 April (Armenian Genocide). Or perhaps the information can be added to the background of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide_Remembrance_Day_07e6.html" title="Genocide Remembrance Day">Genocide Remembrance Day</a> article. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
