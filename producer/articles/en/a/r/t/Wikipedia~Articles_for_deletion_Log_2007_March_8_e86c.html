<li><sub>It's possible you are misinterpreting the function of this discussion. Users come to a deletion discussion to make "judgments" on whether an article should be kept or not. If they see a way the article can be improved or salvaged, most users will be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and simply improve it themselves, not just make suggestions for improvement. The way you can affect this discussion positively is not to make unsupported statements here on this discussion page that you have "thousands of members" and "hundreds of active members," but to add <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable secondary sources</a> to the article that support the contentions in the article. —<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 08:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</sub></li>

<p><sub>If this discussion is only for judgments, then explain how do people fix it if people don't give constructive criticism? And yeah, we did back up the assertions of thousands of members and hundreds of active members: the forum comes with a site counter at the bottom of the main forum page. It is easy to judge, it is worthwhile to actually go to the talk page and give constructive criticism. The judgments basically don't contribute one iota to anything without the constructive criticism. Imagine getting a traffic ticket that says you violated a law, but the cop, the judge, the prosecutor, nobody will tell you how to avoid being convicted and losing your license. But all of them just say "yank the license!" BobCatHKSS 11:28, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</sub></p>

<li><sub>If the cliches listed in the article are nearly identical in concept with cliches found in other forms of media, then why do we need a seperate page for video games? Would it not be redundant? Also, extending on my toilet cliche example: In contemporary times, humans have often used toilets to dispose of their bodily wastes, and as humans tend to do this often, there are a large number of toilets throughout the world. As such, how then is it a cliche that video games <i>with</i> humans or humanoids tend to have toilets? Are gun or sticks or cars cliches as well?--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 05:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</sub>
<ul>
<li><sub>I don't understand your fixation on this toilet thing, I don't see it as a significant portion of the article (IOW, it could be removed without bothering me). Cliches themselves, though, often involve things that exist in the real world. Some people think say, being stuck in an elevator is a cliche. Does that mean nobody ever gets stuck in an elevator? Of course not, just the other day, somebody was on the news for being trapped 11 hours in an elevator here. But if there's a sitcom cliches page and it mentioned it, I'd not be surprised. Same goes for cliches in video games. Sure, some of them may be the same as in other genres (and depending on the content, it might be appropriate to locate the cliche elsewhere). For example, something could be a cliche in Greek and Japanese theatre, but not in say, Broadway theatre. Don't know of any specific examples, not off the top of my head, but I'm trying to illustrate why your objection doesn't work. At most, they're clean-up issues. Stick to other things if you want to convince me on deletion. Bad arguments can ruin a good one. OR is a much better route to go here. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</sub>
<ul>
<li><sub>If none of the cliches are specific to video games (ie they happen often in real life or in other genres) then there's obviously no merit for a seperate article. It's as simple as that.

<li><b>Delete</b> - the problem here is that the references need to identify all these things as cliches.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> At least one of the band members (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alistair_Griffin_3f91.html" title="Alistair Griffin">Alistair Griffin</a>) has some notability outside of the band. But the sources for the article are almost all from one local paper. Google hits are difficult to gauge because "Albion" was in the name of a different band ("Albion Band", a folk group) that disbanded in 2002. My gut feeling is that the band is too new for notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wouldn't have thought he deserved an entry at first, but considering the nature of the position and the massive amount of major media coverage (most of it trivial, but not all <a href="http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070206/COLUMNIST26/702060315/-1/NEWS17" class="external autonumber" title="http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070206/COLUMNIST26/702060315/-1/NEWS17" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) I had to reconsider.

<li><b>Delete</b> On a side note, you have to laugh that the person who wrote "Dessert for Dummies" is serving dessert to George Bush.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some people might indeed care who the previous chefs were, though some of it is more related to the person who was President than the actual person. However, I don't know that this individual is sufficiently notable on their own. Perhaps an article listing Chefs at the White House might be a worthy idea?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I was going to strongly argue delete, but before submitting I looked up other school deletions and the list of article for schools in Maine. It would seem that while I'll never care, I would definitely like to be able to look up an encyclopedic article of where I graduated from. Notability is provided by longetivity and accomplishments. If they can get some truthful statements about accomplishments besides the Blue Ribbon award (I don't consider that notable at all myself), then they should be kept. Insane college acceptance, sports titles, anything really... somebody should tag it as a stub. Perhaps they have enough high school students who break the norm that one might make the article contain something useful. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 20:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Advertisment. Reads like promotional copy, no assertiion of sufficient notability. There was a previous article (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_CustomerVision_0828.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/CustomerVision">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/CustomerVision</a> on this company that was deleted, unsure if this is an improvement on that or not. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 17:45, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is very similar to entries for companies that are CustomerVision's peers such as Socialtext, Jot and Atlassian. Not including CustomerVision in articles such Corporate Wikis would be an omission. This is validated by third party sources such as the only comprehensive review of corporate wikis (conducted by Network World) in which CustomerVision was rated higher than Socialtext.</p>
<p>There are many links to independent resources for CustomerVision and awards. Recently within articles on leading enterprise wiki companies with such qualified researchers as Forrester, Gilbane and JupiterResearch. With customers that vary in size from Fortune 50 to non-profits, CustomerVision BizWiki is a leader in understanding the enterprise market space (look at the case studies, as evidence off their site).</p>
<p>The entry is not intended to be promotional but is designed to assert sufficient notability.</p>

<li>I missed this comment sooner - sorry. The process so far has been to delete the completely useless article that was called "List of Australians" as most of us weren't on it, create a new article <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> with as many lists of people as we could find, then start to sift through which ones are valuable to the project. A number were already accurate, complete and maintained, so are not treated further here. Some have been improved, either through initiative, discussion, or AFD (yes it does happen that articles are improved and kept after nomination). Some have been nominated for deletion and been deleted. These have been lists with overly broad definitions that to become "complete" would have thousands of entries, many not notable, or were lists of "notable people" without a reliable source for the list. These are better served by categories that are magically kept up to date as new articles are written. Redirects have been left in place for any lists that have been merged or renamed. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7ELists_of_Australians_884c.html" title="Talk:Lists of Australians">Talk:Lists of Australians</a> to see how we're going and if you'd like to help. The underlying purpose is to remove lists that reflect poorly on the project as a whole or the Australian part of it, and avoid lists that attract vanity or attack entries. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to wonder why it is that when people want to keep an article because "it needs cleanup" there are almost never 1) suggestions on how the article can be cleaned up, 2) actual attempts to clean up the article during the AFD, and 3) commitments on the part of the cleanup advocates to actually clean up the article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your statement is an inaccurate generalisation.

<li>Not true. Suggestions are often given on how to cleanup. In this case, I can suggest converting this into a table to provide dates of birth/death, place of birth, and a "notes" column listing awards, major roles, etc.</li>
<li>Please see the 3 examples above. Moreover, when it seems likely that an article may be deleted, no one has particular incentive to even try to fix it. If the issue was raised in an environment other than <i>"Du hast fünf Tage diesen Artikel zu verbessern oder es wirt getötet. Verstehst du? Arbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit!"</i>, that might be more conducive to improvement.</li>

I am not convinced yet that these articles are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and they pass my own "smell" test. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'll also note that two years ago, we had to clear out a lot of unsupported election-theory articles that were little more than <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Later-no-harm appears to be in circulation among a small circle of, uh, election-theory hobbyists, but so far I'm not aware of it having had any influence on the real world, or even of being covered nontrivially in multiple reliable sources. This counts more under WP policy than anyone's smell test. I'll defer to anyone who can provide better-sourced information, but currently I'd favor a <b>merge</b> into an article on election systems and criteria used to evaluate them. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I don’t really know how “well” known it is, it depends on how widely one reads, but it is certainly known. I learnt about it many years ago, as part of the many paradoxes of voting systems. It is related to monotonicity, is attributed to Douglas Woodall, Reader in Pure Mathematics at Nottingham University, UK (see <a href="http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE6/P4.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE6/P4.HTM" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>), and is described in many publications, including popular mathematical/voting books. It is reliably sourced, and is in frequent use. By what definition do you mean "non-notable"? <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 00:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>More to the point, I ask you to explain why you think the criterion is “non-notable”, what you mean by “non-notable”, and why you believe that “non-notable” is a criterion for deletion.---(unsigned by SmokeyJoe)

<li>There is only one source of the criteria and there is no evidence of the reliability of that source.

<li>When I google “Later no harm” I get multiple responses, excluding wikis. I see no basis for an argument that “Voting Matters” is not a reliable secondary source, or that it is not independent of Woodall? (perhaps there is one, but it hasn’t been made yet) The many other incidental references demonstrate that the subject is in widespread use.---(unsigned by SmokeyJoe)</li>

<li>From: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> “Deletion A topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because there are insufficient published works from reliable sources that are independent of the subject.5 Without such sources, a proper encyclopedia article cannot be built at all.” I guess that you are relying on this. It looks already like a respectable article, it relates directly to a voting system in use, has potential to be expanded, and is clearly not a product of original research. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 01:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I found the following interesting: “However, such protest votes have an unpredictable effect on an election outcome as IRV fails to comply with any established election method criteria.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instant-runoff_voting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11628412" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instant-runoff_voting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11628412" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. “Later-no-harm” is an established election method criteria with which IRV complies. Your contribution was POV, original research and reveals a distaste for IRV or the “later-no-harm” criterion and I suggest that you have a conflict of interest in nominating this article for deletion. For what purpose, I have no idea. I believe that your reasoning is another example of an abuse of the ill-defined, non-policy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 06:57, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>SmokeyJoey, I advise you to keep your discussion civil and not make presumptions about my motives. IRV satisfies the majority criterion and with a random ballot tie-breaking method, independence of clones, both established criteria. You seem to ignore the possibility that I could have been in error as I had only been editing wikipedia for three weeks when I wrote that edit. Instead you assume I was editing in bad faith. I believe you are violating the wikipedia policy of assuming good faith and advise you to follow it.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 16:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In all seriousness, I am boldly questioning your motive. I feel the need to be bold because this is not a place for a relaxed considered discussion – you are seeking to have (on March 13) the article obliterated from wikipedia, all content, history and discussions. I am curious about your motive because I cannot understand why you want to delete. “Non-notable” really doesn’t explain it. The subject has been noted in many places. As evidence for an ulterior motive, to justify the raising of the question, I offer your assertion (albeit long ago), found largely by chance, that the subject “later-no-harm” doesn’t exist. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 01:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, you are being uncivil. Save your boldness for editing. Again, I advise you to assume good faith. If you assume an ulterior motive and wish to be argumentative, then I am not taking the bait. We have a civil discussion where good faith is assumed, or this stuff from you ends right here.--<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b>; an article in a mathematics journal (Discrete Applied Mathematics #77) is plenty to satisfy WP:V and WP:N, so the remaining question is whether the organization of these concepts make more sense as individual articles or sections of an article like mathematical criteria for voting systems.

<li><b>Strong Save</b>:First of all, this game was invented by me in the year 2002. I searched the web high and low to see if anybody else had thought of this prior to me, I found no entries on this. Recently the game has been gaining much momentum as a result of myspace.com and other networking sites. A page on Wikipedia, the site that started it all, is what I think could give it the boost it needs to become successful internationally. Also, it was given a patent 2 days ago which I filed for in 2003. I just didn't put it on Wikipedia untill I had the (assumed) security of a US Patent. -- <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">User:D'Brickashaw</a> 04:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

A patent can't be granted for actions, which this would fall under.

<li><b>Comment</b> Having done a little bit of research, this is not eligible for patent in the United States, as is claimed above. US patent law only covers "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof".

<li>I don't know where you could get a copy of it, but Australian Schools Magazine ran an article on it in the November 2005 issue, mentioning my name as well as the game itself.

<li>As well as this, PC World ran an article in it's September 2006 issue about Wikipedia Random Article Games, that quoted. "A concept that was made popular in Australia in 2002 with the advent of Connect-A-Pedia has now turned into an internet meme with thousands of copycats all over the web."

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not Wikinews nor Wikisportsrosters. While lists are not required to be on topics whose contents never change, those which aren't both readily maintainable and of some long-term significance are usually deleted. This list has no sources shown. I have trouble supporting even the similar list of NHL captains, and that's the major league of hockey. For the OHL, when a team changes captains, it will typically be reported only in the local newspaper and on the team's website. That's not multiple independent reliable sources. (I come from a city with a team in the AHL, the most important minor professional league feeding to the NHL, and even the local paper gives nontrivial coverage only once a year to the captaincy.) This information belongs in the articles on the teams and on the notable players as "2006-2007 captain", not "current captain". If someone really wants to see a "current" list, they can use team and league websites, and WP does not need to contain less-up-to-date information. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:00, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been trying to get reliable independent info about Jack M Oliphant and have been unable to confirm anything. I should not have created this article without learning more about Wikipedia first and getting some solid facts with references. I do not know the definition of notable. He was connected with Lee Harvey Oswald - Ty Hardin - Timothy McVeigh and was caught planning the bombing of the Hoover Dam and the FBI Headquarters. Please go ahead and remove it. If the FOI requests I made confirm his millitary record, working for OSS or anything else someone can always create a new article right? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottprovost_7e47.html" title="User:Scottprovost">Scottprovost</a> 10:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, you could always create a new article. By the way, I think many of us don't know the definition of "notable"&#160;:-) There's an ongoing discussion regarding whether or not this should even be a reason for acceptance/deletion of articles. Regardless, this article doesn't have attributable information (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>), which is a policy.

<p>To give you an idea of the difficulty I have met with. Apparently his military rank is still classified. Even prisoners of war are allowed to give their rank. How can it be sensitive and ineligible for FOI release 60 years later and after he is dead. US News and World Report has information but has been asked not to release it. They claim that it is nothing significant, mostly related to the Kennedy event. All those surveillance records are set to be released for FOI but not available yet. Is is notable that all the other operatives involved in the Kennedy investigation are considered notable. The fact that Jack is known for being on the side of the Government in 1962 and against the government with Timothy McVeigh with a religious cult to his credit in the meanwile shouldn't make him less notable should it? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottprovost_7e47.html" title="User:Scottprovost">Scottprovost</a> 09:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> If there isn't an editor out there who will maintain it, then it will just attract vandals. I'm all for keeping high school articles, but I'm beginning to think one of the practical criteria needs to be that the article won't just be a spot where vandals hang out, blighting the neighborhood. So an editor needs to be there to police it. I see no evidence of that in this case, so bulldoze it.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b> - I've removed the weasel bits, and found at least one notability reference ( in the article now ).

<li><b>Keep</b> Has potential to be expanded, or at the very least, merged. It actually has sources! Notability is a failed criterion that never had consensus.

<li>I originally nominated this article for speedy deletion, based on the fact that it was basically nonsensical, but have since gotten a second opinion and decided to go for a normal AFD. This articles was also PROD'd by another editor, but the notice was removed anonymously without comment.</li>
<li>This article is a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">barely coherent essay</a>, does not cite any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>, and is by and large unintelligible. It also appears to consist of 100% <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and fails to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribute</a> any of its sources or claims. Furthermore, it is not clear that the topic discussed herein has any relationship to a "cosmic intelligence" and is entirely speculation.

<li>Note, however, that I am not contending that an article about "Cosmic Intelligence" is inherently non-notable, or impossible to produce. I am nominating this particular article because it is incoherent - presumably in the future, one could produce a reasonable, encyclopedic article about this topic.

<li><b>Delete</b> One of the more bizzare articles I've seen on AfD.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I'm rather astonished at the blythe assertion that the national record holder in a sport wouldn't likely be competing at that sport's highest level in this country. As it happens, Burley placed second at his distance just this past month in the US Indoor Track National Championships, won the outdoor national championship in 2003, and has competed at the Olympic Trials. All this took me about four minutes to verify. Now I've added my findings to the article, but AfDs shouldn't be filed in cases where the most cursory of searches uncovers ample verification.

<p>The idea of disambiguation pages is to provide guidance between several likely outcomes of a given search. From <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a>: <i>Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes "Go", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?)</i></p>
<p>People won't search for Ekaterini, or most first names for that matter, to reach any of the targets included in this disambiguation - in reality it is an unencyclopedic list of everyone named Ekaterini disguised as a disambiguation page.</p>
<p>Exceptions from this do exist, namely when people are known primarily by their first name - see for instance <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald.html" title="Harald">Harald</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haakon.html" title="Haakon">Haakon</a>. This does not, of course, apply in this case. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 08:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is, as Falconage above pointed out, not an 'encyclopedic' list. Rather, it serves it's purpose well - I have, at many times, searched for people by first name.

<dd>Gosh Alan, thanks so much for the love. Let me expand my comment (AfD is not a vote btw). The article is about a school. The school is unnotable. Pointless attempts (the teams' sponsor is Nike, eg) have been made to try to provide some grounds for notability in the ongoing and misguided belief that Wikipedia is a glorified Yellow Pages masquerading as an encyclopaedia on weekends. But the school remains unnotable. Why? It is a school &amp; schools are generally unnotable. Their sports teams are unnotable. Their mascots are unnotable as are their school colours, their motto, and the principal's name. How can I be clearer? I am serene that you disagree with me on this issue, but let's keep the commentary on the specific message and not impugn the opinions of those who don't happen to live in your sunshine-filled happy valley of server-wasting schoolcruft. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I prefer to deal with fellow editors, those of us who are working together to build an encyclopedia, not critics with an axe to grind. Above and beyond your clear deletionist bias and near-complete lack of contributions, you persist in pushing your agenda, rather than addressing the article in question. I still don't have the impression that you have bothered to read it. As such, your knee-jerk vote does not address the issues of notability for this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't seem like much of an advert to me. School articles are important and schools are notable. Hence the hundreds of articles on schools.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all school articles are notable. This one, however, seems to be (following the addition of multiple sources to the article). One could argue that the basketball team is more notable than the school, but if for nothing else than proper organisation, content about school teams should be in a main school article (except for major college/university teams, of course). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Would it be possible to merge the names of the contestants into the show's page then? Of course, then the question comes as to how much of the article to keep I'd guess. oh yeah I did want to mention that in retrospect my reasoning for removing the prod was flawed since it followed the 'if this article is here, then this should be too' kind of circular logic.

The subject's notability is based on the show so if it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> then I think per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> we should consider merging it with the show's page instead of out and out deleting it. Also in the interests of disclosure I AM a friend of the subject so if that invalidates my vote well then you should probably know that before taking my comments into consideration. --Andrew831 17:14, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Wikipedia's rule on Reliable sources is:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible." Keyword - whenever possible. So if it is not possible (for any reason at all, as there are no stated guidelines as to what defines impossibility) an author does not have to specify the sources of his facts, or even have any sources for his facts, period. AND since the author did not specify a source, one has no way of knowing whether this fact has come from a primary reference or secondary reference - thus, every uncited fact is arguably taken from a secondary source, which do to SOME factor, whatever that factor may be, citing that source is impossible. Hence, the unreferenced fact is fully in compliance with wikipeida's rules on reliable sources.</p>
<p>Thus, an unreferenced fact is a reliable source! (Wikipeida's rules, not mine)</p>
<p>Hence, the argument that this article should be deleted because not citing sources is against wikipedia policy is spurious at best.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Second, this article has been proposed for deletion because of wikipedia's policy on neologisms. However, wikipedia has plenty of article's on neologisms already - wikipedia's page on deletion says email is a neologism, but wikipedia has an entry on e-mail. Thus if you delete the page on wiki fraud, to be consistent, you have to go delete EVERY article on neologisms; now what kind of so called "Encyclopeida" would wikipedia be if it did not have an article on e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thirdly, as to the claims that this article is inaccurate: Where are your sources? (Show me your sources and I will show you mine.) By Proposing that this article should because deleted because the facts contained in the article are inaccurate, without providing evidence in support of your own claims, is a little hypocritical at best.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, in response to "thought police officer's" comment: "Most of this is already covered in Essjay controversy anyway. No use rubbing salt in anyone's wounds. -- - (Elkspeak)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we see the real reason why this article is being deleted. It is being deleted, not because it is against any of wikipedia's policies, but because it points out the major flaws in wikipedia - it rubs salt in wikipedia's wounds. Hence, Jimmy Wales' Thought police, have been sent out to squash all opposition, as always.</p>
<p>That's why the article is being deleted; not because there is anything wrong with the article, but because its against your own beliefs'. Thus, wikipedia's ugly secrets make make their presence known again. This is not an encylopedia; its a mere forum where one party's beliefs are presented as fact, and any questioning/critism of these facts is immediately eradicated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dimdawg (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dimdawg_cf76.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dimdawg">contribs</a>) 2007-03-09 09:27:04 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Quoting Wikipedia's entry on the word Neologism</dd>
<dd>" neologism (from Greek νεολογισμός "νέος" [neos] = new; "λόγος" [logos] = word) is a word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") — often to apply to new concepts, to synthesize pre-existing concepts, or to make older terminology sound more contemporary. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context. The term e-mail, as used today, is an example of a neologism."(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism</a>)</dd>

<p>I doubt that the article can be cleaned up, since many of the listed "clichés" are either:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Seen in other forms of media, and not specifically related to video games. For example, Area 51-related facilities appear commonly in all science fiction related media, not just video games.</li>
<li>Due to technological restrictions, such as cities having fewer builings than what one would see in a real city.</li>
<li>Appear commonly in real life, so they can't technically be considered as a "cliché".

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, none of your objections to these settings being considered cliche actually convince me. Something being a cliche for Video games and for other Science Fiction media? So what? Cliches are not limited to one media. Having fewer buildings? Makes sense to me that technological restrictions might determine why a cliche happens. I don't see how that possible excludes them from being a cliche. And appearing in real life doesn't make things not a cliche either. But even if I did agree with you, those are content-disputes, not deletion arguments. You'd be better of just sticking to the WP:V and OR concerns, though I do think those can be resolved. Beyond that, I do think the title of the article is poor, and it should be renamed if kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMister.Manticore_1c1e.html" title="User talk:Mister.Manticore">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mister.Manticore_288c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mister.Manticore">contribs</a>) 13:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

Combines the blindingly obvious (Miss Dominican Republic is the pageant which selectes - you guessed it - Miss Dominican Republic) and a directory of contestants, all without the benefit of a single secondary source. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>expand</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Is being a registered party in the UK sufficient grounds for keeping? I do not know the method involved but if all it takes is to simply file some registration paperwork then being registered is hardly a measure of notability. A quick scan of the list in the provided link yields some ~380 registered parties in the UK, which would lead me to believe that simply being a registered party itself does not warrant inclusion. All the party's leadership appear to be from the same family, has by its own admission a very limited membership, the article lacks any credible sources and seems to have been created by a single use account. Unless some verifiable and independent information establishing some shred of notability is found this article does not belong here. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Initally I would have said keep but the party is not notable at all. As it has not stood in any election yet, only filed papers to set it up as a party 3 months ago, I think it should be deleted as there is nothing much in the article and if it becomes notable for what it does during a future election then I would find reason for it to be listed as an article as it would have something other to put than their manifesto. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 17:39, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Briefly: recently-coined neologism that seems to have limited use, in Internet forums, and only in the context of the evolution/creation debate.</p>
<p>This useful and evocative phrase <i>deserves</i> wide use. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but my strong impression is that it is a neologism and that it is used in a very limited context: it is used primarily in certain forums and Wikis, and it almost exclusively used in the context of discussions of the theory of evolution. It has not gained enough traction to appear in published sources that meet reliable source guidelines.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest evidence I have for this is that a Google Books search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mining%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mining%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"quote mining</a> returns only five hits, of which three are irrelevant, one is a 2004 book entitled "Creationism's Trojan Horse," and one is a 2007 book entitled "The Counter-Creationism Handbook." A similar search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mine%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mine%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"quote mine"</a> yields similar results: 48 hits, all but one of which are irrelevant ("And again I quote&#160;: Mine inspections and enforcement of State and Federal law and working codes in themselves are not enough"). The single relevant hit is again "The Counter-Creationism Handbook." 35,000 Google Web hits are harder to analyze but seem to follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>The online <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61" rel="nofollow">American Heritage Dictionary</a> does not define "quote mining," "quote mine," "quote-mining" or "quote-mine."</p>
<p>Online search of <i>The New York Times</i> from 2000 to the present shows no occurrences of the exact phrases "quote mine" or "quote mining."</p>
<p>Note that my objection is <i>not</i> that it is confined to evolution/creation debate, although if I'm correct about this the article should explain this—but that it is not in widespread use and cannot be described or defined by references to reliable published sources. (P. S. I'm not a creationist, and I believe creationists are one (among many!) groups that is fond of the tactic of making collections of misleadingly out-of-context quotations.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. S. Earliest USENET hit in Google Groups search is a 1997 posting <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.christian/browse_thread/thread/e0da83b53ce46dcf/9b9dd4613dfb30d2?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=21#9b9dd4613dfb30d2" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.christian/browse_thread/thread/e0da83b53ce46dcf/9b9dd4613dfb30d2?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=21#9b9dd4613dfb30d2" rel="nofollow">Creation VS Evolution</a> in alt.religion.christian, and it seems to be very widely used in talk.origins. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. P. S. If the article <b>doesn't</b> explain that the term is used almost exclusively in the context of the evolution/creationist debate, then the article isn't accurate. But if the article <b>does</b> explain this, it needs to support the statement by citing a reliable published source—and I don't think one can be found.</p>

<li>I'm unconvinced by the rationale in the now, per Limulus. Coverage is books is not a criterion for something not being an unestablished neologism.

<dd>The issue is not whether the term is "notable." The issue is whether <i>there is enough material to document its usage, based on published sources meeting reliable source guidelines.</i> I think the biggest issue is the one mentioned in my P. P. S.</dd>
<dd>The present article is <b>inaccurate,</b> because it implies that the term is used <i>generally</i> to refer to quotations out of context. For example, in presidential campaigns it is not uncommon for party A to distribute collections of out-of-context quotations, attacking party B's candidate, that were made by that candidate's primary rivals. ("Look! Even his own party thinks he's despicable!") But they've been doing that for decades, and it is never called "quote mining."</dd>
<dd>The phrase is <i>not</i> used generally. It is used <i>specifically</i> by... let me narrow it even more... non-creationists, with reference to argument tactics used by creationists. (And perhaps, I'm told, in some blog postings about global warming).</dd>
<dd>If the article <i>doesn't</i> properly explain how, where, and by whom the term is used, its inaccurate. But if it <i>does</i> include these details, it needs to have a published source meeting reliable source guidelines, and I haven't found one. It's such an evocative term that I think there will be one eventually, and <i>when there is</i> we can have an article. Basically, you don't write articles about neologisms when they're still neologisms, even if you can <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:CRYSTAL">see the shape of things to come</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To begin with, the presence of inaccuracy in an article isn't grounds for deletion. As for it being a neologism - there are reliable sources <i>about</i> the term - the Quote Mine Project includes a section about the term, as does an NCSE document<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/media/Analysis-of-the-Discovery-Institute.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncseweb.org/media/Analysis-of-the-Discovery-Institute.pdf" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Berkeley science review reports on the <i>meaning</i> of the term <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=evolution" class="external autonumber" title="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=evolution" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

<dd>These are sources that use the phrase "quote mining," usually without explanation. I've never denied that it's used. My issue is that there are no sources that <i>discuss the phrase itself</i> and there's no way to write <i>about</i> the phrase except to look directly at how it's used and draw conclusions; that's original research. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>please leave</b> These were both experiments in social behaviour and the phenomenon of word usage and spread. I have now removed all references for my own blog to show that it is experimental. Wikipedia has references for edublog, moblog, phlog to name but a few. These were obviously neologisms when they were first coined but because they have been given a thorough description they are allowed to remain. Whilst I will defer to the majority decision, with the influx of new technology and comms methods new words will be appearing regulary. And should it really be left in the hands of self confessed experts to do? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Willco5 (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillco5_7317.html" title="User talk:Willco5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willco5_21bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willco5">contribs</a>) 16:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Likely hoax. What a first day that would have been... Crossing the English Channel in "open top boats", immediately being posted to the front lines, subjected to gas and artillery attacks and getting sentry duty makes for an interesting 24 hours.

<li><b>Keep</b>; I don't see anything wrong with this article since M_C_Y_1008's trimming. Calling it "indiscriminate" or "cruft" is a non-argument akin to <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDON%27TLIKEIT_90f9.html" title="WP:IDON'TLIKEIT">WP:IDON'TLIKEIT</a>. The material is certainly verifiable and for a game series as important as Pokémon, notable. The scope of the list is narrow and objective. So why is it indiscriminate? On the other hand, the comments above probably reflect the pre-trimmed state so maybe we are evaluating different articles. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 20:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, it does apply here, just as the policy applies to every article on wikipedia. Its not a selective policy. In fact, the first sentence of Indiscriminate Information even says 'collections of items of information' and what we have here is a collection of item information. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And mroe to the point, you say 'whatever that is' in relation to an indiscriminate information, so you admit to not knowing what it even means, but the proceed to try and argue that this article isn't one.

<dd>The policy applies to every article on Wikipedia, but the statement "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection" can apply here positively or negatively. <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection</i> of items of information. "Collection" here applies to Wikipedia. This article is an item of information. Whether this article makes Wikipedia an indiscriminate collection is what is up to debate. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 10:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is a linguistic issue. In the sentence "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", "collection" applies to Wikipedia. Nowhere does "collection" apply to any specific article. It should be clear what this sentence means, yet many editors shift its meaning to apply to specific articles. They probably mean "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of indiscriminate collections of information", which is not what the policy states, though it could be argued that is what it implies. I said that this article does not clearly fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> because it falls under none of those 8 types of articles listed there.

This list could be of interest to anyone who likes any other game/anime/manga, to compare and contrast the item types and functions. If someone mentions "Pokétch" anywhere, anyone else could think, "that is the stupidest name I have ever read, let me look on Wikipedia to find out what it is".

<dd>well then kinslayer perhaps you should start slaying <i>any</i> article that disusses strategy of games, <i>any</i> article that disucusses advanced mathematics or physics... the point i'm trying to make is that just because <i>you</i> don't see a use for this article isn't enough of a reason to delete it. Pomte's example is exactly why we have articles here on wikipedia about subjects like this. Many lay people out there rely on wikipedia to give them accurate information on a wide variety of topics. We like to say that these things belong elsewhere, but that's not true. A person outside the pokemon community wouldn't have the faintest idea of where else to look, and even after doing a google search might get stuck with a fansite, that not only tells them what a poketch <i>is</i> but then proceeds to tell them certain things like when you get each feature - strategies on how to best utilize your poketch and a wealth of other sutff they don't need to know about. For example, "The poketch's step counter ability will help with breeding, just remember to place the egg next to someone with Flame Body so it'll go faster." Now this poor person is more confused then ever. And that's if use a fansite, if they go check gamefaqs, they'll need to sift through LOADS of irrelevant info to find what they want. Wikipedia's purpose is to serve this layperson by giving them the most concise relevant information and then provide helpful external links if they wish to delve into the nitty gritty. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 19:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kinslayer, do you really believe that "collection of items of information" means the same thing as "collection of information about items?" I thought you were joking above (and it is an amusing twist of wording) but having repeated it now it sounds like you are serious. Is it because they both use the word "item" (in different senses) or because it is "information"? Obviously encyclopedia articles can have information. Anyway, to reiterate: calling an article "indiscriminate" is too vague, and in this case I simply don't understand what you mean. <i>Why</i> is it indiscriminate? <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 14:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>there is very good reason for this article beyond "b/c it's in Pokemon" The most apt description for this would be a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">glossary</a> rather than <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">list</a> because it's a grouping of items that <i>are</i> oft referenced throughout the 500+ articles on pokemon in general (e.g. the article on <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feebas.html" title="Feebas">Feebas</a> really shouldn't delve into the detail on <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9block.html" title="Pokéblock">Pokéblock</a> that this article already has - i.e. it shouldn't talk about what generation it was introduced in, or it's relation to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_items_de9a.html#Berry-related_items" title="List of Pokémon items">Pofin</a>). The items themselves feature not only in the video games, but also the anime and manga... so would a condensed version (that would still prolly need to be split off per <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>) be put in at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a>, or <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28manga%29.html" title="Pokémon (manga)">Pokémon (manga)</a> (ok... so manga prolly wouldn't have such a prob fitting in relevant parts)? Some items (e.g. <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9_ball.html" title="Poké ball">Poké ball</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9dex.html" title="Pokédex">Pokédex</a>) are notable enough to have their own articles and would definitely then deserve <i>some</i> sort of page to be grouped on as per the guidlines at WP:LIST. Some items, like TMs and HMs, require too much explanation to be easily mentioned within the VAST amount of articles that wikilink to the applicable section.

<dd>Based on the cultural significance of Pokémon and the importance of collecting items within the hugely successful video games, card games, movies, television series(es), manga, etc., I am arguing that yes, we can afford an article on some of its most salient items. The article is not perfect, but that should be addressed via cleanup, not by deletion. Do you think that scholars fifty years from now will never be interested in this stuff? People already write <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=pokemon&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=pokemon&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">thousands of scholarly articles</a> about it.

<dd>Peregrine has hit the nail on the head. Those voting keep feel that for the topic to be comprehensive, a list like this is neccessary, while those voting to delete see it as a bunch of trivia thrown on a page b/c "I LOVE EVERYTHING POKEMON". Personally, I'd argue the same points for a page discussing the the different mushrooms/shells/bombs in the mario franchise or some other RPG. The only one to actually say <i>why</i> they feel the list is indiscriminate has failed to provide a counter argument to points presented against them. If AMIB has more, i'd like to here them. as an extension of description for the purposes of aiding and understanding <b>sources independent of the subject</b> are <i>not</i> required as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - primary sources.

<dd>at wikipedia when we refer to an <i>indiscriminate collection of info</i>, we are referring to the idea that that not every last bit of information (my hair color) needs to be included. This becomes extended to topics in fiction-based media by only including information that is essential to understanding the concepts introduced, and information relevant to the notability of the subjects. For example, if I were to say that, "<a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardevoir.html" title="Gardevoir">Gardevoir</a> has a special attack of 125 which is higher than that of the recent legendary <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arseus.html" title="Arseus">Arseus</a> at 120, but it is still outclassed by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alakazam.html" title="Alakazam">Alakazam</a> who's base special attack is 135..." then proceed to tell you how it would still be possible to obtain a higher sp. att stat than some Alakazam due to EV training and that most beneficial nature is something that lowers attack... see where this is going? It would have been enough to say that, "Gardevoir have among the highest Special Attacks in the Pokemon universe." We need to be <b>disciminating</b> in the <i>kind</i> of info we include, we <i>should</i> be <b>selective</b> in what gets included because most information (like all of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s past phone numbers) is not relevant enough to the topics at hand. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 18:41, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We exclude the specific stats of Pokémon because they are of interest only as guides for users with specialist interest.

<dd>We discuss the number of HMs because it changed througout the history of the game and to answer the question of "Well what changed?" we divulge that info, it's also important that we give the names because some were removed and then readded later on. This is information of interest to anyone who wants to know how things changed throughout the series. While it would be reasonable to include this info under "Changes" on each generation's main page, this offers a concise overview that allows the reader to take it all in without having to load the five different articles. The same argument could essentially be made for the Pokegear/PDA/Poketch stuff, and I've already explained the reasoning behind the Pokeflute. <i>Specialist interest</i> is a term that could be used to AFD massive amounts of articles on Politcs, Mathematics, and Physics. We exclude numbers for all pokemon because they'd add no <i>value</i> to the article. A lay person can't take anything away from that number other than "Oh, that's high" or "Oh, that's low" and additionally <i>we'd</i> have to tell them it's high or low, so there's no reason having the number anyways - we can leave the # out and they still learn just as much. But you leave out description of an item that is oft mentioned - Pokeflute is used to wake up <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snorlax.html" title="Snorlax">Snorlax</a>, Pokeflute's function was duplicated in the anime in Snorlax's first appearance, Pokeflute has an incarnation in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_5587.html" title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap_e9dd.html" title="Pokémon Snap">Pokémon Snap</a>, Pokeflute was replaced with Pokeflute radio station in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_d777.html" title="Pokémon Gold">GSC</a>, utilizing the Pokegear's (oh wait, what's that?) radio, Pokeflute was later replaced by Blue flute in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_beef.html" title="Pokémon Ruby">RSE</a> - leave it out and the reader's understanding of the item is drastically affected. Indiscriminate info would include how many steps of ash you need to get the Blue flute, what route the guy is located on. For a lay reader it wouldn't matter if we said 100 or 200 steps, Rt. 10 or Rt. 15 - their understanding of Pokeflute isn't affected so it's extraneous, irrelevant info. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 07:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>at the risk of alienating those who agree with my position, AMIB is right, it would be more constructive to say <i>what makes</i> the topic notable.

<li><b>Keep, but trim a little bit further</b>. "Listcruft" is certainly not a good reason for deletion, especially standing on its own.

<li><b>Delete</b> Moreso than not being able to cite the video game, how do you set the threshold for what is or is not a valid reference? I'm a contributor to Kingdom of Loathing's KOLwiki and I run into that problem all the time. Many times references are either wrong, utterly obscure to he point of being dubious, or refer to a reference in another work that is actually a reference to some other original (the citing of The Simpsons' parody of The Shining as the source of the "Heeeeere's Johnny!" quote comes to mind, a reference to a parody of a reference to The Carson Show!). In addition, I would venture if you look hard enough anything could be a reference to anything. Notable homages between noteworthy and 'important' works are one thing (to bring it back to The Simpsons again, The fact in one of the Treehouse of Horror episodes they had Bart dressed as Alex from A Clockwork Orange is somewhat meaningful, given his character), but crufty minutae are another entirely; let alone entire pages of them. If anything this sort of thing belongs on a pop-culture Wiki, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 18:44, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, with reservations</b>; I definitely understand the need for the dab page as such, hence my vote to keep. However, my reservation is why should it be a list instead of an honest dab page? "Preferencial treatment"? Why not just alpha the dab and there's be no special treatment given? Definitely see a need, but maybe this should just be reworded to sound more like a dab than unintentionally like a space-waster. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Eagles</a><a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a027.html" title="User:EaglesFanInTampa">Fan</a><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a54a.html" title="User talk:EaglesFanInTampa">In</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EaglesFanInTampa_5426.html" title="Special:Contributions/EaglesFanInTampa">Tampa</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a54a.html#Your_signature" title="User talk:EaglesFanInTampa">(formerly Jimbo)</a> 01:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

In calling it a "list", this quite possibly might be the only thing bringing this to AfD anyway; I honestly believe by naming this page any of the redirects, <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_888.html" title="Route 888">Route 888</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_888.html" title="Highway 888">Highway 888</a>, or even Roads designated 888 without the "list" moniker will end all this unnecessary discussion and allow this obviously necessary dab stay in tact, as this is the only dab I know of called a "list" in its title. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Eagles</a><a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a027.html" title="User:EaglesFanInTampa">Fan</a><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a54a.html" title="User talk:EaglesFanInTampa">In</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EaglesFanInTampa_5426.html" title="Special:Contributions/EaglesFanInTampa">Tampa</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEaglesFanInTampa_a54a.html#Your_signature" title="User talk:EaglesFanInTampa">(formerly Jimbo)</a> 02:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Which is why I suggested "Roads designated 888" or less wordy-sounding, "Roads numbered 888".

<li>Or "Highways numbered X," highway is only capitalized due to being the first letter of the article, not because it is a proper noun.

<li>There's already a naming convention in place for these types of articles (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highways_numbered_1.html" title="List of highways numbered 1">List of highways numbered 1</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highways_numbered_2.html" title="List of highways numbered 2">List of highways numbered 2</a>, etc...), so this article is no exception. If an NC has already been established, just like after the conclusion of <a href="../../../s/r/n/WP%7ESRNC_8601.html" title="WP:SRNC">SRNC</a>, then we shouldn't change it without a suttle discussion.

<li>I am aware of the naming convention, just not sure it is the best naming convention. I said to move all of them, not just this one. I believe we are discussing it right now, nothing has been changed yet and nothing will be changed until a consensus is arrived at. Since the naming of the articles has been brought into question, it needs to be revisited, if consensus says to leave them where they are, so be it. As a side note, I have never seen a dab page titled "list of ..." I never intended for highway to be a proper to be a proper noun, just like every other word at the start of a sentence or article title, it is capitalized, which doesn't make it a proper noun. Let us also remember that this is a dab page, we are not saying that State Road A1A in Florida is Highway A1A, it is just a guide for those that aren't familiar with every state's naming convention for it's highway. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 20:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Roads numbered X or Highways numbered X would be okay in my book. I'm just not sure mere removal of the words "List of" will eliminate the problem (to the extent that such a problem exists). It is something I'd be willing to try if there's consensus to do so, though.</li>

<dd>I'm sorry if I put words in your mouth, Holderca. I was just pointing out the distinction.

<dd>Plus, the current NC would even set a notability criteria for these <i>highways</i>. Just look at all of the other dab pages...the criteria for inclusion is already defined. Even more so, these dab pages are extremely popular pages—if one were to move all of these dab pages, there would be a whole lot of double redirects from existing redirects not being fixed yet! <b><a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVishwin60_16dc.html" title="User:Vishwin60"><font color="orange"><span style="background-color: #303030">&#160;V</span></font><font color="cyan"><span style="background-color: #6E6E6E">6</span></font><font color="white"><span style="background-color: #8D8D8D">0</span></font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/s/User_talk%7EVishwin60_4197.html" title="User talk:Vishwin60"><font color="black">VTalk</font></a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vishwin60_bdca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vishwin60"><font color="blue">VDemolitions</font></a></sup> 23:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand, how does "List of highways numbered X" set a notability criteria that "Highways numbered X" does not? Double redirects is not a valid argument for keeping the status quo.

<li><b>Keep</b> per practicality. This is a disambiguation page, even if it does not have the best name. Disambig pages are judged by two criteria only: NPOV and usefulness. I find it hard to see how this article could be POV (the highway numbered 888 I live next to is better than yours!?), so only the issue of usefulness is left. I find it to be useful. Three of the 5 links are redlinks, but that aids the development of new articles. It's not like this is a list of personal driveways; these are major regional or local transportation routes. I am tempted to suggest that the article be renamed, but I'm having difficulty thinking of a good alternative.

<li><b>Delete</b>: There is no reason for this to article to exist. I don't understand how people can sit there and say having this article doesn't hurt. It hurts plenty because its contributing to the flood of useless information on wikipedia. This isn't even trivia, it's just someone trying to classify human beings based on musical tastes and clothing style. So what if people in your scene are dressing the same? That doesn't warrant the necessity of making a Wikipedia article about it. StabmasterArson 08:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From both Wikipedia and a simple Google search, tt is evident that both you and Woggly are in deep dispute with anything that is associated with Israelbeach. Therefore your judgement is highly subjective. As said above, statements are made about Israelbeach and he does not even have an opportunity to comment and defend his ations. The three of you should disqualify yourselves from any votes of articles that have any association with one another. Also, to discredit the Israel News Agency is to discredit the Israeli government as they are the ones who screen and issue press credentials. You both also discredit Google and Google News which are used as a measures of reference here at Wikipedia. Let's focus on the 200 + global Internet gurus attending Kinnernet, the majority of "keep" votes above and not on personalities and politics. Thanks. Mhltv 13:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Kinnernet is a vital conference that allows industry leaders from internet related fields such as site building, blogs, forums, social networks, chat rooms, instant messages, P2P and search engines to meet and develope ideas and stratagies. It is an important meeting discussing the future of the internet,and needs to be covered. There are industry leaders coming, and to say the conferance is unimportant is to say the participants are unimportant. Co-founder Yossi Vardi does not invite the press so as not to distrub the particpants, but the conferance's importance is evident from the Times article and the hundreds of blogs. I hope this is not evident of Wikipedia's recent anti-Israel shift.Greendesk 18:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>the expected number depends on the field. Every subject and every specialty is different. There is no numerical formula, but I find that numbers help guide the discussion. Faculty at law schools tend to publish a lot, but as mentioned he isn't at one. Some but not all of the articles are in good journals. On balance, I think he's N as a lawyer who also makes contributions to the journal literature in his special field. And I am not happy with the argument, hesnotasgoodasmeandimnotinWP.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure if we're reading the same google news search. Your link shows that Alan W. Clarke was part of a team of attorneys for a handful of medical malpractice lawsuits and one representing an appeal for a man who burned down a seafood restaurant - of the ten cases listed none appear to be relevant to the death penalty and none appear to be notable (as in argued before the Supreme Court). In the past two decades he has argued less than a dozen cases before appeals, circuit, and federal courts. And he wrote a single guest commentary for the Salt Lake Tribune in 2005 - he is not a staff writer.

<dd>I took a look at some of the Willie LeRoy Jones stuff - interesting case. But the writeup in the NYT is 250 words on page 18 - not exactly a high profile article. If anything Alan W.

<li><b>Summary</b> Here's a summary of the facts that have been discovered about Alan W. Clarke<s>what we've agreed on so far</s>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>He is a lawyer by profession who has a non-law faculty position at a non-selective four-year college</li>
<li>In the past two decades he has published about twenty papers, some in prestigious journals. None appear to be seminal works.</li>
<li><s>He has been involved in unknown capacity</s> Alan W. Clarke was one of three attorneys whose firms filed an unsuccessful stay of execution on behalf of Willie LeRoy Jones<s>with a death penalty case for Willie LeRoy Jones</s>. Mr. Jones' execution was covered with a 255 word article in the 1992 New York Times. Alan W. Clarke was not mentioned in the NYT article.</li>
<li>One of his papers was mentioned as "further reading" in a Ninth Circuit Court Handbook.</li>
<li>In 2005 he wrote an op-ed piece for the Salt Lake Tribune</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as I can tell, no one other than Alan W. Clarke has written even a short summary of Alan W. Clarke's work. He has not been referenced as an "expert" in even local media articles (other than his op-ed piece) and he hasn't even yet published a book. In terms of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> this still appears to be a no-brainer for <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean that <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Valley_State_College_4029.html" title="Utah Valley State College">Utah Valley State College</a> is "non-selective"? And please don't give the impression of voting outside the nomination's statements. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm simply saying that UVSC is not a "prestigious" university on the order of <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> schools or CalTech. In other words, one cannot argue notability on the basis of institutional association alone.</dd>
<dd>And I am not trying to give the impression that we are "voting". I am trying to sum up what we know so far to keep discussion on track. Our last thread devolved into a discussion of Willie LeRoy Jones and some NYT article that doesn't even mention Alan W. Clarke. None of this proves notability. What I am looking for is someone to provide positive affirmation that this guy is notable. From the facts that folks have dredged up on the internet he clearly is not notable in terms of any wikipedia policy, guideline or criteria. I am not interested in opinion or voting. I am interested in someone digging up an independent fact or article that this guy is more than a junior faculty member at a "pretty good" college, of which there are thousands in this country, few of whom are notable by wikipedia criteria. If someone can prove me wrong I'm happy to let him stay. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 08:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I missed the part of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> that states a professor must teach at an ivy league and a college like <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Valley_State_College_4029.html" title="Utah Valley State College">Utah Valley State College</a> is of marginal academic value. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 09:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying it does. There are some discussions on the talk page that propose that any Harvard professor, for example, is automatically notable, an argument with which I personally do not agree). I am trying to dissuade any argument of this fashion by explaining that UVSC doesn't quite fit in this category. Have you uncovered any further evidence of his notability? <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 09:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>About different universities'</i>: it is really simple: a full professor at a major research university (or any major law school) is presumed to be encyclopedia-worthy, because nobody gets to such a position without having publish a major body of work. Associate professors at such universities might or might not be notable, because they almost by definition have published a smaller amount of important work, and Assistant Professors there analogously a only sometimes notable for the amount of work they have yet done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>At other universities and colleges, the standards for a full professor are somewhat lower, and that is why they are not considered major research universities. Individual faculty there often do major work, and then they are notable; but since not everyone has done so, we must also check the notability of the work. (but remember that he is an Associate Professor. and an associate professor at Harvard Law School might still not yet be notable). We use the ranks and the nature of the schools in order to avoid having to do OR ourselves to determine what the academic world thinks of them.</dd>
<dd>So being from UVSC is not a negative factor. There are excellent reasons why absolutely first rate people might choose to teach there, or at smaller colleges as well. It's just that we have to see something distinctive in its own right. I am not saying he isn't. I said "keep" at the start, and I continue to do so, because I regard his specialized legal writing as notable, especially the reliance made of it in the handbook for his Circuit. He is, in my opinion, a notable figure in the struggle against the death penalty, a very honorable choice of career. If it should happen the consensus doesn't think he's important enough yet, still he will probably do much more in the next year or two, and there's no prejudice against an article at that time.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you think that a single reference in the Circuit manual constitutes notability I won't try to argue with you. I would prefer to wait until he does more to add him to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - As far as sources go, the first two debunk the idea of child cannibalism, essentially discussing blood libel and the second two go to the same isolated incident.

<dd>I don't deny that incidents of child cannibalism have occurred. But unless someone can point me towards a source that isn't an isolated incident or simply blood libel, I don't see how it can support an article by itself. As is, I'd be inclined to delete the paragraph about the Chinese, since there's no source material supporting it. That's blood libel.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunky_Rice_06d5.html" title="User:Chunky Rice">Chunky Rice</a> 16:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Deleting the paragraph about the Chinese because there's no source material supporting it is justifiable. However, I should comment that <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a> is an encyclopedic topic and so the claim should be kept if the source is notable EVEN IF the claim is really blood libel. We can report on blood libel if it is notable and sourced. (strange concept here but, if a major publication or notable scholar reports child cannibalism then child cannibalism is notable and should be included as encyclopedic EVEN IF it is generally considered to be untrue, ). The critical thing would be characterize it as blood libel and provide a source for the characterization.</dd>

<dd>Sure, but if the incident is untrue, shouldn't we put it in the blood libel article instead of one called Child Cannibalism? That's why I don't like this article.

<dd>It could be in both articles. One question is whether it adds anything of value to this article. An even more important question is whether the value of this article hinges on the blood libel and whether the blood libel is noteworthy. I don't think the value of this article hinges on the blood libel (and thus the article can be kept on the basis of other points such as the mention in Hannibal Rising). I'm not sure whether the alleged incident is noteworthy. I'll leave that for others to debate. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 19:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't get it. The article you listed about the Noida serial murders doesn't concern cannibalism in the slightest. One of the oddities is that (1) no source has yet been produced describing child cannibalism as a phenonemon (let alone using the term), and (2) no specific instance of child cannibalism has been documented in the article, talk page or AFD page. I'm sure somebody at some point has eaten a child, but given the content we have, it seems ridiculous to have a WP article. And what is this claptrap claiming "cannibals prefer children?" Is that a fact? Do you have a source documenting it? This whole affair seems silly and demonstrably un-encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 01:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the original author. Not sure how to recopy an article to Wikitravel. They have a Saipan page, but nothing like a "dive sites of Saipan" page. Will try to make one. Article is based on several years' pro experience on Saipan-- and a bit of tourist literature. Sorry for the breach of Wikipedia etiquette. Live and learn. Same defects may apply to my dive descriptions for Palau and Guam.Sethnessatwikipedia 09:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Sorry, but I disagree. The article doesn't seem to be promoting anything... it talks about Chrismukkah.com in an attempt to establish a point about the term Chrismukkah. Also, this goes beyond <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, because although the specific term Chrismukkah may be new and not in heavy usage, the practice of fusing Christmas and Hanukkah in interfaith households is a legit topic, and I'm not sure where else it should be covered (though if it's already discussed elsewhere, redirection may be an option). This does need cleaning up and sourcing, but in my view that's an achievable goal for this article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not the place for things that are not notable yet but may be in the future.

<li><b>Reluctant Keep.</b> However much this article reads as a vehicle for the website and however much the very concept turns my stomach, there's been mainstream media play, and that much has been sourced. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The assertion that this is a valid holiday is false and while there are references, the content of these is more to talk about interfaith households and December holidays, not to reinforce the use of the word "Chrismukkah." Let's not confuse the concept of households celebrating both Christmas and Chanukah with thinking that there is such a thing as "Chrismukkah" beyond a few pop culture references. I might be inclined to keep, only if the article were changed significantly to mention that the term exists specifically as a pop culture refence as per <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html" title="User:Jengod">jengod</a>'s note. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 12:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The problem is that "I don't agree with it" isn't a valid reason to delete an article; our job isn't to weigh in on the advocacy issue or whether this is a "valid holiday" (and how is that defined?) one way or another. The issue is whether the subject meets verification and notability standards. Unfortunately, it does. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Understood. But the article as written, with the intro, "Chrismukkah is the modern-day merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah as celebrated in interfaith households where one parent may be of Christian heritage and another parent of Jewish heritage." is so far removed from an accurate description of what it should be that the entire intent of the article is missing. It should be: "Chrismukkah is a term coined in some early twentieth century popular culture references to describe the merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah as celebrated in interfaith households where one parent may be of Christian heritage and another parent of Jewish heritage." and take it from there. What I object to is the creation of an article as a statement of fact when in reality -- see comment from <a href="../../../s/h/l/User%7EShlomke_975f.html" title="User:Shlomke">Shlomke</a> below, we are really just taking a neologism and declaring it to be an actual entity. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 01:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Loosely associated facts about <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> (monotheistic, at least) in popular culture. Don't be fooled by the title: this is just a list of trivia.

<li>Really? Not sure what article you're looking at but the one I see doesn't put any such restriction on its subject matter.

<li>For example, these quotes from the article make it pretty clear to me: "Monotheistic <b><a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a></b> as depicted in popular culture." (the first sentence), "People who have portrayed God:" (the second sentence) and the section title "God's appearance". It says nothing that implicitly includes weird things like swear words, and everything it says seems to imply excluding them. Plus, there is the article title. How can a swear word be a "depiction" of God? Read the dictionary entry for "depiction" if you don't understand this. Furthermore, if you think the article can be cleaned up by tightening the definitions, go ahead. Cleanup is not equivalent to needing to be deleted unless it is very serious indeed. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry if I seemed smarmy, but with the particular argument that you were using, it really did seem as if you didn't understand the definition of "depiction". Otherwise, how could someone argue that a fictional character in a movie who exclaimed "God damn" was depicting God? I tend to assume that in most cases more explanation of my position is better than less, as it lessens misunderstandings and because statements like "it should be obvious that X is true" come off as rude. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 23:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here's how it seems ill-defined to me: there's a world of difference between "Actors who have portrayed God," which is very specific and probably reasonable, and "Depictions of God" which seems to include just about any reference to God. Okay, I don't see how swearing would make it on the list, I don't think it's THAT ill-defined, but just about everything else would be okay: ads with a picture of God, any dialogue with God, religious visions, God-like figures that are like the monotheistic God but aren't necessarily exactly the same, poems about God. I'm not exaggerating here, and I believe that references much like all of these already exist in the article. There are discriminating topics one could write, but this isn't one, and it doesn't serve as the basis for one either. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I see no reasons given to delete it so far that are actually grounded in Wikipedia policy (at least, not in any way that I interpret it). Furthermore, the article needs organization, but it looks like the inclusion criteria as defined in the article itself is defined well enough that the article can't grow beyond bounds - God as a character seldom appears in media. After all, this isn't Religion in popular culture it is <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depictions_of_God_in_popular_culture_7468.html" title="Depictions of God in popular culture">Depictions of God in popular culture</a>, limited to the monotheistic God at that. Claiming that articles including the words "in popular culture" are inherently bad isn't arguing according to Wikipedia's deletion criteria, and neither is saying that the article needs improvement.

<li>Just to respond to this one point.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As others have said, this is an important and interesting area of research, and is notable enough to deserve an article. Unfortunately, it is also a very young area of research, and it will be next to impossible to write a good article about it for a few years yet. I say that having a poor article consisting mostly of links is better than no article at all on this topic.

<li><i>Addendum:</i>the <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE_472a.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a> has a journal devoted to ubiquitous computing: <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/pervasive/" class="external text" title="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/pervasive/" rel="nofollow">Pervasive Computing</a>, which is <i>"A catalyst for advancing research and practice in mobile and ubiquitous computing"</i>. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Computing_Machinery_40e2.html" title="Association for Computing Machinery">ACM</a> lists the journal <a href="http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?linked=1&amp;part=affil&amp;idx=J822&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?linked=1&amp;part=affil&amp;idx=J822&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM" rel="nofollow">Personal and Ubiquitous Computing</a> as one of its affiliates. The fact that the two major professional/academic societies for computing in the US consider "ubiquitous computing" a field worthy of a journal would seem to be a pretty good indication that the field in question is sufficiently notable to have an article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 01:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> They got some news coverage, which is something I'd like to see for more anime cons, but with just 200 people (and no reference cited for that), it doesn't appear as if there is anything all that notable about this convention for its first year.

<li>Although this article may have more content and be better written than many other articles on Wikipedia, that isn't a valid reason to keep it. I could write an article with a complete and detailed history of my mousepad collection...but that doesn't mean it's notable. Likewise, I could write up the entire biography of my grandmother in a well-written article, but there would be no reason for such an article to exist. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 20:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>To discuss in a reasonable matter is understandable, however we all know why one's grandmother and mousepad collection aren't notable; yet, in judging this, and many other entries, I've noticed that people have forgot this clause on the notability page where notability is "not synonymous with "fame" or "importance"". In addition, "notability is generally permanent." However, the comments so far seem to forget these basic stalwarts of wiki. While I myself will not vote on this matter, I remind those that will and have thus far, to remember this and to forget your own individualized concepts of notability, as far too many articles have been discarded due to what I can only imagine are personal perceptions, and not wiki's standards, which of course all editors are supposed to abide by. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillermz_dd6d.html" title="User:Millermz">Millermz</a> 04:05, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It appears that Daigacon has the appropriate independent sources to be considered notable; aside from the ones already cited, it's also listed in AnimeCons.com, which is known as a reliable source by several people here as per previous discussions. I'm confused as to why this is almost immediately being discounted in the first 'delete' comments. I admit that the lack of a cited source for its attendance number is hurting the article right now, but that can be fixed by either finding a source, or the con organizers reporting the number to an established reliable source. Presuming it's correct, <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling_Green%2C_KY_8315.html" title="Bowling Green, KY">Bowling Green, KY</a> is not large town. By comparison, it's about the same size as <a href="../../../e/a/u/Eau_Claire%2C_WI_a896.html" title="Eau Claire, WI">Eau Claire, WI</a> (the city were <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Brand_Con_e17e.html" title="No Brand Con">No Brand Con</a> is held). One notable item of No Brand Con's existence in its first year is its relative geographic isolation from major urban centers and other large cons, which made it an attractive alternative for those with limited access to transporation, limited funds to attend such a massive event, or parents who don't feel comfortable lettig highschoo-aged kids travel without their direct supervision, or to an urban area at all. The existence of SugoiCon was mentioned, but its distance from Bowling Green is comparable to the distance from Eau Claire to Chicago (where Anime cons such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Central_afe2.html" title="Anime Central">Anime Central</a> are held). The fact that there's a viable alternative to the "big con" in the same state that's more geographically convenient for anime fans I believe IS notable. I also have interest in fan-run conventions, comparing them to ones run by corporate backers, even not-for-profits. A con run by a school (or University) might not be notable in and of itself, but the fact that it was a three-day event with industry guests (as opposed to a day-long club event with no industry guests), and that got this kind of news coverage should be. The local news sources certainly thought it was notable enough, which seems to me to be all <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> requires. I'm worried that the critera for being added to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">List of anime conventions</a> is somehow bleeding over as criteria for this article to exist at all. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 18:24, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Beyond that, no one is contesting whether this con <i>exists</i>. What we're disputing is its notability. That there are fans who prefer small intimate conventions is evident, but that doesn't make those cons notable any more than the small towns in which I prefer to vacation over famous and giant resorts. Most cons run the weekend, most cons have some manner of VIP guests, and the local newspaper and TV station usually can be counted upon to give the costumed weirdos thirty seconds of air time or a photo on page 12. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm aware of what the argument is, which is why I'm trying to drive home the point that the article's cited sources are the sole required basis of its notability as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. No one has yet argued against this point since I brought it up. The principal contention against notability seems to be that SugoiCon is a larger convention in the same state. What makes Daigacon notable in this regard is that, unlike SugoiCon, it is actually both planned AND held in Kentucky; the fact that Sugoicon is held within the Kentucky state boundaries is incidental to the layout of the Cincinatti metropolitan area (details on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_anime_conventions_7040.html#Kentucky_Question" title="Talk:List of anime conventions">talk:List of anime conventions#Kentucky_Question</a> page). DaigaCon would then only be superseded in this regard by <a href="http://www.omgcon.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.omgcon.com/" rel="nofollow">OMG!!Con</a>. However, again as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, "Notability is not synonymous with 'fame' or 'importance'." I suspect the lack thereof does not exclude notability. I believe a "by fans, for fans" convention -- planned, funded, and successfully run outside the auspices of a sponsoring corporation or unrelated not-for-profit organization -- should always be considered notable. This is possibly, also an argument for an OMG!!Con article not to be deleted, should one ever be created, however I can find no information on the Tri-State Anime Promotion Society apart from what exists on the convention website. Given the name (and if supported by the proper sources), Daigacon might very well be the first anime con held in the state that was planned and held by Kentucky residents. That's pretty darn notable. ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 18:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In which case you're not paying attention to the arguments. SugiCon was noted as a larger convention, but none of the several editors suggesting Delete have done so using the fact that SugiCon is a larger con within the same state as any manner of argument, let alone a principal one. Our contention is that despite who runs it, where it is run, how many cons are held in the hosting state or any other factor irrelevant to our argument, a first year convention with only 200 attendees is <i>prima facie</i> non-notable, on that basis and that alone. Heck, I ran a SF university con with numerous pros as guests (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Drake_28a8.html" title="David Drake">David Drake</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Yolen_ee03.html" title="Jane Yolen">Jane Yolen</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Brust_49f1.html" title="Steven Brust">Steven Brust</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Clement_2744.html" title="Hal Clement">Hal Clement</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Delany_7801.html" title="Chip Delany">Chip Delany</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanith_Lee_4f76.html" title="Tanith Lee">Tanith Lee</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Shwartz_0d6b.html" title="Susan Shwartz">Susan Shwartz</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Hunt_52be.html" title="Walter Hunt">Walter Hunt</a> among many others), attendance never less than 500 and which went on for over a decade, and I don't consider the 1990s NotJustAnotherCons notable. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> very much explicitly cited SugoiCon's proximity and larger attendance as the basis for his vote. Attendance alone is not sufficent criteria for proving notability, as evidenced in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_No_Brand_Con_2b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/No Brand Con">AfD nomination</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Brand_Con_e17e.html" title="No Brand Con">No Brand Con</a>. On the basis of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, the multiple independent sources already available in the Daigacon article prove that it is notable. Despite the responses I've accrued, no one has attempted to refute this point. Also, I did as you suggested in your <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">user page</a> and took <i>five minutes to follow up a few Google hits</i> to realize <i>the genuine notability of the subject.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Daigacon" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Daigacon" rel="nofollow">results</a>). The report by <a href="http://www.fansview.com/2007/daigacon/da2007.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fansview.com/2007/daigacon/da2007.htm" rel="nofollow">A Fan's View</a> is fairly significant, given that they traveled to this first-year con over two more established cons (<a href="http://www.animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1070" class="external text" title="http://www.animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1070" rel="nofollow">NohCon</a> and <a href="http://www.animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1185" class="external text" title="http://www.animecons.com/events/info.shtml/1185" rel="nofollow">Naka-Kon</a>). By contrast, there is no report on file for No Brand, a larger and more established (and supposedly more notable) convention. I'm wondering how many more sources must be gathered before this convention's notability is acknowledged, but here are a few just to make sure: <a href="http://www.digitalfrontierplus.com/?p=822" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalfrontierplus.com/?p=822" rel="nofollow">Digital Frontier Plus</a>, <a href="http://www.redtram.com/redirect/news/51895868/" class="external text" title="http://www.redtram.com/redirect/news/51895868/" rel="nofollow">Anime News Network</a>, and <a href="http://yaplog.jp/yunmao/monthly/200701/" class="external text" title="http://yaplog.jp/yunmao/monthly/200701/" rel="nofollow">yaplog.jp</a> (I don't know how many U.S. Anime cons, regardless of size, make news in Japan, but I'm guessing not very many). ~ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> 20:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Initially, I thought this would be a fruitless argument, as you can probably tell by my caustic comments above; however, <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> is able to make points much more fluid then I, and indeed since I'm not the only one who feels as such, I believe it's only proper to vote as I, one of many contributors to wiki (of course), sees fit too, and that's with saying as I did previously, that notability is not based on personal perception, as much as it is based on the wiki notability principle that, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, "notability is not synonymous with 'fame' or 'importance'." (How many times must this be repeated?) In the end, permanency is one of the issues, and I've already seen evidence of planning for a 2nd convention (as mentioned with the Full Effect article, <a href="http://www.fulleffectmagazine.com/?q=node/354" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fulleffectmagazine.com/?q=node/354" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>), and also, after doing some light research, I've found that there will be a MSN.com Japan article about Daigacon as well, and as <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanOrange_39c0.html" title="User:SeanOrange">SeanOrange</a> said having Japanese media focus on a convention is probably rare (plus another reference, right?). Aside from that, I believe that we should recognize a decently-written, and especially fairly well-referenced article when we see it since if the scrutiny against Daigacon were to continue, then we'd have legitmacy to take almost all of the convention pages down because when I clicked randomly through the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">List of anime conventions</a> page I didn't come across one that didn't have a references problem (if not more), and I clicked on about 15 different convention's pages!

<li><b>Keep</b> i believe this is a valid article of a growing sub-culture around essex schools. whilst only documented around one or two schools, it in fact has a much wider range, relating to possibly ten-twenty essex and local schools, which with each school having an average of 1000 pupils, this means this article could relate to potentially 10,000-20,000 people, which makes this article very relavent to wikipedia, because with 10,000-20,000 people it could quite easily spread alot further.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.248.106.65 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.248.106.65_7f53.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.248.106.65">contribs</a>) 20:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> If google results are so critical in determining the future of an article, let's use google to get a definition of a language. Here's what it said: 'a systematic means of communicating by the use of sounds or conventional symbols; "he taught foreign languages"'. I think that Og therefore constitutes a language. Also, several people have justified their "Delete" by saying that is is very closely derived from English. If you wrote that you are either ignorant, stupid, or seem to have forgotten that the language we are speaking in, and indeed most other European languages are very closely linked to and is directly derived from Latin, which itself is very closely linked to and is directly derived from Ancient Greek. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParonomasia_869c.html" title="User:Paronomasia">Paronomasia</a> 18:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - Well, it's definitely "stubby." In the US, the SEC requires all owners of at least 5% of a publicly traded company to be named in the 10-K report. Should be put into the <a href="../../../1/0/-/10-K_0263.html" title="10-K">10-K</a> article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a common shorthand way of referring to this rule in such things as stock prospectuses. New investors will definitely be looking this up atr one time or another. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 20:38, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merge and redirect then, I think. It's only significant because of the SEC <a href="../../../1/0/-/10-K_0263.html" title="10-K">10-K</a> requirements. I'll be happy to do the legwork myself is somebody puts it on my talk page after we get consensus. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 20:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just to clarify but the Guild Wars 2 mention *is* related to the "Eye of the North" article since the information for both of these articles that have been put up for deletion (Eye of the North and Guild Wars 2) came from the same source (which you do acknowledge Barek, but then say that there's no link between them, which confuses me). What I don't understand is how information on Eye of the North is considered factual and Guild Wars 2 isn't when they're both from the same source. Either information for both these topics get deleted (since I did vote the Eye of the North article to be deleted, but someone decided to merge instead, which is reasonable with the proviso that what is being said in the source is true) or they both get merged - seems simple to me&#160;:). Having one deleted and another accepted wouldn't make much sense at all (unless someone could find secondary sources to back up information) --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 21:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - my reasoning was based on secondary information. At the time of the initial vote, "Eyeofthenorth.org" was a registered domain of NCsoft, while there was no secondary confirmation for "Guild Wars 2" (that domain is held by a third party who uses it for purposes which ArenaNet actively discourages - ie: they're selling in-game currency for real money). As of this morning, new information has surfaced: per the <a href="../../../u/s/p/USPTO_ba6b.html" title="USPTO">USPTO</a>, NCsoft has trademarked both the names "Guild Wars: Eye of the North" as well as "Guild Wars 2". So, given this new information I am changing my opinion to "merge" (was previously delete). --- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarek_1f41.html" title="User:Barek">Barek</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarek_9542.html" title="User talk:Barek">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barek_3728.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barek">contribs</a>)</small> - 00:07, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suspend judgment for two more days</b>.

<dd><i>Further comment:</i> I feel uneasy about this article, since it seems to have attracted quite a bit of vandalism, and I'm not sure there are responsible editors sticking around to monitor and maintain it. Without them, the article may well sink right back into vandalism, blighting the neighborhood. I have the same concern (although a bit stronger) with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sarina_State_High_School_2e01.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarina State High School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarina State High School</a> where I voted to delete.

<dd><i>Comment:</i>It is not relevant that it has more info then other school articles. The point is that there is no way to get the info sourced. Where would you find published info on some random high school?

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This nomination is bad form. A two-day-old article by a new user should not be deleted so soon. Wait a couple of months, I say, or at least ask the creator to improve the article. And by the way, the instructions for deletion call on editors to FIRST consider other options, such as tagging the article. This may even qualify as biting the newbies. I've left a message on the article creator's talk page, but I can't see how this nomination would do anything but depress and discourage someone who's probably new to Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC) (made minor edits <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC))

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Georgia state Department of Education awarded the school a "2006 Platinum Award for Greatest Gain in Percentage of Students Meeting and Exceeding Standards" after the school improved its percentage of students meeting and exceeding state testing standards. With 92.84 percent of students at or above state standards, a gain of 3.32 percent over the year before, the school improved more than 99.54 percent of middle schools in Georgia, according to the state's "report card" for the school.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Simply by looking at the school's Web page, Mr. Z-man could have seen that the school was given a platinum award, and a simple Web search led me to the school's "report card".

NO claim of notability at all, and it is a middle school - even in other areas of Virginia, middle school articles are generally considered non-notable (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kempsville_Middle_School_abe5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kempsville Middle School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kempsville Middle School</a>, for instance).

<li>Why would a list of characters discuss a species generally? Do you mean simply mentioning the notable boss charrs (which would be fine)? Are you suggesting that that list be expanded in scope to describe the species also? If so, you should note that that list is an increasingly potbellied mess of unattribut{ed,able} information. It would almost be better to create a new List of Guild Wars species to describe the major species in the game, such as dragons, dwarves, mantled knights, and so on. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 11:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A "List of Guild Wars species" would quickly grow just as bloated - there are many major species; but at least as many minor ones.

<li>I am unfamiliar with the Guild Wars game series, but no, I did not mean simply mentioning the major bosses. It is possible to organise a "List of characters" article by species, with brief descriptions of each given at the outset. In any case, I only intended to suggest the merger of the "Charr Description" section (although I failed to specify that initially) and not of the entire article. A List of Guild Wars species article may be appropriate, but perhaps unnecessary given the existence of the list of characters. Also, it would not at present be viable as there seem to be no articles for other species (incidentally, how many are there?). Maybe the best option is, in fact, to <b>delete</b> and simply add a one-sentence description in some relevant article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>weak keep</b> The organization is noteworthy enough (though in my opinion as a source of confusion) that an article is warranted. So is a rewrite, to indicate that the work it sponsors is--speaking generally--fringe science. (I assume that is what the previous ed. also intends). I also suggest renaming to a less generic title. However, since it has had no stable location, I'm having a hard time thinking of one.

<p>I think that the article must not be deleted because it is about a promotion in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, and Wrestling Promotions in Portugal are surely few, maybe one, two in the maximum, and the information about one more can only be good for all the people. The "independent reliable sources" don't exist, because, there are no "news" services that looks into the Wrestling, like in the States. Here in Portugal there are no <a href="http://www.pwmania.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.pwmania.com/" rel="nofollow">PWMania.com</a>, and others that do the same.

<p>OK do whatever you want. Only because you don't know anything about it, doesn't mean there are no other people that know it. You only wanna know about WWE and TNAs and other stuffs like that. "There are no independent reliable sources". There are so much things in Wikipedia that don't have "independent reliable sources", but, it is still in here, and no one say anything about it, because what?, because or you don't wanna know if it is true or not, or simply if it is from the United States or England (or simply because it is from a country that speaks English), it is "good", and what I see here is that all of you are with envy about what I do, and what WWA is: something that you are never, but never, be or work for.<br />
Please delete it, because I can't stand to see my name and my company name in here, a place that I liked but now is filled with jerks and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother%27s_boy.html" title="Mother's boy">mama's boy</a> that think, they know everything that there is to know when they know shit. I'm done whit this. Bye suckers, and if I see one of your kind in here, Portugal, the land of sand and endless beaches, I'll kick you in the balls.<br />
<b>PS:</b> Don't forget to pay Portugal a little visit, and spent damn lot of money to stay here for a week, where I live, for free, like a king. And by the way, I'm sorry for you mom.<br />

Some of the references (like <i>Energism</i>) can't be found in Worldcat and presumably don't exist, while others (like <i>Emile</i>) exist but have nothing to do with Grosz. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacepotato_5fc6.html" title="User:Spacepotato">Spacepotato</a> 00:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The ideas in the article are true, as far as I can tell. Just because it isn't immensely popular on the internet doesn't mean it isn't verifiable or notable. Some rewriting may be in order to put the article in a more easy-to-read language, but the article should be improved rather than deleted. The fact that it is odd (which I agree with completely) doesn't solely mean it should be deleted. I say, just give it time. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuitarmankev1_663e.html" title="User:Guitarmankev1">Kevin</a> <a href="../../../g/u/i/User_talk%7EGuitarmankev1_802c.html" title="User talk:Guitarmankev1"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a><a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuitarmankev1_Polls_391e.html" title="User:Guitarmankev1/Polls"><sub>(MUSIC)</sub></a> 03:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>very weak keep</b> Whether the ideas in the article are true has nothing to do with this discussion. To me, it seems like an excuse to give a scientific veneer to palm-reading. But 3000 ghits is enough for pseudoscience (or popular psychology, whatever), unless all of them are blogs--which seems possible . This is an essay, not an article, and needs to be rewritten, and also must have some third party sources <i>to show notability outside the blogosphere. .

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> - along the lines of Petesmiles above. Vanity publishing and original research going on here, an academic essay with lots of refs. Also the talk page promises: "<i>More articles under this topic will be published by the publisher of the Psychodiagnostic Chirology magazine Dr. Henryk Rostowicz and the editors Mr. Eran Marese and Mrs. Judith Rostowicz</i>". The user is Henryk Rostowicz by the way. Is the pedia a publishing venue since I last looked?

<p><b>Comment</b> - It seems to me that the basis of many of the keep voters is a quick look at google, followed by an argument along the lines of '..It's the subject of enough discussion and published material to make it notable. Obviously this article needs to be rewritten..' to quote Freshboy. I think we should try and discuss the <i>article</i> that's been written, not the subject itself. I would take the 'obviously needs to be rewritten' bit to mean that this article is not up to scratch at the mo. and given that it hasn't been rewritten, p'raps that's really a sensible reason to delete it?

<li>This is analogus to something like "Web 2.0" - Game 3.0 is not a generation of hardware, software or any particular technology stack. Game 3.0 is the new era of thought surrounding a collection of proven industry concepts that have become a percieved standard. All of the current console and game console software creators efforts have contributed to what the industry has come to expect from game 3.0. Jmcdaniel3 04:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>All - I would like to add to the discussion - the article states "Game 3.0, a phrase coined by Sony Computer Entertainment, refers to a perceived 3rd generation of console based video game experiences or design ethics."

<p>I would also like to point out that the users who marked this for delete while tagging it as marketing material are doing so based on a personal agenda, and not for the concern of Wikipedia article content quality. You can examine the users 'talk' pages and clearly see that the users calling this marketing and spam have their own strong opinions about the industry in question that this movement doesnt mesh with.</p>
<p>At the end of the day - wether they personally like this or not, it is a phrase coined by SCE and any press resource can validate that.</p>

<dd>an industry leader (Sony computer Entertainment) coining a phrase is very notable. As the article mentions all platform vendors have contributed to this Game 3.0 perception. The article itself is not orignal re-search, the article just needs to be flashed out more as the industry evolves more.

<dd>No offence intended - but I think you need to go take some business classes and then come back and try to have this debate. Being a market leader is not defined by near-term sales. TD there are over 190,000,000 SCE platforms sold worldwide. No other console manufacturer in the history of the business has sold as much. This entire debate about this article being deleted really concerns me about Wikipedia's ability to maintain accurate content. When you recommended this article for deletion upon personal agenda (which can be proven in the article edit history where you edited the article text to reflect your personal bias the same time you recommended it for deletion) you did not take the time to understand basic concepts - for example, here you demonstrate that you have no idea what being the market leader means. If these kinds of antics carry on, and over long term people can delete and modify factualy content on Wikipedia to reflect their personal biases, the content on Wikipedia will become more and more worthless and only reflect the concensus of the users who remain and enjoy this kind of sophmoric information control (example: the act of you suggesting this article be deleted because of your personal biases) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jmcdaniel3 (<a href="../../../j/m/c/User_talk%7EJmcdaniel3_d846.html" title="User talk:Jmcdaniel3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmcdaniel3_e4ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmcdaniel3">contribs</a>) 13:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>ok so now that you have signed-in - how does that page prove a bias? Game 3.0 is not about SCE digital entertainment content platforms. Where is the bias? and bias twoards what? I will agree that "4D" is total marketing speak. Again Game 3.0 is analogus to things like "Web 2.0". It isnt really a consumer level topic but rather a software design/project management centric topic. A term does not have to be a consumer friendly bit of info for it to be Wikipedia worthy. I can clearly understand the reaction by consumers. Game 3.0 has been present in the industry since Microsoft standardized the XBOX Live! service across its software library via developer/publisher design ethics discipline. Now that the market leader has coined the phrase - it can be considered notable, and not just casual speak used by developers/designers behind the scenes. Jmcdaniel3 00:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually Game 3.0 was in use since about spring 2006 - and not even within SONY but at Microsoft when considering next gen Windows game experiences. I tried to research that for wikipedia to help the cause of this article, but there is nothing publically available. Oh well - I suspect the Wiki community will delete this and we will just re-create it when more uses become public. No matter when the article is re-created tho, SCE was the first to publically and in the eyes of the world media coin the phrase. (that fact seems to be what has caused such a retailiation against the article by SCE haters). I guess Wikipedia also doesnt have many members from the game development community voting here otherwise we would see far less deletes and more strong keeps. I still think that the article is based on the FACT that SCE coined the phrase - again SCE is the global market leader and I would think that what they do/say is notable. Especially when the phrase was born at the largest software company in the world (Microsoft). Jmcdaniel3 14:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>We cannot have information on Wikipedia that can't be verified.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Whoever Jmcdaniel3 is he is completey dead on with the article and his statements on the origins of the term. Sony did beat Microsoft to the punch when it comes to using this term in the public eye. The term has been used within Microsoft and MS Game Studios since early Q1 2006. It is all over internal meeting minutes and discussion records that will never be released for public consumption. Since this page looks to be made up of Sony haters, I will poke fun and say that if Sony is going to say Game 3.0 when positioning their products, they need to actually release software that can be considered Game 3.0. 66.193.54.250 16:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
