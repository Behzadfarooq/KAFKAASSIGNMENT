<dd>I have shortened the Human World entry and attempted to make it more neutral. It is true that, after many discussions with its Science Advisors (one of whom is Paul Crutzen), Earth &amp; Sky invented the term Human World, and it is true that Earth &amp; Sky posted this entry. But I would not call this Original Research or Vanity. In fact, popularizing science - creating simple concepts from more scientific ones, so that people can understand - is our job in the world as a science radio series. I would add that the words Human World are heard frequently on our radio series, which is broadcast to 6 million daily around the world (9 times daily on Voice of America, for example). Many people do hear the words Human World. They might wonder what they mean. If they searched on Wikipedia, it would be grand for them to find some explanation. Thank you.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This article meets notability guidelines... And the nominator is right- it is a notable marketing ploy, and there is valid information in this article that explains this.

<li>That would be the point of the AfD: an article about an inactive fictitious (not merely fictional) person "Gary Troup" is not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a well-written article on a subject that is clearly internationally notable. However, I will say that sometimes I think a distinction needs to be made between subjects that are notable <i>today</i>, versus subjects that are historically notable and worth being documented, encyclopedia-style, for future generations. Though I definitely agree that the Troup article is worth keeping for now, my answer would probably change if asked 20 years in the future, by which time this article may have been merged into some other <i>Lost</i> article as little more than a footnote. But for now, as an article about what is effectively an in-process current event, where we have to maintain large amounts of information because we don't yet have the lens of hindsight to determine which parts are most important, I say yes, keep. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 19:58, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Very informative, very well written. Also important to note that it is <b>not</b> a foregone conclusion that Troup or <i>Bad Twin</i> exist solely as a "marketing ploy," especially given the recent revelation of the significance of the Valenzetti Equation via the Lost Experience. Even if that were the case, however, it wouldn’t necessarily disqualify the article, as it still contains pertinent information. Do not delete. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by BeingClever (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__BeingClever_2e9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ BeingClever">contribs</a>) 23:21, 17 September 2006.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting article that seems to have enough separate content to justify its existence separate from the Lost Experience.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia has other articles on fictional (or fictitious, despite the fact that one delete voter doesn't seem to know these are synonyms "per" Websters, OED, etc.) characters, and this is a character that we can assume to be canon until otherwise stated, despite the fact that they're never seen on screen. Thus neither the fictional/fictitious metric, nor the notability metric apply (consider the fact that "Gary Troup" has, all in all, probably more visibility on amazon, barnes and noble, etc., than the Hanso Foundation, which does have its own article) had in the show, and you will understand why this is also a bunk idea. All in all, the deletionists seem to have no real reason for this at all. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 20:16, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I know how the code works, I've been using WP for over a year and run a couple of <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaWiki_8838.html" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> websites. You're making an orthogonal argument. My point is that this is not a subject which should have been an AFD fix. AFD is for controverisial fixes, where someone may object to it. Nobody is objecting to fixing this one. I tried to boldly take the quickest fix (redirect) and allow for a perfectly proper cleanup Speedy or Prod later of the redirect. It would actually be within existing policy to speedy the darn thing, except that it's under AFD right now, and I'm not an admin (yet? to date?). A bold redirect followed by later speedy redirect delete is perfectly acceptable as a suitable action here. Don't waste people's time on AFD with non-controversial cleanup tasks which are clearly compliant with community consensus and WP policy... just do them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm sorry, but we cannot have an article in an encyclopedia which is a) unsourced, and b) claims that Bob Dylan, David Bowie, the Beatles, Jay-Z, The Byrds, George Harrison, Black Sabbath, Dizzy Gillespie (Dizzy fricking Gillespie!) and countless others had songs featuring cowbells.</p>
<p>There are two references in the entire article that verifies two songs. The rest is taken from "The Cowbell Project" (I'm assuming, since that's the only external link, which itself is just some crazy fanatics home page, and cites no sources).</p>
<p>I know people are fond of their internet memes, and that's fine. You can have your articles on Star Wars kids and Numa Numas and whatever. That's ok, I don't have any problem with them at all. But honestly, can you call yourself a good wikipedian if you want an article in an encylopedia that claims that Jimi Hendrix used cowbells.</p>

<li><b>Delete, or significantly pare down to what is sourced</b>. - I could see how this list could possibly be useful if it were properly sourced, as any list of songs featuring any particular instument could in theory be useful. However, "The cowbell project" doesn't look like it can be considered a reliable source. They have a place to submit songs to add to their list that looks like anybody could add, verified or not. I can see that being an external link but not a source. As of right now there are 2 songs that have a source which I haven't checked to see if they are reliable or not. Assuming they are, that would leave this entire article with 2 songs reliably sourced, which would make this article useless. If someone wants to find a reliable source for each song on here though I would welcome it and would reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 04:07, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Maintain</b> I don't know the proper format for this... so I'm just following the lead here. I have been a long-time wikipedia reader (and active promoter!) and have to say that I have referenced this article twice. Unfortunately, this time it looks like it's marked for deletion. The reason I referenced it was because I was listening to Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name" and you can definitely hear the cowbell between times 0:10-0:20 of the song (and possibly more later) and I wanted to see if it REALLY is cowbell! Sure there may be ONE reference, but honestly... how many idiots do you need 'to change a lightbulb?'--metaphorically speaking. I like how everyone is saying that certain songs definitely DON'T have cowbell... but how many people actually loaded up their playlist and listened for it? And BTW <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't exclude lists... it doesn't even mention lists. Why?

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no encyclopaedic topic "songs featuring cowbells"; the definition of "featuring" is arbitrary (how many cowbell beats in the drum tabs before it counts as featuring?); no reliable sources for this information have been identified after two previous AfDs, making "keep and source" a null vote on the basis that previous attempts to keep and source have resulted in keeping and <i>not</i> sourcing; the likelihood of verifiable sources existing for most of these are slim anyway since the listener can't tell the difference betwen a sampole and a real cowbell, and full scores are rarely published these days, so any song in the last couple of decades is goign to amount to original research pretty much by definition.

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>Still Delete</s> Content sourcing issues normally don't apply in AFD, except in this case there is no physical way that the article could ever hope to be properly sourced. Is that a cowbell I hear or a jamblock? Is it a sample? Is it someone banging on a roadie's head? If you look at the written logs that come out of a recording session, about all you ever see are: "Track 1: Guitar 1 Track 2: Guitar Fills Track 3: Percussion Track 4: Bass... etc.". They don't keep records of whether or not a cowbell was used. Also, if you really get right down to it, this article isn't so much a real scholarly work as it is an attempt to keep a meme alive. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 21:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article is definitely not scholarly; it's part of what I think of as the more playful side of WP. It is, however, a list that establishes a notable connection between the referenced items. It would be notable in a very small way, but for the SNL sketch generating a little more interest in the previously overlooked cowbell. Sure, it's a little crufty, but you only have to read the talk page and the comments in the various deletion discussions to see that it generates interest and discussion. Your point about the difficulty of sourcing the article is well taken. However, I could see Rolling Stone asking Mick Jagger if that was really a cowbell in Brown Sugar. Alternately, the article could disclaim that the songs contain cowbell or a cowbell-like instrument and use the songs as the source - as we might use a book as a source for a quoted phrase.-<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 22:11, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - whether or not you agree with this approach it is an entirely respectable theory. For example, see <a href="http://www.scu.edu.au/schools/gcm/ar/ari/p-jellis00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.scu.edu.au/schools/gcm/ar/ari/p-jellis00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an independent review of the theory with a range of references. If someone wants to find out about the theory then they may turn to Wikipedia for an objective review and would be rightly disappointed not to find it. If it is considered that this article is too POV then the answer is to put in balancing views not to delete - an AfD is not a cleanup crew. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 23:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please allow me to respectfully opbject: the "entirely respectable theory" is <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_research.html" title="Action research">Action research</a> (reviewed in your link), which is branched in wikipedia into <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Science_cca3.html" title="Action Science">Action Science</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participatory_action_research.html" title="Participatory action research">Participatory action research</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative_inquiry.html" title="Cooperative inquiry">Cooperative inquiry</a> by the same user:Zhumaf, who is no longer present to defend his essays. All of them look like "brand names" of particular authors, who, for obvious reasons, do not agree on the term (each wants glory for him, naturally). I have serious doubts in some other articles of the above list, but this one was the most evident candidate for deletion. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>By the way, user:Zhumaf got 3 or four essays already deleted independently , if you inspect red links in some of his abandoned contributions. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As a corroporation of my POV above, a minute ago, while browsing web, I noticed the comment by a David Tripp about action research: <i>"makes the field appear chaotic, ill conceived, undisciplined and very suspect to many outsiders"</i> ... and ... <i>"It is interesting that the difficulties mentioned above do not seem to prevent everyone else from inventing their own, or supporting particular definitions of others. "</i> <a href="http://www2.fhs.usyd.edu.au/arow/o/m01/rtripp.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.fhs.usyd.edu.au/arow/o/m01/rtripp.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. The essays of Zhumaf hardly bring order into this chaos. Clearly, the overall topic is improtant, but it seems the research is novel (or, rather, re-emerging from old roots), and encyclopedia article must start with reputable, published overviews, rather than from individual books of proponents, each of which pushes his own right. There are thousands of books on theory of management, planning, job hunthing and other advise. Which are notable can decide only independent peer review, but not authors of these books (and surely not wikipedians who retell these books in their words). <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Last but not the least, I see some comments to the point that "action inquiry" is a new buzzword for the process of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planning.html" title="Planning">planning</a>: <i>"The idea of deliberately seeking and analysing information is essential to all action inquiry</i>, which is exactly <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_acquisition.html" title="Data acquisition">data acquisition</a> component of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planning.html" title="Planning">planning</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I also find it highly suspicious that the technique is described in terms of the types of language and activities used by a high school student. A mathematician would talk about e.g. vectors or matrices, not "columns of numbers", for example, and use more precise language than simply saying plot points and see what the result looks like. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 18:19, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Chaos-copy indeed. A method for seeking the inner patterns produced by the infra-harmonic structures held by the pristine Platonic relations between a column of numbers and a copy of itself with the top whacked off.

<p>redundant but exception to general merge procedure</p>
<p>This is a duplicate article, and so merging would be the standard course. This particular page seems to be an exception to the rule. It has become rather large and a merge would be a nontrivial endeavor. My main concern is that a merge will never take place.</p>
<p>The content of this page would not seem to be so different from the original as to add significant/salient info. Meanwhile, both pages exist in competition. I suggest that the article be deleted in order to remove the redundancy from Wikipedia, and dedicated editors save off this page's contents to their hard drives and trickle the info into the main article. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 04:39, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just because Google has forgotten the game doesn't mean Wikipedia should forget it, too. Search <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dare_to_Dream_29ca.html" title="Dare to Dream">Dare to Dream</a> while you're at it; you won't get too many hits related to that game either. A Wikipedia article can keep an obscure piece of history from being forgotten. Somebody looking for information about the game will be thankful for a wikipedia article about it.</p>
<p>There was already a wikilink to Dragon's Plight in Bleszinski's article, which told me someone else wanted more information about the game, too. There is no "coverage" in that article; there is an empty link to it and passive mention of it. I just filled it in. It's part of Cliff Bleszinski's history. It was the first game he designed, which makes it as notable as Dare to Dream (his second) and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_Jackrabbit_e2ed.html" title="Jazz Jackrabbit">Jazz Jackrabbit</a> (his third).</p>
<p>I suppose the article could be merged with Dare to Dream's entry (the gameplay sections do overlap), but it doesn't seem necessary as they discuss two different games. Odds are someone else will come along and recommend the article be split. And it doesn't belong in Bleszinski's article because it's not about the man himself, it's about the game.</p>
<p>If someone else recommends Dragon's Plight be included in Bleszinski's article, or merged with Dare to Dream, I don't mind doing that. The information doesn't need to be deleted!--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 18:14, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I wouldn't mind <b>Merging</b>, but all three articles are currently <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unsourced</a>. Just because it's hard to source doesn't mean that people should ignore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which <i>is</i> policy (I've heard the line "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not policy" many times, and let's just say there would be massive problems, starting with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, if notability was totally ignored. However this is less relevant to this article, mostly because of the harder sourcing, which <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> actually does take into account.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:36, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'n not advocating totally ignoring WP:N, but I have a hard time with nominations that use WP:N as their sole justification. Of course you're right about WP:V though. And after I think about it a bit more, I think <b>merging</b> the information from the three articles into the main, (including verifiable sources of course,) might result in a better article overall.

<ul>
<li>Merge which three articles into which main article? There is no main article. Unless you mean merging Dare to Dream, Dragon's Plight and Bleszinski's entry into one? Why? These are separate topics; why merge them into one article when two articles are about games and one is about Cliff Bleszinski? Dare to Dream is part of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Games_285b.html" title="Epic Games">Epic Games</a>'s release history and deserves its own page. Dragon's Plight I can understand the proposed merge because it's not Epic, but it's still a game Cliff Bleszinski designed. Doesn't that make it notable in some way? And if anyone wants sources to the articles, just play the games. All the information I wrote is taken directly from the games. In fact, all the info on <i>all</i> the pages I've read about Epic's early games is sourced from the games themselves. What else do you need?--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 00:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I'm proposing merging into the Bleszinski article. WP:V requires that articles be supported with credible third party (outside of Wikipedia) sources, preferably by other websites that you can link to, however books, newspapers and such can be used as well. The "just play the game" arguement doesn't stand because that would be considered <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> which is also against policy. Trust me, while I can appreciate your love for the games, and I can sympathize with your desire for them not to fade into obscurity, Wikipedia is probably not the best place to champion that cause. When you can show some kind of independent coverage, then you can reintroduce the separate articles. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 04:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I understand the reasons for merging Dragon's Plight into Bleszinski's entry. The game was probably only important to <i>his</i> history, not gaming as a whole. Since I'm outnumbered, go ahead and <b>merge</b> it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how it can fit. Maybe someone can think of a way to make it relevant to the designer and not to the game itself? I just wouldn't want the information deleted entirely. It still deserves a place, and if that place is not in its own article that's okay.--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 23:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Minimal merge</b> - Most of the information here isn't worth merging, as its either a direct copy or not overly important. Just a couple mentions of the game in its creator's bio is enough. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 23:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Stupid edit conflict... Wanted to add these questions: I understand the need for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. All encyclopedias follow it, all of them need it, but isn't there a limit? Would someone who has watched, say, a newly released movie need to cite extra sources when writing a new article about it? Where would you go for an external source for a movie's content? Is using "watch the movie" as a source for its plot and characters considered original research, too? Where can you go for external sources on that? If that's origial research, then what's left to write about the movie? Same for games, especially old ones. I'm not trying to start a hair-splitting debate, nor do I disagree with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but don't some things have to come from the article's subject itself?--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 00:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For a movie, especially nowadays, there is LOTS of information one can cite. IMDb, critic reviews, often the studio itself will have a website. Critics can do original research. We can't. All of our information has to come from outside Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 12:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Understood. Beginning to see the problem and a better idea of how wikipedia works. Though I do have the game, I searched again and found <a href="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?name=Palace+of+Deceit%3A+Dragon%27s+Plight%2C+The" class="external text" title="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?name=Palace+of+Deceit%3A+Dragon%27s+Plight%2C+The" rel="nofollow">this site</a>. And also <a href="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=2082" class="external text" title="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=2082" rel="nofollow">for DtD</a>. You can't get any more third party than these&#160;:-) Is this credible enough? Both are very obscure games... I understand the logic behind the policy, it just seems wrong that the game itself can't be a source when it seems logical that this is the best source to use for information about the game (or movie, or anything).--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 00:03, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The movie or game itself absolutely can be used as a primary source, as long as the information is verifiable by a reasonable adult without specialist knowledge.

With reviews to back up the info on both games and reinforce their place in Bleszinski's history, does Dragon's Plight deserve its own article now? DtD and Dragon's Plight may not be notable to the history of gaming but they are notable to the author, and if these sources can be used to justify the information, they justify a Dragon's Plight article in Wikipedia. I recognize the difficulty of verifying information like this. I'd like to find something in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> to use as a source, too, but at least this is something. I hope the sites I gave above can also be used to help Cliff's entry, too.</p>
<p>I believe it's all notable. Anyone looking for information on these games and/or on Bleszinski's early career will be glad for some details about the games themselves. (Now with a source to back the details up.) If the concensus is still to merge, at least there's a source to tie the game to the creator's history. Maybe it'll allow more than a one-sentence passing mention in his bio. But please reconsider merging in light of these potential sources.--<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagenar_1a86.html" title="User:Tagenar">Tagenar</a> 02:10, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. But the state of public education in general is an issue and the budget cuts slated in Toronto a HUGE issue - for all involved. The Liberals just lost yet ANOTHER by-election in Parkdale/High Park based on this issue and a provincial election is coming up in about a year. Funnily enough, the Toronto Municipal Election page lists the Mayoral and City Councilor candidates but completely ignores the the Trustees. Why is it that people think they are unimportant? Sorry about the impassioned plea - but I'd vote for the article to stay - it's not advertising when you're looking to keep kids in school and feed them while they're there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Maverick9901 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maverick9901_1261.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maverick9901">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Maverick9901 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maverick9901_1261.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maverick9901">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<p>Substub on utterly non-notable fringe political group. Statement "It cannot be determined whether the society has been active since 1997" gives you an idea of its influence. Fishal 07:03, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> American Monarchists are probably always going to be a fringe political group, but the movement does exist, and fringe doesn't automatically equal non-notable. The fact that the group hasn't been active since 1997 doesn't really do it for me either -- historical politics can be encyclopedic. I see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Constantian+Society%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Constantian+Society%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">2790</a> Ghits for the group, (admittedly a lot from what appear to be "monarchist" websites.) They apparently publish a journal, which means both their existence and the substance of their views are verifiable. Monarchism, as a movement, is rather outdated, but hardly non-notable (as many monarchies still exist worldwide.) Wikipedia has an article on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchism.html" title="Monarchism">Monarchism</a> that lists modern pro-monarchy groups including this one. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 17:05, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per those advocating deletion. The article duplicates those already written and shows no real prospect for avoiding that. It would need to be "redone" to within an inch of its life to be kept, methinks. Additionally, the views of users of another site shouldn't have any place in determining whether <i>this</i> site keeps or deletes something. They're welcome to present their case, which they appear to have done, but ultimately even if 100% of them want it, it needs to pass muster here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 10:51, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have yet to hear a lucid argument for why it needs to be renamed to "List of level editors for computer and video games." That name is unnecessarily unweildly.

<p>Not notable to you, but notable to others... Notable to the people who write and those who read it... Obviously Vince McMahon owns a large stake in this website so other wrestling federations are forced to be removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.1.135.63 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.1.135.63_97d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.1.135.63">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As far as I know, neither <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_eb93.html" title="WWE">WWE</a> nor any other professional wrestling company holds any stake in the Wikimedia Foundation. If what you say is true, then there would not be any articles on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling_e010.html" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a>. Wikipedia precedent has stated that as a rule, E-Federations are non-notable. In fact, one of the larger interfed websites, RoughKut is currently going through an AfD nomination, which they will probably lose. I know it sounds cliche, but if we allow your E-Fed, we have to allow all the E-Feds out there, even the ones that suck. I feel your pain, I'm an E-Fedder too, but Wikipedia is not the place to advertise for your site. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 21:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fiddle Faddle makes a good point. It's a national award, and she won it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In addition to the prestige of winning a national competition, this is worthy of an article because it involves a sector of music that is limited and underrepresented on the web. Considering the amount of internet coverage received by pop music competitions (such as X-Factor), it seems only fair that a choral contest of this standard should be treated with the respect it deserves.--Teawithauntie 19:03, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Appears to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The award is an important and coveted one.

<li><b>Delete</b> That no-one has yet created an article about the award itself, winning it shouldn't really be notable for us either.

<li>That reasoning (above) is fallacious. We do not need an article about an award to know that the award is notable. All we need to know is that the winner won the award. If we did not (yet) have an article about baseball we would still be able to tell that Babe Ruth was somehow notable for being reasonably good at it (I even know that as an Englishman with no interest in the sport). I do like your thoughts (below) about creation of an article about the award, and then creating a list of winners.

<p>There have been no significant edits to the article in months. The article has few sourced statements, and it cites information out of context. Statistical data from questionable sources are deliberately slanted to make India look like the poorest country in the world (a patently false claim). There is no precedent on wikipedia to single out the poverty situation of any country as an article, while statistics show that poverty situation in some other countries are far worse than in India. Why is India being singled out? Plus, the pictures are placed out of context and have no text in the articles to support their placement. As it stands (and has stood for months), it is offensive. There is a better article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a> where the matter of poverty in India can be put in at length so this article is also redundant with a POV title. <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 14:25, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Like I said, my main issue is redundancy. There is no need to have two articles <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty_in_India_b565.html" title="Poverty in India">Poverty in India</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a> both of which discuss the same things, so much so that RF copied text from one and put it in the other. What good does that redundancy do? There is no content in poverty article that isn;t already there in Standard of livin article so merging is unnecessary. Only fair solution is to delete the poverty article or merge the Standard of living article into the poverty article.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 23:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

Poverty exists in many countries including the United States. Poverty is a major problem in the Less Developed Countries (LDCs). It's a key focus of the United Nations.

<li><b>Keep</b> on principle--not necessarily an endorsement of the current article. Poverty is within the scope of standard of living in many ways... but, it also is an important social issue and for that reason as much as any other it deserves its own article. How is poverty and vagrancy (related) treated under law? I know the issues comes up in the U.S. and it has to in most countries. Also countries have interesting ways of dealing with poverty... favellas in Brazil, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Poverty in India exists and is a well-documented issue. It is possible to write a NPOV, verifiable and informative article about it. That is the only thing that matters.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, obviously. There are a million academic studies of poverty in India. Four-fifths of the people who live under the poverty line as defined by the UN are Indians. The current article is appropriate, not terribly unsourced, and NPOV. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_Living_in_India_a2e8.html" title="Standard of Living in India">Standard of Living in India</a> article contains several other details, as well as a summary of this article. This is exactly how things should be. The standard of living could be measured by several different indicators, including for example life expectancy, female literacy, degree of political freedom etc., and not just income-related indicators. See <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Development_Index_c588.html" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a>. POverty is strictly defined as income below a certain level, that level being defined as the minimum required for the purchase of a diet with enough calories to maintain average bodyweight. The two things are not the same. Frankly, this argument is ridiculous and this should never even have been brought to AfD. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: From one perspective, you're right. The debate is whether to delete this particular article about Poverty in India. However, deletion inhibits writing and editing. If we believe the topic is worthwhile, it is better (IMO) to take the current article and expand it than to delete it and hope that someone will write a better article from scratch.</dd>
<dd>Merging is certainly one solution. Another is to trim the "Poverty" section in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_Living_in_India_a2e8.html" title="Standard of Living in India">Standard of Living in India</a> down so that it is a summary of this one and then expand this one. This article certainly needs expansion. There are many, many ways in which it could be expanded. One would be to describe the government programmes in greater detail. If we delete every article because it doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards now, then we will tend to limit Wikipedia. If we work to improve articles, then we will grow Wikipedia in both quantity and quality.</dd>
<dd>I recognize that the opinions expressed here are just my opinions and represent an "inclusionist" philosophy rather than a "deletionist" philosophy. Nonetheless, those are my thoughts and you may adopt them or reject them as you will.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>:As of this moment I am doubtful as to whether the article should be deleted or not. It would seem that the better solution is to shorten the poverty section in the standard of living article and expand the poverty article and cross-reference when needed. To all those who have been following this AfD (and any other interested parties) I would be very happy if you would peruse the poverty article, as well as the standard of living article, and fix any redundancies by cross-referencing.Thanks.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 22:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Since your essay fails miserably in its attempts to rebutt Silensor, saying it rebutts it is very poor english. A reader might get confused, and think your essay has any merit whatsoever (when it obviously does not). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>a) That is a matter of opinion of whether or not it rebuts his essay well (and I note that at least one school inclusionist seems to have had somewhat positive remarks about my essay so). b) You seem to confuse the meanings of many words related to logic. In this case you are confused about the difference between logic and grammar. To use the canonical example "Green dreams sleep furiously" is a grammatically valid nonsensical sentence. It might make sense not to make grammatical critiques when you don't understand what grammar is. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>And furthermore, I have already asked you to explain what issues you have with my essay. So far you have not mentioned a single one. If you have any substantive issues please explain them.

<li>The article was originally based on the interpretation by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Elliot_Friedman_7cd1.html" title="Richard Elliot Friedman">Richard Elliot Friedman</a> in his books about the old testament. Specifically "Who wrote the Bible?". That can be cited as a source, but I'm not sure of any papers in this area, though I imagine there are some. The later text added and opionions I don't know about.<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulianonions_8fe0.html" title="User:Julianonions">Codec</a> 07:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Friedman is a reputable source, and generally represents the mainstream in the academic community (indeed some of his books are officially required reading - or at the top of official book lists - for theology courses at several well respected universities). You can also find similar views in well respected commentaries (e.g. Peake's) and encyclopedia's (e.g Jewish). Shirahadasha seems to be on a campaign to delete all <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_criticism.html" title="Historical criticism">historical-critical information</a>. It seems to me that Shirahadasha is more interested in pushing a literalist POV than in encyclopedic content - i.e. that this nomination is in bad faith. The title - <b>Snow White Miriam</b> - is the normal title under which literature discussing this section of the Torah (i.e. the one involving Miriam turning snow white as a result of her comment) is found. Google is hardly an appropriate arbiter of what is or isn't the case - if Shirahadasha would care to look in theology libraries in works where this section of the bible is discussed, you will find the title quite frequently. In addition, I should add that the topic is not viewed as controversial in academic circles; in much the same way as the theory of evolution is not controversial in academic circles (and describing it as such would be utterly inaccurate), but some people (e.g. Shirahadasha) may have an issue with it. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 17:14, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Elliot_Friedman_7cd1.html" title="Richard Elliot Friedman">Richard Elliot Friedman</a>, <i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i>, at page 76, does indeed mention, under the heading "Snow-white Miriam," this narrative as reflecting "the depths of the antagonism between the priests who identified with Moses {either as their founder or ancestor) and those who identified with Aaron." It also notes that the story "is usually left out of the sunday-school curriculum." Much else said in the current Wikipedia article remains unsourced and should be deleted unless verification can be provided. Given these circumstances, would recommend <b>merging</b> the sourced material with <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miriam.html" title="Miriam">Miriam</a>, making "Snow-White Miriam" a subset of that article, and presenting Friedman's view (as such) in a subsection on <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_criticism.html" title="Biblical criticism">Biblical criticism</a> perspectives on the story.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It really needs to be sourced better but this is a biblical episode that has been commented on by a number of people is worth keeping.

<li>Comment To give an example using a known non-event, a search on brown+jersey+reagan", gets nearly 3 million Google hits, but "brown jersey reagan" gets no hits.

<p>The result was <b>No consensus defaulting to keep</b>.

It expands on the smaller mention, as is not uncommon. I also note that there is a sizable list of media mentions worldwide. The delete reason "Practically every Palestinian civilian killed by the IDF qualifies as 'notable'" is an affirmation of keeping the article.

I did not bundle this article for deletion with the others, because this article is much more extensive, as there was an IDF investigation into this clearly tragic death. However I still believe this article should be deleted for the reasons below.)</p>
<p>While Iman's death is obviously tragic, I believe this article should be <b>deleted</b> due to the following concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I don't think Iman satisfies any of the criteria at WP:BIO, including being <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">"the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works...(Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage)."</a> The article's coverage, and the references, are really about the <i>incident</i> of Iman's death and the subsequent investigation, not about Iman herself. The article includes almost no biographical details about Iman, and such details would indeed seem out of place. (Compare with the discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Allen_Smith_0a1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith</a>.)</p>
<p>(2) Violates <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a>. The incident of Iman's tragic death and the subsequent investigation are already covered in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Days_of_Penitence_4e53.html" title="Operation Days of Penitence">Operation_Days_of_Penitence</a>, an NPOV and extraordinarily thorough day-by-day coverage of that operation. The nominated article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> of the other article, as it <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">"highlight[s] negative or positive viewpoints or facts."</a> Specifically, it highlights the negative fact of the accidental shooting of a Palestinian child by the IDF. Widening the context even further than Operation Days of Penitence, hundreds of children on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been killed, by suicide bombers and by the IDF, just since the second intifada began in 2000, and this unfortunate, broader topic is also already well-covered in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_and_minors_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_5e00.html" title="Children and minors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Children and minors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. The nominated article devoted entirely to Iman's death takes it out of the context of both Operation Days of Penitence and the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:07, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's take part (2) of the nom first. An article on a particular notable effect of a war or police action does not constitute a POV-fork, even if it is centred facts which <i>could be viewed</i> as negative. I do not see anyone arguing, for example, that <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_massacre_fb94.html" title="My Lai massacre">My Lai massacre</a> is a POV-fork of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. An article entitled Unnecessary Civilian Casualties of Israel's attack on Gaza, now, would perhaps be a POV-fork. For this to be true, the <i>particular</i> icident has to be notable.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>About part (1) of the nom: I think that's a little disingenous on the part of the nominator. At the very least, if the investigation was notable, and that is not denied in the nom, the article could have been moved to Investigation of the death of Iman al-Hams. I would not support that, however, as there have been several occasions where it has been decided that a person becomes notable through the manner of their death. Consider <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a>. The example chosen by the nom is, I suspect in somewhat bad faith, as the death of that individual was non-notable even by the standards of the media circuses such deaths involve. The JonBenet Ramsey murder and that girl who disappeared in Aruba are still on here. As are Diallo and another article that just survived AfD of someone who was similarly gunned down by the NYPD. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> itself says "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" meet the criteria for notability.</dd>
<dd>Thus, the investigation itself would have to be nn for this argument to go through. The article demonstrates it wasnt. In fact, I have read this elsewhere already, so I think it's very far from nn, especially given the degree of media interest in Israel itself. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 01:46, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Re: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. First, as to renown and notoriety. I don't think Iman achieved either renown or notoriety. Certainly not notoriety; and as for renown, at <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=renown&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=renown&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, "renown" is defined as "widespread and high repute; fame," "the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed." Neither of these characterizes Iman. "Renown" connotes that the person <i>did</i> something, herself, whereas Iman, tragically, did nothing to get shot.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Renown or notoriety" in this context means "will people search for her name?"+"will they continue to do so for some time in the future?". You have conveniently avoided the fact that that section of WP:BIO is cited frequently as indicating that people who have died in notable fashion have achieved notability. Iman may have done nothing to get shot, but that is irrelevant; because she got shot, she had renown thrust upon her. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 19:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Let's take <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Holloway_4ddc.html" title="Natalie Holloway">Natalie Holloway</a> first. I do think it would be appropriate to consider deleting that article, but as her disappearance/death was an isolated incident, it simply doesn't fall into the same category as Iman's death. Next, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a>. His death also was an isolated incident, not part of a larger story, and alone engendered widespread criticism and discussion of NYPD practices, so an article devoted to his death and community reaction is appropriate. Next, <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBenet_Ramsey_daa2.html" title="JonBenet Ramsey">JonBenet Ramsey</a>. Her death was unique as it engendered a widespread discussion on the propriety of kiddie beauty pageants, and as Bwithh noted in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Allen_Smith_0a1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith</a>, pertained to wider cultural trends.

<dd>Surely you realise you havent got a good enough argument in this case. Iman's death was part of an military operation. The investigation was notable in that it revealed details about what is considered appropriate during military operations. This caused widespread discussion in the English and Israeli press, and thus is notable. What part of this is difficult to follow? If her death was not <b>unique</b>, as you seem to - in the absence of all precedent of logic - believe is necessary for inclusion, at least the level of scrutiny and the facts that emerged in the investigation were uniquely discussed. Is it untrue that it engendered widespread criticism, defence and discussion of IDF practices? Then how is it different from the Diallo case? You have described these cases, and in none of them have you <i>even begun</i> to explain how they are inappropriate comparisons.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 19:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like Stalin (may his name be expunged) said, one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. Sadly perhaps, he was right. Uniqueness does confer extra notability, and Iman's death is one of hundreds. But uniqueness also has to do with the POV fork issue. The investigation into Iman's death, as I said, is already covered in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Days_of_Penitence_4e53.html" title="Operation Days of Penitence">Operation Days of Penitence</a>.

<dd>See my discussion below. That the investigation is covered briefly in that article is irrelevant, as the investigation extends to methods used elsewhere, and the investigation itself is hardly part exclusively of the details of the operation, which is the primary purpose of that article. You have, again, not made your case. Iman's case is one of hundreds, but <i>the one that was discussed</i> and hence notable. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 20:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But even if you think a comparison between Iman's and these three deaths is appropriate despite these differences, I would point out that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_George_Allen_Smith_0a1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/George Allen Smith</a> shows that precedent is not unanimous on whether to keep such articles.</dd>

I think its clear that you wished to delete several articles. About the others, its possible that they were less notable. I certainly wasnt moved to intervene. This is, however, a notable incident, a notable investigation, a notable discussion, and to delete it as being the bio of a nn person instead of moving it to a more appropriate title, means that you think the <b>discussion</b> is non-notable; and that is untrue, and to attempt to achieve the removal of the discussion inappropriately smacks, as I said, of something approaching bad faith. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 19:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(a) Once again, you miss my point. Many people die sensationally; but a death that causes discussion of army methods and considerable study in several countries is notable in a way that George Allen Smith wasnt. (b) The article about the operation deserves to be about the operation. The discussion of IDF methods following the girl's death went beyond a specific operation. (c) My statement was that you "wished to delete several articles". The good-faith interpretation of your actions is that you let the fact that this article was created by a user who also created articles about nn individuals to affect your judgment. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 20:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(b) You're making way too much of the "discussion of IDF methods following the girl's death." Read the article on Iman, and you will see it has little discussion in the way of general IDF practices. The discussion almost entirely involves specific allegations and rebuttals related to the incident of Iman's shooting. (c) I found these articles created by Alberuni because I find one that I thought NN, then checked to see what other NN articles the same user might have created. Obviously there's no way I can prove my judgment is not impaired.

The proper comparison in terms of notability would be of the My Lai massacre to the Operation Days of Penitence (during which Iman was shot), or of a single casualty of My Lai to Iman.

<dd>This has been discussed above, but to respond specifically: your use of the term is incorrect and it is inapplicable here. It would not be a POV-fork to create an article on a specific victim of th eMy Lai massacre, it would just be not encyclopaedic (Unless it were about the little girl in the photo, perhaps, if there was considerable discussion of her identity). The article about the operation is <i>not the place</i> for an 'adequate' discussion of the investigation. At some point in the future someone might point out that that article is overwhelmed with this discussion and be within their rights in removing it, as the investigation is <i>peripheral</i> to the operation itself. It needs and deserves its own article, and saying so is not a POV-fork, in the manner in which the phrase is used. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 20:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The investigation is adequately covered in the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Days_of_Penitence_4e53.html" title="Operation Days of Penitence">Operation</a> article; the investigation is not notable outside of the context of that operation; and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Iman_Darweesh_Al_Hams_dc79.html" title="Iman Darweesh Al Hams">Iman</a> has little or no discussion on general IDF practices that go beyond the operation. The Iman article does nothing more than highlight a negative fact from the operation. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 07:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The investigation cannot be said to be non-notable outside the context of the operation. The operation provided the context for the <i>death</i>.

<dd>First of all, may I respectfully suggest that you calm down a little. Second of all, as for "articles about Israeli victims," tell me, where are the individual articles on all of the Israeli children murdered by terrorists in the <a href="../../../m/a/27/Ma%27alot_massacre.html" title="Ma'alot massacre">Ma'alot massacre</a>, <a href="../../../s/b/a/Sbarro_restaurant_massacre.html" title="Sbarro restaurant massacre">Sbarro restaurant massacre</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphinarium_massacre.html" title="Dolphinarium massacre">Dolphinarium massacre</a>, and all the others over the years? Unless they are well-hidden, the articles do not exist. The individual victims are merely listed in the articles about the particular incidents. This nomination seeks to achieve the same result for this individual.

<dd>Dear anonymous. These pages are not primarily about the person involved, but about the incident. The article is not necessarily about the girl, but about the way in which the girl was murdered. You could rename it "<i>Gaza killing of Palestinian girl on whateverdateitwas</i>" if you want. It seems logical to me that large incidents, in which multiple people were killed, should be named after the location of the incident - for example, "Ma'alot massacre". For incidents in which only one person was killed, we call it after the name of the victim - for example this article, <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayala_Abukasis_acf4.html" title="Ayala Abukasis">Ayala Abukasis</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalhevet_Pass_dd9d.html" title="Shalhevet Pass">Shalhevet Pass</a>. If multiple members of one family are involved, it is named after the most notable one - usually the father, or if he is not involved the mother - such as <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tali_Hatuel_25f5.html" title="Tali Hatuel">Tali Hatuel</a>. And there should indeed be articles on Wikipedia about each victim of the intifadah, on both sides. Virtual monuments to each of them. Not only innocent children, but even IDF and Hamas combatants. (This comment is also placed below for discussion.) --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel575_08a4.html" title="User talk:Daniel575">(talk)</a></i></small> 19:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The information regarding this person in my view has deep relevance to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. The statement that this page is a slippery slope to giving a page to every person killed in war, or that we should give a page to every victim of My Lai is a very specious argument. Her death is one of the few in the whole of the Palestinian conflict that has resulted in the prosecution of an Israel soldier; if she died in a huge massacre like <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qana.html" title="Qana">Qana</a>, that would be a different story. Moreover, it has been extensively covered in the global media. Furthermore, her death is seen by many as a key evidence for the tactics employed by some members of the IDF. I am not sure how many recall the death of Iman Hijjo; she died somewhat early in the most recent uprising. I could see the argument made that an article about her was a POV fork. However, the case of Iman Darweesh al-Hams is much different given her death led to some sort of conviction, and was more well publicized.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, clearly anything but the facts should be removed from this article. The vote to keep is by no means an approval of the article's wording. But, the article concerning her definitely has merit. Take the example of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Durrah_f90d.html" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a>. He is also a child who died in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; no one would recommend the deletion of this article despite the view by some that the pictures of it are overly graphic and the article covers primarily his death and the aftermath only. Iman Darweesh al-Hams is very in terms of symbolism as Muhammad al-Durrah and may be more well known in the West.</dd>
<dd>Finally I think the vote to delete is the most POV part about this article. <a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZaydHammoudeh_3b03.html" title="User:ZaydHammoudeh">ZaydHammoudeh</a> 17:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so difficult if you're a Zionist. They like to ignore criticism by pretending it's only minor non-notable groups that criticize them. Criticism? Just pretend it doesn't exist, wish it away, and if necessary, mention the word 'Holocaust' to silence any and all criticism.

<dd>That statement (that there is <i>always</i> a "discussion") is demonstrably false.

Given that, I strongly suggest you re-read the above points and alter your vote. I would also urge any editors -or the closing admin - to have a look at the discussion page of the article, which has been active for a long time with people arguing about the sources used, the degree of NPOV of the content, whether there should be a link to the IDF Code of Conduct, etc., etc., without once questioning the importance of the subject or the level of notability or the availability of multifarious sources. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a></dd>
<dd>Speaking as an Israeli, this incident was a major scandal in Israel, and sparked more discussion, controversy and criticism than almost all others (barring A-Dura and a few others).

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, three of the sources listed are the Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune and Fox news. I really don't agree that this is a non-topic - whatever reasons caused the word to gain prominence aren't really as relevant as the fact that it <i>did</i>. And this prominence is verifiable by independent sources. The fact that it's also the name of a monkey is what made it such a questionable comment in the first place and is therefore relevant to the article. I agree that <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacacaGate_0bdc.html" title="MacacaGate">MacacaGate</a> probably should go, but I do think that there can and should be a Wikipedia article on this controversy. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 20:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep on the condition</b> that the section on the Allen controversy be reduced to one sentence and merged into the "Usages" section of the article. I disagree with Dina's statement that there should be a WP article on the Allen controversy. Foot-in-mouth disease is prevalent among politicians, and this particular controversy is no more notable than the dozens of other kerfuffles that deserve no more than a paragraph in larger articles (in this case the article on the 2006 Senate election or the article on George Allen himself). On the sources, I agree with Dina. Disregarding the section on the Allen controversy (because I think that that should anyway be reduced to one sentence), more than half of the sources for the first part of the article seem legit, non-blog. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:23, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>SEN. ALLEN: Tim, I made a mistake. I said things thoughtlessly. I’ve apologized for it, as well I should. But there was no racial or ethnic intent to slur anyone.

Now, call me ungenerous, but given those facts, the idea that "macaca" was simply three syllables Allen randomly strung together when digging at a dark-skinned young man who was getting on his nerves just doesn't strike me as credible. I don't expect Allen to admit now that rather than make this name up it was a synonym for the N-word that he was fond of when he was a kid. But he's practically begging for renewed attention to this transparent lie by weaving it, again and again, into his strained apologies. <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009763.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009763.php" rel="nofollow">[62]</a></p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It would be absurdly naïve to merge it with Allen's article. Even if we choose to believe his claim, which is unfalsifiable, he didn't invent the word, but rather reinvented it. In any case, it existed before he used it, and has an existence independent of his gaffe. If we merged it with Allen, we would be tacitly supporting the claim that Allen coined the word innocently, and that can be neither proven nor disproven. The only NPOV options are to (A) delete the article as non-notable or (B) retain the article, perhaps abridging the section pertaining to Allen so that it doesn't dominate the rest of the article. (A) would require us to delete articles like <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/g/Wog.html" title="Wog">wog</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dago.html" title="Dago">dago</a>, which can be quite informative, so the only acceptable alternative is to keep. However, I suggest we confine the bulk of the "macaca-gate" information to a subsection of Allen's article, since this article ought first and foremost to concern the word, not a specific incident of its use. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">said</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhumiya_e6d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhumiya">done</a>) 03:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

But the article is still <i>about the slur</i>, which is why the Allen controversy doesn't merit any more than a sentence or two, as in the "Usages" section. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I resent that, I really do. The fact of the matter is this article did not exist until the Allen controversy. Additionally, many of the sources were American, and the section about Allen took up a very significant chunk of space. If anything, I thought the <i>article</i> was too provincial, reflecting American interest in the subject out of proportion with the word's history and use. We do not usually have a separate article for ethnic slurs unless they are very well known in English; in this case it was only after Allen used the term that someone decided it deserved its own article.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 21:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

In a Google search of the term it was the first site that I recognized and was clearly about the word "Macaca." I do think that Mr Allen's excuse for using the word should be on his WP page. However, I was glad to see on the "Macaca" page the regional origin of the word. Perhaps the fact that Mr Allen's mother comes from where this word originates (and Mr Allen's story that he simply made up the word) should be on Mr Allen's page as well, since it seems political.--216.205.234.64 17:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)Brian</li>

<p>Book with little notability and of highly questionnable credibility. Published by a vanity press. The title gets a limited number of Google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Nazi+Connection+to+Islamic+Terrorism%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Nazi+Connection+to+Islamic+Terrorism%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> mostly on forums, blogs and message boards and because his author gets some coverage as a Republican politician and a radio-show host. A previous debate resulted a year ago in a no consensus <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Nazi_Connection_to_Islamic_Terrorism_8f5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism</a>. I'd like to point out that the book fails to meet the proposed <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">criteria for notability of books</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>the author is not primarily known as an author,</li>
<li>the book has won no awards,</li>
<li>the book has not been the subject of multiple indepedent reviews. You do find, for instance a review by Samuel L. Blumenfeld <a href="http://www.balkanpeace.org/hed/archive/apr04/hed6371.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkanpeace.org/hed/archive/apr04/hed6371.shtml" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> although Blumenfeld is Morse's colleague at the WorldNetDaily <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/archives.asp?AUTHOR_ID=37&amp;PAGE=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/archives.asp?AUTHOR_ID=37&amp;PAGE=4" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> and his coauthor on at least one book <a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/Thunder-Out-of-Boston_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ1858204" class="external autonumber" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/Thunder-Out-of-Boston_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ1858204" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> so his independence is suspect.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. There is no consensus in the numbers, I have at 4-4. So on the arguments. It <i>is</i> true that galleries are are not proper articles (although we do have some articles that <i>are</i> basically galleries, we're not supposed to). This point is not really strongly refuted. Yes there a captions for some of the photos, but this makes it little more than a captioned gallery. The other main Keep point made is this is a useful and encyclopedic entity. That may be, but still, it's not really an <i>article</i>. The main article does have a number of good images (some of which are in this gallery). With a link to the Commons gallery, this seems to serve to purpose. Bottom line: we have to hold the line somewhere, and I think the point that Wikipedia articles should not be just collections of images is strong enough that the article should go. Also FWIW slashes are not allowed in article names in the way used here. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article does not assert any notability about its subject. It does not place this school, one of thousands like it, in any historical context. It does not provide any information available elsewhere, nor does it relate it to any broader educational or cultural context. The information it does include is either of such a generic and common nature as to be self-evident (nearly all public high schools have sports programs, for example), or is specific and unverified. There are no sources pertaining to the article; the only link given is to the school's main page.</p>
<p>I came across this article on random page patrol and placed a <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> tag on it, citing these concerns. <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJHall</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall">talk</a>) removed it, with the following summary: <i>Disagree, plus H.S. deletes are controversial.</i> It is not clear to me how he thought this article <i>did</i> assert notability, and I would invite such explanations here. As to the controversial nature of school AfDs, that remains a mystery to me. Articles about schools are not in themselves a special type of article, nor do they enjoy special status. They do not enjoy policy-level protection–even articles on Prime Ministers and Presidents don't have such protection in itself. Rather, the <i>nature</i> of the subject guarantees an easy assertion of notability and the ready availability of reliable sources.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> worthwhile article on a signficant topic. Also, there is a clear precedent on keeping all verifiable real schools, particularly high schools. Nominator starts with the false presumption the school has to rise above others, and ignores the possiblity that schools, are normally worthy of conclusion like various other topics (such as municipalities, members of state legislators, licensed full power radio stations, etc...) where we keep all items of a class, provided basic policy, particularly, verifiability, is satisfied. Lets use our time and resources on improving articles, and not dead-end debates. Incidently, I applaud JoshuaZ writing his essay. His comments about being ok with the the deletion (or merging) of many smaller towns and villages shows he has thought through things, and has expressed a greater level of consistancy in arguements than most who want deletion of the typical school. Its pretty much impossible to argue that keeping a high school with 900 kids should be deleted, but supporting the retention of a typical township of a dozen people. Of course, we won't being undoing precedent for either places or schools. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - There is a difference between "this is a stub" and "this is not notable". Existing precedent is that high schools are by nature notable.

No that does not mean they should be immune from deletion; it is just a statement that a PROD is for non-controversial deletions.

<li>I did read the nom - but I also read the <i>article</i> - which allowed me to discount verifiably false statements. Again, claims that are false upon their face aren't arguments - arguments are a position built upon facts - facts necessarily being true - which both of the statements you point to are not. Thus it remains that the only argument presented is <i>It's a stub</i> which remains an awful criterion for deletion when making an encyclopaedia in this format. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep!</b>: I don't usually encounter such obvious decisions in an AfD discussion. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this article should be kept and expanded! With the coup in Thailand &amp; Thaksin on his way out today, Mai (and all the rest of the Royal Family) is an even more prominent figure than when this was AfD tagged.

<li><b>Update</b> After actually reading the article, I propose that it be changed. There are some things that Qabbalah wrote about me that are not completely true and some notable things that were left out. Also, there's some personal information posted there that I prefer not to be accessable to the public. How did he get my wedding photo? I certainly agree that the pages dedicated to my albums ought to be removed or merged. The same with Cafe Graffiti which was not notable except, perhaps, as a side note. I will be happy to change it myself, but I don't know how. RE: WP:MUSIC, There are two "notable" credits - 1. I toured South America and Mexico with Elegant Machinery - 2. I have been played on "Alternative" stations owned by Clearchannel (Something I regret, but it qualifies) Also-It is important to note that I have sold enough copies of my first two albums to earn a gold record, but I refuse to join the pathetic agencies that masquerade as unions, so I don't qualify.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonySReed_3bab.html" title="User:TonySReed">User:TonySReed</a>

<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b>. It is possible that an article about this topic might at some point (possibly) be made that would be worth keeping. However, the current article is two sentences, one of which is patent nonsense and the other is a restatement of the title. Policy-wise I'm not sure we can apply different speedy criteria to separate parts of the article but it seems like a reasonable thing to do in this case. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:40, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article deals with a closed high school, but a school's encyclopedic notability does not vanish when it closes. The decision to close the school is best understood in the context of demographic change, declining church attendance, and the financial pressures on Roman Catholic dioceses related to lawsuits over sexual abuse. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 22:37, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s>*<b>Delete</b></s> While I agree with Truthbringer that notability does not vanish when an institution closes this school did not have any notability in the first place. The only argument that can be made for notability is the age of the school but even then it barely goes back to the 1880s. I was unable to find any record of notable almuni or any other particulary notable event or matter associated with the school. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC) Now changing to <b>Weak keep</b> the age of the school might confer notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs to be reworked, but the text and desciption that is already there demonstrate notability. I fail to see how the lack of notable graduates makes the school any less notable; as if schools have an obligation to turn out notables to justify their existence. Nor is it clear that a school that survived for 120 years should be any less notable because it could "only" date itself back to the early 1880s. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, the presented argument is a lack of notability.

<ul>
<li>Arguments that are false upon their face don't really count as arguments in any viable way. Saying <i>This claims to be an encyclopaedia article, but is actually a cheese sandwich</i> would also be difficult to count as an argument for deletion, even though it has the form thereof. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually that would still be an argument and you said "no rational" given that multiple other people think this is a rational including the nom who is a respected user it might behoove you to explain how this argument is so bad that it doesn't even merity being addressed. If you could explain it would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:31, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. While yelling <i>Is too</i> - <i>Is not</i> might be also termed an argument, I would hope it's clear from context I mean a line of reasoning based upon facts - none of <b>those</b> have been offered to support deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me? Notability is not a magic default state. Are you going to explain what is notable about the article or not? You asserted that it was based on data in the article. If so, please point to it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're excused. I haven't said anything about notability being default, rather than it's been establish (please read the article to discover this). Notability isn't subjective - <i>I don't like this sourced, encyclopaedic article, so I'm going to accuse it of being non-notable</i> is <b>not</b> a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability not being subjective is irrelevant since there is no claim that anything here is notable. Don't confuse a lack of subjectivity with magically making everything notable. In any event, most of the people who say this isn't notable have objective notabillity criteria). Given this it might be nice for you to explain what is objectively notable about this article? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you'll check the article, you'll find that it has mutliple, indepedant reliable sources - thus it is objectively notable. The standards of notability are notability are not personal standards, they're standards we apply evenly across wikipedia. Multiple sources of third party coverage from reliable, independant sources is notable - and this is not <i>my</i> standards, but Wikipedia's standards. Nobody can objectively claim this school isn't notable - only subjective claims can be made to that effect (and subjective claims are useless in this context) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The use of the multiple independent sources standard is something used in certain guidelines. However, there are serious issues using it with schools. As I have already pointed out, newspapers love to puff-pieces on schools. Thus, it isn't a real assertion of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The multiple independent sources standard applies just about everywhere - although other litmus-style tests are occasionally used, it's clearly the most important test, and is used ubiquitiously. Where specific guidelines exist, there can be higher standards - though that's essentially to prevent spamming. Whether newspapers print "puff-pieces" on schools is something I really don't know (nor do I really care). Personal standards of notability go against <i>everything</i> this encyclopaedia stands for. If some publisher has found something worth publishing (better:multiple publishers) then that's a far more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> acceptable criterion for retention, the converse for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:35, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article has had two AFD nominations recently. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bitweaver_b464.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bitweaver">first</a> resulted in a <b>delete</b>. It was recreated, and deleted as a repost. It was then the subject of a deletion review and subsequently <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bitweaver2_8fef.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bitweaver2">relisted</a> at AFD where it was again decided it should be deleted. The content has now been moved from TikiPro and is a stub. There was considerable work done on it during the last AFD listing and it was still eventually decided that it failed to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I don't see that this has changed in the last few weeks, so rather than have somebody spend time rewriting the article I suggest it is deleted. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 22:21, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> No it doesn't. It demonstrates that lots of people are chiming in because they saw the same issue. (This is precisely why I don't think the Schoolwatch or the general deletion categorization is a good idea). Fanaticism of a few is not the same thing as a consensus to keep. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd say the fact that we have unanimous support to Keep this article is a demonstration of true consensus, not "fanaticism." And isn't the definition of a "fanatic" someone who consistently disagrees with what you think is right. I hope that all participants in these AfD's would read through the articles and try to improve them (if possible) or make constructive suggestions for improvement, before voting, rather than making a knee-jerk vote to Delete OR Keep. But, even with the weasel words, when a "fanatic" like <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> voted to Keep, this AfD should he have been closed immediately. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:07, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> My criticism was not directed at this article by itself where I agree the consensus is to keep it was to the claim that "there is consensus within the community that schools are notable." In any event, I'm certainly not a deletionist fanatic, I vote keep on about a 1/3 or so of school AfDs. And in this case, I use fanatic to mean people who don't do anything other than vote keep per the exact same arguments and who seem to spend most of their time only editing schools articles. Fanatic might not be the best phrasing. It might be better to call these repeated keeps "not obviously representative samples of the community as a whole." <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My argument was in the previous sentence (it's a large school, enough said), not the one you kindly just quoted, which was merely a conclusion drawn from that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am the main author of the Photo Genesis article and a non administrative ordinary member of Photo Genesis. On seeing the first nomination from the text provided, I understood that I could log an objection and remove the warning, which I did, sorry if I misunderstood that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The text concerning why the article was nominated for deletion was not very clear and linked too numerous reasons as to why the nomination may have been made, nothing was specific that I could see.</dd>
<dd>The article was written as an information page on a small gallery that hosts work from like minded photographic artists, it was not intended as an advertisement or a vanity article; I singed it in my name as I prefer to do things in my name instead of an assumed identity for correctness. I added the owners name as he supplied much if the information that I used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry it has been seen as a NPOV/advertisement article, I will therefore try to make the article compliant with Wikipedia policy.</dd>
<dd>I am new to Wikipedia so I would hope that other users might be a little understanding if I do not do things 100% correctly, everyone has to be new at some point, making mistakes is how we learn.</dd>
<dd>I do not understand the following statement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>“I searched for Photo Genesis and found it to be many things, none of which except an RSS feed directory led to the gallery in question”.</b></dd>
<dd>Is that important?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Google search places it a top listing and Yahoo 2nd place listing, is this what is meant by doing a search? I don’t know how RSS works.</dd>
<dd>The search term Photo Genesis may well return many things, Photo genesis however is one thing, a gallery and art community.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I apologise, I should have been clearer with regard to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_en__176&amp;q=%22photo+genesis%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_en__176&amp;q=%22photo+genesis%22" rel="nofollow">Ghits</a>. The gallery is in top place in this search, but it is the gallery's own website. While this may seem strange to you the very fact that it is the gallery's own website means it is discounted - it is a self fulfilling prophecy of notability, you see. Any good webmaster can get their website to the top of the list in many (but not all) searches.</dd>
<dd>At position 5 is <a href="http://chordata.info/-/90/1221/" class="external text" title="http://chordata.info/-/90/1221/" rel="nofollow">your own newsfeed</a> in a newsfeed directory. Again, because it is your own it is discounted. Good webmastering, just not "Wikipedic" notability, I have scrolled (albeit reasonably quickly) through the first 100 results. Your own website appears a couple or more times, but I have not found any independent reference to the gallery. The major result is for some form of light based therapy. This tends to prove that it is not (yet) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a></dd>
<dd>The article is also written as a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a> article, rather than as secondary research. This means that it is not acceptable in its current form. That doesn't mean it is not a great PR piece, it just means it is not a Wikipedia article yet.</dd>
<dd>The best way of saving the article is an immediate and total rewrite to render it notable and encyclopaedic. Notability requires assertion, so reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> and conforming with it is vital. Assertion is done with citation of external sources which are independent of your own article and which have themselves a distinct notability. The thing that will not save it is rhetoric (I appreciate you have not used it).</dd>
<dd>With regard to the source of the information it is certainly permitted to quote your sources, including the gallery owner. This is best done with references because Wikipedia articles are never signed. I think <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> covers this, but I may be mistaken.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am the main author of the Photo Genesis article and a non administrative ordinary member of Photo Genesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from one very helpful user, there hasn’t exactly been much in the way of useful feedback. I am good with cameras and EV’s which may or may not be “notable” clearly I am not good with writing articles; shame that only one user could find the time to be productive with their comments and explanations. The lack of response would seem to imply that many don’t really have an opinion one way or another, judging by the huge response on some AFd’s</p>
<p>I am a staunch believer in helping to develop people in areas where they are not so strong. I don’t exactly feel inspired to re-write something that is just going to receive one word/phrase answers. “delete” Surly if one feels so strongly about something, then logically they should be able to express that with more than one word/phrase/sentence.</p>
<p>I could probably re write it into one short paragraph that has little educational value and comply with all except “notability” but if the general consensus is that Photo Genesis isn’t notable there isn’t anything I can do about that.</p>
<p>Thank you for the warm welcome!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable as-is. Perhaps the article could be recreated after a good deal more of the machinima has been completed and its popularity grows. --<a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuthraw_a2a4.html" title="User:Authraw">authraw</a> 03:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> Many things start out small, and as a result have small entries. Wikipedia is complete in this way in that there is something to grow from; people are more likely to add to an entry than create one. I suggest that someone find some upcoming information, and also add a summary of the first episode, if possible. While vanity is indeed a possibility, I say we let someone mess with the page until it's wiki-worthy, rather than delete it. While it is also true that it is not well known, and to be already well known is the prerequisite, it seems unfair to link its apparent popularity to the amount of hits on google it gets. Other articles started out smalll, back when RvB was first coming out, the article was small, and didn't get deleted at all. I may not have been a user then, but I was watching the article for updates.--lycanfury09 08:53, 18 September 2006 (PST)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> I agree with LycanFury, which is why I added to the article. I don't know who wrote it first, but I agree there should be a synopsis of the first episode. How do you add a synopsis page? (I'm new here)--DansonDelta40 13:31, 18 September 2006 (PST)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm just about to add to this article and make it better. The popularity will grow, eventually. Since there is stuff already written about it, it just doesn't make much sence to delete it when we know it will become wikiworthy eventually. Also, it doesn't seem right to delete it because it isn't popular.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know I'm new (I originally added so I could add to this article), but is the only reason to delete if because it "hasn't made enough of a mark" yet?

<li><b>Comment</b>. You can only vote once. And if I had 10 cents for every article where an involved party in the subject tried the "but it'll be famous <i>one day!</i>" argument, I'd be rich.

While Freenode more closely pushes its discussion topics toward GNU ideas and open-source software (including Wikimedia's IRC channels), it is still an IRC network like DALnet and EFnet are. It isn't notable enough to warrant anything other than an article about the network itself (which we <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">have</a>).</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I came to wikipedia when I heard the news to understand fully the significance. At a later date it may be appropriate to merge with an article about PDPC or Freenode, but at this time it is a useful and relevant page, and should be expanded, rather than deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> His death was widely reported, that's enough for. If people search for him, I want them to come here for the information, and not somewhere else. If the creators of the other channels get the same attention that he did, they should get articles too. If the article on PDPC doesn't link to him, it should.

<li>Was the death of your great-grandmother reported in the media (geek-media, whatever)? His death was reported on many, many sites. He sure got a lot of attention for someone that wasn't notable at all. That's enough for me. As an aside, (and note: this isn't my real argument at all, just an aside. If this was just anyone, I wouldn't use this argument for his bio being kept, but since he was notable...), do we have to follow policy so damned ridgidly? Come on, the guy just died, lets show him some respect from people who really respected him. We don't have to be cold, calculating policy/process machines all the time.

<li>History suggests otherwise - many people have been considered more notable after their deaths than before them. Take Shakespeare.

That Rob's daily successful battle with trolls, spammers and rule-exploiters to keep freenode a place for civilised discourse online should be commemorated by this kind of pettifogging is ironic indeed. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Marks_8699.html" title="User:Kevin Marks">Kevin Marks</a> 01:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I just searched wiki wanting to know who he was, after seeing simply a mention of condolence to his family on Gentoo Linux's main page. It was useful to me. More generally, I have to agree that the fact the other network creators don't have entries is hardly a logical reason to delete here. Just points out articles that need written. If that line of reasoning is somewhere in policy, I'm glad it hasn't been around since the start... We'd never have had a first article. I can just see it now: "Foo is a thing. Nothing else has an article. Ergo Foo shouldn't have an article." Highly useful line of reasoning there. Hatchetfish 05:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

A mention of who Rob Levin was and what he did for PDPC would be appropriate on the PDPC page itself, but the event is not notable or historically significant enough at this time for its own entry on Wiki.

<li><b>Keep</b>- Disclaimer I am a new user; In the short time I have been engaged in Wikipedia I have formed some ideas about what Wikipedia is and WP: NOT. If Wikipedia is an encyclopedia than the purpose is for research and if I was researching the Canadian labor politics, this article would be helpful, also argument for it not being a vanity page. The figure is notable enough where I could find information on him with a simple Google search to an independant site. I don't think international notability is required and as others in countries outside of Canada have heard of him I think that this article meets the qualifications. Personally I also have a "Why Not" feeling towards this article along the lines of the "Wikipedia is not running out of paper" argument. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 17:26, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Totally non-notable. and unencyclopediac -- keep votes mostly puppets or close friends. The article is already tagged as having few or no links with relationships to the article. I don't even think this can be called "original research" because it's mostly vanity info like IRC usernames and blog links, weight, etc. Definite delete. <a href="../../../k/u/l/User%7EKultur_7fee.html" title="User:Kultur">Kultur</a> 18:54, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>First I was wondering if you could state the reasons for saying the article is non-notable and unencyclopedia. Second while I appreciate your qualifying "mostly" I feel that your "accusations" of the keep votes being puppets or mere friend loyalty are offensive and irrelevant. The first time I heard of Andrew Nellis was in this context. I am neither a puppet or a close friend or any friend for that matter and I still see value in this article. Third your claim that it is "mostly" vanity info, I think is false, in that the majority of the page refers to Andrew Nellis's work in Canadian politics and the media's references to him. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 20:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps I am being dense on this point, however I do not see how the identity of who created the article is relevant as to whether the article belongs on Wikipedia, I only edit or write articles on subjects that are interesting or important to me, if I knew someone who was notable I would certainly want to be involved in their article, I think this is the <b>foundation</b> of Wikipedia if people could only work on articles they were removed from no one would want to work on an article. I will concede that some material in the personal life section should be cleaned up. I still have not seen your argument for the article being non-notable.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Point taken. However, one can surely see, for instance, a biographical article written about someone by themselves is really autobiographical, and therefore NPOV. It is likely to include distortions or irrelevancies. The article's existence is at question, regardless of who it's written by, because it does not have any relevance in an encyclopedia. There are plenty of less important places on the web for people to post about each other. Wikipedia is not one of them. <a href="../../../k/u/l/User%7EKultur_7fee.html" title="User:Kultur">Kultur</a> 05:23, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't know how anarchist activists are rated but I don't think Jaggi is any or more important than PP is. Singh has gained attention because of his planned political actions and because of his protests. He has also been mentioned in the news and on television many times. The only difference I can think of is that Jaggi is in Montreal and Andrew is in Ottawa.

<p><b>Bad Faith Delete</b> - I'd just like to point out that I suspect kultur's delete vote has been done in bad faith. He runs one of the businesses in Ottawa that was affected by the Panhandler's Union civil actions. As far as "Personal Info" as Vanity is concerned, maybe kultur has no idea what the point of a biography is, and maybe he'll nominate some other AfD's for biographies that have Personal sections in them(all). Or, he could just help us fully wikify the page and try to be constructive.

<dd>An A for effort, Fred, but you just shoehorned the reference into the article on Jane, by proxy of common affiliation with the IWW. That's not a relevant link. I'm sure a better connection can be made. Haven't they been arrested together or anything like that? "During a protest at the blahblahblah meeting, members of the local blah blah blah group, including Jane and fellow Ottawa activist and suspected ur-fascist Andrew "PoisonPen" Nellis, were hauled off by State-sanctioned stormtroopers for a severe talking-to." That sort of connection I'd consider a relevant link. 69.194.35.109 03:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They are both members of the same branch of the IWW in the same city. I think that's a worth enough reason to link them. Andrew has never been arrested. Jane however has been arrested dozens of times and spent eight months in jail.--Fmaack 06:08, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't be so literal Fred, just rewrite the connection in a relevant form. The article on Jane isn't an article on other IWW members in Ottawa. 69.194.35.109 01:20, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's in the <b>COPYRIGHT DATABASE</b>. Even if this article is deleted, it will just be recreated in a month, so I don't see the point. Don't believe me? Go here: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/records/" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/records/</a> and search for this: PAu-3-027-449. Besides, whats the difference between this page and the half dozen other future Simpsons episode pages? Or the dozens of future episode pages from other shows?
<dl>
<dd>I don't doubt that there WILL be a <i>Simpsons</i> episode called "Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times," and that in the not-too-distant future, the article under discussion will be WP-worthy. The problem is that <i>right now</i>, this article is not worthy of being on WP, and judging by Google, it will not be for some time. Having a page of nothing but grade-D prognostication reflects badly on the incredibly well-documented pages for other <i>Simpsons</i> episodes. No Homers Club is calling WP a <a href="http://nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=55871" class="external text" title="http://nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=55871" rel="nofollow">"bad media source"</a>, right alongside <i>The Sun</i> (!) and TV.com (!!). We're better than that.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Quick Wiki lesson: if no information is available other than the title, anything within it will be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which gets deleted. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, even if an event will happen, we can't have an article based entirely on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> speculation. Yes, it will in all likelihood be aired, but <i>at this moment</i> there is no information available about it, leading to comments like this on the page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>No plot is available yet, although the episode name suggests it will be about revenge and possibly Sideshow Bob (although Kelsey Grammer has not been announced as a guest star for this season) or Artie Ziff (Jon Lovitz HAS been announced for this season). The title also suggests that it could be an episode with three different stories.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That comment should be removed because it is just unsourced speculation. This will leave the article completely blank, essentially throwing it up for a CSD A1. When verifiable information is available, the article can be recreated. Remember everyone, <i><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</a></i> --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So how come The Mook, The Chef, the Wife and Her Homer, Please Homer Don't Hammer 'Em and several more episodes were not up for deletion when we knew squat about them? There are several we still know nothing about and nobody's rushing to put there articles up for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Listing Wikipedia as a bad sources disclaimer is because anyone can edit it, and it was added following the addition of an obviously fake title (Simpsons Christmas Stories II), and the last time I checked that page was still there. Just because somebody rightfully said that things posted on this website should be taken with a grain of salt, doesn't mean you can delete an article. It's in the copyright database, IT IS AN OFFICIAL TITLE.</p>
<p>What is the point of deleting an article when in a few weeks it will just be recreated?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not speculation. Although in future maybe new episode articles should only be created when there is a description. The episode is listed on the Season 18 page. Scott 17:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's nothing to be gained by deleting this article, even though I'm in agreement that it should have not been created at this time. -- Boonjava 17:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; if someday there'll be an episode, the article can be easily recreated; for now it should be removed, also to not encourage such practices.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 11:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for now. The fact that it's in a copyright database is meaningless: episodes change names in planning stages. Also bogus is the argument that it'll just be recreated - that's why we have a CSD for previously-deleted material. Salting the earth is also possible. Per Aldux, the article can be recreated when there's actually material. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 14:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd really love to know why we never get this sort of argument about any other episode we know nothing about!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would too, because as I pointed out, there are at least four other SImpsons episode pages that are similar. And not to mention the fact that TWO fake episode pages existed for several months wothout being deleted! (Simpson Christmas Stories II and Simpson Witches). I hardly see why this page is worth targetting. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion0422</a> 20:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If this page is deleted, the precedent it would set would prevent future fake-episode pages.
