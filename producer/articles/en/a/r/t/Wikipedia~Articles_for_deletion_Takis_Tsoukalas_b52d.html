<p>The result was <b>keep</b> - not the most cast-iron case for keeping, but there is barely a nomination for deletion either, with barely any attempt to dispute that the subject is notable. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Takis Tsoukalas is a controversial person and leader of <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympiakos.html" title="Olympiakos">Olympiakos</a> hardcore fans. He is offensive towards to other Greek teams of fans and likes to humiliate them. This article lacks the quality to be a wikipedia article (totally unimportant content, non-wikified), has controversial content, it is not neutral. Also, it is vandalized many times by IP users, and its quotes are insulting (quotes which are not translated correctly and have sexual connotations or threats) . I can see no reason for this article to be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaragouniS_dc75.html" title="User:KaragouniS">KaragouniS</a> 17:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaragouniS_dc75.html" title="User:KaragouniS">KaragouniS</a> 17:05, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep and clean up</b>. Article asserts notability and the subject appears to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The article certainly requires cleanup and NPOV expansion. Some of those oh-so-memorable quotations (for instance "All the big teams of Europe won their leagues. You just got the third, the goal I mean") aren't so memorable out of context, but "it gets vandalized a lot" is no criterion for deletion (request protection), nor are "it contains inaccurate translations" (translate them accurately), "it is POV" (edit it) or "he humiliates people". "He supports team X and I support team Y" isn't a valid criterion either. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 17:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My friend, "... You just got the third, the goal I mean" can translated as "you and your team are a piece of sh*t and can win anything". This article is inimportant and irrelevant to a encyclopedia. Tsoukalas is a hooligan and hooligans biographies are not included in encyclopedias<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaragouniS_dc75.html" title="User:KaragouniS">KaragouniS</a> 17:41, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it were protected I would work on it to make it a nice, fully referenced, respectable and neutral article, albeit about a not so greatly respected person. Yet while unprotected, it is merely a metaphorical dartboard for anonymous foes of TT. Keeping anonymous vandalism repaired would be too much overhead for, as was stated, not such an important article. So my recommendation is, <b>protect or delete</b>. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Erau_4e74.html" title="User:Samuel Erau">Samuel Erau</a> 15:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be deleted. And on another note let's keep this discussion amongst greek people here, as only they have any first hand experience with the issue. That goes to tony, who does not seem to be familiar with the issues at hand yet diligently, albeit incorrectly puts forth his opinions. A marginal figure on greek trash tv should be the least item to be considered for wikipedia inclusion, and it's presence here only makes a mockery out of the essense of this encyclopedia, which I suppose is the intented goal, that and an inside joke. Had greek tv, or greek journalism been included in an extensive survey here I could consider this for inclusion. But letting this in as is we are opening the flood gates for who knows what to be included in the encyclopedia, next thing you know this becomes an outlet for anyone's self agrandasing prospects. Notability, and that agains goes out to tommy, is clearly not met here, unless of course we broaden the term as much as to include anything and everything and ultimately nothing at all. My two cents as a very frequent user and contributor here, despite my lack of a user account, for personal issues. 62.38.23.26 04:48, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, some people don't seem to understand what Tsoukalas is, but just listen to us who see his (ugly) face every day. THIS GUY IS A HOOLIGAN, who tells children and teenagers to go and hit other team fans. He is considered the most hated person in greek football and in greek tv. EVEN OLYMPIAKOS FANS HATE HIM. IF you don't believe what i say, please ask any greek you know. It's a disgrace for this fantastic encyclopedia to include his name. He does not deserve it, guys. And you'll see that many people agree with me, in <a href="../../../t/a/k/Talk%7ETakis_Tsoukalas_40a5.html" title="Talk:Takis Tsoukalas">Takis Tsoukalas Talk Page</a> ---- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaragouniS_dc75.html" title="User:KaragouniS">KaragouniS</a> 22:09, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
