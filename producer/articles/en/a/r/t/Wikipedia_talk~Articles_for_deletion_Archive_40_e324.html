<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change to closing templates</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">Trialsanderrors</a> has created a good pair of templates for closing deletion reviews ({{<a href="../../../d/r/t/Template%7EDrt_659d.html" title="Template:Drt">drt</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../d/r/b/Template%7EDrb_7e31.html" title="Template:Drb">drb</a>}}), and I propose that the code from these templates be merged into <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_top_a9e2.html" title="Template:Afd top">Template:Afd top</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_bottom_9329.html" title="Template:Afd bottom">Template:Afd bottom</a> respectively.</p>
<p>The key benefit is that the text of closed debates is wrapped in a show/hide box and hidden by default, so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Closed discussions will not occupy so much visual space on the daily logs.</li>
<li>It will make it easier for admins closing old discussions to spot unclosed ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key disadvantages I forsee or have been raised are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Might not work for non-Monobook skins? Workaround: Make separate includeonly and noinclude text but with the same parameters so that the show/hide magic is reserved for the daily log but the regular closing text is displayed in the AfD subpage itself. People using non-Monobook skins can still view the full discussion in the subpage.</li>
<li>Might mess up section editing. Possible workaround: Fake section headers (not sure).</li>
</ol>
<p>But I think it is worth discussing the merits of merging the code from the DRV into the AfD closing templates.</p>
<p>For those who can read Chinese and wish to see how it might look like, the Chinese WP does it this way: <a href="../../../../zh/a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" class="extiw" title="zh:WP:AFD">see their AfD page</a> and <a href="../../../../zh/%E5%88%A0/%E9%99%A4/%E6%8A%95/Wikipedia%7E%E5%88%A0%E9%99%A4%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E5%92%8C%E8%AF%B7%E6%B1%82_2006%E5%B9%B411%E6%9C%8827%E6%97%A5_f1ba.html" class="extiw" title="zh:Wikipedia:删除投票和请求/2006年11月27日">sample closed discussion</a>.

<dd>Hmm. How much pre-transclusion space do those new templates occupy? We only have 2MB of transclusion memory available per page, so any changes from a simple template to a more complex template should be double-checked for server impact. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 08:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They're all supposed to be subst'ed (both the DRV templates and the current AfD closing templates) so there should be no transclusion problems. None of them use any meta-templates either. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 08:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this is a good idea.

<li>Hiding the closed discussions is useful; I've been doing that in my own monobook for awhile now. Although it would be better to avoid transcluding them to begin with, hiding them will at least speed up rendring a bit. I do think it would be better if the boxes were open by default on the discussion pages, and closed when they are transcluded. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 19:30, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The system as used by DRV does not reduce the amount of text downloaded - it's something like {{<a href="../../../h/i/d/Template%7EHide_9aca.html" title="Template:Hide">hide</a>}}, but done with CSS classes. So the main advantage is that closed discussions take up less visible space. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 10:38, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>While I don't like the amount of mark up text, it does seem that something should be done to make it easier to find active discussions and skip over closed discussions. I rather prefer the approach used at <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">MfD</a>, which is to move the closed discussions to another section on the page. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oops, I didn't see this discussion until now. There would be no additional code on daily logs. The code is entirely on the AfD page, the log page would look identical to the one we have now. I also added two proposals below, one would make use on &lt;noinclude&gt; to remove everything but the result from the log page. If the concern is mostly that the log pages take too long to load, that would be the solution to go with. Additonally, the AfD can simply be transcluded on the article talk page (during or after the discussion), which would kill the need for {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}}. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Referring to versions during AfD discussions</span></h2>
<p>This suggestion might have been discussed in the past - I did not consult the archives. During an AfD discussion, persons who have an interest in the article staying will sometimes (often) rewrite sections or modify the article in some way to help it survive and remain in Wikipedia. I don't recall ever seeing people refer to the version of the article that they are commenting on, but I've sometimes seen heated discussions where it is clear that the 'combatants' are talking about two different versions or arguing over the fact that a change was made at a critical time. My thinking is that there should be a recommendation added to the guidelines for AfD that suggests it is a good thing to indicate which version (with a permalink) is being commented on during a discussion; I've implemented an example of this at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brothers_Cider" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brothers_Cider" rel="nofollow">the AfD discussion around 'Brothers Cider'</a> where re-writing the article is being discussed as an option.

That way the rest of the participants can reevaluate their earlier comment. A few people use the permanent links to keep track of the different versions as the page changes but most people just compare the edit time-stamps.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change in policy</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that as of late, Wikipedia's editors are getting more zealous about marking articles for deletion.</p>
<p>While copyright, libel and falsity may merit deletion, I would say that it is counter-productive to delete articles based on the idea that they are not notable or well-known. First, the fact that the item in question is notable to at least one person makes it notable to at least one person; where can a line be drawn? Second, as a repository of knowledge anyone can edit, deleting pages because they do not meet the criteria of the elite seems to be against that goal.</p>
<p>I shudder to think what would happen to knowledge if libraries burned the books that were checked out only infrequently on niche topics.</p>
<p>May I suggest a "not notable" or "niche" tag, instead of marking for deletion and, eventually, deletion? To me, this seems like Wikipedia Vandalism under another name.</p>

<dd>The line is drawn at publication in reliable sources. Notability is not a function of whether we or you have heard of the subject but whether the world at large has deemed a subject notable by writing (or addressing the subject in other forms of publication) about it in a non-trivial manner in sources independent of the topic. That a subject is notable, as that term is vernacularly defined, because one person thinks so, is not a standard that can work for an encyclopedia which is inherently a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> synthesizing primary and secondary sources already in existence. The analogy of libraries burning infrequently checked out books is false. If a library analogy lies, it is: "if libraries were such that <a href="../../../a/n/_/The_Abortion%7E_An_Historical_Romance_1966_41b6.html" title="The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966">anyone could print a book on any topic and place it in the library</a> without any control, then that library would very quickly need a mechanism for determining what books should be removed because they were not actually published."

<dd>If only that were true! I have seen well researched and referenced biographies deleted as not-notable, based on the number of Ghits the person has, and that number of Ghits required is creeping upward. The excuse given is that the person wont be of interest in the future. Who knows why someone will be searching for information in the future, and the more ephemeral someone's fame is the more reason to preserve it. I have been looking for websites from just a year ago and they are gone, and the cached version at Google dont have all the scanned documents, and don't have the formatting that was in the original PDF. Sadly libraries do discard books that are no longer needed. I think they should bury them in Arizona under the desert sands. Remember nothing is deleted from Wikipedia, except images (now they are archived as of a few months ago). Every article deleted from Wikipedia is still available, but you have to be an administrator to retrieve it. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 23:12, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apparently well-researched and well-referenced articles can still be less than fully accurate if the subject is not notable enough to attract multiple editors. The vast majority of articles I've seen deleted for lack of notability have been overwhelmingly the work of a single editor. Even if every word in the article is true and sourced, there is no guarantee that relevant facts on the subject have not been selectively included. Only multiple pairs of independent eyes can do that. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The practice was never "common" but it did happen more two years ago than now. It's not that it necessarily prejudices the closers of the discussion but it does tend to inflame and prejudice the participants of the debate. It also reinforces the (false) impression that "votes" matter. This is a common misperception by new editors. We should be doing everything we can to lead them to the realization that strength of argument and facts matter far more than any mere "votecount". So I would say that no, we should not be keeping those running tallies even "just for fun". And yes, it is often appropriate to politely remove the tally and to tactfully explain why they generally do much more harm than good. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What about the IPs with a valid point. I have seen anons come by a give citations that helped the debate alot. Protection should not be used for preemptivly, only once a problem has occured.

<ul>
<li>I agree with HighInBC, no semiprotection until a problem hits a given article's debate. Wikipedia has many frequently-editing experts in some subject areas; and it has no experts, or only one or two who rarely log in, in other fields. One of the ways I occasionally contribute is to tell someone WP needs good help on a topic they know better than I do. Sometimes one will find the AfD and give some perspective (such as importance within its niche) or cite a good source. They're more likely to do this as anons than to set up an account. Most of us can ignore the obviously non-policy fanboy noise, and sometimes we can point those users to policy pages and get them to become legit contributors. Most admins who do AfD closings can judge based on policies and sources, and the worst the anons can do is turn a "delete" into a "no consensus, keep until fixed or found unfixable". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To semiprotect all AfD debates would be so overly beaurocratic, its fairly easy to tag comments submitted by IPs/new users who have not contributed to anything but that debate. We got to be slightly fair in the process and allow them to have a voice too. Also HighInBC brings up a valid point that protection is appropriate after the fact not to prevent a submission or an edit.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 21:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a very strong principle of Wikipedia to not be hostile towards new users/anons without reason since locking pages runs counter to the concept of an open site. Beside, we should be more concerned with what is said than who says it. I see just as many registers non-new users voting based soley on personal interest in the topic as I do new users. There is a template notice for discussions being "voted" on by single purpose accounts, and considering how infrequent it gets used, I'd say it really isn't a problem. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 23:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

The more eyes on the process the more useful the process becomes. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 20:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see why an <i>active</i> WikiProject is onerous to "consider" notifying. Most do not have enough volunteers to keep up with tracking the level of XfD nominations themselves, and an increased level of intelligent discourse at XFD can only be a good thing if we're not voting, right? If there's a problem with a biased WikiProject always voting Keep (or Delete, or whatever), then take it up with them, but this is a much more reasonable proposal than the perennial "inform all editors" or "inform creator" suggestions. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 20:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because an active WProject does the monitoring itself. What is onerous is to expect the nominator to sift through the list of WProjects, decide which ones are 1. relevant, and 2. active, and follow their notification procedures. Your assumption that this knowledge is readily available is flawed. The issue about WProjects as internal meatpuppet collectives is an additional one, but that's not what I'm aiming at. So why don't you, for the next ten AfD's you create, add notifiers to the relevant WProjects and report back how it went? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I understand articles being written NPOV but what about being nominated NPOV what I mean is. If you have personal issues with articles. How could one know this. Looking at a user page for one. Assuming (yes I know i used the evil word assume) a member puts they are a vegan on their user page and then suddenly they seem to be nominating just about every meat related page.

<li>I would suggest the main criteria for a mass deletion is that any comment made on one item would be equally valid of all others. It seems important that they are the within same subject e.g. a collection of articles about masts or churches etc. objected to for the same reasons. A collection of unrelated topics all accused of being OR should not be acceptable as there are likely to be sperate arguments for each. I would prefer it if deletion only resulted if there has been a consensus to delete all. If an individual entry is generating discussion but others are not, there should be a procedure for severing it to its individual AfD and the mass AfD can continue without it. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 19:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<div>I think that mass deletions are often the only way to deal with the C&amp;P <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trainspotter.html" title="Trainspotter">trainspotter</a>. The system is stacked in favour of such non-notable articles anyhow. It's so easy to create an article by cutting and pasting, and changing one or two small details. These should clearly by mass speediable. Another problem is that, upon seeing somebody creating [useless] stubs for masts (as an example), another editor ignorant of our policies and guidelines might think that's the way to go, thereby channelling their efforts inefficiently.</div>

<dl>
<dd>
<div>Mergers are very time consuming for the editor, and all of this could have been avoided <u>if the original creator had followed wiki policies</u> to start with, (ie by creating articles then spliting off sections which get too large). In the case of the many stubs linked to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">list of masts</a>, you may see that I indeed merged info and made some external links direct, so that no information is lost. It has been going smoothly till now when I started getting bolder with larger numner of articles.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<div>From the debates, I believe there's no fundamental issue with the stubs to be deleted, but the large number of items in one go appear to causes unease, as in your particular case. However, I feel that there are few downsides as the process is sufficiently transparent (all the information is there to be verified, audit trail etc). Too many carbon copy AfDs, will result in complaints, not to mention the workload involved for the nominator(s), and the use of kb of disc storage whihc would have been liberated by the deletions. I would favour a clear deletion guideline for speedy deletion for such stubs, per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A1" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A1</a>, so that administrators would feel empowered. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</div>

Its just a matter of gaming the system, and choosing the right time to put something up to a vote, and starting a "get out the vote" campaign to the right people. Once it is gone its doubtful anyone will relist it to be resurrected, since only administrators can see deleted entries.

<dd>At the moment I just wanted to get a feel for the mood. There must be some period of time (however short) when the appropriate response to a <b>keep</b> result that is disagreed with is deletion review. Otherwise articles could spend time perpetually in AfD. Logically a <b>keep</b> vote as a concensus of the community of the validity of an article should have consequences. To renominate it within a couple of months in the hope that different users will contribute to the debate, seems improper. It is analogous to starting a court case and losing, suspecting that another judge might take a different view, and relitigating the case. I would hope that such nominations could be treated as an abuse of process. At the very least a new argument for deletion not raised at the previous AfD should be needed. This would serve as the counterpart for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> G4 (recreation of deleted material).

<dd>There's no "X months before renominating" because different cases require different time periods. A candidate who is going up for election next Tuesday may be eligible for re-nomination in a few weeks, whereas a failing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> might be better reviewed in several months. To lay down some sort of hard and fast time limit begs for rules lawyering, IMO. I think in most cases articles that come up for renomination too soon get sympathy keeps, which is not exactly proper but a self-correcting balance on most abuses of the system. Personally, I usually wait at least a month or two, even for something like Carlsbad grimple which was pretty clearly a hoax. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 16:00, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Time shouldn't be the criterion ... content change should be, in my opinion. If an article survives an AfD and a month later is a) unchanged and b) re-nominated at AfD, it should be speedy kept based on the previous result. If, however, the article has substantially changed, then another trip to AfD could be justified very soon after survival the first time around. The comment above ("Repeated attempts at AFD" section above) in support of 'gaming the system' with appropriately targeted 'get out the vote campaigns' until the desired result is achieved is exactly how the system is <b>not</b> supposed to work, and predicating acceptance at AfD on content change would help to reduce the influence of 'system gamers'. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 00:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would argue that it's not necessarily change to the content but change to the circumstances. If the content got worse, then the page should be reverted, not AFD'd. On the other hand, if the consensus opinion of the original decision was "keep pending rewrite" and after a month or three the article remains <i>un</i>changed (that is, still unimproved), that would be reasonable grounds for a renomination - the fact that no one has been able (or willing) to fix the concerns raised during the discussion is a new fact that may be considered by a subsequent discussion. Likewise, if the decision was "no consensus" because the facts being argued in the discussion were unclear, a renomination may be in order as soon as the relevant facts become known.<br />
Premature nominations and attempts to game the system are bad for the project and should be shouted down when they occur. But I do not think that the project would be best served by attempting to impose time-based criteria on renominations. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 05:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are some limited cases where that might be in order; for instance, if notability is not established in the article, but evidence is presented during AfD or on the talk page that establishes notability, retention of the article contingent on inclusion of such information wouldn't be out of order.

<dd>"Keep pending rewrite" happens when the community is skeptical that the article <i>can</i> be cleaned up (without, for example, violating NPOV, NOR or one of our other core policies) but is willing to give the "keep" voters the benefit of doubt. I've argued for a number of articles that way. Sometimes I've been successful with the rewrite and turned them into usable articles. Other times, I had to admit defeat and ended up renominating the page myself. "Keeps" are often contingent. That flexibility of outcome is part of why we are so insistent that this is a discussion, not a vote.<br />
Unfortunately, it seems more common that AFD participants argue "keep - it could be cleaned up" then abdicate any responsibility for actually helping with that cleanup.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Multiple nominees</span></h2>
<p>This might have been dealt with over and over again, but I just want to point out some inconsistency in the way the multiple nomination procedure is applied. The suggested criteria on the main AfD page gives such examples as "a non-notable book and articles about all its characters", or "a non-notable band and articles about its members". What I don't see is "a non-notable mall and every other article about a mall on wikipedia". But this is how many users (in perfectly good faith) apply the criteria; for a current example, look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_19#Team_Carbon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_19#Team_Carbon" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is not egregious but it is symptomatic. I would like to emphasize that in the past month, during which I have been particularly active on AfD pages, I have not yet seen a mass nomination that <i>hasn't</i> resulted in conflicts and debate over the procedure rather than the article(s) at hand. See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CAT1-X_Hyperion_Gundam_series" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CAT1-X_Hyperion_Gundam_series" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It also leads to users going on mini-vendettas (which is <i>fine</i> IMO) against perhaps non-notable churches, schools, etc, but then nominating them all in a <b>huge</b> bundle with the explanation that "these are all non-notable churches." Does this perhaps suggest that a tweak to that part of the AfD procedure guidelines might be in order? Has this topic already been done to death, and no one even wants to talk about it anymore? If so I apologize, but if not, I'd like to see other opinions.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 09:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ahh I was just about to add a message suggesting something. Since the examples I cite are counter to the given guidelines, perhaps an additional bullet in that section to clarify that multiple-nominating is <b>not</b> intended for x,y,z purpose - so then editors and admins can refer to something concrete in asking that the mass-nominees be un-bundled.

<dd>Perhaps I am misinterpreting your comment, but as it is written above it appears you believe he is suggesting that the article should not be deleted. The statement makes no such claim. He's simply saying that quality of an article is <b>not</b> a consideration for AfD. He further states that the real concern for an AfD is whether or not the article should be on the wiki. Both of these statements are basic policy. Yes, in the full discussion he does indeed give reasons for a Keep, but these arguments are based on notability, as they should be.

<dd>Thanks for the prompt response. I do not believe that he is suggesting the article should not be deleted. To me, the quality of the article is not in question (as you point out and has been pointed out on this page, poor quality is not grounds for deletion, but improvement). Quality and original research are not necessarily linked. A well written article can still be original research. The point I made in the afd is that the article is original research (and I outlined the reasons why I believe it is), which according to this page, is grounds for deletion. Is the question of whether or not an article is original research and therefore should be deleted, overridden when the purported subject of the article is decided to be notable?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia Day Awards</span></h2>
<p>Hello, all. It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza's</a> proposal for an appreciation week to end on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Day_df16.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Day">Wikipedia Day</a>, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebrartion of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007. I have created yet another new subpage for myself (a weakness of mine, I'm afraid) at <a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadbilltucker_Appreciation_Week_a49f.html" title="User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week">User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week</a> where I would greatly appreciate any indications from the members of this project as to whether and how they might be willing and/or able to assist in recognizing the contributions of our editors.

<p>So I read some stuff and I thought it's a great thing to put on talk pages when articles get deleted and people complain about it but don't understand notability requirements.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<table class="messagebox standard-talk" style="color: #C54400; border: 2px solid #FF0000; text-align: center; font-size: larger; text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold;" align="center">

Comments, questions, and new sections are welcome.</td>

<p>It could probably use revising. The main thing is the virtual classroom article is very easy to read and comprehendable as opposed to the longer, more detailed things on the policy page.

<dd>Elaragirl's new version is better.

<p>Elera's is more easy to read then the Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted and the policy pages, which both sound like reading the Encyclopedia Britanica.

<p>I posted two different ways of archiving AFD debates at <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_AfD_1123.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors/AfD">User:Trialsanderrors/AfD</a>. They're based on the new archiving system we just implemented at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. There are two advantages for this sytem: For one, it removes the discussion (but not the result) of closed debates from log pages, so it becomes easier to look for open debates; and for two, instead of creating a {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}} (or as I like to call it, "Old awful") box on the talk page, as the discussion can simply be transcluded to the talk page. The two versions differ by whether the discussion can be viewed by uncollapsing the archive box (easier to access, but more load on the log pages) or whether the discussion can be viewed only by clicking on the "AfD" link (harder to access, but reduces load on the log page). One thing I haven't implemented is a field for closers to explain their reasoning. The proposed system would be based on templates similar to {{<a href="../../../d/r/t/Template%7EDrt_659d.html" title="Template:Drt">drt</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../d/r/b/Template%7EDrb_7e31.html" title="Template:Drb">drb</a>}}, which are currently used to close deletion review debates.

<p>Both of Trialsanderrors' proposals look great to me. It obsoletes a bunch of Javascript I wrote but who cares about that&#160;:) If I were to choose between the two I wouldn't focus on downlod time as it isn't much of a problem for me and it's really only a hack to save download time anyway since a page of unclosed debates is still just as long. But I don't have a strong preference between the two, both are improve on the status quo. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-01-01 00:39Z</small></i></span></p>

A world famous translator (sorry if you haven't heard of him) was proposed for deletion because he failed the google test--look him up in Barnes and Noble, people with fewer book listings are all over Wikipedia, and this guy doesn't even write in English! The arguments will still be offered, no one will read the link, and it will just clutter the page. Yeah, just challenge.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A couple of ideas</span></h2>
<p>As we all know, debates added towards the end of the day attract less attention than those added at the beginning. I commented on this on the mailing list and a couple of really good ideas came up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new debates at the top. Yup, very simple. We do it with some discussion pages, it's simple to do and it means that people won't lose interest before they get to the newest debates.</li>
<li>Transclude the previous day's debates at the bottom of a new day's debates. Do this in a &lt;noinclude&gt; in case people forget to knock it off during maintenance. Or do it only at /today.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>I think we should try to standardize top- or bottom adding over our forums. Top-adding seems to makes more sense because it gives the newest additons the most attention. On transcluding yesterday's debates to today's log, I don't think that's feasible since we're already running 150+ debates per day. We could possibly create a "last 100/150/200" log page though. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Both those proposals make sense to me. Top-adding should be done ASAP in my opinion, the first AfD always gets a lot more comments than the last few and this is a simple way to try to correct that. A last 150/200 page log would work pretty well I think (adding all the previous day's debates would bloat today's log). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have been feeling for some time now that this sort of thing is a major problem for wikipedia. It is very easy for bias and censorship to jump in here: wikipedia votes for deletion are usually only voted on by a few dozen editors, out of the hundreds of thousands of people who might read an article. It does not take much soliciting to go on to swing a vote. Votes are generally not vetted for honesty: it is trivial for someone to give a bogus rationale for their vote (e.g. declare that they are voting for an article to be deleted on the basis that it violates a wiki policy, when in fact it does not) - who checks? who decides the number of votes cast was representative of a sensible cross-section of the wikipedia community? --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 17:56, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The closing admin vets the comments and decides all those issues. This is exactly why 1) we are <i>discussing</i> the article, <a href="../../../v/i/e/WP%7EVIE_cf5b.html" title="WP:VIE">not voting</a> and 2) we <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">restrict the closing</a> of AFD discussions to experienced administrators in almost all cases. By the way, to answer the first question, solicitation of "votes" is strongly and actively discouraged and, when discovered, will almost always backfire, resulting in a raft of comments that the solicitor acted in bad faith and causing those solicited "votes" to be discounted (to some degree) by the closing admin.

<dd>Really? This all surprises me.

These ideas do not appear to be pseudoscience (at least, from what little I've checked). Some merger might possibly be considered, because with so little peer-reviewed discussion, having three different articles might be excessive. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 21:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Subject: [Wikipedia-l] Entries for deletion.... issues from the Third World

Hi all, I'm from India, a contributor to the Wikipedia. In recent
times, the 'mortality' of new Wikipedia entries seems to be higher
than usual. While one can understand the need for abundant caution,
it's also important to allow for a diversity of concerns and issues in
this space.

Should we presume that because an initiative is not very visible in
cyberspace (okay, we are under-digitised societies!) that it is not
prominent or noteworthy? See as one example:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikalp This is a campaign against
censorship of documentary film in India, one which has the
participation of about 250 documentary film-makers.

There must be some way out. Your suggestions would be welcome. FN

<p>Thanks for posting this. It is very true that several AfDs require rigorous research rather than relatively simple Google searches to ascertain verifiability. (You don't even need a language barrier or a less privileged country of origin to fall in to this trap.) While it is unfortunate that the original authors (some who may be relatively new, i.e. <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>) of the article may not have done thorough scholarly research, their not doing so does not necessarily mean the article should be a speedy delete or even nominated for an AfD. Time permitting, I am willing to help editors who sincerely request a bit of scholarly research on any topic. Is there a good place for me to list my signature so people can ask for assistance? I understand that canvassing and advertising are not the way to go, and that is not what I'm talking about here. Maybe I'm talking about copyediting? <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 14:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The etiquette standard should be the same as RfC</span></h2>
<p>Currently the AfD etiquette standard is</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't reorder comments on the deletion page to group them by keep/delete/other.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this should be adjusted so that the page follows the same "arguement for/arguement against" structure as the RfC's with the person calling for its deletion to have a few sentences explaining their position and a few sentences following by a person who wish it to remain. Both statements should be signed and neither signitor should be given a vote. If a person or admin is biased against a work their statement on top with a large gap between that and the oppossing arguement is unfair. Wikipedia does not allow this for the less controversal outcomes of AfD and insists on the structure I advocate here for Afd, as per</p>

</dl>
<p>so it makes no sense that for the more drastic arguement around Afd that a lesser standard is accepted.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 17:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But RfCs are not meant to enact something, they are meant to allow people to easily see the arguments for or against something, for which they have to be close to each other. Seperating&#160;!votes into seperate camps on an AfD only encourages vote counting as a substitute for rational argument. Look at RfA. It splits votes between "support", "oppose", and "neutral", and it basically <i>is</i> a vote; rarely will a bureaucrat consider the actual arguments made. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 17:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We've tried splitting the comments into "keep" and "delete" sections before. The experiment failed. It had the following adverse effects on the discussions:
<ol>
<li>It became much much harder to match changing consensus when the article or the facts presented changed. In a strictly chronological discussion, it's easy to see that "all comments made after the rewrite were keep" or "all comments made after <i>fact a</i> was discovered were delete". When you presort the comments, you have to sort out every timestamped signature.</li>
<li>Conditional comments became much harder to figure out. Where do you sign your name when you really mean "keep if X turns out to be true but delete otherwise"? How do you categorize "merge or delete"? It's confusing for the discussion participants and impossible for closing admins.</li>
<li>It tended to polarize the "voters" into competing camps. We already have too much adversarial nonsense and emotion getting into these discussions. Presorting the "votes" made it worse.</li>
<li>When AFD discussions are vandalized (and they frequently are), it made sorting out and fixing the vandalism much harder. Walking through the edit history is simpler if the discussion is still basically chronological.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Your proposal also goes beyond the previous experiments by limiting the arguments for and against to those made by two initial participants (who then may not "vote"). This shuts down the possibility that other participants in the discussion will have new facts to add to the debate. This would be a bad thing for Wikipedia.

<dd>&lt;grin&gt; I'm flattered to be used as an example now, but while I haven't been struck by lightning (or otherwise warned or cautioned) for starting that AfD, I'll just point out that the articles are not deleted and that no conclusion on what type of discussion is needed for these has been made yet... If you want to mass nominate articles, you can a) start with one to set a precedent (make it clear in the AfD nomination that that is the objective, or you'll get "why did you single out this one" counterarguments) - if theis AfD is successful, nominate the other ones all at once or in batches of e.g. 20 (like is done with the towers AfD we recently had), or b) just go for it and nominate them all. Make fairly certain that they are very comparable (i.e. not some more notable than others), or people will start complaining (I wont, I like mass nominations, but I seem to be an exception). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Listing of all previous AfDs on a given one?</span></h2>
<p>Question: on AfDs, why don't we make a procedure of listing all previous AfDs at the top of a page for review? For example, on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%285th_Nomination%29_69ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Nihilist Underground Society (5th Nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Nihilist Underground Society (5th Nomination)</a>, that article is up now for the 5th time. I put a comment just now in that copied the multi-AfD table from the Article's talk page. Wouldn't it make sense to just have someone put this by default at the head of each AfD page, for complete disclosure of an article's history? <a href="../../../f/2E/f/User%7EF.F.McGurk_e625.html" title="User:F.F.McGurk">F.F.McGurk</a> 18:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My opinion is to ditch the WP:AfD/Blablabla (5th nomination) format and to create subdirectories WP:AfD/Blablabla/1, /2, ... /5, etc. Simplifies using the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfdx_3821.html" title="Template:Afdx">afdx</a>}} tags too. The main page could contain the summaries of the previous AfD's or, if my proposal to reformat the closed debate boxes will ever get adopted, the transcluded discussion, and of course every individual subpage will automatically have a link to the WP:AfD/Blablabla main page. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think (hope?) that this would be unnecessary overhead for the vast majority of deletion discussions. What proportion really turn out to be repeat nominations/discussions? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The nominator should note any previous nominations under the current name when nominating, yes. If they have not read the talk page/deletion log, then they have not done their homework. However, failing that, I have to agree with Rossami that it's overkill to rework the entire structure to avoid this problem. Adding something to the instructions should be sufficient. The bigger problem I can't sort out is when you go to the deletion record and end up at the first one, with no indication that others have taken place. Would it be worth documenting future AFDs on the talk page of the prior ones? -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 02:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My proposal is actually to achieve the exact opposite, to simplify a whole number of steps. For instance, editors now need to know the difference between {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">Afd</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfdx_3821.html" title="Template:Afdx">Afdx</a>}}. For every repeat nomination using {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfdx_3821.html" title="Template:Afdx">afdx</a>}} the nominations have to be corrected manually to remove the "(Nth nomination)" from header and {{<a href="../../../l/a/_/Template%7ELa_6d37.html" title="Template:La">la</a>}} template. The {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}}, which has to be written by hand, could simply be replaced by a transclusion of the main AfD page, etc. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:04, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The user should not have to manually correct the repeat nominations. {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfdx_3821.html" title="Template:Afdx">afdx</a>}} defaults to "2nd" but it's a parameterized template and can be used to enter any level of nomination. For subsequent nominations, the user types {{subst:afdx|3rd}}. If you follow the process properly, I don't know of anything you have to correct by hand. But I'm pretty sure you knew that so maybe I'm not understanding your concern yet. Now, I will concede that knowing the difference between afd and afdx is complex - but it only occurs in a small number of cases. If I understood the proposal correctly, we'd be adding a layer of complexity to <i>all</i> deletion discussions just to deal with a minority which are repeated incorrectly. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The idea is creation of a process which puts the encyclopedia before deletion and is improve first and delete only if necessary. Additionally, discussions should be informed by the informed. Also, de-centralizing allows the inclusionism-deletionism dichotomy not to play into discussions as much (can't just go down the list: keep, keep, keep; or delete, delete, delete).</p>

<dd>I'd decentralize even further, because centralised discussions generally <i>do not scale</i> along with the growing size of wikipedia.

<dd>WikiProjects tend to scale themselves more-or-less adequately (as, being largely social structures, they collapse if they don't); so splitting along those lines ought to work. Having said that, there are two points of interest here:
<ul>
<li>How to we deal with articles that fit into multiple project's scopes? (This usually happens when a topical project and a national project intersect.) Presumably we can double-transclude subpages, if we're still using separate ones for each discussion; but somebody needs to figure out how that'll work in terms of keeping lists synchronized.</li>
<li>To avoid people trying to do silly things with the creation of ever-more-specific sub-projects, it may be worthwhile to have some sort of benchmark before a project is eligible to have discussions funneled to it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Decentralization makes it nearly impossible to check if someone is tampering with the process since presumable less people are watching the debate. People in relevant projects tend to be biased on the subjects they like. An outside view can be very useful in a debate. Decentralization makes it hard for people to casually browse the list of debates to find a topic they can comment on, which could be subjects they don't "like" but might have valuable insights about. It only causes more work. However, "If a topic is deleted because it does not have sources, a noticeboard could be kept for such articles" is a good point. Before something gets deleted for lack of sources, people at relevant projects should be asked to try and verify it. That way everyone can still easily participate yet articles get the attention they need to be vetted by experts. By the way, I see no scaling problems yet. We had a massive increase in member numbers, but the number of "voters" in AFDs haven't changed much, it's only the controversial ones that draw out big numbers. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We could of course try to get the best from both worlds. Have all debates listed in a central place, but also relevant project deletion pages to attract the experts. Some projects already have relevant noticeboards. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:50, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This would balkanize the project, fragmenting it into a collection of only vaguely associated "WikiProjects". It would not only allow but encourage the creation of ever smaller specialty "projects" populated solely by those interested in keeping their little community of pages alive. It would become extremely difficult to reinject balance into discussions once a small community decided on a particular course even if that course was at odds with the will of the larger community or even at odds with the goals of the project. Deletion is one of the most important decisions which we make about an article. The AFD process puts that decision in front of the largest possible community of editors.<br />
By the way, there already is an experiment in the categorization of AFDs. The purpose of the categorization was to raise visibility among the "project" people but without disenfranchising the rest of the community. I haven't looking in on the categorization experiment lately. If it's not working then we need to know why before proposing another round of the same. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:57, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>How do you expect people to manage this? Stub types come roughly 1 per Wikiproject, and the people who actually affix stub tags do not use them. Why? Because there are so many that you have to consult a list to pick one.

<li><b>Commment</b> "Deletion is one of the most important decisions which we make about an article."

<li>I'm not saying better, just interested: i.e. more likely to research beyond just Google, more likely to not drive-by "nn d", etc. Standards should not be dropped: reliable sources, verified material, etc should still be required, but with editors who care more than your AfD regular. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 02:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I've found google to lag a bit in the sciences and to have some surprising omissions, leading to debates that never would have taken place had one person in the field been consulted. For example <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_optimum.html" title="Thermal optimum">Thermal optimum</a> was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Thermal_optimum_cbe2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thermal optimum">nominated</a> based on "Very few Google hits which are not ambiguous or Wiki mirrors." And other reasons which are not necessarily part of the AfD process. This would probably surprise biologists, ecologists, climate change scientists, paleontologists, and quaternary geologists that google has only a few hits on a basic term. But what is, is.</li>
<li>And any handy biologist or geologist would have known the functional use of the term, and how to research it, and would have said "huh?" they're questioning sea level rise with a thermal optimum as POV? I can't even quite think where the nominator is going with that. It's a thermal optimum, so there is less water stored in ice, what do they think sea levels do? Or are they questioning the amount of rise, because they know so much about the topic they know the expected rise is much greater or much less--in which case they know it shouldn't be deleted? "This is an unsourced one sentence stub (since August 2005)related to sea level and global temperature. <b>Very few Google hits which are not ambiguous or mirrors of this Wikipedia article.</b> In relation to current controversies of climate change, the article should be fleshed out or deleted. It seems POV to say the "Thermal optimum" would have the sea levels 5 to 6 meters higher than now. Edison 17:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)" The AfD started somewhere that someone with a small bit of knowledge on the topic never would have gone.

Should there be an article in Wikipedia on the endosperm of <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nuphar.html" title="Nuphar">Nuphar</a> if it discusses the embryology of the Laurales from an article on the phylogenetic systematics of that order? Probably.

<li>Which is why I have a problem with making AfD debates decentralized, and instead based around Wikiprojects. That encourages a "We're the experts, so we're right" mindset, while also directing articles to people who are most likely to have some bias. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Serious problems with this proposal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notability <i>is</i> defined unambiguously, people just ignore the guidelines or invoke it when irrelevant. Fixing debates to focus on policy and broader consensus guidelines, instead of serving as simple votes, is going to be <i>harder</i> under this, not easier.</li>
<li>Projects have their own specific interests. Forcing debates to take place on their 'home territory' will hurt AfD's effect of shining light into dark corners of wikipedia where bad articles have been created. I've nominated several articles for deletion that would have never made it if only fans of the topic participated. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 02:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Two things:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are usually 10 different current log pages; 15 topic-oriented pages would be only 5 more&#160;:].</dd>
<dd>Also, what is inherently wrong with a project of people devoted to preserving and improving encyclopedia articles? Is it so wrong that, say, the Military history WikiProject would want to discuss lesser battles and choose to merge them into organized groups versus deleting because 10 AfD regulars haven't heard of them and all the sources are in these "book" things and not online?</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I am banking on these sort of debates not happening often. There are usually over 100 discussions on a log page, but I wouldn't expect more than five or so history related pages be proposed for deletion a month (I could be very wrong of course&#160;:]). And if a "WikiProject Green Day fan clubs" were to surface, I'm sure the community would be fully capable of MfDing and wouldn't let it try to impose ridiculous notability standards on clearly unencyclopedic articles. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 02:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't like this idea. Subject-related wikiprojects work well as they are, largely outside the centralized processes of Wikipedia bureaucracy. They shouldn't be co-opted into 'official' roles in the deletion process. Worse, this would only create another meta-process to decide if Wikiproject X is large enough/has enough members/etc. to host deletion debates. Under the existing system, wikiprojects whose scope includes large numbers of AfDs already often have deletion noticeboards, which seem to serve their function a bit <i>too</i> well; no need to reinforce those tendencies further. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Why are we even discussing this? WikiProjects are invited to organize their own deletion sorting pages, but putting the discussions into their domain is not only impracticable, but also unencyclopedic. We're a repository of general knowledge, not a jumble of disconnected subject wikis. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is certainly one of the most positive initiatives for cleaning up the AfD, and the sooner it can be implemented the better. As it's currently designed it certainly insures that a small ignorant group will maintain control of the process, rather than a more sophisticated group that knows what it's talking about. Breaking this up into small parts will bring more eyes into the process because the lists will be smaller. Informed people will not need to wade through long lists of topics about which they know nothing. This will be especially helpful for biographical articles where a title in a person's name gives no clue of what that person does.</p>
<p>The arguments against have more to do with people protecting their turf than about making Wikipedia any better. The cries to have everyone participate in every deletion discussion show a deep disconnection from reality. Nobody can effectively do this. Nobody can be so diligent as to deal with all these nominations fairly; it's impossible. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 10:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Segmented within AfD</span></h3>
<p>While I believe it is a good idea to capitalize on the social structures and specialized content guidelines of WikiProjects (all of their members are editors after all, even in good standing sometimes), perhaps segmenting by topic without branching out of AfD's corner of the 'pedia would be beneficial. In addition to the arguments stated earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current log pages are long to an unreasonable degree.</li>
<li>Categories cannot be watchlisted.</li>
<li>Organizing by topic will attract more interested and informed comments (hopefully).</li>
</ul>
<p>This wouldn't be a radical revision of the deletion mindset or process, merely a reorganization.

<dd>Except organization by topic will not work. First off, some things do not fit neatly into topics, so there are certain to be "no, this belongs in <i>my</i> AfD list, not yours!" edit wars. And second, arranging by topic, while it may attract more informed comments (which I still don't think is necessarily better), makes it hard to start a discussion, because you <i>must</i> know the topic you should put it under.

<dd>I don't see that that's a bad thing that someone nominating an AfD must know enough about it to know where to categorize it--how could you otherwise know it doesn't belong in Wikipedia if you know nothing about the topic? And, getting some expertise in might, again, forestall some of the more ridiculous AfDs that are entirely based on the editor nominating because <i>they</i> don't know a thing about the topic. There is a lot of wasted energy in the AfDs. In addition, yes, the lists of AfDs are incredibly long.</dd>

Should it be deleted by a group of people who don't know anything about translations or translators, simply <i>because they don't know anything about translations and translators</i> and since this translator failed the google test and <i>must</i> be non-notable?

If an article is deleted because people who have sources don't see it, then it can be created later with sources, and Wikipedia has lost nothing except some unsourced material. On the other hand, if military related AfDs are a seperate group, then you have a bunch of military experts commenting, and really only them.

<p>Much of this discussion is assuming there are non-trivial numbers of AfDs for obscure military battles, science terms, and people in narrow academic fields, such that consulting an expert in the subject would seem useful, and that such an expert could easily locate sources. Looking at any AfD log suggests that the vast majority of deletions are for bands, companies, websites, and entertainers; allowing self-proclaimed internet experts on these things to claim deletion debates as 'theirs' seems like a self-evidently bad idea. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I don't make this assumption. Most of the articles up for deletion appear to me to be an article somebody wrote about their best friend from high school (who got mentioned in a newspaper once), or their grandfather who once met someone famous. Heck, one of my grandfathers gets slightly over 400 ghits, and a credible number of references in scholar for his papers and books, with a couple of huge dedication biographies from prestigious scentific organization, and he's not in Wikipedia, although some images of his work, and some organisms he studied are. (The other one, thank God, isn't in Wikipedia, either, although he, too, gets more ghits than a lot of Wikipedia notable-enoughs.)</dd>
<dd>And, yes, I do see a problem with the WikiProjects owning articles. I knew if Unicerosauras or whatever it is called went to WikiProject Dinosaurs, someone there would want to keep that piece of crap, and, in fact, one of the most respected (by me) editors there wanted to keep it. But what harm is there in this, even though I argued against WikiProjects for this very reason, that we keep borderline articles on the basis of people with more knowledge arguing for keeping them? I just saved an obscure article from speedy deletion, about someone I didn't know, but who was connected to a lot of people I knew about. What harm transpired that this article wasn't speedy deleted, but was instead brought up to stub-snuff? If Wikipedia starts approaching the limits of its bandwidth/space, or whatever it's called, it becomes a different story, but if the article is about something notable enough, what harm to keep? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there's no harm in having a wikiproject noticeboard for AfDs and having people keep an eye out for relevant pages, possibly augmented by a bot that notifies wikiprojects when pages with their tag on the talk page are marked for deletion? That way, interested parties know about the debate even if they aren't watching the page. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:02, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This sounds like a good idea; though I still think that having people take articles they have problems with to a wikiproject first, and for deletion only if everyone agrees that it doesn't merit an article would do wonders for our overall quality. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 04:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Seems it'd do wonders for the amount of time invested in deleting articles on fictional weaponry. Again, I don't see the problem here of perfectly legitimate articles getting deleted via AfD because no one with an interest in/knowledge of the subject noticed the discussion. (Inappropriate speedy-tagging, I think, is a much more common problem.) My experience is the opposite; articles that are long and have references sections get default-keep votes from people who don't know anything about the subject and don't realize the sources provided are unreliable/misrepresented/irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>The idea of a bot-assisted deletion noticeboard isn't a bad one, though the projects that find themselves with so many deletions that they need a bot to keep track, might want to fix their articles themselves. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 07:01, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have today been the subject of censure by <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc glasgow</a> for completing AfD's (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gay_icon_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gay_icon_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/2Advanced" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/2Advanced" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) that other users have nominated, but for which the process has not been completed properly - this usually involves creating the AfD discussion and/or adding the AfD tag to the page. I've been doing this for several months without critisism; I quote the reasons given by the nominator from any source (edit summaries, talk pages) that I can find, and state that my opinion is neutral. Can I confirm that my behaviour has been incorrect, and what I should have done in this, and other similar cases, is to delete the entry from the log file? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 17:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the problem in those cases was that there wasn't a case for deletion, so it wasn't really a nomination. If they've just made a mistake in listing and there is some reasoning <i>somewhere</i>, then I think it's fine to list, quoting their reasoning and stating you're neutral. If there's no reason, however, then there's no need/point in listing the article for deletion. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'll just delete any nominations that don't specify a reason, and advise the nominator appropriately, in future. The anon nominator of the <a href="../../../2/a/d/2Advanced_82fa.html" title="2Advanced">2Advanced</a> AfD _did_ specify a reason, albeit a very short one; should this be re-activated, or shall we let it go as a glitch in the system? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 17:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would say it should be reactivated. The anon did provide a reason to delete it, so it should be discussed. It would seem that the only reason 2Advanced was closed was because Gay icon was, which isn't a valid reason. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 22:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To me the crucial element is whether the original nominator's reason for deletion can be ascertained. If they can, then listing the incomplete AfD noms is fine. If not, then there's no way to know if its a genuine, trolling, or just a delettion request with no policy to support it. Nonetheless, we don't reopen closed AfDs. The correct process is either to seek <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> or to start a new AfD. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 22:27, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Apologies, I misread the <a href="../../../2/a/d/2Advanced_82fa.html" title="2Advanced">2Advanced</a> one and somehow didn't notice the reason (I'll blame tiredness). That one could have stayed open, in my opinion, despite the reason being fairly brief, but others might think differently. Not really worth a DRV, but someone could relist it with an expanded nom if they think it's worth deleting. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doc G's behavior is unsupported by <a href="../../../c/s/k/WP%7ECSK_91ce.html" title="WP:CSK">WP:CSK</a>, which allows speedy keeps only in cases of unambiguous vandalism. The prior Gay icon AfD survived on two delete and one keep&#160;!votes, so that's certainly not an unambiguous endorsement. I'm not sure about <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowpedia_0ef3.html" title="User:Knowpedia">User:Knowpedia</a>'s motivation though, s/he tagged it for speedy deletion before without giving a reason. Since s/he's an established editor I would've removed the listing and guided him/her to the proper instructions. The 2Advanced article clearly suffers from a dearth of secondary sourcing, so that's a perfectly good call to nominate it for deletion, and certainly no reason whatsoever to cut the AfD short. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
