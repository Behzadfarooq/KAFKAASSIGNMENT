<p>How do we put deletion bait on Wikipedia? Let us count the ways:vanity, promotional, non-notability (no Google hits for this) and what can <i>you</i> put forth? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Google the filmmaker Eric Norcross and you will see some fan sites as well as listings on various other sites like famouspeople.com I object to this decision whole-heartedly. Please dispute with me through my talk section before taking action.</p>

<dd>This isn't a <i>decision</i>, this is a <i>proposal</i>. And we will "dispute" it <i>here</i>, not on your talk page (which I won't be able to find if you don't <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">sign your posts</a>), because that's what this forum is for.</dd>

<dd>In any event, filmmakers considered notable enough for Wikipedia do not automatically make notable movies. If I didn't find anything about the movie on Google, it does not get to acquire notability by having a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 06:05, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're saying that your God? Let's say (hypothetically now) that someone somewhere wants to know more about this man or his films--where are they going to go? One of those measly fan sites that have absolutely very little or even worse: incorrect information about the man and his projects? This is the perfect place for his biography.</p>

WHAT HAS HAPPENED ON THIS WEBSITE IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF FLAMING--THOSE WHO ARE NEW. I AM LEAVING THIS WEBSITE FOR GOOD AND ALL as I know now that there is no hope for this place.

<dd>Katherine, how are we supposed to write a useful encyclopedia if we don't have a set of standards that govern what we will allow ourselves to publish? How are we supposed to verify that your submissions are accurate, for example, if this movie has never been covered in the press? I hope you'll read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and understand why we have these debates. I assure you that nobody here has anything against you personally - it's just that many, many people try to use Wikipedia to publish announcements, opinionated statements, or unverifiable information. It's nothing personal - these articles just do not meet Wikipedia's standards. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 06:44, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> and possible Speedy as the article makes no claims of notability, user's ranting on this AfD page notwithstanding. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 06:45, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I believe this user would have reacted the way she did regardless of how the nomination was phrased. As noted below, she went and vandalized not only my page but the pages of everyone supporting deletion, blanked this, then blanked the warnings she got at her own talk page. In any event, see "Joseph Cipriano" somewhere in the AfD archives for an example of someone who similarly lost it with a nomination that was a lot calmer. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Let's not bite the newcomers in nomination statements. To the page creator: I understand how much work this project represents. Enter the project in some film festivals and get it into the IMDB. Then you can recreate this listing. Save the article text now so that you can paste it back when you have appropriate references.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: AFAICT this user is not involved in the making of this film. She seems to be just a very devoted fan. Hell hath no fury like a groupie scorned, I guess. I wonder if (based on her comments here) she has some issues with the people who did the other fan sites and this is her way of trying to get back.</dd>
<dd>Also note the recently created <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricnorcross_ec25.html" title="User:Ericnorcross">User:Ericnorcross</a> page, with this bit of personal philosophy: <i>I find Wikipedia to be nothing more than an internet web-board, designed to let those around you decide what's true or not. If they don't believe you or cannot provide proof, it must be false. Bullies.</i> It was used for some of the attempts to remove the AfD notice. I wonder if this is a sockpuppet account, but I'll wait and see. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Neither of us know this person. Good faith assumes she either worked on the project or is good friends with people who did. I really find your comment "Hell hath no fury like a groupie scorned" and speculation about sock puppets to be inappropriate. This article fails to meet Wikipedia standards. I hope it does become encyclopedic after a few months on the festival circuit. There's no need to mock the editor. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 20:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I checked the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ericnorcross/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/ericnorcross/" rel="nofollow">one site</a> which <i>is</i> devoted to the film and promoting it. Given the relatively minuscule budgets of most independent films, if she were involved in any way she'd be credited there. Googling on her name plus his <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qka&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Eric+Norcross%22%2BKatherine%2BJohnson&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qka&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Eric+Norcross%22%2BKatherine%2BJohnson&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">produces nothing</a> that would suggest her involvement with him in any professional way.</dd>
<dd>Yes, it would be nice for him (at least) if this did one day rate an article. However, it's not now, and there is no prejudice against recreation, though I think it would be better if it was by someone who took the time to understand how things are done here before they went and posted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 06:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--As a native New Yorker I can assure you this film exists and it is quite popular--and steadily gaining. If you want to prove your experiment to be a success--do not vote it out. I've been monitoring this for the last two days and have found just as much negativity from the experienced Wikipedians as from the author herself. All she did was write an honest article.-- <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 66.161.23.201 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.161.23.201_056d.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.161.23.201">contribs</a>) 21:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
