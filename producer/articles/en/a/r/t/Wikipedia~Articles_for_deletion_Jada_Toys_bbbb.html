<dd>I'd say Wikipedia is not the right place for that, in any case, don't start lists of whatever in sub pages if the main page of a subject is not done~, and don't copy/paste huge lists of 'stuff' nobody will know what they are because you're not saying on the page. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> 13:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC) While I'm at it, don't give your pages 'LISTS' as a title either. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> 13:55, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I build this online or do I have to build it offline and upload it somehow when it's done?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Articles can be written online, however, make sure the first version you post is at least a decent skeleton asserting the context, importance of the subject etc, otherwise, this <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">afD</a> is what happens.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A skeleton is exactly what I was building, but it's hard to add the content you're expecting from me when someone keeps deleting it or changing it before I've finished.</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Jada Toys is indeed a <a href="http://www.jadatoys.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.jadatoys.com/" rel="nofollow">real company</a>], their "hook" is a more urban, larger scale form of diecast car (1:55 compared to the usual 1:64). I personally don't care much for these but the local Targets and Kmarts are overflowing with them. I think an article would be appropriate but it needs to be considerably more well written than it is currently.<a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EArenacale_187c.html" title="User:Arenacale">Arenacale</a> 05:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Damn...here I go wandering in as an anon despite promising myself not to and I find an article on a subject I'd written about elsewhere. I thought I'd extend the courtesy of replacing the adspeak with an article I'd done at Wikia's Radio Control wiki. Arenacale hit it on the head; most Jada toy cars are "urbanized" late models with "dub" wheels, stereo amps, candy paint and the like. They also have a line of toy R/C cars. For the record, I've done this as a courtesy to Wikipedia since I do remain active on other Wikia sites. I <b>abstain</b> from voting since I am not an active member of this community nor do I plan to be ever again and I leave it up to the rest of you to decide what to do with this. - Lucky 6.9 07:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--Doggbert 23:09, 30 May 2006 (UTC) Thanks, but you changed the intent of the document to meet your interests of R/C and not what I was trying to create. R/C is a very small portion of what Jada produces. Their primary focus is on diecast collectibles and that is what I was trying to build.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> following cleanup by User:Lucky 6.9. As an additional note their website has Alexa ranking around 160,000 and there are 38 pages listed on Google that link to it, which while not fantastic does at least show its existence, if not so much its notability. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 13:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> --Doggbert 23:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I merely copied what I'd done on another site. You are more than welcome to change the article to suit your original intent just so long as your changes are within this site's guidelines. That's what Wikipedia is all about. The company is notable, the article encyclopedic and you simply can't vote to delete it because it doesn't fit your original vision. Odds are it'll stay, so why not brush up on the tutorials and bring it up to a higher standard? The former Lucky 6.9 via 74.62.5.240 00:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--Doggbert 04:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC) Thanks, but I recommend deleting this based on Equendil's response. The meat of this article was going to be the lists of released diecast pieces that could be maintained by a community of collectors. As Equendil put it "I'd say Wikipedia is not the right place for that".</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. What terrible confusion - why is Doggbert voting against an article he created? In its present state as a five line article it seems perfect. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">Dlohcierekim</a>'s note suggests that it is sufficiently notable to not need references. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:32, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--Doggbert 16:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC) See my response above as to why. If opinions have changed and I'm allowed to create lists then I'll continue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, don't create lists under such a title as 'SERIES' as you did earlier, and at least say what the list is at the top of the article before dumping miles of stuff, and you may have a chance ... <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> 17:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>OK, I've done all I can (and will) do to this. To Doggbert: Sorry about the confusion. I hope you understand Wikipedia a bit better now. To the rest of you: It's been nice swinging by if only for a brief time. Regards, Lucky 6.9 15:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--Doggbert 16:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC) Thanks for the edit. That's basically the same outline I created earlier. I hope it doesn't get deleted again.</p>
