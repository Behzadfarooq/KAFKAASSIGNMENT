<p>I don't believe this website meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Now don't get me wrong the emulator <a href="../../../u/l/t/UltraHLE_b316.html" title="UltraHLE">UltraHLE</a> which they helped distribute widely is (or at least was) notable, no question about it. The website however is not. I suppose we could redirect to UltraHLE but then again, I'd rather have even that choice confirmed through AfD since I've been in disagreement with the creator (and sole editor) of the page. The search "emulators unlimited" on Google returns about 10K hits, not bad but then again not so good given they've existed for 10 years and that of the first 1K hits, only 260 are unique <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22emulators+unlimited%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=280&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22emulators+unlimited%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=280&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>I dont feel that this reason for deletion is appropriate, wikipedia is meant to be based for things also in the past, just because the website isnt as popular now as in its heyday, doesnt mean that during the times your question, that it wasnt a huge aspect of why UltraHLE was popular and infact released and a solid piece of emulation history which provided emulator homepages for its authors to use, without any financial gain.</li>

<p>I am the webmaster of emuunlim.com and any questions on why you dont think that this (alongside other websites included such as Zophars Domain) shouldnt reside on wikipedia please ask, whether you feel that the website didnt have any significance on the emulation/internet regarding media attention and regarding UltraHLE, is souly down to your judgement at this moment of time, im sure that Realityman (Gordon, UltraHLE) will vouch that we played a major part of changing history &amp; bringing it into the forefront (myself being the first person to test it also) of the emulation fans and the media, if you need any more validation, contact Nintendo&#160;:)</p>
<p>want some validation? okay:</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well if you put quotes around "emulators unlimited" it's below a thousand. Note that the search without the quotes is meaningless since it will hit any page with the words "unlimited" and "emulators" in it. The search with the quote tells you that about 1 out of every 1500 of this million and a half hits is relevant to the website. As for the search for emuunlim, yes it does get a lot. Yet half of those are the pages from the site itself! <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=emuunlim&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=emuunlim.com&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=emuunlim&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=e&amp;as_sitesearch=emuunlim.com&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> A quick look at the remainder of the hits shows that the site does not come close to meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The notability of UltraHLE isn't in question here (the links you gave solved that one pretty thoroughly). The link between emuunlim and UltraHLE is harder, and if I ask Realityman, he will probably say you were influential in the distribution of UltraHLE. Unfortunately, Some of Wikipedia's principles are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not Truth</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a>, which means that we couldn't use his statements unless they were published in a third-party reliable source. We also couldn't contact Nintendo for this information for the same reason. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 02:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Emulators Unlimited isn't even the focus of the story linked by Mr Manticore above; the story is about a lawsuit against another company, with later content describing the subsequent announcement of UltraHLE, mentioning that "it relies on illegally copied ROMs." Frankly, a hack based on illegal copying may easily get popularity among a small niche, but it needs real evidence of mainstream coverage to meet WP's standards. I read references to MIME (another game emulator) frequently, but if I ever heard of "Emulators Unlimited", it was in a throwaway context. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>here is the UK's leading PC gaming magazine "PC Zone", covering my website etc in May 1999 just after UltraHLE was released:</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Press coverage consists only of trivial mentions to the website in conjunction with the emulator. The articles linked-to only seem to attest to the notability of the emulator, not the site. The website deserves some mention in the emulator article, but there isn't enough independent info on the site to warrant an article of its own. Being "mentioned" and being "one of the bigger emulation sites" does not meet WP's criteria for sourcing and verifiability. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 14:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've been well acquainted with emulators and emulation sites since about 1998, and the fact I've heard of UltraHLE but not this does not bode well.
