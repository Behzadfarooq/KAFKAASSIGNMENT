First of all the article doesn't represent a Neutral Point of View but just a caricature from the pro-syrian parties of their opponents. The source is Al-Akhbar, nothing but a Hizbollah (the pro-syrian party) newspaper that is very far from neutrality.

<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - This definition has been shared all over the internet already, it is only normal that it's definition be found on a reliable source such as Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - It is very biased and it is a term that an anti lebanese pro syrian writer started, it is very insulting for a lot of lebanese, it promotes sectarianism , very bad decision Wikipedia 14:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Considering the source of this definition, I do not think it deserves any attention as it comes from the Alakhbar newspaper. I guess those who know what is the political inclination of Alakhbar will know that it is far from truth. Moreover, regardless of whether Ahmed Fatfat is doing a good job or not, I do not think anyone else in Lebanon is doing a better job!!! That might seem very sad, but if this term is to included in wikipedia then I suggest the inclusion of some other terms like Nasrallatism. A brief definition of Nasrallahtism is as follows: An ideology equivalent to that of the Nazists. A one minded ideology which believes in mere destruction and which gives no regard to human life. An ideology which only works in ignorant societies, and which grows stronger and stronger through the brain-washing of its supporters. An ideology which puts Nasrallah himself on a godly level, whereas in fact he is just such a fascist which wants political power. There is still more to say, but I would leave it to others to add more. Wikipedia please consider my suggestion. Thank you</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV). This article is NOT neutral but represents ths political views of its author and contains much direct assault on the person of a widely respected political figure in Lebanon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> there should be some more sources if it's "all over the internet already".

<ul>
<li><b>Compromise</b> Would it be an acceptable compromise if the term is kept on Wikipedia, but the reference to politicians removed? it is a fact that the term now exists and has a definition that could be used universally. I do not think there is a copyright over the word Fatfat that is a common word in Arabic beofre being a Last name. so the word can be used in the context the creator seems fit for it Moonsear 15:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - While babysitting this article today, I got a chance to really look at it; try again in a few months or a year and have references from then. We do not have articles on neologisms until they are very widespread and a couple of dudes with some blogs writing about a column from the day before is not enough to convince me this is a "real" word instead of a fad. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 15:47, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - it is a new concept introduced in a very original way, with real world examples. Keeping this article will lead people who refuse the concept to argue against it, and the other to support it. Eventually this process will lead to the reformulation of an objective, scientific concept supported by very well argued concepts and examples.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Please keep it in mind that Angry Arab Assad Abu Khalil is nothing but an anti Lebanese Anti American &amp; Pro Hezbollah &amp; Hamas. His views mean nothing. This is just another attempt to degrade the sunnis in particular &amp; the Christians &amp; Druzes in General. If Wikipedia wants to be another access for these radicals to express their contempt of the Lebanese system, sure go ahead</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This is a very bad joke that is adding nothing but fuel to the civil war fire in Lebanon. keep insulting the Siniora government &amp; keep supporting the Hezbollah Terrorists.

<li><b>Comment</b> for newcomers. Maybe Ahmad Fatfat is doing a great job, maybe not; maybe this neologism is an insightful satire of Fatfat's ideology, maybe it's a sick joke. <i>All that is completely irrelevant to this discussion!</i> The aim of the debate here is to establish whether or not the concept of "Fatfatism" is sufficiently notable and widespread to deserve an article - not to discuss its merits. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkarioffszky_c8b8.html" title="User:Skarioffszky">Skarioffszky</a> 17:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - this is the process in which new ideas become validated, and fatfatism is a legitimate term being born today that will be used by historians and political scientists from here on after to help define shady political figures who share similar traits as fatfat. wikipedia should be enthusiastic about being the first encyclopedia in the world to have this very important term in their archive.

</ul>
<p>Finally, after decades without a word that describes the political trend and ideology of many arab leaders, "fatfatism" is here to help&#160;:)<br />
I am not going to discuss Ahmad Fatfat. But to answer some earlier comments:<br />
- The term "fatfatism" was not started by an "anti-lebanese pro-syrian writer", but by a Lebanese Professor at Berkley!<br />
- Fatfatism does <b>not</b> insult Lebanese or promote secterianism. Fatfatism is merely a term that described a certain attitude in politics followed by many arab leaders (it neither attacks Lebanese nor certain sects).<br />
- As for the reliability of the Al-Akhbar newspaper, this newspaper only mentioned what As'as Abu Khalil defined as Fatfatism. (Also, the newspaper has proved to be reliable by always providing proofs. Check today's paper for an example - 07/12/06.)<br />
One thing is true, the term is very recent, and not much references are available <i>yet</i>. <b>But</b> the term is spreading like fire! It is widespread now in Lebanon, and mentioned in several news outlets. And it is the only term that describes these specific political traits and ideology. There is a huge need for the term fatfatism, which actually explains why it's spreading quickly&#160;:) --129.215.212.170 18:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not delete:</b> This term now is used in the news that praised wikipedia for allowing it on their pages. People in lebanon started using this term wh9ich means it will soon become a tradition in lebanon. Please leave the term on wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not delete:</b> Keep the entry! If for whatever reason someone does not agree with Abu Khalil's term, then ask Ahmed Fatfat what he thinks...he has a website now: <a href="http://www.ahmadfatfat.com/political-background/" class="external free" title="http://www.ahmadfatfat.com/political-background/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahmadfatfat.com/political-background/</a>.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news source. Given that Lebanon is hardly a primative backwater, 13 google hits for the term most of which are from one source suggest that this term has not achieved a critical mass that warrants its inclusion (usage of the term in a major national newspaper or a large number of blogs is needed, I feel). However, the requirement for neutrality does not require we avoid making any reference to notable attempts to discredit politicians by those who disagree with their policies, merely that we ensure that it is a report on the portrayal, rather than the portrayal itself. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Still a relatively non-notable neologism. Wikipedia is NOT a source for such terms, only for terms that are already established.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Irrespectivly of whether we're pro or anti Ahmed Fatfat, the Fatfatism terminology is widely used in the Lebanese political scene. The 1st of December events including several hundreds of thousands of people included parodies of the "Fatfatist" school of politics. The term has been discussed in Lebanese newspapers as well. No reason to delete it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b> - Homer58, Fatfatist, Mabizeid, Moonsear and Zabadani all smell like fake accounts to me for the pure reason that the only edits they seem to have made is on this page and the actual Fatfatism page.
