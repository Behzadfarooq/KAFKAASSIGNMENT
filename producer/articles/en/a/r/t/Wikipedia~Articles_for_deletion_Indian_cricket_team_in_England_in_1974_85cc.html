<p>Non-notable stub whose content is contained entirely in the title.

<li>In light of <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a>'s edits to the 1974 page, I'd like to <b>keep</b> it, but all of the other should be <b>deleted</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> the 1974 article and any others where there is "real" content. But leave the redlinks in the categories so that editors know which tours are missing and can come back to them with more content later. As ALoan says, it isn't difficult to get more content, and I've been working through some older tours – <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_in_England_in_1927_63d1.html" title="New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927">New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927</a> and the 1931 and 1937 equivalents, for instance.

<dd>Taking exception to my addition of 13 new articles once we were already into the debate is fair enough (and I do apologise for not including them in my initial AFD as I no doubt should have), but I take exception to your suggestion that just because the other articles *could* be expanded they need to be kept until they *are* expanded (also to the suggestion that people who want to delete content-free articles are somehow obligated to fill in the content themselves). Any of these that get expanded by you or anybody else, I'll be happy to see kept. However, the articles I've nominated are, in their present state, better redlinked. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 06:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

These articles will get there eventually - do we need to rush to delete them? You are simply encouraging me to do a quick and dirty expansion job, adding a few lines of summary, rather than doing the job properly.

<dd>Sorry, I've probably been unclear - I'm not trying to suggest at all that the onus for filling out the other thirteen articles should be on you. You did what looks to me to be a good job with the 1974 one and, as a result, I no longer favour deleting it. If you want to do the others right away, that's great, and then I wouldn't want them deleted, either. If you want to do the others a couple of months from now, that's great too - I just think that, until Wikipedia has an article on the 1952 series, any links to the 1952 series should be redlinked (that's what redlinks are for - to indicate that, though a topic is sufficiently notable for an article, no such article yet exists). If you feel you've done your part and that somebody else should do the others when they have a chance, that's also great - but the articles should be redlinked until somebody actually does them. In answer to your question, the rush to delete them is owing to the fact that, in their present state, they're non-articles. I'm not proposing a quick and dirty expansion job, I'm proposing that, until somebody does a proper expansion job, these "placeholder" "articles" serve no purpose. As to why I haven't risen to your challenge as <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> has, it's because I don't know a damned thing about cricket. To answer in advance the question (not necessarily asked by you, but probably by somebody) as to why a guy who knows nothing about cricket is proposing cricket-related articles for deletion, it doesn't take a cricket expert to see that these articles (except for the ones that you and Johnlp have expanded) bring nothing to Wikipedia. In summary, I do appreciate your work, I'm not "asking" you to replicate it 13 more times, and I just think that articles that don't exist (which these ones don't) but might at some point in the future (which these ones might) should be redlinked. My sincere apologies if I've offended. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 17:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep all</b> as I will be expanding them well within the two month limit suggested by the proposer above. I am the original author of all these articles but I have not been much active on the site of late. I expect to resume my former levels of contribution around Easter and will be looking at the tour and season stubs as priorities. Thanks yet again to <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> for their help in developing these articles and for maintaining their excellent standards of work.</dd>
<dd>May I point out to all those non-cricket people who think cricket stubs should be deleted that the cricket project is both the largest and most developed sports project on Wikipedia. We intend to develop everything in due course, and we are steadily working our way through, but we are handicapped by sheer scale since ours is far and away the oldest professional team sport and its history is massive compared with those of other sports. Rome was not built in a day: these tour and season stubs are there to provide a foundation. The bricks and mortar will be delivered shortly. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 14:37, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep all</b>. The proposal is short-sighted as it must be obvious to anyone that an Indian cricket tour of England is a notable sporting event. Yes, the articles need to be expanded but the cricket project is very good at that and they can be trusted to get on with it. These sort of interventions by persons who do not understand the subject achieve nothing. --<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeWilliams_3db4.html" title="User:GeorgeWilliams">GeorgeWilliams</a> 20:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
