<li><b>Delete</b> While I really enjoy this kind of trivia, as do many others, without episode references it is nothing but a random and incomplete list of bands of varying notability. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 04:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Per Dawson, it's rather useless without episode references. Perhaps if combined with an episode guide, I might go for it. It would also make a half-decent category. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>B&amp;B: it's not a bad list, but could just as well be a category (although we'd lose detail). As Staxringold has pointed out, B&amp;B was pretty music-oriented, so I think this has some use -- <b>weak keep</b>. The Simpsons list is even more valuable, particularly the "Parody songs" part -- I mean, I had no idea that ""The Children are our Future" is a parody of an Ike and Tina Turner song, and my life is marginally enriched. <b>Keep</b>.
