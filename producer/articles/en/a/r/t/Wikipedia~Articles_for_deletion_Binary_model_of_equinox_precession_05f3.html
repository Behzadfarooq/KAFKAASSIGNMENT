<p>The article as it stands today (2005-09-26) clearly states that the standard physics theory completely disagrees with this model. It also states that most mainstream scientists regard it as nothing more than pseudoscience - this is stated not once, but three times during the article, as well as 2 reasons for considering it pseudoscience (lack of empirical evidence and unfalsiability) are provided. However, if these 2 criteria were universally applied, the theory of superstrings should also be clasified as pseudoscience (it's unfalsifiable and right now there's no evidence for it), as well as the "dark matter" theories (MOND does have empirical evidence in it's favor, predicted acurately some behaviour of low emission galaxies and is falsifiable) I wrote the entry on the double star theory ("Nemesis", which itself was proposed by a respected mainstream scientist, though not well regarded today) was deleted from the Precession "alternative views" entry. I left it out for I wanted to settle down the controversy surrounding the article. I myself find some aspects of the "bin. model of eq. prec." objectionable, and it's proponents don't do their own theory any favor (trying to pass ancient Indian religious texts as scientific evidence isn't sound to say the least) but nonetheless interesting as it relates very well to the Nemesis theory and could have something to do with it - it could very well be possible that a rotating sun/nemesis system induced a slight parallax change thru millenia, which could add to the natural precession of Earth due to gyroscopic effect. Mr. Pitchford, if you don't mind a little criticism... have you ever read Kuhn or Feyerabend? Sometimes you sound REALLY dogmatic on your writings, as though your views on science were more akin to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Comte_6c2b.html" title="August Comte">August Comte</a>'s <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positivism.html" title="Positivism">positivism</a> than to modern <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a> as put together since popper, kuhn, lakatos or feyerabend's times... By the way, now I've registered. BattleTroll</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I <b>agree</b> with Battle Troll. Many of these scientific apologists are as closed-minded and dogmatic as the religious folks they despise so much. In fact, many of their views and exclusionist attitudes are as bad as anything in Catholic Church history, including the Inquisition that so many of them love to use as an example of oppression. The irony is, they're members of a Science Inquisition that is going on in modern times that's just as bent on silencing differing views as the Catholic Inquisition was. They also have a lot in common with the Christian fundamentalists that they criticize so much. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 16:36, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I decided to consult my university library's online-access-to-scholarly-journals service. The journal <i>Solar System Research</i> (English translation of <i>Astronomicheskii Vestnik</i>) has 23 articles since November 2000 containing the word "binary", 23 that contain the word "equinox", and 2 that contain both. One's about the binary asteriod 423 Diotima and the other's about the Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon. Neither mentions this theory, and no article mentions Cruttenden. The journal <i>Astronomy and Astrophysics</i> (affiliated with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Southern_Observatory_7de2.html" title="European Southern Observatory">European Southern Observatory</a>) has, since 2001, 0 articles mentioning Cruttenden, and 0 results for the search [binary AND "equinox precession"). The journal <i>New Astronomy</i> has, since July 1996, had 0 articles containing the word "Cruttenden" and 0 articles containing the three words "equinox", "binary", and "precession", in any order. In light of this, I think this is a violation of the general policy espoused in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Sec. 1.4, as the hypothesis lacks the widespread notability/influence to make it legitimately encyclopedic. This is also a potential violation of WP:NOT 1.3.1, as the lack of acknowledgement outside the originators suggests that this article constitutes "proposing theories". As such, I am convinced that the proper course of action is to <b>Delete</b> this entry. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 23:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
