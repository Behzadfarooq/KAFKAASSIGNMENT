<p>Prashantpole 05:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC) In today's world, telecommunication is the fastest growing industry. This has mainly been possible to transmit vast and varied data, sound, video etc. in the same form. New generations of network-based technologies that are emerging will add to performance capacity, speed and flexibility, all at reduced cost.</p>
<p>Information technology, which is the ubiquitous hub for all business and industry, is useless if it is not easily accessible and cannot be transmitted. The developments in the telecom industry have been tailored to suit these requirements.</p>
<p><br />
With the advent of the new telecom policy in India which allows privatisation of value added and basic telecom services, a vast new market has been opened up. The Indian economy is growing at an unprecedented rate, and its telecom requirements are tremendous.</p>
<p>A telecom company that wishes to succeed against this backdrop must have a solid technical and marketing base, possessing the savior-faire required to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>And that's what <b>TEPL</b> has.</p>
<p>Established in 1993, the TEPL network spans across the Central / Western India, with service and distribution centres of its own. The TEPL family consists of more than 100 professionals, 60 of whom are qualified telecom professionals and the rest are involved in marketing. Since its establishment, TEPL has been foremost in bringing global technology to the Indian market. This it has done by forging strategic alliances with the world's leading and most respected telecom companies, such as Vertex, Matrix, Beetel, Brother, Panasonic etc.</p>
<p>TEPL is engaged in providing after-sales service which ensures that TEPL's quality products are supported by reliable and efficient back-up. This division is manned by qualified personnel using state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. TEPL specialises in providing value added telecom services and telecom consultancy, besides marketing and supporting innovative and new telecom products.</p>
<p>At its present rate of growth, TEPL envisages an annual turnover of more than Rs. 100 Million by the year 2009 - 2010.</p>
<p>As the adage, a company is only as strong as its people and we are justifiably proud of our dedicated team. A team that tunes its cerebral radars to global standards. A team that regularly attends communication workshops abroad, monitors emerging trends, and strives to engineer solutions to suit our telecom hemisphere.</p>
<p>A team comprising more than 100 techno-savvy personnel. A team backed up by over 60 customer-friendly Service Engineers. A team fortified by an expansive distribution network covering the length and breadth of Central &amp; Western India.</p>
<p>A team programmed to offer the world's latest telecom solutions.</p>
<p>A rapidly expanding team servicing over 10,000 current installations. A team that never rests on its laurels, but is busy exploring yonder vistas, yonder perfection.</p>

<p>Sweetwater, FL (Hardee County) is am unincorporated area in the southeast section of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardee_County%2C_Florida_c702.html" title="Hardee County, Florida">Hardee County, Florida</a>. Long/Lat: 27°24’34.50” N and 81°42’09.71” W Peak altitude is 82 feet, but the topography varies. Sweetwater is 15 minutes by car southeast of <a href="../../../z/o/l/Zolfo_Springs%2C_Florida_be19.html" title="Zolfo Springs, Florida">Zolfo Springs, Florida</a>, and is bordered by U.S. Highway 17 to the west, State Highway 66 to the North, and the unincorporated communities of Crewsville to the east and Fish Branch/Gardner to the South. It contains a significant portion of the Oak Creek watershed and borders on the Charley Creek watershed, both of which empty into [[<a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_River_a1cb.html" title="Peace River">Peace River</a>]]. For many years, Sweetwater was the location of Hardee County’s only lake, Lake Frances, which is privately owned. Sweetwater is only 15 minutes from <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlands_Hammock_State_Park_2f25.html" title="Highlands Hammock State Park">Highlands Hammock State Park</a>, and 20 minutes by car from <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlands_County_9494.html" title="Highlands County">Highlands County</a>, and the city of <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebring.html" title="Sebring">Sebring</a>, which offers regional shopping, recreational and medical centers.</p>
<p>While the center of the community was roughly considered the Sweetwater Church of Christ, the congregation was disbanded in the early 1970’s and the building demolished. The Church’s cemetery remains and was renamed the Mercer Cemetery as a significant number of the population are from that family. The center of the community is now the intersection of Sweetwater (formally County Road 656 and Merle Langford Road) and Crewsville Roads.</p>
<p><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p>Sweetwater, FL (Hardee County) once had a thriving rural population who chief occupation was farming and cattle and at one point had it’s own one room school and was home to a large turpentine mill with a commissary. Most families lived off the land, farming and harvesting domesticated animals such as beef, pork and poultry. The collection of raccoon and alligator hides was a way of life for some, as was (it was rumored) the making of moonshine. The population has steadily declined since the 1950’s and the major industry is now citrus and cattle. The population continues to be comprised mainly of working class families, with a few retirees.</p>
<p><b>Future Plans</b></p>
<p>In early 2007, plans were revealed for a large planned community beginning at Sweetwater Road and U. S. 17 and extending back to Charley Creek to be named Sweetwater Ranch. When fully realized, this development could double the current population of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardee_County_2dc7.html" title="Hardee County">Hardee County</a></p>

<p>Born in Hong Kong in 1943, Wong went to America in 1961 at the age of 18. He received his doctorate in medicine there. In 1972, he started a clinic and helped deliver more than 1,000 infants over six years. In 1978, Wong, then 35, made a decision to run for the council of Cerritos City, and in 1984, he was elected the country's first Chinese-American mayor.</p>
<p>While Wong was becoming popular in America, he started to gain fame in China after a song "Offsprings of the Dragon" he sang at 1985 Spring Festival gala broadcasted by CCTV nationwide.</p>
<p>Wong has made exchanges between China and the United States his priority over the past 20 years. He was the first American official to work on the scene during the floods in China in 1998. He went to the flood-hit areas twice, and after returning to the United States, launched a donation drive, asking American people to help China.</p>

<p><b>15 August 1998</b><br />
Jason Roberts was 17 years old the night the two police officers were shot dead. The officers were in Morabbin, a southeastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia as part of a surveillance team called 'Hamada'. Operation Hamada was set up to watch possible robbery targets as there had been a number of armed robberies occur in the area over a short period of time. A police taskforce named 'Lorimer' was formed to investigate the deaths of the two police officers.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>15 August 2000</b><br />
On the second anniversary of the killings, Jason Roberts, aged 19, was one of two men charged with the murder.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>14 August 2002</b><br />
The trial began at the Supreme Court of Victoria. Hundreds of witnesses were called to the trial, which ran over 113 days and produced 8029 pages of transcript.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>31 December 2002</b><br />
Jason Roberts and the co-accused were found guilty.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>24 February 2003</b><br />
Jason Roberts, aged 22 years, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 35 years.<br />

<p>There are many points of controversy surrounding Roberts' conviction, including:<br />
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Roberts' DNA was not found at the scene of the crime.<br /></li>
<li>Recordings from listening devices were a major part of the case against Roberts. However, Professor Butcher for the Defence conducted a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectrogram.html" title="Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>, which casts doubt on claims by the Crown that Jason Roberts said the phrase "I kill D's." (alleged code-word for "police").<br /></li>
<li>The vehicle that was said to have been used in the crime was cleared four times. Only during the fifth inspection that took place four years later, was any gun residue found.<br /></li>
<li>During his arrest, Roberts was sexually assaulted and digitally raped with a firearm, and severely physically assault resulting in visible injuries.<br /></li>
<li>During deliberations, jury members were allowed to go home for the weekend. They also went on a picnic.<br /></li>
<li>Roberts was never charged for the alleged armed robberies and yet they featured heavily in the case against him.<br /></li>
<li>A lot of personal property was taken from Robert's house during a police raid and was never returned. This includes the vehicle (supposedly used in the crime) that belongs to Roberts' then girlfriend.</li>

<p><br />
Dr. Richard Bruno is a Clinical Psychophysiologist specializing in the treatment of disabling conditions -- fatigue, pain, and stress -- as well as Post-Polio Sequelae (PPS), the unexpected and often disabling fatigue, muscle weakness and pain that are occurring in the world's 20 million survivors of polio. He is internationally acknowledged as the world's foremost expert on PPS.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruno trained at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and as a Fellow in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University. On joining Columbia's faculty, Dr. Bruno began the pioneering work that documented the relationship between cold temperatures, Type A behavior, psychological stress and PPS.</p>
<p>In 1984 he organized the International Post-Polio Task Force, which he chairs, and serves as advisor to post-polio support groups on four continents. Dr. Bruno edited three special issues of the journal Orthopedics devoted to PPS, and advises both Congress and the federal government on PPS-related issues. Dr. Bruno co-authored the Social Security Disability regulations for PPS. In 1987, when the Social Security Administration refused to release those regulations, Dr. Bruno returned to Washington and successfully lobbied with Senator Bill Bradley to win their publication. In 2003 he wrote and, with Congressman Steve Rothman and Senator Arlen Specter, won release of a Social Security Ruling for Post-Polio Sequelae to stop inappropriate denials of SSDI.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruno's work has been published in journals as varied as Stroke, Biofeedback and Self-Regulation, the Journal of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurology, Disability and Society, the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Psychophysiology, Sexuality and Disability, the American Journal of Medicine, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences and all three American journals of physical medicine and rehabilitation. He is also a contributing editor of New Mobility magazine, a contributor to Canada's Total Access Magazine and Salon.com, and writes an internationally syndicated columns on PPS and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Dr. Bruno also conceived and co-wrote the story on the NBC series "American Dreams" about nine-year-old Will Pryor, who had one leg paralyzed by polio, having surgery so that he would no longer need to wear a long-leg brace.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruno lectures throughout the world and his work is frequently covered by the media. Articles on Dr. Bruno's work have appeared in Newsweek, The New York Times and USA TODAY. He has appeared on NBC's TODAY Show and ABC's Good Morning America, on CNN, The CBS Evening News, and ABC NEWS NIGHTLINE, on the BBC, CBC and National Public Radio, and on The Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel. Dr. Bruno has received many honors for his work, including the New Jersey Pride Award in Health, an honorary Doctor of Humanics degree from Springfield College and inclusion in Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare, in Science and Engineering, in the Biobehavioral Sciences and Who's Who in the World. Dr. Bruno was also selected to present the 45th Annual John Stanley Coulter Lecture to the annual meeting of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruno is director of The Post-Polio Institute, International Centre for Post-Polio Education and Research and Fatigue Management Programs at New Jersey's Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. Dr. Bruno's most recent research has found a link between an undiagnosed childhood polio infection and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in baby boomers. His book The Polio Paradox: Uncovering the Hidden History of Polio to Understand and Treat "Post-Polio Syndrome" and Chronic Fatigue, is published by Warner Books. His new e-Book, How to STOP Being Vampire Bait: Your personal stress annihilation program, was just published.</p>

"www.beb.com" is a curious wesite which but a few people know anything about.</p>
<p>Upon typing "www.beb.com" into the address bar, one is presented with simply the message: "This is a private site for access by BEB.COM members only. Unauthorized access is prohibited."</p>
<p>No other information is presented on this site, and no other site on the internet seems to tell tale of it.</p>
<p>We can only assume that it is, as the message suggests, a private site, accessible only to administrators or the like through the use of some secret.</p>
<p>No other information on beb.com is currently available. If you have anything to add to this article on the mystery of beb.com, please do not hesitate in doing so.</p>

<p>The J-1 Visa or Exchange Visitor Program was first implemented in 1961 as part of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. The motivation behind this act was to promote the understanding of other cultures by the people of the United States and likewise the understanding of the America culture by people of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges.</p>
<p>A J-1 Visa is a non-immigrant visa available to aliens that fall under the designation of "Exchange Visitor". To obtain a J-1 Visa, your sponsor must be accredited through the Exchange Visitor Program designated by the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>Certain classes of J-1 "Exchange Visitor" require that the alien return to his/her home country or country of last permanent residence for a period of two (2) years after the completion of the J-1 status if: 1) the J-1 program is financed by the U.S. government or the government of the alien’s home country; 2) the home country of the alien has a shortage of people with skills that the alien has; or 3) the alien receives medical training as interns or residents.</p>
<p>Individuals who qualify for J-1 status if sponsored through an accredited Exchange Visitor Program include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>
<pre>
   * Secondary School and college students, including students working towards a graduate degree;
   * Business trainees;
   * Trainees in flight aviation programs;
   * Primary and secondary school teachers;
   * College professors;
   * Research scholars;
   * Medical residents or interns receiving medical training within the U.S; and
   * Specialists.
