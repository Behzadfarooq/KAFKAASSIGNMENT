<li><b>Keep</b>I tried to search Star Tribune for this incident but they only permit searches of past 14 days for newsarticles on webpage. I'm sure that MST has this documented, it was in March 1988 so it might just be paper. Its a colorful humorous story that amount to a fine bit of local folklore. It would be covered by <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> plus groups importance in anarchist development in USA. I think we should be able to get paper cite from MST-I will try to contact articles only editor, an IP. I hope he's from Minneapolis, maybe he can search.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to see this relisted for further discussion. Basicly, this AfD got little attention until an editor contacted all editors who ever edited this article and notified them of the AfD nomination. While that is not an illegitimate technique, I am not quite sure that is how AfD is supposed to run. I suggest relisting to allow for a further consensus from the WP community.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 11:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is nothing improper about notifying editors who's work, and history, is threatened to be destroyed by deletion. Many seeking Deletion improperly complain about <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASS_3bfe.html" title="WP:CANVASS">WP:CANVASS</a> being violated. This is wrong. What is at stake here is notice and opportunity to be heard for editors, <i>who are volunteers of a non-profit</i> having their work tossed out. I did not invite stranger to the article to meddle. I did not invite my "peeps." I invited all participants in editing the article. In fact, because by placing the AfD tag you technically "contributed" to the article, I invited you too. Without notice and an opportunity to be heard for interested parties any discussion process is hopelessly flawed. You are not entitled to a "do-over" because you don't like the results.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 13:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to add that listing the article as an AfD wasn't proper in the first place, because as far as I can tell, no attempt was made to take any of the steps listed in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> section <i>Before nominating an AfD</i>, and none of the criteria listed on <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> were cited as grounds for deletion. I'll be happy to support a re-listing as an AfD <i>after</i> such actions are taken, and <i>if</i> reasonable grounds are cited. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Under <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">Deletion Guidlines for Administrators</a> the correct action if any doubt exists is to not delete. "When in doubt don't delete"---not when indoubt give the Deleter another chance. The nominator didn't meet his burden. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 14:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> That big tag at the top of the page should certainly make editors feel welcome. It seems to me to be intended to chill speech. Editors coming to this page after receiving notice are not doing anything wrong. Nobody said it was an election. I understand full well what consensus means. It does not mean one users opinion. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 20:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
