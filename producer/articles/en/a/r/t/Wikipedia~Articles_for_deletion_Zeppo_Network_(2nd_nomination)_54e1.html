<li>The Zeppo Network, Inc is a S-Corp founded in 2004 which is the IP holder of the ZeppOS management software which turned down a multi-million dollar buyout offer in July of 2005. Instead it formed a subsidiary, Empowered Internet Solutions to distribute the software in a grass roots effort. This company has since become the largest web solution provider for the state of Hawaii. Over the past several months Empowered Internet Solutions has launched sales offices in California and Florida. It has been featured in many trade magazines. The content is relevant and needs to stay. Thank you.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertholf_df38.html" title="User:Robertholf">Rob Bertholf</a> 08:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A walled garden of marketing for a company that markets a "content management solution". I'm not convinced by appearances in obscure business publications, which are more than likely not much more than paid ads. Out. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate the cautious sentiment about a new post and the constructive direction I was previously steered. I am however now growing weary of the unjustifiably elitist mentality shown by Brianyoumans. In rebuttal, I would hardly call Biz Journal (Pacific Business News) an obscure publication. Admittedly, we have done much in the way of paid advertisement in large state magazines but I have not listed that here. Articles were written on me by both the Pacific Edge and InMagazine due to the fact that they found my vision and success <b>notable</b>. Nothing which was posted was driven by a sales agenda. The content posted is factual and unbiased. The fact that The Zeppo Network provides research and development on search engine technology and offers a content management system is not something which should be looked down upon. Fact is we have turned down a substantial buyout offer, we own the largest market share in the state of Hawaii and have two rapidly growing regional sales offices now in California and Florida. The only point which I feel is valid is the fact that I posted the content with a username which was not made up. Had I posted the content from various fake accounts we would not be having this discussion. To remedy this situation, I have asked my employees, my pr firm, my friends and my enemies to become active on these posts to alleviate the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. Over the next 24 hours there will be numerous posts by previously named sources which I hope proves to satisfy you all. I honestly feel the post adds valuable content and am open to suggestions on methods for solidifying my companies place here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Searching on "ZeppOS" and "content management" on Google gives you only 913 hits... many of which aren't even relevant. Search for "OpenCMS", and you get over 3 million; even "Hot Banana" "content management" (another commercial system) gives over 86K hits. You are a small regional firm, and while I wish you much luck, I don't see why you or your products need Wikipedia articles, especially ones written by your marketing department. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:54, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to remind all to <i>assume good faith</i> in all of these proceedings. Just because a page is autobiographical does not mean that it is automatically advertisement, vanity, etc. Whether this page stands or fails does not rely on our opinions of the poster. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 03:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. I should not have implied that Robertholf had deliberately written a "marketing piece"; I apologize. I'm sure he has a great deal of genuine enthusiasm for his company and his products. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:16, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Appology accepted Brianyoumans, I think that intentions are everything, had we met in person you would sense my sincerity and even been the one to start the post on the Zeppo Network&#160;:) Evangelism is what it is, my energy typically is quite contageous and the product speaks for itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>The Sell</b> I have avoided any marketing spin in the wiki posts, but here is some additional info to set the stage for who we are.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Zeppo Network</b> started its R&amp;D on search technology in 2003, the ZeppOS platform was developed to fill a need for logically storing data found in a website.</li>
<li>The <b>ZeppOS</b> software is different than the typical CMS systems we see popping up which are extremely polarized; either overly complex or easy to use but limited in functionality. We received our last patent pending in July 2005 using Heller and Ehrman for a standard web platform. ZeppOS is unique in the fact that it arguably has more functionality than any competitor yet has a very easy to use navigation and usability. The system was created with the designers in mind, most designers do not use a CMS because it limits their creativity, our system showcases designers abilities.</li>
<li>We presented the software to several companies, one of which being Yahoo International. They were interested in purchasing the software but did not have the same vision for methods of deploying it. The large ISP's who were interested in the product wanted to mass distribute it with generic stock templates, we felt this would provide the wrong image of the software ultimately limiting its potential. We then started contacting local web design companies to distribute the software but found that their reach was limited. I am sure we would all agree that most web design companies do not have a bigger vision and typically service 2-5 clients a month maximum. We then formed a web solutions company specifically structured to rapidly deploy higher end custom web solutions at a very low rate. <b>Empowered Internet</b> proved itself in the Hawaii, in 2006 while confined to a limited market we deployed over 20 sites each month. Some very large projects to include military bases, community colleges/educational institutions, four chamber of commerce’s (to include the main Hawaii Chamber), and many small and medium sized businesses. We partnered locally with Clear Channel broadcasting and deployed sites for Budweiser and Time Warner Cable. With just one month in two new markets we have already laid the groundwork for replicating the success we found in Hawaii.</li>
<li>The bigger picture is to continue gaining market share and then launch Zeppo Search which will allow us to feed relevant web content to search engines. There is a much bigger vision which we do not advertise for obvious reasons. I have presented all I intend to sway your opinions on this post. If you have any hoops to jump through I will have one of my team to do so.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> At present, regional interest only--their client list at <a href="http://empoweredinternet.com/customers.asp" class="external free" title="http://empoweredinternet.com/customers.asp" rel="nofollow">http://empoweredinternet.com/customers.asp</a> has the heading "The largest web solution provider in the State of Hawaii and rapidly expanding to the mainland," examining it, the only ones whose names indicate a located say "Hawaii (whatever)..." (They claim Florida and California).</li>
</ul>

<dd>However, if regional interest is sufficient, then it seems they do have a major position in Hawaii.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 21:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although no press releases have come out as of yet, we have structured a deal with Salem Communications in Tampa Florida who will be distributing our software as well as strategic partnerships with T3Communications and First Data Services who will be offering our services to their clients in Florida. Since the initial creation of this post we have also hired a new sales rep in the washington DC area.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertholf_df38.html" title="User:Robertholf">robertholf</a> 15:33, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I dissagree, it seems it has been justified that there is enough regional interest due to the industry dominance in the state of Hawaii as proved by press clips and TV interviews. They have four physical offices across the nation and it appears several clients in each location.Wiki-ickie 19:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and trim</b> into one article and re-write / remove undue weight from much of the content as much of it is repeated and has the feel of an advertisement. Many statements have been left un-referenced, and the main contributors are all closely tied to the organizations. This will need work from some third-party editors. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho McCann</a> 20:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Zeppo Network as locally notable; <b>Redirect</b> all of the rest and Zeppo Awards (another part of this walled garden) to Zeppo Network as they fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and dont demonstrate notability. I am particularly worried about these articles being <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and would like to see one or two of those articles be deleted rather than redirected, in order to prevent undue PageRank influence. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
