<p>Another vanity article by an alleged actor who has appeared as an extra a few times, and as an unnamed character in a DVD sold on its producer's website. It goes out of its way to give "sources" but they're basically the IMDb, which takes submissions from the public (in cases such as this they're basically always written by the subject). There's been a lot of this sort of vanity going around. See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Frank_Croteau_f7e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank Croteau">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank Croteau</a> for a recent AFD of a very similar article. <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as usual fiend has to lie to get his way! Pretty much everything Mr. fiend has reported above is a lie. He claims that the only source is IMDB lie. He says that he was just been an "extra" a few times - lie. He has held major roles in at least five films. His book is being sold at Amazon as well as at least one of his movies in which he gets second billing. This supposed "unnamed character" is a lie as well. The article on Michael Kaplan is nothing like the deleted article on Frank Croteau. Kaplan is much more notable. As an admin. fiend should be made to tell the truth and no longer lie and use shadows and mirrors to fool people into voting the way he wants. Michael Kaplan is an actor who has appeared in many independent films a couple have aired on televion. He has also been included in some documentaries. I bought one of his films The Deserter in Newbury Comics. I beieve his notability is established hence the reason for beginning this article. He is well known among military enthusiasts too. And no I am not Michael Kaplan nor am I a member of his family or a friend of his, since this would be the next accusation that fiend will try if his predictability continues. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 03:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Excuse me Calton, or should I say fiend, since you two sound so much alike, but "bad faith" doesn't come into it. He is lying, and he has to know he is lying because he is forming his lies in such a way to get a result. Just like you are lying too in the very same way. So close to Rfiend that it makes me wonder. For you to make the statement that his films are "barely a cut above home movies," is a falsity. Have you ever seen any of the films he has appeared in? If not, then how can you and fiend make these same "home movie" accusations? If you have then tell us which ones. I own one of these films on DVD and it is in no way a home movie. It doesn't even have a low budget indie feel to it and looks very professional. And of course, you don't think it meets wpbio because you always seem to agree with fiend from my previous experience with you. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 16:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> IMDB shows a few bit-parts and one film that we deleted despite Dwain's best efforts as lacking any provable notability.
