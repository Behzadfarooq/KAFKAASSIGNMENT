<li><s><b>Strong Keep but needs <s>POV removed</s> total rewrite</b> While the article is strongly POV in its current form and needs a lot of work, it is a valid topic given Richard Dawkin's assertion that (to paraphrase) religion is responsible for most atrocities. There is a book review of the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dawkins_Delusion_34c3.html" title="The Dawkins Delusion">The Dawkins Delusion</a>" in the New Scientist from last week that could be cited and possibly the Dawkins Delusion itself contains references that are relevent (I don't know - I've not read it). I agree that several of the sections of this piece need wholesale removal -- like Hitler, Purportedly Religious Terrorism etc. Plus, the article name should be changed for sure. Perhaps a "List of atrocities carried out by Atheist Regimes" or "Atrocities by Supposedly Atheist Regimes" might be better?</s> <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 06:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the author of the article, I'd like to make a couple points. If you note the article on <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations_89d0.html" title="U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations">U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations</a>, it points out that communist terrorist organizations are second only to Islamic groups. Communist (Marxist, Stalinist, Maoist, etc.) groups are by definition and self description philosophically atheist. This compilation is not my idea, nor is the concept of atheist terrorist groups novel. It is not original research. It should also be noted that there are articles on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Terrorism_4797.html" title="Christian Terrorism">Christian Terrorism</a> (despite the fact that there is not a single Christian group on the list) and on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Terrorism_b569.html" title="Religious Terrorism">Religious Terrorism</a> (despite the fact that no religious group other than Islamic is represented on the list. Based on the State Department list there's more reason for this article than Narco, Christian, Agro or Eco terrorism articles. The objections above to POV are equally applicable to the other terrorism articles. And, as no doubt most of you know, POV according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> is not a strong basis for deletion. The article can be edited and rewritten to deal with that. As to the title itself being POV, it is not so any more than the other terrorism articles are. The other articles on classifications of terror groups include their philosophical world view as their motivation. It is no more POV to have an article on atheistic terror groups than it is on Islamic or Eco terrorists. As to sources, they can be provided. There are existing articles, most of them well cited, on each of the groups listed. Finally, I don't think it's the best solution (because the category would be less inclusive leaving out any philosophically atheist groups which are not communist) but the article could be renamed "communist terrorism". <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 11:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Atheism is not a main philosophical basis for any of these groups. Therefore, labeling them "Atheist-terrorism" is both wrong and misleading. If you want, indeed, start an article about <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_terrorism.html" title="Communist terrorism">communist terrorism</a>, but this time please find acceptable sources. <a href="../../../d/l/x/User%7EDLX_8f1a.html" title="User:DLX">DLX</a> 11:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would have to disagree. Historical materialism (or philosphical materialism - Marx's term) is a keystone of communist doctrine. It rules out any rules out the existence of any supernatural entity. Every communist government has been officially and stridently atheist. It is an essential part of their goals and identity. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 11:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see any sources calling all these groups athiest terrorists and that is what is important here. I took a look at that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_terrorism.html" title="Christian terrorism">christian terrorism</a> article as well and frankly that needs to go for some of the same reasons this one does. Let some one else make that call though as it might be looked on badly if you did, see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> The title would seem to be deliberately misleading &amp; biased. If it can be turned into a decent article about communist terrorism, that would be great. If this is done, it should be moved to <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_terrorism.html" title="Communist terrorism">Communist terrorism</a></i> but the resultant redirect should be deleted. The focus of the article is communist terrorist groups so why label them as "atheist"? If you're talking about communists, be bold enough to say so. How is the all-communists-are-atheists argument irrelavant (whether it be true or not)? What if they are? So, be up front about it and move it to <i>Communist terrorism</i> ... if and only if it can be repaired. However, I doubt that it can be. As noted above, there's nothing relating these groups together besides the fact that they happen to share similar political ideas also the article seems to contain original research and bias and seems to lack sources. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">J</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jimp_f608.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jimp">i</a><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimp_beb8.html" title="User talk:Jimp">m</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Jimp" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Jimp">p</a> 17:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
