<li>Comment: The current content of the article is not good. However, on the principal of this type of article, I'm not clear it is inherently a POV fork. It seems <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_%28prophet_in_Islam%29_6c96.html" title="Jesus (prophet in Islam)">Jesus (prophet in Islam)</a> is similiar in concept, and a number of "God-per-religion" articles also exist. To me, if two religious groups have a sufficiently different view of a figure, perhaps separate articles are appropriate. This is particularly true when the views of that figure *define* those religious groups. I see <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>, not as a fork of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>, but rather, as sub-article of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a>.

<dd>I believe the Jesus case is special, since christians and muslims are essentially using different sources to build their views of Jesus, whereas for Ali (and the other ones in that cluster), Shi'i and Sunni have different comments but work from the same source material. Kinda the same. Erm. OK, the difference may just be one of degree. I see your point about having this as a sub-article of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> - maybe something like Place of Ali in Shi'a Islam would be better? It would be less of a POV fork. I disagree with the rationale "could be helpful to readers of [[Shi'a Islam]", since it could be used to justify any POV fork. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">flammif</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">r</a><sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlammifer_ede3.html" title="User talk:Flammifer">talk</a></sup> 19:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I concur, as Jesus may or may not actually be the EXACT same person in both religions. However, for Sunni view of so-and-so and Shi'a view of so-and-so the subject is clearly the same in both cases. --<a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontomars2k4</a> 21:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

Exactly the same sources are <i>available</i> to Jews and to Christians, but they assign a different meaning to them. Clearly the Shi'a and Sunni views are derived using different source material; Sunni do not use Shi'a sources.

<dd>Re the Jesus case: I believe there are significant aspects of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> involved. There do need to be several articles as a matter of article length; however, I've deep misgivings about the way this was done. It seems that overtly labelling articles as POV forks (or worse yet, simply failing to translate the name, as was originally done, and is still done with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa.html" title="Musa">Musa</a>, etc.) had been seen as granting exemption from <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and as liscence to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a>. And Jesus is of course the <b>exact</b> same person in both religions - Qur'anic mentions of Jesus are mostly confirmations of or rebuttals to Christian doctrine surrounding him, and presume identity.Timothy Usher 19:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read the Qur'an? Most mentions of Isa (Jesus) are about how holy this prophet is, second only or perhaps equal to Muhammad. Most Muslims believe he is not dead but will return at the end time. And what is wrong with the name "Musa"? As if "Moses" is not what you call a "translation" – and a rather lousy one at that. Why should everyone prefer a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> transmogrification of a presumably <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Egyptian_5289.html" title="Middle Egyptian">Middle Egyptian</a> name? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sahaba's (Muhammads companions) are a very prominent part of what Shi'a regard as relevant to their religion, and at the same time they have reached a totaly different conclusion than the Sunnis with regards to almost all Sahaba and events. This, in the same way that Jews and Christians have a very different view of Jesus, even though they use the same sources. So per the precedence of the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christian views of Jesus</a>, this article series is legitimate and even needed and desired. In my view, those who do not agree have failed to understand the scope of dissagreance between Shi'a and Sunni in their views of the Sahaba, something that even have caused some Sunni denominations to cry out for the killing of Shi'a due to what they perseive as defaiming of the companions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Shi'a curse the Sahaba</li>
<li>Those that curse the Sahaba are kaafirs</li>
<li>The Shi'a are therefore kaafirs</li>
<li>Those that curse the Sahaba should be killed <a href="http://answering-ansar.org/answers/cursing_sahaba/en/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://answering-ansar.org/answers/cursing_sahaba/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> However, I'm not so sure any longer that ALL the discussion re Ali should be moved into the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> article. That is, the Ali article is a biography. Shi'a make several claims about the life of Ali that are disputed by the Sunni and by Western academic scholars, and those contentious claims are covered in <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_of_first_male_Muslim_361e.html" title="Identity of first male Muslim">Identity of first male Muslim</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_6654.html" title="Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>. I think both those breakout articles are what breakout articles should be: they take very contentious issues out of the main article, so that there's more space for all the contending views. However, much of the Shi'a view of Ali is, IMHO, theology rather than history. It doesn't belong in the biography, it belongs in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> article. If it is too big to fit there, it can have its own article, <i>as Shi'a theology</i>. I think that's the difference between the study of the <i>historical Jesus</i> and arguments about the nature, divine or human, of Jesus (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>). I haven't gone into the Shi'a article in a long time -- it was taken over by Shi'a zealots. But a lot of the Ali material needs to go there, not be presented as history. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:02, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't think the latter should exist; I just looked at it and it does seem to be be a POV fork. As for the article up for deletion -- it's not theology, but history, badly written history, and it's written by someone with no background in Shi'a theology. If the article had a different title and substantially different content, and were presented as theology -- that is, if it were something it is not -- I would vote to keep it. Are you up to making the necessary changes? I don't think I am, right now. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:52, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here we go again, Zora dissmissing the Shi'a view of history as nonsense, claiming that it should not even be presented as the Shi'a view of history. I feel deeply offended by that, to claim that my view of history should not even be called "Shi'a view of history", rather "Shi'a theology", implying "Shi'a bs". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:03, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
