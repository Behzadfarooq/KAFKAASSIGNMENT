<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). Wisewaif pointed out a fairly high ranking among the Yahoo! podcast list, although 75 minutes had fallen to 61st place when I checked the link out. I am concerned with sockpuppeteering and/or meatpuppeteering here, but ultimately some of the "keep" voters have presented reasonable arguments for this podcast's notability. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:14, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per wisewaif, but with a caveat. There is no Arbitron or Alexa for podcasts so far, and it would be rather difficult to build one. If Yahoo Podcasts isn't one of the big fish in the pond, asserting that something is notable for appearing on Yahoo's list doesn't necessarily mean anything. That said, it is Yahoo, and on the scale of big fish overall they're a basking shark, so I'm willing to give this list the benefit of the doubt. I think a combined discussion on the issue of podcasts is in order, especially after the Wehatetech fiasco. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:59, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What? If <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">podcasting</a> is notable (clearly, given the size of the article) then the "small pond" is notable, therefore being a "big fish" in it is more than adequate justification for an article. I think wisewaif has given sufficient evidence that 75 Minutes is among the top English-language podcasts, as far as it can be determined. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/0/User_talk%7EBk0_24c3.html" title="User talk:Bk0">Talk</a>) 12:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> "If there is even confusion about the potential notability of something, it's not notable." that makes no sense, a complete logical fallacy. how many people outside the u.s. have heard of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper_Lee_54ae.html" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a>? she wrote one novel in her entire career, and released it at the perfect time. point being, many (who never read the book in high school) would question the potential notability. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamer.redeemer_80f7.html" title="User:Dreamer.redeemer">Dreamer.redeemer</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreamer.redeemer_2b9b.html" title="User talk:Dreamer.redeemer">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dreamer.redeemer_8145.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dreamer.redeemer">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Definitely notable. Determining the notability of podcasts is hard though, even harder than notability for musical artists. Gaining nationwide (or rather: global) notability isn't really an important thing for a podcast that focusses on music that is more or less underground. I see 75 Minutes as more than just a radioshow: it has a sense of community that reaches out to underground musical scenes in all parts of the world. The show is notable not so much for the wide variety of listeners, but mainly for the wide scope of scenes and genres it covers. Rather than marking this for deletion, an overall discussion (as suggested above) on the notability of podcasts is in order. To make a comparison with musical notability again: my stance would be that articles are okay as long as they are objective. Ie: "This band consists of four members" is okay. "This band is awesome!!1lol" is not. PoofBird 18:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a reasonable explanation of what the site in question is all about; "notoriety" is awfully subjective, don't you think? Maniaclives 14:59, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just wanted to point out that this podcast has released 35 shows (25 weekly + 10 bi-weekly) and it has very high production values. Furthermore, the program is 100% not-for-profit, so how could the article in question be an advertisement? Have any of the delete voters actually listened to the show before knee-jerk voting against it? It is a top-notch podcast and there is no reason it shouldn't be represented on wikipedia. Maniaclives 17:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"How could the article in question be an advertisement?" — it doesn't have to be for-profit to be an advertisement; it's an effort to gain listeners, and thus, an advertisement. --<a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHosterweis_526c.html" title="User:Hosterweis">Hosterweis</a> 23:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Alexa isn't too useful for podcasts -- podcasts use different distribution mechanisms from webpages, so a different metric has to be used. I don't think that metric exists yet, so some more ad hoc intermediate metric needs to be created. In the meantime, I would think Yahoo Top 100 is as good a system as there is at the moment.
