<li><b>Keep</b>.

He is very famous in world surfing circles apparently but was charged with murder and manslaughter. He was recently acuitted of those charges but found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice (or perverting the coure of justice or something - don't quote me). Then, just this week, we're hearing about them again in the context of these events in Sydney. I think they are notable enough to have a TV documentary made about them, and are notable because of Koby Abberton's involvement.

<dd>These events took place on Monday night and were heavily reported in the Sydney press. This was supposedly in retaliation for the events at Cronulla.
<dl>
<dd>Sunny, Jai and Koby have made media appearances to contradict "supposed" involvement, as recently as yesterday's Daily Telegraph (14 Dec, pg 4). I doubt that the <i>"Bra Boys" at the beach</i> meant to suggest that a fight had been arranged by the group. This would be better discussed on the article's talk page, <i><b>if anyone thinks it can be expanded beyond a stub</b></i>.
