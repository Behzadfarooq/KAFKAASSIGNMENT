<li><b>Delete</b> As someone who creates music, this article makes very little sense to me. For example, it says that someone doing "artmastering" might change the "<i>order of movements or instrumental parts</i>". Maybe, but if so they're not <i>mastering</i>, they're <i>arranging</i>, which is a whole different step in the recording process. Also, I don't recall ever reading about "artmastering" in any professional musicians' magazine, not even when they have whole articles about the mastering process. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The text states that changing the "..order of movements or instrumental parts.." is done only in some extreme cases. I think you will agree, that changing the order of tracks, or cutting off and fading out a section of a radio mix to fit it into a prescribed time slot, are tasks commonly performed in mastering studios. So I see no issue, if in some extreme cases, the artist wishes to change an order of movements. As far as calling it "arranging", you are right, it definitely goes beyond the regualar mastering, that is probably why they called it "armastering" because it involves artistic decisions. <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoy7_86c4.html" title="User:Voy7">R. Watts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Do a websearch under "artmastering" see what you will find. "Maniac" and its subsequent remixes were big hits in the US. Another article on one of the leading music sites MusicBizAcademy.com features Art Sayecki and Artmastering and mentions Michael Sembello and "Maniac" <a href="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicbizacademy.com/articles/gman_mastering.htm</a> . I also found a testimonial of Michael Sembello, the author of "Maniac", on www.artmastering.com website. So start listening to music, Hankwang , and start reading about it before you attempt to edit anything associated with Audio Mastering. <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoy7_86c4.html" title="User:Voy7">R. Watts</a>
<ul>
<li>If I do a search for "artmastering" as you suggest, I get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22artmastering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22artmastering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">19 unique Google hits</a>, most of which seem to be links to the same site. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Keeper, Definitely. A one of my demo tracks was mastered with artmastering, so I have had a first hand experience with the process. I live in Oxnarxd and visit LA often. I had a limited budget and I couldn't go to back to the recording studio but I was not happy with a guitar part in my song, so we cut it out and changed the pitch of the first bar in the bridge to match the spliced parts. It was fun. Sayecki is well known here in a LA and obviously in the world, after all those articles appeared. I see no problem with the article is a Definite Keeper.--<a href="../../../j/w/i/User%7EJWilman_a30c.html" title="User:JWilman">Jonathan Wilman</a></li>

<li><b>Keep this article.</b> I'm not associated with wikipedia. I'm an artist with three CDs in my discography. Several of my tracks were mastered with artmastering. The process is real and it works great. If you have questions please contact me through my CD-baby website since I don't have wikipedia account.

<li><b>Keep.</b> My name is Scott G of G-Man Marketing. I'm also the recording artist known as The G-Man, and write the "Communication Nation" column for the Advertising Industry Newswire. I have written more than 200 articles for Web sites and print publications and I stand behind each of them, including the one referenced here. During an interview conducted with Art Sayecki in Dec 2003, I learned about the process of armastering and heard several examples of it. I chose to have two of my albums, "Sonic Tonic" and "Motion Potion," mastered by Art using his process of artmastering. As far as I can see, the text is correct other than the date of artmastering of "Maniac" (re-release) which I believe took place in early 2003, but this can be easily corrected by simply contacting Michael Sembello or Art himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't doubt that Sayecki is running a legitimate business and has happy customers such as Fran Lucci, Scott G, and Sembello. Neither do I doubt that he has an original view of the mastering process. But that doesn't qualify either the company or Sayecki's philosophy as being notable according to Wikipedia's guidelines. Being associated with a notable person is not a valid criterion for notability in itself, just like the staff of the US president is not notable unless there was a lot of publicity around them in the mainstream media. If Sembello ever mentioned in public that he specifically chose the company Art Mastering to master his cds, then that would warrant a paragraph in the article about Sembello and/or the cd in question (provided that these are notable for a Wikipedia article). <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHankwang_1955.html" title="User:Hankwang">Han-Kwang</a> 10:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Observation</b>: Please read the article thoroughly. <b>Sembello in fact did mention it in public or for the public.</b> Here is a quotation from the aforesaid article by G-Man: <i>"There can be tremendous loyalty toward mastering engineers on the part of artists and producers. Michel Sembello, composer/performer of songs from hit albums and the huge film "Flashdance," told Art Sayecki "After hearing what you did with 'Maniac,' you are the only person I will let master my stuff."</i> Please notice that G-Man is directly quoting Sembello. I doubt that he would write this if he didn't have supporting evidence. If you scout the web for his articles you will find that they all are supported by an extensive, almost obsessive (no offense intended), research. I think that if an artist such as Sembello makes this kind of public statement then it is definitely notable by wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../v/o/y/User%7EVoy7_86c4.html" title="User:Voy7">R. Watts</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Additionally</b>, in the entire article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mastering" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mastering" rel="nofollow">Audio_Mastering</a>, this is the only section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artmastering" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artmastering" rel="nofollow">Artmastering</a> that actually has some support in the press as well as publically accessible pictures and references. Everything else has been contributed by various members based on their opinion rather than on notable facts or evidence and is placed there without any supporting evidence or references.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If we follow your reasoning, then the entire Audio Mastering section should be deleted as "not notable", which would be a terrible waste!</dd>
