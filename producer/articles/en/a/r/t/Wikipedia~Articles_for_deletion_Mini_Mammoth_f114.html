<li><b>Keep it</b> i have a friend whos friend has a mini mammoth on their desk top at Telstra. Her friend reckons telstra paid for the research because mini mammoths are great at installing phones.</li>
<li><b>Keep for a few days</b>. I don't believe this article was used for advertising, It has come about though a discussion on a morning breakfast show, people have picked up the idea and are having fun with the concept. While I understand that the academic value of the content is low, it is an interesting case study on the creation of an "in joke". Wikipedia contains much esoteric information, and I think that as long as this article is not harming wikipedia as a whole, it should be left.
<p>I also believe that this has spread the influence of wikipedia, as more people discover wikipedia for the first time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Netbogan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Netbogan_d1dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Netbogan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep it</b> Who are you to say that jay and the doctor's conceptual minimammoth idea is not suitable for an article? It is a concept for an idea, and im sure if minimammoths were created one day, that i would like to have one wandering around my place. Also, it is not a publicity stunt because triple j is not a commercial radio station. thats my two cents... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.34.177.6 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.34.177.6.html" title="User talk:203.34.177.6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.34.177.6_6965.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.34.177.6">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> I concur. Many themes and ideas from radio shows have long-standing Wikipedia pages. Including many from the Jay and the Doctor show (check the Jay and the Doctor Wiki pages for examples). Triple J is an Australian government-owned radio station, they don't have advertisements, so no commercial advangage can be gained from the page. Rather, their audience will be exposed to the world of Wikipedia. If anything, perhaps the link to the merchandising site, not related to Triple J but commercial nonetheless, could be pulled. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.2.218.145 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.2.218.145.html" title="User talk:203.2.218.145">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.2.218.145_c5a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.2.218.145">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is an entry for Space_Goat - I guess the difference is that is a serial whereas the Mini Mammoth is a topic of discussion. Would you be happier if that article made it clear that is just a topic of discussion, or if the article was transformed to be more of a discussion of the joke that includes some information on the joke itself? If it doesn't get any more airplay in a couple of weeks, I won't be sad to say it go - but I'm sure space goat had it's critics when it was starting out, so why not what and see?

<li>Since I haven't added or edited any articles that seems a little hostile, especially the use of "we" and "our" from an admin. Space Goat only got marked as unreferenced after I mentioned it, so at the time I made it my comment was made from a wikipedia article that didn't have a problem. And as we've discussed elsewhere, it's as well or poorly referenced as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Goons_1986.html" title="The Goons">The Goons</a>, but that article hasn't been marked as unreferenced.

<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> The origin and fictional nature of the concept is stated at the outset. The article could do with a good edit, but it is clear that the discussion of the concept is satirical and comic. I refer to the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> article for an example of a comic concept that has taken on a life of its own. As such, both concepts are appropriate subjects for Wikipedia. However if the idea peters out in a week or two, it would be appropriate to delete the article. <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPapertiger96_e290.html" title="User:Papertiger96">Papertiger96</a> 01:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> I've added it to the category Fictional species - if the non-existence of the animal is grounds for deletion you need to take out the whole category. There are many species from books and video games in there - the radio is just as valid a form of media, especially now podcasts exist making the medium potentially as persistent as books or video games. It might be more appropriate for placement on uncylcopedia, but as Papertiger said, if the Flying Spaghetti Monster gets a page, the Mini Mammoth has the right to a page. As an observation the mention on JJJ increases the exposure of wikipedia to the general public, and the multiple deletes and repostings would make wikipedia sound fairly unprofessional and disorganised to people hearing about it for the first time. I'll be watching the process carefully. Edit: used 3 tildes rather than 4 - oops. DaveAU 01:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm now undecided - Kinu made the good point that the article is astroturfing the joke. I don't have a strong preference either way - I've just been trying to point out pertinent things like the commercial side of it being a hijack, the origin being a news article and existence of other articles on fictional animals. Even if it's just a running joke, there's a discussion of the use of 'Hot grits' as a running joke in the slashdot article. But the astroturfing is a grave concern. And I don't think they're sock puppets coming in - they're probably listeners who only heard about wikipedia this morning - they'll also be aware if people are recommending deletion without having the facts... I won't lose any sleep if it's deleted immediately for astroturfing or if it hangs around to see if it lasts. Actually, if it can be called astroturfing it probably falls short of the original research criteria... DaveAU 03:23, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> Discospinster has not provided good reasons for its deletion. It is encyclopediac as are various other fictional species within Australian culture. Discospinster incorrectly labelled the article a number of times (his behaviour stunk of nothing but vandalism and trolling) and now he's continuing. I vote for keeping the article and if Discospinster continues his behaviour (as he has done on a number of articles (see his talk page), he should be reprimanded.<a href="../../../p/o/n/User%7EPontifexmaximus_7271.html" title="User:Pontifexmaximus">Pontifexmaximus</a> 01:24, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep it</b> Firstly, as has already been stated, there does not appear to yet be a satisfactory reason for the entire deletion of the Mini Mammoth article. The article could be perhaps modified to meet general Wikipedia standards. NetBogan makes a few pertinent points, including the potential for such an article to increase the audience and scope of the Wikipedia project. This is important, and allows the number of sources of information for Wikipedia articles to increase. I would like to further express the potential for this to be "an interesting case study on the creation of an 'in joke'" and a way to explore the potential for fictitious characters to evolve and become 'real' with continuing discussion. As a biological scientist, I would also like to point out that there is a basis to state that scientific research is never conclusive - according to the null hypothesis method, a scientist, in research, should essentially set out to disprove a theory - so that, in reality, science never really <i>proves</i> anything. So, there is really no way to prove that the Mini Mammoth does not already exist or, furthermore, that it will not exist in the future. Finally, why is this page being classed as <i>original research</i>? I do not find there to be anything that may be considered as scientific research within the Mini Mammoth entry. In addition, the idea is not entirely original, as DaveAU points out - the idea of the Mini Mammoth evolved from a current news item. --<a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBauhinia_9fa2.html" title="User:Bauhinia">Bauhinia</a> 02:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: If this is merely the product of hype, then in a few days it will be gone and nobody will care if you delete it. The article is generating a great deal of traffic and edits. Therefore, there is great interest in the topic and its being recorded for Wikipedia. I'm amazed at the people who've said 'Delete' who haven't actually provided good reasons for its deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just as a friendly reminder, you only need to vote once, so any other remarks you make should be seen as comments. With THAT being said....Wikipedia is NOT a crystal ball, if this term/idea dies out in the next few days or weeks, we'll have to go through this process AGAIN to have the article removed. My point is this, remove the article for now, and IF this continues to be a notable fad, then by all means restore the article. A new running joke on a radio show does not warrant enough for an article on Wikipedia, but as I said if this has any staying power, by all means replace the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 04:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep it!</b> don't delete it! you guys are all to uptight! let go once in a while. im still in school, and all the people in my class know about the mini mammoth. its a bit of comic relief, something to get away form reality. i say good on jay and the doctor for doing something that shows their keen imagination, and knack for making people laugh. its a bit of harmless fun. i bet if it was on channel 9 news you would keep it no doubt! the radio(and most definately triple j) is just another respectable form of media, so keep it, not because it may or may not be true, but because it makes peolpe HAPPY! or is that word too hard to understand?

<li>So if a Wikipedia entry is created more or less directly from a culture with a strong <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_tradition.html" title="Oral tradition">oral tradition</a>, would that be considered invalid due to lack of documentation? Yes, I'm aware it's not exactly the same thing, but I would appreciate some clarification on this. Next, if the Mini Mammoth becomes a "cultural phenomenon" in the next couple of weeks, appearing in magazines and such, would the page be allowed to be un-deleted? Culture is fluid, and moves quickly in modern society. Also, as an aside, Wikipedia's "Feature Article" for today is <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>.

<li>Frankly, <b>if</b> this phenomenon became a cultural phenomenon, I would support the article's existence. But WP is not a crystal ball.

None of this can be said for the "Mini Mammoth". Drop Bears are notable. Mini Mammoths are not. Your "logic" seems to be: The Drop Bear is a fictional Australian creature; so is the Mini Mammoth.

<li>Ok, I'm going to contradict myself here - I don't actually think this article is a hoax, because it is not a genuine attempt to deceive people. It's just a joke. It's obviously a joke. Perhaps if we had a tag that said: "This article is a JOKE. It should not be taken seriously in any way." this might solve the problem - everyone would be happy. Joke articles should not be subject to the same standards of vandalism as other pages. In fact, if they attract vandals away from the serious pages, all the better. Think of it like a graffiti wall.

As such, it probably belongs in something like <a href="http://www.encyclopediadamatica.com" class="external text" title="http://www.encyclopediadamatica.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Damatica</a> rather than the Wikipedia. I was unable to hear what the comments were this morning, however I think a speedy deletion would just confirm that the joke worked. Keeping it as is (for a while) shows that while spurious material <b>can</b> turn up in the wikipedia, there is also a review process at work as well - <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELauraSeabrook_2642.html" title="User:LauraSeabrook">User:LauraSeabrook</a> 8:34pm 28 July 2006 (GMT+11)

<li>Wait, I'm really not getting the logic here. <i>Keeping</i> a non-notable, unverifiable joke article would prove that Wikipedia has a working review process while deleting it wouldn't. How does that work? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 11:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>1 hour after the article was created, it was tagged with "Prod". Less than 1 1/2 hour after it was created, it was marked as AfD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mini_Mammoth&amp;diff=66061354&amp;oldid=66047612" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mini_Mammoth&amp;diff=66061354&amp;oldid=66047612" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. How an article which states that it is "being considered for deletion" can fool an uninformed into thinking it is a "legitimate souce" is beyond me. The "joke" did not work and is gone beyond lame a long time ago. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
