<li>What you say about precedent may be a correct description of the outcomes of past AfD's, but that has nothing to do with how our policies and guidelines apply to the article under discussion here.

<ul>
<li>With TV episodes, from what I've seen both policy and precedent don't make a blanket judgement either way on TV episodes. Individual articles are OK, but only if the episodes are notable and the articles have sufficient content to justify their existence (or at least show the potential to get there with some editor effort). Really, TV episode articles should be judged on a case by case basis, not a notion that all should be kept or all deleted. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh come on, if you want me to bullshit you and retype my message all <i>Wikipedia-PC</i> with neutral sounding words, ok, but don't tell me people don't think that. Certainly, that should never be the criteria alone, as Wikipedia is a work in progress and we are here to improve rather than delete. BUT, it's not likely that such articles even can improve. Yes, some minor improvements have been made, such as an infobox and the slight rewording of the painfully small content, but it's still nothing more than an episode that is not independently notable, nor information that needs to be split due to size. It's just mindless plot summary for the sake of plot summary (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7). You seem to be missing the point of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> and other similar pages. I don't like it <b>because</b> it's not a good article nor does it have the potential to be one and because it is needless plot summary, which our policies and guidelines strongly discourage. I actually liked the Dilbert show (wasn't <i>great</i> but I enjoyed it). -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:19, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like you to humour me and construct proper arguments, yes. But if you think this article should be deleted, why aren't you nominating all of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dilbert_animated_series_episodes_bb7f.html" title="List of Dilbert animated series episodes">these</a>?

<dd>Maybe for the same reason I haven't corrected every typo on Wikipedia, time. The idea that this is a general censuses is what gets under my skin. It's not a consensus. I'm not saying there's consensus <i>against</i> episode articles, but there never was a real consensus for them. It's so painfully easy to make articles that it makes it appear there is wide support for this. New users come on (and even old ones), see the articles and do the same for other shows. It's not a horrible thing, and everyone was acting in good faith, but for the vast majority no thought was really given to the creation. It was not the result of a discussion, rather it's the result of a misconception on a major scale. Precedent does not help us in this situation. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 00:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And nice double standard you have there, considering the "reasons" some of the keeps have made. That being said, I have no problem with further explaining myself. If you wish me to explain more on my reasons then I will. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 00:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would like to note that, in contrast to what Ned said above about consensus, a consensus to include articles on episodes of notable TV shows was reached at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a>. It's also worth noting, given his objections to plot summaries, that the very first thing included in a list of items "to include about a television episode, where possible" is a "plot summary of the episode". Furthermore, he should know both of these things, since he's edited both the page in queastion and its talk page. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 14:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it should also be noted that that page also says to create individual episode articles "Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes". It certainly doesn't say that every notable show should have an individual article for each episode, in fact it recommends starting with series and season articles first and only splitting individual articles as necessary. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is true, and ordinarily I would've suggested that this be merged back into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dilbert_animated_series_episodes_bb7f.html" title="List of Dilbert animated series episodes">List of Dilbert animated series episodes</a>, except that in this case doing so would break that page's table format. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a big supporter of <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a>, so yes, I know all about it. As Milo's note says, the topic of an episode is ok, but not necessarily an article dedicated to an episode. The episodes do not need individual articles, and only make themselves a target for cruft, trivia, and OR. Even forgetting anything about notability or any of those shades of gray, we still don't actually have anything more than a plot summary to write about that is unique to a specific episode. As for the table formatting, the solution to that is easy, just use the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Template%7EEpisode_list_d7db.html" title="Template:Episode list">Template:episode list</a> system. I would have no problems with a merge. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 19:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will 2nd Milo's and Ned's comments here. And I would like to introduce a term for this problem "Episode creep"&#160;:D. Yes the discussion says that. HOWEVER. It also says that you should not default to such behaviour, but where possible start with Shows -&gt; List of episodes. Then once you establish notability for a seperate article (translated: more then a plot summary and the stuff which is usually tracked in imdb) you can create seperate articles for episodes. This does not say you have to create articles for ALL episodes of a show. The idea here is to improve before you create instead of simply duplicating effort by creating a ton of episode articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 19:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
