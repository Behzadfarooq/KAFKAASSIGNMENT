<li><b>Keep</b> Article has recently been edited with sourced material and references. I was intrigued by the original article, which lacked many things, and spent the better part of yesterday trying to get to the bottom of this with reliable information from valid (and citable) sources. Right now there is too much evidence to suggest that this may still have an official tie to the lonelygirl15 creators, and the two mentions in the NY Times are notable as such. Many Wikipedia entries have never had that kind of recognition, yet their pages remain. If this is all forgotten in a month, it can be deleted then, no? <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsincere_dfef.html" title="User:Insincere">Insincere</a> 16:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an intriguing topic that had many, many followers, and their main avenues of discussion and information (lonelygirl15.com and Alissa's board) were both cut off, making it much harder for people to keep up. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumpy_f2e6.html" title="User:Plumpy">Plumpy</a> 20:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This topic has garnered reoccuring national attention. Other sources of compiled information on the topic are lacking. 18 September 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.131.131.56_dd4b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.131.131.56">24.131.131.56</a> (talk)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I can see why this was nominated, but a lot has changed since then. I believe this will be an important landmark in whatever genre this turns out to be. It's become an enormous and controversial internet phenomenon. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkwell_67b1.html" title="User:Inkwell">Inkwell</a> 21:17, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> ARGjacking something that isn't even determined to be an ARG (or even a game) does not make a wikipedia article. Kids playing on YouTube can get their own stand-alone wiki to compile the CIW story, which can be added later as a spinoff from the LG15 wiki article, if warranted.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Topic has garnered enough attention, and has newly updated sources and references. Furthermore, it warrants a separate page, as the Creators of lonelygirl15 have since disavowed all connections to this project. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavensgrace_c53c.html" title="User:Ravensgrace">Ravensgrace</a> 21:19, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Cassieiswatching has been a significant enough part of the story that the creators of LG15 had to address it in a formal announcement, their first since the LG15 story was "outed". Many people running into it online will come here to find out about it, and it has at least a mention in the NYTimes. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 21:59, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; There are several forums available to document this. It could be added later once it's nature is determined (ARG, hoax, etc.). The current article also does not objectively cover the topic, as it interests a too narrow group of people at this point, and will most likely just be made vehicle for promotion. Vanillaflava 22:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the record, I committed the "highly inappropriate" step of advertising this topic by posting about it to the unfiction forums. Sorry, I didn't realize that was super-frowned upon at the time. In my defense, my posting (which I can't link to because the forums are down now) encouraged only wikipedians to come here and didn't advocate for creating new wikipedia accounts just to vote. Also, it seems that people attracted by this posting have voted both ways, not just "keep". Anyway, sorry. The forum is down and doesn't appear to be coming back with the old data anytime soon, so it seems my message contributed about four or five votes here, tops. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumpy_f2e6.html" title="User:Plumpy">Plumpy</a> 22:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Cassieiswatching is an immensely popular interactive fiction ARG; most other ARGs have their own wiki pages, sources are cited, and the page is a useful overview of this particular ARG. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardAdams_a38c.html" title="User:RichardAdams">RichardAdams</a> 00:14, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> Just because it's Internet culture doesn't mean it's not notable. We have articles on far more obscure things without them being challenged as non-notable-because they have nothing to do with Internet culture.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think it deserves a footnote in the lonelygirl15 page, but it is not notable enough to warrant a seperate article. Marsman57 03:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Per nom. I just see this as an advertising it's non notable doesn't ad anything but is just a buncha clips. Secondly it's taken over a lot of the lonelygirl article just as advertising. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirGrant_23af.html" title="User:SirGrant">SirGrant</a> 04:44, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just out of curiousity... advertising what? The "cassieiswatching" YouTube poster has no products to sell, and the Wikipedia entry has been created by fans of hers, not by an involved party <i>promoting</i> the videos, which is drastically different than <i>advertising</i>. The question is whether CIW is <i>notable</i>, not an ad-hoc assesment of whether the article was created purely by CIW's authors to promote it, which is unlikely considering the number of people who have contributed to the article. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 10:08, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Wikipedia has articles about a lot less popular and a lot more specialised topics, like <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skiploom.html" title="Skiploom">Skiploom</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaan_of_Troyius_47da.html" title="Elaan of Troyius">Elaan of Troyius</a>. I believe this shows, that the goal of Wikipedia is not becoming something as big as a print encyclopedia anymore, but something a lot bigger. Anyway: Every article only takes a neglectible amount of database space and if there are people interested in an article, it should be kept. --84.168.10.167 16:19, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Think for a minute, delete voters: LG15's article was initially deleted in a similar vote, until I nominated it for DRV and it got undeleted by an overwhelming majority, and of course since then the article has been hugely in demand. The right and wrong of that situation is clear. Wouldn't deleting this be making the same mistake? I have no doubt about this being notable. The phenomenon has reached such a level that all aspects of it, including spin-offs, are notable as well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think deleting lonelygirl15 was a mistake. Nor was it a mistake to bring it back. The notability of the subject changed and thus it was brought back. That is the way it is supposed to work. Lonelygirl15 being deleted was not a mistake at all, in fact it was perfect example of the wikipedia deletion procedure working exactly as it was designed to. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriptofcorbin_060f.html" title="User:Criptofcorbin">Criptofcorbin</a> 06:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I certainly <i>hope</i> it wasn't working properly in that instance, since she was plainly notable already when that first debate took place. We just had deletionists reflexively voting against something because of the subject: "just some blogger", "a fad" (some people think fads are non-notable), etc. It was more notable the second time around, yes, but it didn't switch from being non-notable to being notable in that time period (about a week, as I recall). It was just a bad decision. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:41, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP** This article goes with LG15, taking it away would leave newcomers to the story researching left with no information on the background of the videos.

<ul>
<li>You remember wrong. It was almost a month apart. It couldn't have been a bad decision it was just the right decision at the time. It went from have a majority of people favoring deletion the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_9cc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15">first</a> time to a unanimous keep the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_%28second_nomination%29_bfa8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15 (second nomination)">second</a> time. What was the difference you might ask? Perhaps what made her more notable was that she appeared in several main stream media news services and put out an additional 7 videos averaging over 500,000 views where her old views were closer to 200,000. I don't think wikipedians are idiots.</li>

<p><b>What did I do wrong?</b>: Obvious I made a mistake. This article has been listed for 9 days now. Everything I have read says it should be decided within 5 days. This is the first time I have ever put an article up for deletion and I tried to follow the step by step process, but it seems to me that I must have made an error somewhere.

<li><a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> is right; the process of AfD discussion and closing is often messier and slower than it ought to be, and this AfD is just one of those that hasn't been dealt with yet, for whatever reason.
