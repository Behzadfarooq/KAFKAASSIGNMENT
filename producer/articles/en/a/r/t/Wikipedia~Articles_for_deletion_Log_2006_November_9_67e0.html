<li><b>Delete</b> Subject fails the central requirement of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. No evidence of multiple features in national cultural publications. Citing an IMDB listing and a personal website are both of relatively little value under this guideline. I googled several pages deep and found no media mentions in notable publications, and not much that isn't either an automatic listing (IMDB) or Joel Manning-created content. There's no independent fan website. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 02:40, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Wikipedia is not an actor/dancer database, regardless of whether an article is self-promotional in nature. This subject shows no indication of coming close to passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> with his various bit parts/extra roles. He is not "clearly notable". Look at his IMDB entry - "Dancer" (in Clerks II and Jackass 2 and others) and "Lovin' Spoonfull #2 Bass Player" and "Zombie #2" etc. are not major roles. The "Mike Nesmith" role is also a bit part or at best a minor speaking role in one episode<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511729/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511729/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. So he is liked enough by the producers of American Dreams that they gave him bit part roles on more than one episode. He also got a couple of single episode bit parts (as a background dancer for a single scene in the most recent<a href="http://joelmanning.com/?p=68" class="external autonumber" title="http://joelmanning.com/?p=68" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) on not-well-known sitcoms. This is not encyclopedically notable. Its not notable enough for a magazine. This is not even "up and coming" unless we work for his agent (and besides, no crystal balling on Wikipedia). Allowing articles like this would mean open season on Wikipedia for every struggling/"up and coming" Hollywood actor with a couple of TV bit part credits on their resume <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see what you mean; the article is somewhat deceptive. At first glance, he appears to have an impressive body of work. I don't know what the show "American Dreams" is about, but I assumed from reading this that he had some kind of recurring role playing various celebrities (?). And stating that he is in Clerks II and Jackass II doesn't help. I guess I was also assuming more significance on this accident he had (overcoming disability to return to acting, etc.), but upon second glance it appears to just be filler. Changing my vote, unless something more noteworthy can be provided. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 03:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I looked around a bit and it looks like <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dreams_8683.html" title="American Dreams">American Dreams</a> had a gimmick that every episode, or most episodes, they would recreate musical acts that appeared in the 1960s TV music show <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bandstand_91e6.html" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a> - these do not seem necessarily to have anything to do with the plotline of the American Dreams episode (maybe some "theme" resonance). In an episode in the third season, a performance by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Monkees_8ee9.html" title="The Monkees">The Monkees</a> on Bandstand is recreated. It looks Joel Manning was part of this performance (with 3 others) as <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Nesmith_4c70.html" title="Mike Nesmith">Mike Nesmith</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did say "<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_part.html" title="Bit part">bit part</a>" not just extra roles. ( According to your own blog entry, your most recent sitcom dance role was not a major role. We're unfamiliar with SAG terminology, but this is an encyclopedia, not a SAG database.

<p>This does not appear to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The only references given are one article about Sarkis in a University of Florida college paper...and Sarkis works at the University of Florida. Of the other two, one mentions Sarkis but she is by no means the primary subject. The other just lists recent books and has a brief paragraph about her book. None of those, in my opinion, add up to Sarkis being the <i>primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</i>. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Stephanie+Sarkis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Stephanie+Sarkis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">97 unique Google hits</a> for "Stephanie Sarkis" and a mere <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Stephanie+Moulton+Sarkis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Stephanie+Moulton+Sarkis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">70 unique hits</a> for "Stephanie Moulton Sarkis".

<li><b>Keep</b> Google is not the sum of all knowledge. There <i>have</i> to be local newspaper articles out there. And I think Tony Siragusa is a big enough name to give this school notability.

<li>Actually, no it isn't. It's an example of how not to use search engines to assert notability. It's just an argument from counting search engine hits again, but simply using a different search engine to the usual one. In contrast <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a>, above, has actually read what xyr chosen search engine turned up.

<li>How many of those articles are mere <i>mentions</i>, that don't actually give any in-depth information about the school? And how many are in-depth articles about the school? Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite them</a>. If you can cite multiple in-depth articles that don't just <i>mention</i> the school but actually are detailed articles <i>about</i> the school, you can demonstrate that the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria are satisfied (and, at the same time, provide a proper basis for writing an article). You haven't actually made that case yet. All that you have done so far is count search engine hits. Counting search engine hits isn't research.

<li><b>Keep</b> Largely per precedent. As a general rule, to simply say delete because you disagree with an <i><b>Overwhelming Precedent</b></i> is bad form. As has been said, we're not made of paper. We have the capacity to handle such articles, and it's somewhat akin to trolling to nominate all such articles for deletion disregarding precedent. Precedent, while not explicitly, is a very good guide.<a href="../../../x/e/i/User%7EXeinart_b3eb.html" title="User:Xeinart">Xeinart</a> 05:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, that's exactly backwards. It's the invocation of precedent, which is simply the fallacious "If article X then article Y." argument once again, which is bad form. Every subject should be considered on its own merits. I suggest that you discard the idea of precedent and instead follow the example of <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">Newkai</a> above, who actually has the right idea but simply hasn't followed it through and made a proper case yet. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry it took so long to respond to this, I only just read it. Firstly, at the risk of coming off as way too pretentious for my own good, I ask you to use terms properly. What you described is not fallacious at all. Having said that, the gist of precedent is not "If article X then article Y", it's "If the <i>merits</i> of article X are the same as the <i>merits</i> of article Y, article X was kept, and <i>merits</i> are the determining factor in a keep or do not situation, then article Y should be kept."

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, how I hate these school articles... But I know when I'm beaten. Wikipedia has become infested with non-notable school articles, and this is another one. But there's a claque that votes to keep any article with the word "school" in the title, and they seem to outweigh the ( slightly less organised ) bunch of anti-"school" people, so the cruft accumulates. The entire issue has become a holy war for some people, so the best thing to do is just to let them have their way. In twenty or thirty years the issue will have died down, and the next generation can work out what to do. I reckon there are about 40-50 dedicated "any school is notable" people, and they can't possibly keep all the school articles updated reliably and efficiently, so in a couple of decades someone will suggest hiving off all the school articles to a separate directory, and the facts on the ground at that time will drive the case. In the meantime, let them have their victory: it's a poisoned chalice. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I am not going to 'vote' either way here, as I've gotten tired of these AfD's for high schools (and I typically support the AfD's and strongly feel that all high schools are NOT inherently notable), I did just want to make the comment that newspaper articles, especially local ones, are not good sources for proving notability for the simple reason that virtually all schools, including middle schools and elementary schools, are going to have numerous articles about them specifically in their local papers. All schools are important enough to the locals to get discussed regularly in the local papers; then again, so are all hospitals and pretty much all restaurants too, and we don't have articles on them... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - In addition to the reasons posted above, I'd also point out that the article is young and will likely grow as more people come across it on this debate.

I can't even figure out what criteria 5 even intends to mean: "The school has multiple alumni or staff members that, because of their activity in direct relation to the school, are notable enough to meet a biographical inclusion guideline such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>." What on earth does "because of their activity in direct relation to the school" mean, and who on earth WOULD be included by this criterion? Would <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Siragusa_a64f.html" title="Tony Siragusa">Tony Siragusa</a> -- who starred on the school's football team on his way to NFL -- pass this arbitrary test? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:23, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't assert that it didn't follow that proposed guideline (note that I expressed a keep opinion above)- as to the others you need to reread criteria 1 in that proposal which specifically rules out routine local coverage. As for it being in direct relation to the school- this seems to be being hashed out on the page. Furthermore, the proposal is not a "consensus of one person" but has a fair bit of support on the talk page right now. If you don't like the proposal you should go to the talk page and say so (as I invited people to do on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> talk page). In any event, this is all irrelevant because again as I observed many poeple have personal standards (That said, I do agree that it would be helpful if he would give more explanation of what he was thinking) <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:31, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that individuals should provide greater justification, keep or delete, referring to specific relevant Wikipedia standards and guidelines. I find your dismissal of this article's ability to satisfy <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> standard 1 on multiple, non-trivial coverage to be a significant demonstration of the non-viability of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> as an objective standard for determination of the viability of school articles. As the two articles cover respectively an anti-prejudice initiative exhibited at a local university and the details of the school's participation in a statewide inter-district initiative, it boggles my mind that these articles would be deemed "trivial" or "puff pieces" based on this proposed guideline. The "exclusion" of so-called "routine local coverage" -- which I would interpret to mean a sports result or a school play, but you seem to mean anything other than a multi-page in-depth article in a major national publication -- seems to be far too arbitrary to be a basis of judgment. If this is what criteria 1 in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> means, than it seems to be way too narrowly drawn to be useful or meaningful to weigh notability of schools. To put it succinctly, do the articles included in this article satisfy criterion 1, and if not, what would?<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, as The Way says "virtually all schools, including middle schools and elementary schools, are going to have numerous articles about them specifically in their local papers".

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think anyone is treating this as a war. I can see only two users who might be in that category, and one currently has an RfC over it and the other one almost got blocked for spamming all the inclusionist editors in alphabetical order to tip a DRV.

<li>And that means what precisely? For one, I didn't AfD this article. Are you saying that my arguing strongly for the removal of non-notable schools is so serious that you feel a need to speak up to counter me? Or are you saying that without my stubborness no school AfDs would be happening and I am the tipping point to make them keep happening? Either of those is flattering but I doubt that is what you meant so explaining might be helpful. As for the notion that I am treating this as a war, I think my record on school AfDs almost speaks for itself. I'm many of them I have been persuaded to change my opinion on those specific schools. Even as I argue for deletion I help clean up schools and add sources (see for example Brickey Elementary. Indeed, even in this discussion, I had a productive discussion with Alansohn above which has forced me to reevaluate certain issues. If I thought I was at war, do you think I would have endorsed a few minutes ago the opinions I endorsed on your RfC?

<dd>Right, but it doesn't mean much when it's one or two guys who are all friends using multiple accounts to attempt to unduly position things in their favor. Also, per nom is a linking statement which must specifically indicate previous statements made. There is no statement made and therefore per nom is invalid in this case as per nom can only be used on a factual basis. No facts have been contributed to this article since creation that indicate specific reasons the article should be deleted. The only 'reasons' listed are simply opinions and not factually based and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt by readers of this topic. - Akaneon 02:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> What credentails in wrestling? You cite yourself as being NWA Ref of the year when you referred less than three shows in a majority of those years according to people in NWA and the total votes from all years combined doesn't even reach 50. You're barely an Indy ref and truly shouldn't be bogging down Wikipedia with this crap. If you really want to get yourself over, go out and ref more and stop hanging on to accolades voted by less than five people a year, three of which are your friends.</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing the press coverage that was claimed but never shown. Normally a closer doesn't search, but normally people provide evidence rather than just vague claims of it. On a News search, I get one result and it's a simple mention that isn't very informative. On a regular google search, everything seems to be various random webpages either of credential check sites or other schools / practitioners. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_McKeith_894f.html" title="Gillian McKeith">Gillian McKeith</a> cites at least 2 articles from newspapers... this article cites nothing, none of the "news coverage" of McKeith mentions this group, let alone gives useful information on it.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This group does not seem to be primarily an accreditation mill; it also certifies practitioners, and claims to function as a referral service, etc. It may be scam-like, but it appears markedly more notable than the entry above; for instance, it gets more than 39K Google hits, 713 unique - most of them schools and practitioners mentioning their certification. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 10:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Was in the news as part of the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_McKeith_894f.html" title="Gillian McKeith">Gillian McKeith</a> education scandal. Obviously important to document these groups given the number of schools who cite them as accreditors. Finally, should be kept per the list guidelines, which mandate articles for list components and this is included in our <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:09, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1) You listed NO sources for that claim. Perhaps if it is so important it should be included to prove notablity? 2) Just because its on a list does not mean an automatic keep (as you have been told before.) 3) 713 unique google hits is not very many. 4) What are some of these "schools" its connected too? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Not sure what claim you are objecting to. Check the coverage on McKeith. This was major news in the UK. Otherwise, besides the list guidelines, I think we should be documenting all unrecognized accreditors, for the simple reason that people constantly claim bogus degrees from these groups. Merely listing them does not provide enough information for our readers. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article is badly sourced, but looking at the article about the author, this is a very notable comic (it's a character, but also the title of the series). The series is mentioned on the Comiclopedia<a href="http://lambiek.net/artists/p/pran.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lambiek.net/artists/p/pran.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, one of the most important sites for comics worldwide.

Judging from these different, independent, and reliable sources, this is not only a notable character, but one of the best known series of one of the best known Indian comics authors. I don't have access to any books about Indian comics, but I would urge nominators to at least do a little Google check (or your favourite serach engine) before nominating any article.

For example <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonograph.html" title="Phonograph">Phonograph</a> though is not popular today, is definitely notable to warrant an article. I am sure WIkipedia cares about Notability and not popularity. Everything that is popular is notable, but not everything that is notable is popular. Lack of popularity today per se is not a criteria for lack of notability <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span>
<ul>
<li>Your "Bad faith nom" comment is an accusation that I, as the nominator, acted in bad faith.

<li><b>Don't take it personally</b>; You had tagged a notable entity as non notable.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I agree with the points made above, but considering this lbum is supposed to be out in roughly 2 months surely there's something out there that can be said about this to make a real article and so the crystal ball can be used if we can see some evidence.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fancruft, listcruft. Basically List of jokes on The Simpsons episodes involving fictional machines. What next?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm iffy on this, just because in most cases, "List of fictional...whatever" articles are lists of things inherent to the nature of the show, for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Futurama_products_1138.html" title="List of Futurama products">List of Futurama products</a>--Futurama is set in the future, and a common joke on the show involves humourous, fururistic twists on modern-day products. The Simpsons is about family life and pop-culture in general--not <i>inventions</i>. This is just an extremely large list of an extremely random aspect of the show. Unless someone could provide a pretty good argument for keeping, I'd say delete (and who knows, there are some people who may be searching for this very thing?). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 06:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's no question that the Simpsons is notable, and will have a fair number of articles devoted to it. This list involves inventions which are often the focus of an episode, and in preference to having an article on each one, as some might possibly deserve it, I'd prefer just this one, as it can be more inclusive. Though I think this list should have links to the episodes the invention appeared in(some do already, some don't). In addition, you should note there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_products_in_The_Simpsons_1f14.html" title="List of products in The Simpsons">List of products in The Simpsons</a> (not to mention Vehicles and Homer's jobs) with which this could be merged as a seperate section. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW, I don't think lenght is a good argument against this list. It is not extremely large(though I could agree with removing some of the entries, that is not due to length, just inclusion), not necessarily going to get extremely large(I suppose the Simpsons could go on forever, but that's not a good argument for no list), and is short in comparison to some of the existing simpsons articles (like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">Neologisms of the Simpsons</a>).</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I like the Simpsons, I think most people do, and, more importantly, it is one of the most important shows in the past two decades. That being said, this does NOT mean we need lists for every-possible thing involving The Simpsons. This is listcruft/fancruft. Bwitth makes the same point I'd argue; if we let this stay, then we have to let virtually all lists regarding The Simpsons, no matter how random, stay. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 23:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><strike>Keep</strike> strong strong keep</b> Its an interesting article, I'm sorry to say I recognise many of the inventions and its a fabulous article which has collected together some very intesting aspects of the series into one place. Is it encyclopedic? Having written some stuff on the inrationality of faith in invention, it would be very useful to have an article with so many "irrational" inventions from which to draw examples. If anything I would like to see more details on each, some diagrams or pictures, but what is already there is a very good source material. Perhaps it should be compared to a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Robinson_c90f.html" title="Heath Robinson">Heath Robinson</a> invention --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really. What it establishes is that the term is really only known or heard among the mail-making community. Possibly only a small segment of it, since it's one of maybe two Google hits for the term in this sense that are not from Wikipedia mirrors.

<dd>I was asked to provide a reasoning behind my decision, so here goes: 1. If I count&#160;!votes I get roughly 21 dels, 13 keeps, that's a 60% majority for deleting, but really in no man's land between no consensus (ca. 50%) and rough consensus (ca. 67%). 2. The policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is very much in flux over whether glossaries are exemptions to the <i>Not a dictionary</i> provision. Unless there is consensus to strike the exemption I prefer to stick with the status quo ante (still reflected in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), which is that glossaries are acceptable. 3. Most importantly, the content of the article changed significantly in the last days of the debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> thanks mostly to edits by <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a>, and this change was reflected in a number of delete→keep changes and late keep&#160;!votes, so the early "delete not sourced"&#160;!votes are no longer on solid factual ground. Taking these three factors into account I did not see that consensus for deletion was established. This is a no consensus closure though so it can be renominated anytime. I recommend waiting three to four weeks for the policy debate to be settled and to see if the article improves, and consider renomination then. But of course I might be wrong, and that's what we have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you are using the definition of encyclopedic as "an alphabetical organization of fields of knowledge" then you are being pedantic. It is not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, no matter how much it tries to fit a dictionary definition of encyclopedic. It is not a collection of verifiable facts. If you are saying that it is, then I respectfully think you are wrong and agree to disagree.</li>
<li>If you are suggesting that articles, without sources, that are little more than stubs, that have existed in the same state for months, are verifiable, do you mean theoretically? Because, theoretically, <i>anything</i> is verifiable to some people.

<dd>Okay, apart from being demonstratably not an inclusionist (I've compared my AfD votes and it's pretty clear I'm a "centrist" on the issue - my keep arguments for articles that are deleted are a percentage of my keep arguments that equal to the percentage of my delete arguments where the article is kept) I'll show what the problem is when you vote to delete an article without first reading it.</dd>
<dd>If an article is appropriate for an encyclopaedia, but not for "the spirit of an encyclopaedia" then voting to delete it clearly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Rather than make value judgements about whether I particularly like a topic or not, I apply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she ain't paper</a> and ask merely "Is it encyclopaedic?" - here even you admit the answer is yes, so I'll move on.</dd>
<dd>I'll ask <i>is it sourced?</i> For this article, the answer is <b>yes</b> - clearly it's important to read the article to determine whether or not it's sourced. Merely guessing can result in the wrong answer. Being sourced (such as this article is) brings the advantage of a vaguely NPOV test of notability - someone else has found it notable enough to document - this is (I believe) a much more NPOV test than <i>Do I personally find this article interesting?</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd just like to note that people aren't providing reasons for their "keep" votes. It's not enough to say it's encyclopaedic, particularly when so many have argued that it's inherently <i>unencyclopaedic.</i> While items <i>on</i> the list may be verifiable, that still doesn't provide a convincing rationale for keeping the list itself, as mentioned in the original post. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> a precise list of terms on a given specific subject is authorized by policy. Terms such as bukkake, gokkun etc. are extremely well known and verifiable through tons of sources. I don't even understand the objection on that score. The nom seems to be questioning the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this list. Well, for better or worse, Japan and sex have been tightly intertwined in the western imagination since at least the 19th century.

The vast popularity of specific Japanese porn genres in the west is just a later-day manifestation of the previous craze for Japanese erotic prints.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this list is going to survive, what is listed on it needs to be very closely monitored. The fact so little of this article's definitions are unique to Japan is a big part of the problem with it. Very little of what was listed is unique to Japan - it simply defines a Japanese word for something which goes on all over the world. This is a deeper problem with Wiki wearby numerous topics of little or no note are documented in great depth, but let's not get into that here. So, what is of note out of the article? Just up to H, I'd argue that at least half of what is currently there is not in anyway unique to Japan and merely serves as a DicDef.

<li>Bukkake: A Japanese invention - worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Chikan: Not unique to Japan - of little note. However, has a long and meandering article (lifting large sections from Rotton.com as a source) suggesting otherwise...</li>
<li>Ecchi: Links to the article for the English letter H. A foreign slang word for sex - of little note</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- I voted to delete this before, but I've changed my mind, because the article is in different shape now. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but these are not simply translations of English phrases into Japanese but rather a completely different beast: sociological phenomena of sexuality in Japan, explained, and with articles about (most of) them. This could maybe use a renaming of some kind, but this list is cut down to the essentials and is encyclopedic. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> and you'll see that this kind of list is much like other kinds of lists given there. I can't help but think that many of the people who endorse deletion under the dictionary argument haven't noticed these points, but rather noticed the "list of ... terms" and didn't like the article concept. So like I said, maybe renaming is a good idea, but I'm not sure to what. Still, this goes well beyond mere "terms." <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Question about how such a journal could attain notability: If articles in it become notable (discussed in refereed scientific journals, discussed in New York Times and CNN? Does that make the journal encyclopedic, or only the writers of the article? If noted scientists publish in it does that confer notability? Issue 1 has an article co-authored by Herbert Terrace, well known at least in experimental psychology. I expect that the distinguished Columbia faculty will frequently be co-authors of papers in it, and that those will get cited by their peers if they say something significant. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If that occurs, the journal will have some notability. We will still need to have enough data about it from independent sources to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (which I'm not convinced we have at this point). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply to Edison:</b> My knowledge of scientific literature is, well, developing, but IMHO for a journal to be notable, it should have a higher impact than CUSJ. I searched Google Scholar and found one hit for CUSJ, a request from a student to publish a paper in the journal. As JoshuaZ says, I have no prejudice against recreation, should it become notable. For now, it's not. If the Columbia faculty publish their articles in the journal, and these articles are cited, then the journal obviously attains some notability. Perhaps the guidelines for this should be made clearer? Just a thought... 124.177.238.175 03:27, 11 November 2006 (UTC) <small><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana_dzasta</a>, logged out.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wow, I remember finding and cleaning up this article, like a year ago, it seems. It survived this long, and now it's up for deletion, and possibly speedy delete?

No, no no, and again I say NO. All we have here is an apparently notable subject, very little information, and no citations whatsoever in the article.

I'm all for deleting articles that with the currently available sources can not be saved (you can check my track record if you want to), but at the same time we are here to <i>build</i> an encyclopedia, not only to discuss it. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with what you are saying, Fram. But we are not even presented with an article that could reasonably be called a stub here-- which in this case would be (1)the name of the article, (2)at least one sentence that explains what it is and why it is important, and (3)at least one reference source that shows the sentence is verifiable. Yandaman's quote about putting on a bathrobe before you walk out the door is very apt. Wikipedia's help information explaining to newcomers what they should do if they want to create a new article warns everyone that they should do their research and get the article in good condition before posting it, because a sub-standard article may well be deleted before you get time to come back and make improvements. Whenever someone improves an article to at least stub quality and there is some indication that someone actually will continue improving an article I have always changed my vote to "keep." (check my track record, too) I have not suggested that we completely obliterate any efforts to have an article about Freej cartoon, and in fact <i>I have suggested options for keeping alive the hope for a good article on this subject without needlessly cluttering Wikipedia with substandard material.</i> <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 18:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we dealing merely with poor writing here? Or are we dealing with the scribblings of a child-- say junior high school aged-- who decided to fiddle around with Wikipedia features briefly and then disappeared? <b>What's on the article page is something that should have been done in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/WP%7Esandbox_8744.html" title="WP:sandbox">sandbox</a>,</b> not in a regular article page.

<p>This article makes no attempt whatsoever of referencing any "sources" or presenting verifiable data.</p>
<p>In fact, this article seems about a fictitious company featured in the November 9th episode of the television show "Jericho", which I have myself viewed. The information in the article appears to be based off of events in the television show.</p>
<p>If no information can be found that this company actually exists, this article should be promptly removed. NorCal Ryan 09:34, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating this article for deletion second time. First time according to my count <i>27 votes were for deletion and 19 for keeping</i>. The deletion votes were coming more regularly in the end but it was closed. If the admin had extended it closing deadline then we might had reach on a consensus. The reasons of deleting it are many. <b>(1)</b> The sources used for making other sites as third holiest sites are not reliable. Mostly the criterion of number of people visiting a site is used to make it holiest for Muslims then our third holy site <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>. <b>(2)</b> A very vast majority of Muslim agree that third holiest site is <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> article could have a section for small minority not agree with it. Creating a new separate article looks like a effort to make our claim of majority disputed and a conspiracy against Muslims. <b>(3)</b> The references that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is indeed third holiest site (nothing else) are very strong. We have many hadiths from Sahih Bukahri and others. Furthermore, also it was place towards where Muslim used to offer their Prayer instead of Kaba in Mecca. It is our Kabla-Awal (first Kaba). How could something be holiest than our Kabla-awal? Please do not use CNN/Fox as a source to tell Muslim that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is no more third holiest to us. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 09:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not really subjective but some people are trying to make it subjective in this article. For example: a hadith from Sahih Bukhari: <i>"the Prophet of Allah Muhammad said a prayer in the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca) is worth 100,000 prayers; a prayer in my mosque (in Medina) is worth 1,000 prayers; and a prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is worth 500 prayers more than in an any other mosque</i>. Also another hadith says: <i>... Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques: Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem).</i>[Sahih Bukhari: Volume 3, Book 29, Number 87]. This article try to conspire against our Kabla-awal. Muslims have ever offer prayer towards only two places Kaba in Mecca and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>. But they are telling us other sites are more holiest to us. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 10:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_f296.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Third holiest site in Islam">previous AfD</a> was closed (by me) a couple of days ago as "no consensus". This should really be an issue for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, and in hindsight maybe I should have relisted the AfD to attain a better consensus. Anyway, this is an article that seems to deal with an issue that is somewhat potentially inflammatory (weasel wording intended). I do not know the fundamental details of this issue, but I can see that there are differing views on the matter. From what I can see, there is some substance to the claims made in the article. Perhaps an acceptable compromise can be reached if an article named Holy sites in Islam or Muslim Holy Sites, in which the holy sites were not ranked, was created.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 11:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">User:ALM scientist</a> lists the reasons for deletoing as follows:
<ol>
<li>The sources used for making other sites as third holiest sites are not reliable. Mostly the criterion of number of people visiting a site is used to make it holiest for Muslims then our third holy site Al-Aqsa Mosque.
<ul>
<li>How can you clarify this? I read that The Imam Ali mosque received more pilgrims? Besides, all along it has been argued that this has nothing to do with it, but rather it is the 3rd holiest b/c of Koran, hadith etc!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A very vast majority of Muslim agree that third holiest site is Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Aqsa Mosque article could have a section for small minority not agree with it. Creating a new separate article looks like a effort to make our claim of majority disputed and a conspiracy against Muslims.
<ul>
<li>This was originally included in a section in Al Aqsa mosques, but was removed after complaints and a new article was created to conform with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">W:NPOV</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The references that Al-Aqsa Mosque is indeed third holiest site (nothing else) are very strong. We have many hadiths from Sahih Bukahri and others. Furthermore, also it was place towards where Muslim used to offer their Prayer instead of Kaba in Mecca. It is our Kabla-Awal (first Kaba). How could something be holiest than our Kabla-awal? Please do not use CNN/Fox as a source to tell Muslim that Al-Aqsa Mosque is no more third holiest to us.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There have been thorough arguments against this notion discussed in the previous deletion attempt. CNN/Fox are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">reliable sources</a> whether you like it or not! <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>CNN/Fox/Time/PBS/CBS (and any other news source which this article may souurce) have said the Al-Aqsa mosque is Islams third holiest site several times, and it looks like they readily acknowledge the same.

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Like I've said before, this article is an indiscriminate collection of links with no regard to <i>factual accuracy</i> or reliability. <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of Information</i>. Several of the sources are not reliable sources and are <i>not in accordance with WP:Verifiability, WP:Reliable Sources</i> (Several self published sources and no 3rd party analysis to back the sources) and <i>Undue Weight</i> is given to self published sources. While one can try to assume good faith, the creator(s)/major contributors themselves have expressed the political/religious inclinations they wish to satisfy by creating this article. It's unreasonable to assume good faith on part of users who openly declare that they are acting in bad faith. Therefore I feel this article was written in <i>Bad faith</i>, and on top of that <i>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</i>. Also, most of the article is just a collection of obscure external links which just say "site is third holiest" without any theological reason. So, that's a <b>lot</b> of policies violated. There were attempts to improve the article, but the long edit wars prove that this <i>cannot be done</i>. Finally, any credible information in this article has already been added to the respective articles of any site, so this article can be safely deleted without any loss of information. I also humbly request certain users that are in favour of keeping this article to refrain from resorting to insulting/flaming the users that want it deleted - and discuss the article itself. Also, I request some users that want it deleted to keep their cool. Any fears of "Only Muslims controlling what is said about Islam on wikipedia" are completely unfounded and keeping such an article is not the proper way to address such fears. If people readily accept whatever is written on the internet and everything was factually correct, wikipedia would not be required, Google would suffice. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">thestick</a> 14:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG SPEEDY DELETE</b>: Per my input at the previous AFD request.

Certainly the title "Third Holiest site in Islam" implies that this is a status given in the religion of Islam and relates to all Muslims regardless of being in Turkey or Pakistan or Tunisia. This title is to the common 3 cities notable to all muslims regardless of where they happen to be. Again to the Turkish example, it does not seem that Muslims give this recognition and embark on a journey to visit the mosques in Turkey and the Turkish Northern Cyprus Republic. Similar thing can be said to al-Juwanah mosque and so forth.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge salvageable parts in the relevant article on the Mosque. The reason is that this article is merely a list of mostly non-notable utterances by non-scholarly media sources, and as such, does not warrant an entry into an encyclopedia except (and forgive me for saying this) for malicious intentions. It would be one thing if this article documents actual scholarly references to various sites that are regarded as the 'third holiest', but this article actually is a compilation of quotes by various individuals or media organisations - that mostly have no scholarly knowledge of the subject and would probably stand corrected if confronted - that <i>passingly referred</i> to some site or another as the "third holiest" for Muslims. "Passive reference" from sources such as a reporter or a member of a non-relevant organisation is not grounds to creating an encyclopedic article. If this article was quoting people who actually know what they are talking about, e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Armstrong_ba0b.html" title="Karen Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a>, it would be a different story.

<dd>Well, at least she <b>is</b> a writer on religion, which these sources are not. <i>And that's the point:</i> The vast majority of the sources used in this article are NOT sources that are discussing the "level of holiness" of the Aqsa Mosque. These are just random utterances in passing by people who were not saying what they said to make an argument about what is or is not the third holiest site in Islam. If this article stays, it would need to be encyclopedic - meaning that it would have to include sources that are making an argument about the holiness of the Mosque and not just news clippings of quotations being uttered <i>in passing</i> by people who are actually emphasizing a different matter entirely. That is why this article is just disingenuous and horribly misleading and un-encyclopedic.

<b>Here is my 2 cents worth</b>: I would like to ask why there is no article called "First Holy City in Islam" or "Second holy City in Islam"? I think there is enough junky material on the Web that can support such a WikiPedia article if the same standards for creating the third holiest article are followed. For example, only one hour of so-called research I spent on the Web was enough for me to collect to citations that disupte that Madina is the second Holiest city in Islam.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the new arguments for "keep," where they seem sincere, elevate procedure over policy. Where the arguments for "keep" sincerely concern content questions, I repeat again that any actual "controversy" here could and should be discussed on pages devoted to articles on respective sites, using authoritative sources. I myself harbor no illusions regarding the nature of this piece, and I assume its more vigorous defenders don't either, so I will be frank: WP is not a soapbox, nor a battleground. The authors of this piece seem to me to want to use WP to bait Muslims with a made-up "controversy" regarding their sacred sites, and they have done so. I am sure that anyone here who has previously encountered long-term, complex editing abuse in other subject areas recognizes the systematic and sustained pattern of exploitation of policy for mischievous purposes that we see here. We have also seen before how WP procedures for addressing the problems caused by partisan posters are defeated when more than a few gather to prevent corrective action based on "a consensus." While it is clear, given the nature of this dispute, that a "consensus" cannot be achieved realistically, it is also clear that, given the references this article lines up, "the controversy" this article seeks to establish does not exist in any substantial form anyway. Those of you in the US may be aware of a particular Fox News commentator who uses the network to flog sales of a sensationalist book he wrote on a "liberal conspiracy against Christmas." This is exactly that kind of shallow, partisan scholarship, entirely intended to cause a ridiculous dispute, that I am seeing the WP mainspace, procedures and policy being exploited to perpetuate here. As some of the comments in this AfD and the last one show, there are people in the real world and on WP who are gullible enough to believe "any" reference, or "any" article, even on WP, substantiates "anything." --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 02:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I call it as I see it. The editors in question seem fine Wikipedians with great records in other capacities, I would say especially on topics that have to to do with Israel or Judasim, but sustained efforts to paint this one particular Islamic site a certain way don't at all seem "well-intentioned" to me. To me, the bending of WP policies and prodecures to allow for this here and in other articles qualifies as a complex pattern of editing abuse, and I would advise all editors truly concerned with WP policy over their own politics not to support the keeping of this article.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 23:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>but surely Tew the whole point of this is that (at least regarding the article's creator, in this instance) good faith is demostrably lacking, per my above on <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">User:Amoruso</a> and others noting the 'pov fork'. but contra Amer this instance seems to be a blatant attempt on the part of Amoruso to confuse a very important issue "to do with Israel or Judasim". again, everyone pls check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;oldid=74295402" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;oldid=74295402" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>&#160;<b>→</b> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball">bsnowball</a> 11:10, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep if thoroughly improved</b> This my-site-is-holier-than-yours-business has been around forever. Sectarian dispute, aided by scholarly opinion even led to minor warfare around this issue.

If, and only if, somebody would morph the article into a disinterested overview of the history of "holy-site ranking" disputes, the article has merit. As it is, it's just sectarian mud-slinging. Also, the name "Third holiest site in Islam" is obviously awkward, to say the least. But the concept has merit. <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzate_9435.html" title="User:Azate">Azate</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article cannot be maintained in a NPOV state. The reason for that is the fact that the article was created to settle scores in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The fact that you could in principle have a bona fide article on this subject doesn't mean that we should keep this article. Similarly, if Neo-Nazis were to create an article about genocides with the intent of diminishing the Jewish Holocaust, you would have little chance that the usual wiki procedures would be effective in producing a NPOV article on that subject. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 14:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Content forking...for the sake of spoilers. We don't need "spoiler free" versions of the same article (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">here</a> is the original article). That's what spoiler warning tags are for. This is almost as bad as trying to POV fork.</p>
<p>The following three articles are being bundled in:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a pity this violates wikipedia policy, I found these articles(for stargate sg1 and atlantis) helpful.

The rationale behind the "spoiler-free" versions is more to provide a text-only tabulated list of episodes that doesn't take as long to load, than it is to be spoiler-free.

<li>As pointed out by the anon ealier up, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> seems to serve the purpose of a "text-only tabulated list". Something like <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> is fine in the sense that it's really a summary article - collecting all buffyverse media into a chronological table.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've noticed this for a while, but didn't care to get in a dispute over it. I do agree with the nom; we shouldn't be making forks for the sake of spoilers alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It did make me think about possible ways to have such a second list but for a reason other than "spoiler free". If a list "without summaries" can be seen as useful and a logical list on Wikipedia, but for reasons other than hiding spoilers, then that might be worth exploring. One thing to note is that Stargate has <i>10 seasons</i>, and images for <i>each</i> episode. That can be a hell of a page to load for some users. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes_695c.html" title="List of The Simpsons episodes">List of The Simpsons episodes</a> (18 seasons) deals with this issue by having a main list that does not have images or summaries (making it free of spoilers, but more as a "side effect") and then has sub episode listings per season. Keep in mind that Stargate SG-1 is being dropped from Sci-Fi channel, and might not have future seasons. Still, even just 10 is a lot of stuff on one page.</li>
</ul>

<li>I'm not sure if there is another method or rational that would allow for such a "spoiler free" version to co-exist with one(s) with summaries?

<dd>Having the spoiler free list as the main list and the spoiler list split into seasons would work quite well. It might end up with them all getting put up for deletion as not being notable enough for an article of their own, though. Over 200 screenshots on one page is rather excessive... --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:23, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>use a spoiler tag on the spoiler list? Add a link to the category on the spoiler list. The category in effect serves as a spoiler free list of all episodes, since it shows only the name. If people really wanted to, they can tag the episode articles such that they'll show in the category in order (so like [[category:category of episode articles|episode number]]). Or on the spoiler list, have a spoiler free list of episodes first, then summaries below. There're plenty of ways to give readers fair warning without having to create redundant pages. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 02:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even if the category was in order, it wouldn't say what the numbers were or what seasons they were in, nor would in include air dates, etc.. And putting the spoiler free list first and then the summaries would just be putting both pages on one page - if you're going to keep it all, it might as well stay on two pages. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if we keep all POVs about a topic in one article, then we may as well keep each POV as a seperate page? That's the same idea as what you're suggesting --&gt; to cause a content split in an article. Which is meant to be a big no-no. Having the list first and then summaries would be just like putting both pages on one article, but what's wrong with that? Where as them as seperate pages is a problem because it's essentially a content fork. Wait, it's a content fork and a redundant page, since the "list" would exist on both articles, just that one of the articles also has summaries and the other doesn't. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Besides, where to draw the line? I can imagine a spoiler free overview articles on movies and books to be useful, and not to mention spoiler redirects. Go take a look at the spoiler policy talk page if you want to see how far that got. If this is just because of the usefulness of a summary-free list, then something like <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> covers it. List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes (spoiler free) is basically a shortened version of <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> containing only the TV episodes, but serves no other purpose. Where as <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> does also serve the purpose of being a full chronological list of all Buffyverse media. Someone who wants a spoiler free list can just go to <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a>, although being spoiler free isn't its original purpose. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't about POV, it's about helping the reader find the information they want without finding information they don't want. There is nothing POV about it. What's wrong with having both pages on the same page is that it would be far too long - when pages get too long, standard policy is to split them in a sensible way into multiple pages, the most sensible way would be to split the list and the summaries into separate article, and you'd end up with what we started with. Yes, the information on the spoiler free page is redundant, put its purpose is not to provide more information, it's actually to provide less information. If we could have the spoiler page not including the info that's already on the spoiler free page, that would be great, but it wouldn't actually work (you can't have summaries of episodes without listing the episodes). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>uhh...splitting the article when it gets too long? I think you're forgetting, that the ultimate purpose of splitting a very long article is to make it into several <i>shorter</i> articles. This spoiler split doesn't solve anything. Because as you said, you can't have summaries of episodes without listing them. So we're not "splitting the list and the summaries into seperate articles" at all. We're "copying the list out into a seperate article."</dd>
<dd>And as i said, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_chronology_%28tabulated%29.html" title="Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)">Buffyverse chronology (tabulated)</a> serves the exactly purpose you described ("helping the reader find the information they want without finding information they don't want"). I'm sure other projects like stargate can find an equally sensible way to provide a list that satisfies the purpose, but isn't just a redundant copy of information from another article for the purpose of spoiler protection. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that you can't have the summaries without the list applies just as well to the summaries being at the bottom of one article as it does to the summaries being in a separate article. If you had it all on one page, you would have the list duplicated on one page, rather than spread over two pages. A chronology like the Buffy one would just end up being a spoiler free version of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Stargate_13cd.html" title="Timeline of Stargate">Timeline of Stargate</a>. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 18:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This band was also on an MTV special. It suits notability criteria number 5.</p>
<p>This is user SaxIndustries - I'm not sure how to properly tag things in this discussion, but I thought I should mention, the NESkimos have been featured in Jacksonville's Folio Weekly (a weekly printed newspaper), there's a scan of the article on ForGreatJustice.org, here's a direct link: <a href="http://www.forgreatjustice.org/phpgallery/albums/userpics/10001/Scan001.PDF" class="external text" title="http://www.forgreatjustice.org/phpgallery/albums/userpics/10001/Scan001.PDF" rel="nofollow">NESkimos in Folio Weekly</a></p>
<p>There's also an article from their appearance at the <a href="http://www.thewsvg.com/news/59/" class="external text" title="http://www.thewsvg.com/news/59/" rel="nofollow">World Series of Videogames.</a></p>
<p>As well, they've been on an MTV Special, the top 20 videogames of all time countdown (I don't remember the exact title, unfortunately), and they had a brief mention in Spin Magazine last year. I believe these qualify for the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria.</p>
<p>I will openly admit, though, some items on the NESkimos wikipedia article didn't need to be there, such as all that detailed information on the web forums, and talk of users going through hard times together, or whatever it said, that was all completely useless. But I do believe they are an important band, and a Wikipedia-worthy band at that.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, why this page is marked for deletion, but not, say, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Minibosses_a43b.html" title="The Minibosses">The Minibosses</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Kaufman_3f58.html" title="Jake Kaufman">Jake Kaufman</a>, both of which are just about as big in the video game music community as are <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_NESkimos_4ad2.html" title="The NESkimos">The NESkimos</a>. I think the problem is, nobody in the video game music community really qualifies in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, seeing as how a lot of groups have problems getting the songs licensed and are unable to release an actual record on a real label, which prohibits them from winning any major music awards, breaking into the mainstream, etc. It's an undergound kind of thing at best, but it is a fairly large movement, and these bigger acts do deserve their own Wikipedia articles. I mean, the NESkimos and Minibosses did both play at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_Expo_767b.html" title="Penny Arcade Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a> 2005, which had over 9,000 visitors (I'm not saying 9,000 were at the concert, but even 10 percent would be 900 people) which equates to a pretty large concert, even for some of the bigger mainstream acts out there.</p>
<p>The main point is, the NESkimos do in fact qualify in point five of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, meaning the article should be kept. SaxIndustries</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The name of the show on MTV was "Ultimate Video Game Countdown". It was sponsored by MTV and Electronic Gaming Monthly. It originally aired on January 2nd, 2004. It was a 20 game countdown, and the NESkimos were featured in the segment for the number 1 game, The Legend of Zelda. If this doesn't qualify them under #5 for Musicians and Ensembles, then also consider that they are one of the foremost recognized bands in the video game cover genre, having wide recognition on the internet, as well as playing shows at The World Video Game Championships in 2006, Penny Arcade Expo in 2005 &amp; 2006, and MAGfest 2005 &amp; 2006, which should qualify them under #7.</li>

<p>Characters from an amateur unpublished series yet to be released on <s>Google video</s>MySpace. The bundle nomination also includes other characters: <b>CoCo Nuts, Zileus Chimpusgus, Marcus Nuts, Boris P. Nuts, Junior Chimpusgus, Mr. Harley Davidson</b>, as well as the main article about the series, <b>Ape Hotel</b>, all recently created by the same user.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Ape Hotel will not simply be a Google video show. It will be something people can actually download (in low quality) and buy on DVD. It won't just be some goofy thing you find on You Tube. Also profits from the show will be partially split between GrASP and WSPA. It will also eventually be on tv. TheChimpanator 12:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nehwyn you seem to have something strongly against these articles. Do they offend you in some way? I'd have thought official website would be up there with straight from the horses mouth but there you go. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by TheChimpanator (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheChimpanator_924f.html" title="User talk:TheChimpanator">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheChimpanator_26db.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheChimpanator">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>No, the articles have not been nominated due to their offensive nature (they have none), but rather on the basis of lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, as well as the fact that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. I can see you're a newcomer editor; don't be discouraged by a deletion nomination. Read the guidelines and policies linked in this debate and try and fulfill them so the articles meet Wikipedia quality criteria. If you do, they will most likely be kept. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 13:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anyone can create a web site and publish all sorts of things on it. That doesn't make what they publish true. (Remember the lesson of <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a>.) This "official web site" is a <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> page. When creating Wikipedia articles, don't use sources where you are just taking the creator's/author's/subject's own sole word for things. Use sources where other people, independent of the subject, and with names and good reputations, have checked facts. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unless someone else is creating them then I don't think there are any more. I stopped making them after I kept getting this will be deleted warnings, now I'm just trying to save what I've already done but it appears no one else sees this as worthy. Again I say this is a real show that will be on real tv, maybe only in Australia but I know the people behind it, they're going to get it out there no matter what. They're just dedicated to the cause. It's a charity show and it means a lot to a lot of people...correction, there is one more page. Mr. Harley Davidson. TheChimpanator 13:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right on that one, I had put the AfD notice on it, but then forgot to mention it here among the others (corrected now). As for the rest of your remark... again, encyclopaedias are not for speculations and projects about the future; you can repeat that the series is going to be on TV as many times as you like, but please keep in mind that you need to quote <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that it is indeed scheduled for TV (even just in Australia) if you want the articles kept. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 13:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok so as the shows isn't technically out there yet and thus there is nothing I can do to save the articles, I will delete them myself and repost them when the series has offically debut on actual television, not TAFE tv or internet. Sorry if this has pissed anyone off. TheChimpanator 14:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well..um...having said that I don't actually know how to delete them so you'll have to do it i guess. It would have been great to just leave it but until the show is on tv there is nothing else I can do.TheChimpanator 14:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> WP:BIO, aside from being merely a guideline rather than policy, is not all inclusive. Really, the real question when discussing whether or not an article should be deleted is: Does its presence actually <i>hurt</i> anything? <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 13:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that is <i>not</i> the question, because "Keep my article. It's not hurting Wikipedia to have articles on me, my friends, and the things that we just made up in school today!" is the perennial argument of people who want to keep bad articles. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is, in contrast, the simple elaboration of our <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> policy that Wikipedia doesn't have biographical articles for every person that exists or ever existed, and has been consistently employed for several years, now. So I suggest that rather than making the same bad arguments that the defenders of bad articles make, you make <i>good</i> arguments, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a>, to demonstrate that the WP:BIO criteria are satisfied by thiIt is interesting to wonder whethers person. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You do need to. You're wrong, not the criteria. Perpetual stubs without scope for expansion have always been deletable, per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> all the way back to 2003, and as I said, the WP:BIO criteria are simple elaborations of what WP:NOT has said for several years, too. Citing substantial non-autobiographical sources to demonstrate that there is scope for expansion will satisfy the primary WP:BIO criterion as well as the Deletion policy and What Wikipedia is not. But a lack of sources yields a 2 sentence perpetual stub, with no scope for expansion, whose information is already contained in the article on the town, and which is deletable per all three of WP:DP, WP:NOT, and WP:BIO.

<li>Just because something is written as policy does not make it <i>ipso facto</i> correct. But, anyway, the article is not destined to be a perpetual stub. I have several non-autobiographical sources of information; my plan was (and still is) to keep fleshing it out over the next week or so. Would everyone involved be amenable to closing this discussion until I (and others) get it written, and revisiting the matter later if some deem it necessary? <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm usually in favor of keeping elected officials, but a small-town mayor seems a bit too obscure. It seems a close call to me, but I think it fails WP:Bio. (I could see it merged into an article on the town, though.) I totally disagree with the "it's not hurting anything" argument. If WP was turned into a pile of non-notable articles, I'd consider that a harm. On WilyD's point, if we think this will never be anything more than a stub, I would argue that it may as well be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 16:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just curious--WHY would you consider that harm? Some argue that it will bring disrepute to the encyclopedia; I fail to see how having more information than other encyclopedias can be a bad thing.

<dd>Sure - just briefly, I see two harms. One is technological / financial (i.e. it must cost something to store extraneous data without slowing down access to the non-extraneous stuff). If there aren't some limits, then the infrastructure does eventually break down. The second is that an encyclopedia clogged with anything and everything is less useful and harder to manage. I'll stop there, though - because I think this is a debate better suited to the discussion pages of WP:Notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While notability is not a policy, it certainly is a valid reason for deletion if consensus finds it to be so. What's more, improving an article cannot increase notibility of the subject. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The consensus on one particular debate does NOT trump policy. Furthermore, while improving an article does not increase the notability of a subject, it can add a claim to such (although it is not needed, as notability is not a valid reason for deletion) if it does not yet exist. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 22:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I know that consensus cannot trump policy, I am not aware that any policy exists saying notability is an invalid reason for deletion. And yes, you are correct in that providing proof can help demonstrate the notability of the person. The duration of the AfD should make that feasible. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:39, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not really...I only have a limited amount of time to spend on Wikipedia each day, and that time comes in small chunks (2-3 minutes). Furthermore, most people don't revisit these, so changing the article will do absolutely nothing to affect their suggestion in this discussion. All I can do is try to convince future participants that this should be left alone, and the time spent doing that is time I cannot spend working on the article itself. And if I can't keep the article from being deleted because certain individuals (including, quite possibly, whoever the closing admin is) choose to ignore policy or are too lazy to see if the arguments being posted are actually valid with regards to this particular article (admins have quite a bit of leeway when closing AfDs, but most of them choose not to use it and instead just lazily tally up the "Keeps" and "Deletes" rather than weighing the strength of the arguments and their relevance to the article as it actually is), then there's no point in working on the article any further, is there? See my essay, <a href="../../../g/i/v/Wikipedia%7EGive_an_article_a_chance_3c56.html" title="Wikipedia:Give an article a chance">Wikipedia: Give an article a chance</a>. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your confusion is in thinking that this is a vote. If a person voiced an opinion to delete on the basis of a claim, then that claim is later disproven, and that person never comes back, then the following should happen:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>An admin will see that the AfD is old enough to close</li>
<li>This admin will look at all the claims</li>
<li>This admin will weigh the claim based on if arguement is valid or not(considering available evidence)</li>
<li>If the closing admin sees that an opinion is based on an idea that has been proven to be inaccurate then that opinion will be given little or no weight.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I am saying in a rather longwinded sort of manner is that these sorts of discussions are dealth with using common sense, and beyond common sense a sense of fairness and objectivity limited only by the personality of the closing admin. There is no simple vote count at the end, but a consideration of the ideas and opinions brought forth aswell as their justification.</dd>

<dd>No, I'm quite aware that it is not a vote. If you had bothered to read what I had actually written above, you would have seen that my point is that, while admins are supposed to do what you said, they generally are too lazy to bother. So an article that clearly shouldn't get deleted gets deleted.</dd>

If it were a name of a theoretical type of device then I would expect to many reference to articles showing it was in common use.

<li><b>Relax Guys!</b> - this is a legit informational page. Everyone has one of those, EVEN YOU! If that is not the case, than lets kick out all the Sony,Phillips, BMW, etc. pages! What I see is that you are just acting in a discrimatory way, since this content has to do with religion! That is absolutly against the spirit and the concept of a FREE community encyclopedia! This article is not a propaganda, nor a advert! There many people in hungary, myself included who are intested in the charity work of YWAM organisation. This organisation is NON-profit therefore your idea of this article being used in commercial reasons is irrational! if you have any question or further comments please refer to me and I will gladly explain to you who YWAM and what it does. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS ARTICLE!</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Its irrelevant whether this is propaganda or not, the organization is still non-notable. You may do some good things. You may have some committed volunteers. But this isn't notable; Sony, BMW and Phillips are. Bottom line. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 21:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I DO NOT THINK SO</b> hey montco - I don not really think that the organisation needs to be <b>notable</b> to be on Wikipedia. There is no such rule, plus you can not just favor big corporate mashines who make millions of dollars exploiting 3rd world countries and completely disregard non-profit organisations who try to make a difference. All I am saying is that YWAM is actually doing a lot for the communities all over the world and espacially Hungary! It will be a shame to bully an organisation that tries to make people's life better! See, your agruments have no weight because you have no idea of YWAM's charity work and commitment. By the way, speaking of being notable, fyi YWAM has regional offices in almost EVERY country of the world, that means it is registered in recognised in all of these countries(I don't think you can say the same about such huge corporations like APPLE or even GOOGLE! ), even the coutries where there is evident opression and persecution of religion. That is really ironic that those country's governments legally and in fact accept YWAM but this "FREE", "COMMUNITY" encyclopedia does not! My belief is that u are completely biased and the "religious" background of YWAM scares you.</li>

I see no use of <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent sourcing</a> to establish any such notability, so no seperate article should exist.

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears that since this person died in the 1930's, there aren't going to be alot of web resources on him and I'm guessing the sources of this article have come from books. But I did add one web source from Today's Outlook Magazine, a middle eastern magazine.

<dd>In science, not everyone is going to invent the wheel or the computer. Science is <u>always</u> a collaborative effort. And innovation always uses elements of previous innovations.

<dd>As requested by Oakshade, I've had another look at the entry. If all that is mentioned is true (and I can't be sure from the article) then this guy definitely deserves an entry just for his shear work. If the article can substantiate that "The original solar cell was invented and tested by Mr. Al-sabbah in 1930", even with a patent number, then there's no question about keeping the entry. However, I couldn't find him in google (was the internet invented in 1930?).--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 00:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Clearly, it will surprise Oakshade to learn that editing articles under AfD is <b>encouraged</b>. Since removing the unsourced exaggerations means the article is <i>less</i> likely to be deleted, I don't see his beef.

But I got suspicious about the highly Anglofied nature of the US in the early 20th century and did a search of just "Sabbah" and found a TON of patents in the 1920's and 1930's by "Camil Sabbah" or "C.

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears the Tenshin Aikido Federation has just been deleted for being blatent advertisement. Tenshin is a word that means heaven-mind and is used in the names of a number of martial arts the most notable being <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB_e44a.html" title="Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū">Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū</a>. Personally if the word is going to redirect anywhere it should be there, since that school is about 400 years old. Tenshin is in the name of the aikido school founded by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Seagal_fd07.html" title="Steven Seagal">Steven Seagal</a> and his then wife and as far as I know it is still called that although Mr. Seagal has no longer anything to do with it. Tenshin aikido is how some of Seagal's refer to what they do but there does not seem to be a consensus (read a whole lot of public sniping). The dojo of his ex-wife is certainly of a different type and has nothing to do with these groups.

<ul>
<li>It's been marked as such for a while. As I said, not only does it not have any references, I doubt that it ever can have proper references. You show me a source that identifies what's a reference to something else in world of warcraft and then we can say that it's not just original research. Final Fantasy X makes zero mention of pop culture references within the game; this is nothing but. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 16:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the FFX article references content from a video game. It might not be "pop culture references" specificially, but the idea is still the same. If you really want to see references, why don't you add them yourself? --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 16:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the idea is not the same. "There is X in a game" can be cited to the game, but "There is X in a game and it is a reference to Y" is not supported by the game unless you do original research. The burden of referencing information is on those who add it to the encyclopedia, not those who question it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the ideas are the same. You can reference "X" as per FFX and then reference "Y" as per whatever genre it happens to be in. Most of the list is common knowledge and doesn't need to be referenced. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everything needs to be referenced. The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not truth</a>. There are a lot of widely believed urban legends that are blatantly false, so common knowledge is no excuse. Deciding what is actually a reference and what's just a coincidence is a judgement call, and making those sorts of calls is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:15, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You obviously never wrote a research paper before. You don't have to reference every little detail that is in an article. You only need to reference those that are either questionable or not common knowledge. For example, if I wrote up an aritcle on US Presidents I woulnd't have to reference "George Washington was the first President of the United States of American." If you are going to go around deleting articles sololy based on a lack of references then more then half of the database of Wikipedia will be gone. Just tag an article stating that you wish to see references, or better yet tag the specific points you want cited, but don't go deleting articles just because there is no references that meets your approval. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a research paper, it's a tertiary source. Even in a research paper you'd need some sources at the end, unless all you're doing is stating your own ideas (which <i>we don't do</i>). If I tagged everything I thought I needed a reference, I'd tag the entire article. Go read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then read it again, because everything you've said is contradicted by that policy. As it says, unsourced material may be challenged and removed by any editor. I've challenged this article, and now I'm saying it should be removed. Our <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_washington.html#References:_biographies" title="George washington">George Washington</a> article has dozens of sources to refer to for even "common knowledge" claims. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is researched, it is just not original research. "Tertiary source" is just a type of research. I think you need to go back and readh <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. You also took my George Washington example out of context, please reread what I wrote. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not common knowledge if I don't know it. That's why you need to cite a source for verification. Can you cite a source for even one of the references claimed in the article? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:35, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, you are right, it is not common knowledge if you don't know it. The George Washington example I gave you is a classic definition of common knowledge. I'm sorry if you didn't know that before I told you. Again, lack of references is not grounds for a deletion. If you really felt that there should be references then why don't you find the references and add them yourself? It is very clear to me that you just want to see this article deleted and you are trying to come up with any reason to do so, even if it isn't a rational one. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unverifiability is grounds for deletion. I say the article is unverifiable. Someone cites sources and proves me wrong and I'll change my mind. Only wanting to include content that <i>complies with our fundamental policies</i> is hardly irrational. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, largely because it is amusing. It is neither "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>", in that there is neither "novel narrative" nor "novel historical interpretation" in any of it. It's rather a matter of what people have seen and recognized as allusions in the games: the references are the games themselves, and the cultural references they are alluding to. This isn't the sort of novel interpretation meant by the policy, which was never intended to prevent people from making note of these sort of pretty obvious allusions. Merger to any of the main Warcraft articles is impractical: a compilation of this extent <i>ought</i> to have a separate article. There are other practicalities to consider here: if this article is deleted, the insights this article contains will be inserted in other <i>Warcraft</i> related articles on a semi-random basis. Best to keep this to collect them all in one place and keep them organized. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think your response about living in a box shows a touch of absurdity in your position. How is a book supposed to convince you that the sun is in the sky? It won't. You'd have to observe it yourself to know. This is a common problem in philosophy. See Plato and the shadows in a cave. For that matter, that you have to have a subscription to WOW isn't a valid objection, as it's still publicly accessible. I can't read a book without going to a store or library that has it, so I don't see a difference with WoW? Sorry, but your reasoning is not at all convincing, but rather detractory. You might convince me with some individual entries, but as a whole, no I can't agree. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:39, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's absurd, because the point is that wikipedia editors themselves are unreliable as sources of information, but they can point to other sources that prove what they say is true. The trouble with WoW is that these aren't internal to the universe or stated explicitly anywhere, they're all <i>inferences</i> that people make, and those inferences aren't there for anyone to check, someone else has to make the same inference to agree. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 19:43, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but they are there for anyone to check. You can play WoW and see it for yourself. Or find some movie on Youtube in some cases. In any case, the arguments you used have served only to undermine your position with.

<li>Why is it absurd to think some people's knowledge of pop culture is different than that of the typical American's (or insert whatever country here)?

<li><b>Keep</b>, the bulk of the references are self-verifying through a simple comparison of the referring work and the work referred to.

Those that aren't so explicit and obvious (I'm skeptical of the dance moves, and the supposed <i>Jungle Book</i> reference is a stretch) should be sourced or removed. Whether a statement of fact is so obvious that a specific reference is not needed is the kind of common sense editorial judgment we need to make all the time, and the comparison of quote X to quote Y to find that they are identical is not itself original research unless it is not obvious. Would you need a source stating that two biographies about a "Franklin D. Roosevelt" are in fact about the same individual named "Franklin D. Roosevelt" instead of two different people with the same name?

<li>Any entry that categorically states 'X is a reference to Y' without a citation to back it up is putting down their own opinion and should not be reported as a fact, which is the whole point of Wiki. (Reporting facts I mean.) As an example (and I'm aware this may not be the best example, but oh well.) The Napolean Dynamite reference is based on dance moves. However, Napolean Dynamite himself is aping Jamiroquais dance routine and is indeed dancing to one of his songs, so it would be just as likely that the designer who put the dance in was a fan of Jamiroquai and not Napolean Dynamite. For all we know, without an official statement, the designer has never even SEEN Napolean Dynamite. Without a citation, what we have is just one editors <i>opinion</i> of what the dance is reference to. And it's not just this one entry, I'd say 90% of this article falls under the same description. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 12:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But these things <i>are</i> cited. But you just seem to dislike that the game itself is the source, as well as the other works mentioned. Citing every item would just be putting a reference to Warcraft and a reference to the other item (the Fountainhead etc) on every single item. "The sky is blue" is a terrible comparison, since the sky isn't a source while every item on this list is.

<li>They can be sourced for their existence in the game, but not the analysis of them as references. As I said above, you can cite "X is in the story" to the story, but not "X is a reference to Y", because WoW never states that explicitly, so we make original inferences. For example <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ran_%28film%29.html#Themes" title="Ran (film)">Themes in Ran</a> may be obvious to anyone who watches the movie, but we can't just find them ourselves, we need to cite the analysis of others. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 22:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Grr... sorry last comment. When we refer to "Popular Culture" for an article, we refer to how the subject impacted it. Not, all popular culture references that are made by the subject.

<li>By individual entries, I mean each individual entry in this list. For example, above, I found an article that described the Cannonball Run and Big Trouble in Little China refererence. I also don't agree with you that we list only a subject's impact on popular culture with references to it(which is in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article right now), but also in the cases of certain content, describe the references in it. See many episodes of TV shows for numerous examples (from Robot Chicken to Pokemon and Sailor Moon). I suppose you could divide WOW into individual quests and areas, with sections for this sort of thing there, but I believe that would actually be detrimental to Wikipedia, since it would make it more of a game guide. So, in preference to keeping information, having one article on the MMORPG's pop culture references is my choice.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> While I do believe this does violate WP:NOR, I understand that many disagree. However, there are several other problems here. Not only is this a rather arbitrary piece of listcruft as well as fancruft, it's an article consisting entirely of trivia. Wikipedia policy is pretty clear that, while trivia isn't outright banned, trivia is highly undesirable and should only be kept in new articles as a way of suggesting things to be converted into prose with the eventual goal of removing trivia from the article. That makes it pretty clear that trivia with it's own article is far worse and totally unnecessary. Are we going to have an article for 'pop culture in...' for every piece of fiction, every game, every movie? I'd certainly hope not. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 23:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per The Way. First, "Karate Kid — One of the bosses in Naxxramas instructs his students to 'Sweep the leg,' a line from the movie." Is that really a reference to Karate Kid - and not any of dozens of other martial arts movies? Fans could debate that ad infinitum - and any obscure trivia that fans could debate ad infinitum is probably not encyclopedic. I'm sure there are some references in here that couldn't be debated - where the reference is crystal clear. But even there I don't think it would be an appropriate article for an encyclopedia, any more than a FAQ/Walkthrough would be. It's practically a list of everything funny that happens in the game, decoded for the culturally illiterate. I'd say delete. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Something being important or unimportant is an opinon. To me there are many articles that are just trivial information to me, but it might be considered so to someone else.

<ul>
<li>That's certainly not the only thing we're discussing, but it is on the list of things. That an article is about a subject that some would consider trivial, but which is nonetheless notable under the WP standards, is not a reason to delete. However, when an article exists only to provide trivial pieces of information about a subject (notable or not), that is a reason to delete. Think of it this way - there's an article on Monty Python's Holy Grail. There's a <i>lot</i> of trivia that you could list about that movie - if you wanted to include a list of jokes, funny bits that get repeated, etc., you easily could. But you may as well just include the script instead - if the trivia is so trivial and so inclusive that it more or less just restates the movie, then it's just an indiscriminate collection of information. I think this article is pretty much along those lines - so the fact that it's stuffed full of trivia is a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>See, that's where I disagree. A list of every character in WOW would be entirely trivial. A list of every item as well. A list of those who by virtue of their name choice or other characteristic have a unique character that causes people to recognize them as references to another thing is not trivial, even if it was trivia. Perhaps it's just a result of pepole using the same word, but with different meanings. That said, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> article currently has a section equivalent to this article. It's got about 50 entiries in it. There's also at least a few daughter articles based on characters in the movie. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually the Holy Grail article's section (while itself completely out of control) is the exact opposite of this - it's a "cultural references <i>to</i> this movie" rather than "cultural references <i>in</i> this movie" section. The former establishes the place of the movie or game in the culture; the latter establishes that the movie or game is...full of references. I see this list as equivalent to the first two things you cite here - except that this is a list of every joke / reference in the game. I don't really think I understand why that wouldn't be trivial, any more than a list of items or characters would be. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:05, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point I was making is that they are equivalent, I recognize that they are sort of mirrors to each other, but the information is of the same nature. Especially since you can also find the same information in the articles about the various TV/games/whatever that mention MPaTHG. (Not always mind you, but I doubt that's a conscious decision as opposed to a quirk of editing). And no, it's not every joke/reference in the game. Just the ones that are pop culture. Think of it like a phone book (Yes, I know Wikipedia is not a phone book). You can have it listed by name. Or by address. Or by Telephone number. This article is effectively then, a reverse look-up directory. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Ok - in fairness I still don't see your point, given that the former provides cultural <i>context</i> for the subject, whereas the latter merely describes the <i>content</i> of it. But I don't think it's important, because I don't think the Monty Python section could stand on its own in any event. Let's assume that you're right, and that this is equivalent to the type of thing in the Monty Python article. Would you include a stand-alone article that was just "List of References in Pop Culture to Monty Python"? As a part of the Python article, they add a little value - but they're not a full article. Similarly, I can see a few of these cited in the WOW article to show that the game is "reference-laden," but don't see it as a full article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 22:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Reducing indentation for convenience) Yes, I could see such a list being made an article, if it was desirable to reduce the size of the Monty Pyton main-article. Given that it is a movie though, there's only a limited amount that can be said about it though. But that's beside the point, the real idea is that the content itself is not inherently objectionable. Since it's not, it's worth looking at the subject matter, which is the very content-rich World of Warcraft game. WoW isn't a single movie of fixed length, or even a series (and I note, there is a lot of Monty Python content on Wikipedia), but rather a large created environment with a fair amount of content. That means deciding what articles and information aobut it Wikipedia should include are different from any movie. More extensive is likely to be one of them though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My entire point about saying that it should be deleted on grounds of it being "trivial" is unjust. The notion of something being trivial (something that is interesting, but unimportant) is largely opinon. I think that all of the articles in Wikipedia is interesting, but in the larger scheme of things, it is not very important. In fact, encyclopedias are in my opinon simply books that contain tid bits of trivial knowledege the important and non-trivial information is usually contained in the references that they cite. No one at the college level would (or should) every use an encyclopedia as a reference for a paper because of this. The same is true with Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 18:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: On the one hand, it might be <i>possible</i> to write a list called <i>List of possible pop culture references in Warcraft</i> with entries like "After defeating a group of spiders in the wastelands, characters can obtain a sword called <i>Stung</i> "(citation) In <i>The Hobbit</i>, Bilbo Baggins obtains a similar sword, named <i>Sting</i>, which he uses in a battle against spiders.(citation). On the other hand, (1) this article doesn't even approach that sort of neutral, non-OR presentation, and (2) it would be pretty crufty even if it <i>were</i> written correctly, possibly enough to implicate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. On balance, though, I think that most of the information could be included in a non-OR fashion and properly cited, and it seems to have interested readers, so weak keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 21:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please don't confuse quality of argument with quantity. Or Numerosity with novelity. The notability comes from the book's unique divergence from conventional wisdom.

<dd>I voted merge but the lack of libraries stocking the book may have to do with it being released less than 2 months ago (mid-September 2006) more than anything else. Your test would have more validity if you conducted it 5 years or more after the release of the book -- if still no libraries had it, then it clearly fell with a thud.

<p>HBK Investments manages private investment funds that can only be offered to qualified investors under very limited circumstances. Under the U.S. securities laws, HBK Investments is prohibited from holding itself out to the public as an investment manager, and it is illegal for interests in its funds to be offered through any form of general solicitation. Accordingly, this posting may violate the U.S. securities laws, which could have serious consequences for HBK and for Wikipedia. Rjh827 17:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This is a rather silly nomination. One, the company isn't offering funds through this article. This article is just a normal company article like any other. Two, even if it did, the violator of the law would be whoever made the posting, and not Wikipedia; we aren't an arm of the SEC and we are not obliged to trip over ourselves making sure none of our editors violates any of the the securities laws in all countries. (Of course we'd take it down if it violated Wikipedia policies.) If there were a legal problem with this article, the correct stance for Wikipedia to take would be to take down the article once the SEC (or anyone else) were to obtain a court order forcing it to do so. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 17:41, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but definitely <b>expand</b>. The nominator's rationale is absurd since security offers can only be made by prospectus. WP does not hold itself out as a repository for prospectuses.

<dd>This is no systematic bias and there is no attempt to "alienate" the articles -- I am from India. Can you please explain how the "base notability of the main is established"? There are no citations, no sources -- the burden on evidence lies on the contributors, not the AFD nominators.

<dd>Hindutva cannot have a 'Jansanskrity'. Because Jansanskrity means 'People's Culture' and Hindutva does not believe in either people as a starting point for any sociological discourse or in the existence of any such thing as people's culture.

<p>Kept in June, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aspies_For_Freedom_3e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aspies For Freedom">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aspies For Freedom</a>, for reasons not unconnected with the nominator's admitted dislike of the person who runs this group. My major problem here is that I find very little hard evidence of either significance or independent coverage. A Google search which excludes Wikipedia, forums and blogspot returns <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Aspies+for+freedom%22+-wikipedia+-forums+-blogspot&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=170&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Aspies+for+freedom%22+-wikipedia+-forums+-blogspot&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=170&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">145 unique hits</a>, and Google News finds no hits. There is some attempt at halo-effect from protests by people who were then members, and letters of support, but honestly that does not amount to reliable sources regarding the organisation. At best it might deserve a paragraph in an article on the anti-cure movement. My biggest concern here is that I am unable to verify, from the sources, either the claimed significance of the group, or the neutrality of the article. Any gaming group that scored this low on the Google-O-Meter would be nuked from space without a moment's compunction, but this is not a gaming group. It is, however, a minority activist group which is skilled at self-promotion. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 18:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. For this article to be kept, it is in serious need of independent coverage per nom. Clearly several editors involved with the topic strongly believe there is such coverage. Problem is the article does not reflect that at all: Many links in the article (that aren't from the group's own page) simply go to content promoting the same positions on issues. If you dig around on a couple of the linked pages you can find links to the organization's main page, but not much if any discussion of them near their home page (have not looked exhaustively). The Times (UK) link has a fleeting reference to the group and their work (although it could be read to say they would be covering the group more in the future; if they did, that coverage would be handy); the Times (NY) link talks about issues the group are interested in but does not mention them. So much for notable sources. (One other link was subscription only). If somebody got on the ball, I suspect this article could be brought up to clear keep status quite easily. But right now it's a clear delete. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> 17:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A short article named <b>N'Ko</b> was needlessly split into <b>N'Ko script</b> and <b>N'Ko language</b>. I disputed this, and attempted to revert to a single article. An edit war ensued, unfortunately, resulting also in the moving of <b>N'Ko script</b> to <b>N'Ko alphabet</b> by the splitter. I proposed on the <a href="../../../n/27/k/Talk%7EN%27Ko_43e0.html" title="Talk:N'Ko">Talk:N'Ko</a> page that the article should only be split if there were consensus from other editors that it be split. The splitter has ignored this, and it's been getting unpleasant. There is no reason that the single <b>N'Ko</b> article can't deal effectively with both script and language issues (at least until it gets much longer than it is) and therefore <b>I request that <i>N'Ko alphabet</i> be deleted (or made into a redirect) and what unique content it contains be merged into <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a> -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 18:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

The N'Ko script can be used to transcribe other languages. I have a document in French and N'Ko in N'Ko script.

<li><b>Comment</b> If Mr Conradi were a reasonable editor, that might be possible. It is not. There was one article, <b>N'Ko</b>, which he has split. In point of fact, he is now continuing to edit <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_alphabet_3920.html" title="N'Ko alphabet">N'Ko alphabet</a> and <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_language_0a90.html" title="N'Ko language">N'Ko language</a> while we have this dispute. This seems to me to be bad faith. All that is happening is a whole lot of confusion is being added to the Wikipedia. <i>I was advised by one Administrator to propse a VfD to <b>merge</b> the articles all back into <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a>.</i> Please be specific about how we can resolve this. All I see is Mr Conradi acting as though he can do whatever he likes. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 15:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>False claims again and again. Evertype can't you stop it? Can't you add content to the language article like I do add content? I am editing the language article because the N'Ko articles is protected. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 04:05, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You split the article. I dispute that the article should be split. I have now also given the following at <a href="../../../n/27/k/Talk%7EN%27Ko_43e0.html" title="Talk:N'Ko">Talk:N'Ko</a>: It is not acceptable to me to have the two articles split. Mr Conradi endeavours to force a taxonomy for all language and script articles on the Wikipedia. But he does NOT know anything about N'Ko. The literary dialect which now has the ISO 639 script code "nqo" is <i>only ever written in N'Ko script</i>. Indeed, because of the nature of the N'Ko script and the way it informs the literary dialect, it is impossible to see how the literary dialect could be written in the Latin or Arabic scripts, because it is <i>intimately tied</i> to the writing conventions of the N'Ko script. I have tried to explain this elsewhere, but instead of <i>discussing</i> with other editors and <i>agreeing in consensus</i>, Mr Conradi has ploughed on ahead, splitting and adding more material to the split articles, oblivious to the fact that he is doing is counter to the <i>facts</i> of the sociolinguistic situation for N'Ko. It makes <i>no sense at all</i> to have <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_alphabet_3920.html" title="N'Ko alphabet">N'Ko alphabet</a> separate from <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_language_0a90.html" title="N'Ko language">N'Ko language</a>, and that split in fact makes it more difficult to write an article which <i>correctly and usefully</i> addresses the facts. A single article, <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a>, is all that is needed here. I (who have worked with the N'Ko user community for several years) cannot edit Mr Conradi's split articles. I cannot improve them. They make no sense while split. The split is <i>only</i> wanted by Mr Conradi. Not by anyone else. He split the articles without consultation or consensus. There is sustained opposition to the split; he has not convinced me with his "justification" that "all language and script articles should be split". It makes sense for many of them to be split. It makes no sense for N'Ko to be split. N'Ko is a special case. We (the Wikipedia community interested in Writing Systems) should not <i>want</i> Mr Conradi to "get the numbers to 100%". He wishes to do this for its own sake, not because it makes sense to treat N'Ko this way. <b>I ask you, Mr Conradi, can you <i>possibly</i> agree that in this case your desire for tidiness is incorrect and unhelpful, and that you should <i>listen</i> to someone with expertise in the script in question, and agree to allow us to revert to a single article <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a> which can then be improved and expanded usefully?</b> I ask this courteously, despite the fact that your willfulness and your apparent pleasure in doing whatever you please with the Wikipedia is extremely exasperating. Ikiroid, that is the best I can do. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 09:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most reasons have already been mentioned. I believe size is not a good criterion for notability (quite a few small town would loose their article in Wikipedia if 500 members/citizens was the lower limit). I think the society does work that is very relevant and thus notable. Their journal actually ranks relatively high in the ophthalmology section of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Citation_Index_e8b6.html" title="Science Citation Index">Science Citation Index</a>.

<dd>Thanks for pointing me towards the notability policy. It says that notable means being written about, not being well-known. Dogme <i>is</i> written about, though as I am not willing/able to do the legwork to prove this, I suppose my assertion can't count. You assert that <i>minor</i> means <i>non-notable</i> but I disagree; many movements in art, politics, etc. may be minor but much written about (ie notable) and influential.

<dd>Nonetheless, the article was written by a member of the organization, and is violation of those policies as well. Given those problems, it is irrelevant whether it is notable or not. You reference movements in other disciplines but notability in those areas is determined by history, and this organization is not old enough to be even viewed through history.

<li>Just because they "mention" Dogme does not mean they are references. I have changed the heading to "See also".

<li>The two references were chosen because they represent leading authorities in the field, and therefore their "mentions" of Dogme tend to validate its importance in the field, but I am happy with the "See also" formulation. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottThornbury_3a3d.html" title="User:ScottThornbury">ScottThornbury</a> 18:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>List of what seems to be very popular games made by the RPG Maker community. However, only one game on this list has any notability sourced (and even then it's pretty questionable); the rest of the list is just a listing of games, which all seem to fail the notability guidelines in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">he shoots</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">he scores!</a>)</font> 18:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> without merging. A week and a bit ago I asked on the talk page for references of notability and nothing's happened since then. There are so many RPG-maker made games out there, very few of actual note, there's no point in having this list. Some of the games may very good, but without any third-party verification of quality, this is just a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">list</a> for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">promoting</a> them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 22:11, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I also know a bureaucrat who is too famous in bureaucracy of Pakistan and atleast 2-3 pages of goole comes for him, so it means should we make an article for such people too? <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> has nothing to do with any bureaucrat, he is even under the DCO {District Chief Officer), the name itself shows that all powers are with DCO not with <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazims</a>. I don't want to go further, except making a comment that you for your un-healthy claim brought up many sock-puppets here. Aiditior, Zakksez a.k.a Zak are your sock puppets. I hope the administration will be taking action against you soon and blocking of you will be made alongwith this article soon. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_M._Khan_c4c8.html" title="User:A M.

<li><b>Keep</b>- Seems to be notable. But is there any Pakistani wikipedians to comment on this Afd...? If so we have to consider there words with more weightage. Asian Language Newspaper reports are not available in Google search. So we cannot blindly believe and rely on google hits when the AfD biography of an Asian is taken into consideration. News reports from Urdu or Hindi newspapers of 5 lakh copies are not available in google. But report from English Newspapers with mere 1000 copies are also available in google.Ha...Ha...Ha...<b><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph"><span style="background:#0c0;color:#FFFF66">&#160;Nileena joseph&#160;</span></a></b><sup>(<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENileena_joseph_c9bd.html" title="User talk:Nileena joseph">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nileena_joseph_3551.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nileena joseph">Contribs</a>)</sup> 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>High Comments</b>. I am also a <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> Wikipedian, I never knew the person before reading this article. He is infamous person. I asked many people in his area, who were my college mates and some work with me in <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobilink.html" title="Mobilink">Mobilink</a> <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar.html" title="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>. All of them replied that yes they just know him for Nizamat (Holding status of Nazim) not for his lottery. One of them confirmed yes he is won alottery in US, others replied that they don't knbow about a lottery but came to know that he is having a property in US also some fule-stations and minor things. He was a sheep-man (who is servant of elders of Villages to make sheeps roaming daily inmountains) before he went to US. Now he won due to using money, his case is still pending in election commission tribunal. Even he is freed of charges, <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> is nothing, nothing special as mentioned by my fellows earlier. An appropriate action for deletion of this artilce musttake place now. The article is nothing more then a debatless for some voters who are just voting withut any specefic reason other then being involved in personalising. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBegu_Khel_ef57.html" title="User:Begu Khel">Begu Khel</a> 21:43, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> If we start adding <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, we will for sure be adding thousands of pages daily. According Local Government Ordinance of Pakistan a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> is having powers of Grade (BPS-20) officer. Nazim have no right to interfare in divisional or provincial political affairs even. There is a restriction of Matriculation for Nazim, while for <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Civil_Services_8a0a.html" title="Pakistan Civil Services">Pakistan Civil Services</a> one need to be passing the competetive Central Superior Services! examination. For Members of Pronvial Assemblies, Naional Assemblies and Senate, in Pakistan, one need to contest an election and candidates for such elections need to be holder of Bchelors Degree. This shows the real difference that how less is Nazim delaing with. They (Nazims) are just restricted to use some powers, previously those were with prestigious Assistant or Deputy Commissioners. Recently, in one of the debate here on Wikipedia, concluded that Grade-20 officer is not at all a prominent.Eventhoug, there are such officers in 20-Scale, that they are looking there department as Incharge of it for whole Pakistan. Inshort, I will surely, ask for Speedy Deletion of this article. It also seems to be copy from a <b>baseless-link</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBegu_Khel_ef57.html" title="User:Begu Khel">Begu Khel</a> 19:28, 11 November 2006 (UTC) <small>What if it is my 9th edit?

<p>Although undoubtedly notable among the university's students, I don't feel this guitarist is notable enough for an entry. Yes, has been playing for 28 years, but only live and in a small area. Google search brings up few sites, but nothing beyond that that would be given to a small group playing live gigs. <a href="../../../g/e/k/User%7EGekedo_7c9b.html" title="User:Gekedo">Gekedo</a> 19:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Undelete</b>.At what point does one reach "Wikipedia status"? Is it a quantitative "they are known by x number of people" or is it something more complex? While I understand the spirit behind the deletion of pages, I feel that given the vastness of wikipedia it cannot be compared to a simple encyclopedia. I'm sure it is a great feat to have your name written up in Brittanica, for example, but should it be as difficult to be written up in wikipedia? These are not simply rhetorical questions, as I really would like to know peoples thoughts about this. I haven't been editing for that long so I'm still trying to figure things out. <a href="../../../j/e/_/User%7EJe_at_uwo_2966.html" title="User:Je at uwo">Je at uwo</a> 20:21, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rick McGhie has attained a cult status at one of the largest universities in Canada. There is not one student who has walked the campus who doesn't know of his musical stylings. Rick McGhie has a a place in the heart of 25 000 students and hundreds of thousands of Alumni. I've seen things on Wikipedia that are far more meager or irrelevant than this entry. <b>I think it should stay.</b>24.42.118.206 20:25, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating this to protect it from speedy deletion as a repost. This Trivandrum story got deleted as an undisputed prod back in March but I am prepared to give it a proper AfD. Note that it is not original research - original research is that which is published here for the first time. The question is: is it notable or just an engineering students' project which has received a bit more publicity than usual.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've done quite a bit of cleanup on the article. We have a situation where it appears there is an American six-stroke engine and an Indian six-stroke engine that operate on different principles. I've included information about the American six-stroke engine, but information on the Indian team still dominates the article. I'm not sure whether to try to balance them according to notability, or to split them into two separate articles. If they are split into different articles, this should probably turn into a disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 21:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I've done quite a bit of cleanup on the article, and have also added a little bit of new information regarding the subject. There are two other six stroke engine designs known as Beare Head and Bajulaz Six Stroke engine. I have added informations regarding them too in this article. I feel that this article " six stroke engine " should be written such that, it describes the various six stroke engine designs. --Drakefroster 22:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Stong keep?</b> If this is what I think it is, it is something I read about some 25 years ago and if I had a million quid have always wanted to have a go at building. However, the article seems very confused. If I understand it correctly it is not literally a six stroke engine but a combination of two stroke and four stroke technology. If it is what I think it is, it has to be in Wikipedia, but the article is terribly confusing so that I'm not sure what it is about and it drastically needs a mega-warning until someone can improve it! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 00:06, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have a conventional ass, and mine won't move 360 deg. It sounds like an embellishment. I believe the common-sense etymology involving how feces steam in cool temperatures.

Boy, I had a heck of a time finding this little gem, googling for garbage. Dead prostitutes are a common joke in "popular culture." I'm sure even Family Guy had a dead hooker or two. So, why the resounding delete on an article on what is essentially a pop culture joke and list of examples, just like Cleveland steamer? Maybe an admin could undelete and compare the two. "Dead prostitutes" apparently had a sole author and no serial AfD's, and those are the only differences I can detect at this point. Oh, and the fact that it's pretty easy to figure out what a dead hooker is without reading a sentence-long definition. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Spunky_Toffee_af7b.html" title="User:Mr Spunky Toffee">Mr Spunky Toffee</a> 17:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

This is a definition and a list of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attestation" class="extiw" title="wikt:attestation">attestations</a> in the real world.

Previous AfD keep votes were given because they saw potential for the article <i>becoming</i> encyclopedic if only someone would include some decent sources, and it has never happened after the AfD closed. Given that repeated failure, I don't think it ever will until the Real World does some academic or semi-academic treatment of the subject and creates some decent sources for us.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Inclusion of this article does not really advance the interests of the encyclopedia, overall. It's a very, very marginally notable entity. Let's say it adds .0001 <i>encyclopeditrons</i> of value to the Wikipedia. Then on the other hand you have the chance of this being picked up and used to give a bad impression of Wikipedia, invitation to vandalism, attracting the undesirable sort of editor, really inappropriate for children (and yes I know we are not censored for minors, but I don't think <i>this</i> is what is meant), general ickiness, and so on. We can say that overall the article <i>subtracts</i> .0002 <i>encyclopeditrons</i> of value. Therefore it is bad for the 'pedia, and the closing admin should <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and delete it regardless.

Of course it's not a common subtitle: that's why it's a functional list as opposed to one of the usual "list of songs that mention their titles more than three times in their lyrics" sort of random collections. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I'm missing the point but as there's obviously millions of books, there's obviously going to be loads of subtitles. There's obviously going to be common ones and uncommon ones. I'm sure if you find a subtitle, there's going to be other books that have the same subtitle just because there's millions of books. As much as I like the meaning of the subtitle, I can't see why it's so why it’s so significant. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 22:02, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The argument for christian creation is such a well known subject that it really needs to be covered. I tried to work out what the appropriate <b>vote</b> was but I'm stuck. I'm convinced the name needs deleting, but <b>can someone comment on another name</b>. What if the article were called <b>"Creationism (Christian)"</b> and within that article were set out the argument for creation as found in this article followed by the article against creationism? If I were writing an essay I would find it useful to have the information in this article available in order to know what I was arguing against. I looked at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and it really doesn't seem to cover what this article does, nor given its current size does it seem appropriate to add to it. If a factual article could be produced describing the argument used for creation and the kind of events that are cited as fact, it would be useful to have and encyclopedic, in the same way Wikipedia covers fascism, without supporting the philosophy.--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 01:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The subject is notable, and of use to the general public who will want to know more about a current public debate. To avoid bias, would should have a Arguements for Creation article or somesuch for balance which basically this article seems to be. I'm not saying it should be given the same weight as other theories supported by the scientific community though. The whole creationsist/evolution debate is Christian in the US context, and that should be clarified or expanded to cover other creation theories. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 01:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Note that <i>asserting</i> notability is only enough to keep an article from being deleted on-sight, not for keeping at AfD. The usual metric for AfD is whether it can be demonstrated to be <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notable</a>. There is certainly information out there on him<a href="http://www.apollohospdelhi.com/apollo-group/chairmans-profile.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apollohospdelhi.com/apollo-group/chairmans-profile.html" rel="nofollow">[138]</a>, but finding indepedent coverage is the litmus test we're going for.

(It's mentioned again <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2005/05/22/stories/2005052205130801.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thehindu.com/2005/05/22/stories/2005052205130801.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the paper <i>The Hindu</i>, and <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/03/31/stories/2005033102100400.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/03/31/stories/2005033102100400.htm" rel="nofollow">here again</a>, but since they're repeats they all together only count as one instance of coverage for notability's criteria.) More evidence like this will show that he's notable enough to have an article. An argument could also be made that he's made a "widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field" by founding the private health industry in India, but that would require more digging to substantiate. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 18:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As references I would add the following press release <a href="http://www.jhintl.net/JHI/English/Media/Latest_News/Media_LN_HopkinsApolloJuly05.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jhintl.net/JHI/English/Media/Latest_News/Media_LN_HopkinsApolloJuly05.asp" rel="nofollow">[139]</a>from John's Hopkins. While not 'independent' it asserts that Apollo Hospitals is the largest private hospital group in Asia.

For me the question is whether being the founder and CEO of a large company confers some level of notability upon the founder.

<dd>There's <i>some</i>, but it's not very much. The notability requirements are designed to make sure that there is sufficient independent coverage of the specific subject of an article so that it can be written in line with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> policy by people who aren't already intimately familiar with the subject (and so also satisfy <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy). So, we really do need sources specifically about Dr. Reddy. If we can't find any now, it's possible that he'll get more coverage in the future and so be ready for Wikipedia then. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 08:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Off the top of my head, I think there are supposed to be different universes or continuities in the DC multiverse (or somesuch) and this would be a history of Superman Prime - as in the most real reality or the 'prime' (possibly from Prime Material Plane, originally a D&amp;D reference) universe of exsistence. I couldn't tell you if the content was cruft or not, but some sources would be a big plus towards not for me.

<li><b>Redirect</b> I think I'll give a bit of explanation for the non-comic book folks here. Ok, over the past 50+ years of history, the story of Superman, like many comic book characters has undergone some changes in creative line-up and design. His backstory has been retold, and reinvented. Sometimes this has been simultaneous with on-going stories, and sometimes it has been a deliberate rebooting by the publisher. Anyway, for various reasons, a decision was made to give an in-universe explanation for some of this, basically, there are times when a Superman from one universe has met one from another. There have also been various alternate versions of Superman like <a href="../../../t/r/u/Superman%7E_True_Brit_6d8c.html" title="Superman: True Brit">Superman: True Brit</a> (Superman lands in Britain not Kansas) and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Superman%7E_Red_Son_76e2.html" title="Superman: Red Son">Superman: Red Son</a> (Superman as if he'd landed in Russia). Anyway, there's a list at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_alternate_versions_of_Superman_f8a7.html" title="List of alternate versions of Superman">List of alternate versions of Superman</a> and this entry is covered there, but in an alternate article: <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_One_Million_1634.html" title="DC One Million">DC One Million</a>. Since that article is MUCH better written, I say redirect there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:44, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
