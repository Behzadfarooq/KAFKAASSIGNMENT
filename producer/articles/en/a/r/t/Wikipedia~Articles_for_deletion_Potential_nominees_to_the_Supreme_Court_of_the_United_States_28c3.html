<li><b>Delete</b>. What will we do when Rehnquist retires or dies? This kind of information will go stale quickly.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> for the following reasons, which combine to make this a notable discussion:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The current Court has been intact and unchanged for a longer period than any Supreme Court in over a century;</li>
<li>Chief Justice Rehnquist has become an iconic figure, and will leave very big shoes to fill;</li>
<li>Throughout the history of the Court, there have only been 16 Chief Justices, so they do not come and go very often. This article should consider not only who may fill the vacant seat, but also who will become the next <i>Chief Justice</i> {Scalia? O'Connor? Thomas? Someone from off the Court?);</li>
<li>The process of appointing Justices has become particularly politicized since <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>, which has lead to rampant speculation as to who may succeed Rehnquist dating back to the 2000 election campaign.</li>

<li>I disagree. If that is the case, we should delete <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a>, because it is currently speculative, and will be irrelevant once the position is filled (indeed, the same argument could be made for every presidential election that has already passed) - except that it's not merely speculative because we know there will be an election, who is likely in the pool of candidates, and what concerns are likely to drive the vote; and it won't be irrelevant once it is over because it is a piece of American history. This is a very similar situation - the likely candidates and the issues that will drive the selection are known, and whoever gets selected, it will mark an historic point in the history of the court. --[[User:BD2412/deletion debates|BD2412] 03:05, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with your analogy. <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a> will not be irrelevent when the position is filled, because we can still have an encyclopedic article on the subject of the election. However, once the next Supreme court justice is chosen, it will be will be useless to keep an article on the process that went into choosing that justice. Furthermore, speculating on an election, a huge event that follows a rigid process and schedule, is vastly different then speculation on the appointment of a justice, which could happen at any time and will happen according to the whim of the President. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 04:38, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The opinion on the existence of <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a> is fairly clear in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Speculation is well documented so the article can be kept. My main problem is with the title (see my comment above) and the article is hard to title because it is not clear when the appointment will be made, unlike the US presidential election which is virtually certain to take place in 2008 (I'm not up on US election procedures, could possibly happen earlier or later in extreme circumstances?). That said IMO this speculation is documented well enough to be included, just not under a seperate title hence my vote for <b>delete</b> this particular article and <b>merge</b> content to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 11:50, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, seeing as how Rehnquist's illness sparked dozens of television and newspaper reports over possible successor appointments, how about an article on Supreme Court appointment hysteria? Seriously, though, I think the unusual intensity of coverage of this issue (based in no small part of the factors I listed above) marks a rare phenomenon worthy of its own article, <i>once we can agree on a title</i>. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="#FF5500">gab</font></sup></a> 12:14, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok here's another idea. How about creating a new article called U.S. Supreme Court nomination, about how it's done and all (I know it's not really that complicated but there could be more detail about why confirmation isn't as easy as it sounds) with a section called maybe "Speculation on possible George W Bush nominations" or something. As a section the title can easily be changed / updated and new sections can be added when further speculation comes up in the future. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:21, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Again, same thing could be said of <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a> - every U.S. citizen who will be over 35 as of Jan. 20, 2009 is a potential future president (hey, that includes me!) But there is a manageable list of serious candidates, and so there is for the Court - the nominee will be someone who a) has the proper experience to be realistically confirmed by the Senate (almost certainly a sitting federal appellate judge, state supreme court judge, U.S. Senator, or a person in a high-level position of legal counsel to the executive branch) and b) someone who falls within the appointing president's ideological stream of thought. Just as the pundits are probably on the mark when they project who will run for president, they are similarly on the mark to suggest who will likely be the next Supreme Court nominee. By the way, fun fact: nothing in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a> requires Supreme Court Justices to be U.S. citizens. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="#FF5500">gab</font></sup></a> 03:46, 2005 Mar 25 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So the potential list is in the billions. There is no specific date range, so this article could include potential nominees dating back to the nineteenth century. If a listing of the most frequently-named , current candidates is needed, it can be included in the main article on the court. Further, I dispute your asertion of the accuracy of pundits. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 19:18, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Except that the 2008 election is a predetermined event—it <i>will</i> happen in 2008. It is true that more appointments to the Supreme Court will necessarily be made, but no one knows <i>when</i> this will be, or even <i>who</i> will be replaced, however likely Rehnquist is. Furthermore, candidacy for president is self-motivated and entails overt acts years in advance on the part of the hopefuls.
