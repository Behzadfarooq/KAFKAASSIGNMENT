<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>, obviously.

<p>Horribly unreferenced pseudoscience, a similar list of occurrences could probably just as easily be tied to any other number. The <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> is rambling and speculative, however removing the problem parts would leave it meaningless. Previous attempts to solve the issues with this have either been ineffective or were little more than sweeping it under the carpet (e.g. forking it from <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_%28number%29.html" title="23 (number)">23 (number)</a>). In summary, with the OR and V issues, not to mention the use of weasel terms, this article is now beyond help. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 01:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Notable number in numerology which has been referenced in numerous literary works (the writings of William Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson, for a start), not to mention inspiring a major film only a few weeks ago. The article needs to be expanded and sources added, etc., but I feel the topic is notable enough to be kept. Content issues can be addressed at the article level. PS I have read the above noted and have discounted it. That's still a content issue, and not an issue as to whether this article has a place in Wikipedia. I say it does. All the note above did was make me change my opinion from "keep" to "strong keep". <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So, you are in effect saying "I don't believe this article is in a fit state, but we should keep it anyway"? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 01:12, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In general, yes, the rule is, even if an article is in abysmally poor condition, if there's something of merit to the subject, it's better to keep and improve it. Now it might be worthwhile to blank it in this case, but I don't know that I see a problem with the edit history being kept. Something like libel or copyvio would be grounds for deletion, but I don't know that that's true. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Remove all the useless trivia from both the <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_%28numerology%29.html" title="23 (numerology)">23 (numerology)</a> and <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_%28number%29.html" title="23 (number)">23 (number)</a> articles, then <b>merge</b> the two together.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 01:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but continue to clean with a firehose. I took out the pop culture references that didn't make explicit reference to the numerological significance of 23 and encourage others to plug away at directly sourcing unsourced content remaining in the article. <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 01:50, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I believe, as I stated on the talk page, that the occurances on <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_%28number%29.html" title="23 (number)">23 (number)</a> and this (including some good which has been deleted and is in history) should be merged onto this article with major trimming of unimportant occurances. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReywas92_4c7c.html" title="User:Reywas92"><font style="background:#7FFF00"><b>Reywas92</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReywas92_aaca.html" title="User talk:Reywas92"><font style="background:#00ff7f"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sup> 02:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I will accept your argument on the strict condition that you agree to <i>personally</i> take up the task of verifying that every single prospective entry is a specific reference to the "enigma", and not merely coincidence (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 02:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - They've made two movies about this number, so it's clearly notable. It doesn't matter if an article is hard to keep clean, and thinking an article should be kept implies no responsibility beyond truly believing an article should be kept. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 05:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> No article about a reasonable subject is beyond help. Since this subject has received some attention, it needs to be covered. I wouldn't mind merging it somewhere, but this seems like a content dispute, not a reason to delete. Lots of articles on Wikipedia are difficult to write, some attract the attention of some less than reasonable folks. It's the nature of Wikipedia, which will not be written in a day. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The number 23 is notable due to it's presence in movies, several secret societies and other notable areas. It may well be a pseudoscience as mentioned, but this does not mean it isn't notable. <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoeloq_4256.html" title="User:Poeloq">Poeloq</a> 11:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that the article is garbage, and sympathize with the plea of the nominator, but frustration over cleaning up an article is not a reason to delete it. At the very least, it can be turned into a stub with whatever information can be verified, and then started over. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMus_Musculus_8efa.html" title="User:Mus Musculus">Mus Musculus</a> 18:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
