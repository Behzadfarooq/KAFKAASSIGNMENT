I really hate to delete all that information. There is so much of it, it must have come from someplace reliable. I tried to do some research on the topic to provide at least one reliable source, but couldn't figure out what the topic was: Geo-political web-based simulator? Geo-political internet simulator? Geopolitical simulator? Some of the subject matter from the article might fit in the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulation.html" title="Simulation">simulation</a> article, but I'm not even sure whether the term "Geopolitical" is appropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">Geopolitics</a> doesn't mention anything about simulation. Before deleting the article, it would be kind of someone with some knowledge in this area to place a reference to this topic in an appropriate Wikipedia article. That way, someone in the future might be prompted to develop a correct article on the topic (whatever that topic may in fact be). There probably is a relevant article on the topic, but the present article does not appear to be that.-- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:09, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - Thanks for the information.

However, I still can't put my finger on the topic of the article, which means I can't actually determine whether the topic is Wikipedia notable. If it was, I would reduce the article, footnote it, and support it on deletion review. As I posted above, there has to be an article in all that text, but I can't figure out what it is and thus can't offer any support to the article. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 17:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'd really like to vote to keep this article, because I think the subject is interesting and because I'd expect this type of game to be more popular in the future. BUT repeated AfDs on the specific games in this category have (it appears) failed to produce a single reliable source (as defined by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). Instead, it seems that everything out there on the Web (based on a couple of google searches I did) is either (a) a reflection/mirror of wikipedia articles or (b) game sites, forums, and other peripheral mentions about the specific games. So I'm guessing that there may be a thousand or so (or less) folks who play or have played such games, and that's about the level of interest in these. Ironically, perhaps, if someone had really done original research and traced the origins of each of the games, identified their differences, gotten figures on how many people play and have played each, gotten information about the business model (so to speak - costs to play, costs to operate, etc.), and compared the games to each other (if I were a potential player, which would I be interested in?), I'd be very tempted to argue "usefulness" (not an accepted criteria, I know), and it's possible that there wouldn't have been an AfD (not even unsourced article ends up here.) But that's not the case - it's really not a very <i>useful</i> OR <i>interesting</i> article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 17:25, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> - The consensus so far appears to be delete every Wikipedia independent topic related to Monkey Gone Mad. I found a few more Category:Monkey Gone Mad images, Category:Monkey Gone Mad albums, and Category:Monkey Gone Mad. If there are others, I assume that the administrator will delete them as well. As for my delete vote, only notices regarding the appearances of Monkey Gone Mad have made it to the newspapers; nothing about the formation of the group or the history of the group. Monkey Gone Mad really need to start releasing PRs so that newspapers will cover them better. If they eventually make the newspapers, there might be enough information to sustain an independent Wikipedia article on Monkey Gone Mad. As part of the deletion, it would be kind of an editor to list Monkey Gone Mad within an appropriate article. I tried to, but couldn't figure out where they could be listed.-- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 17:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all (or merge)</b> Whilst these are fairly useless, and I think the creator probably needs to get out more, they are also harmless. They are NPOV and verifiable. Wikipedia hasn't got a space shortage. If the creator needs to find better things to do with his time, so does the nominator. No-one in this debate has presented any argument as to why Wikipedia would be better off without this information. Yes, this is 'cruft', and so what?

<li>I don't get it, whether they were created by the same person is largely irrelevant. We don't target individual editors, but the articles themselves except in the cases of trolls/vandals.

<li>I agree that whether they were created by the same person is largely irrelevant to getting your way and having the articles deleted. However, you are asking us to delete articles in the collective, not individually. There should to be a consideration in the deletion proposal of each editor's collective effort over multiple articles. Regarding the example I gave, the fact that an anonymous editor created all the stub articles on same day using the same (wrong) approach to post the information which largely already exists on Wikipedia elsewhere helps those voting to give consideration to that editor's collective effort and come to a conclusion that these article were a mistake by a novice editor. It will help the novice editor understand why their articles were efforts were. I do appreciate your efforts to clean up Wikipedia. However, you are not just asking us to delete data, you are asking us to delete the hard work of many editors. You might not see yourself as target individual editors, but the editors behind many of the above articles are new and might see it differently. For example, you listed not just one but many articles created by user 85.74.33.35. Also, I did not see a notice on user 85.74.33.35 talk page that many of his/her article are up for deletion. What is that new user supposed to think? Most of the editors of the articles you listed are new and probably have no idea that deletion is even possible. Fairness to these new editors during a collective deletion process should include at least a notice on their talk page and some showing consideration that their collective efforts to contribute to Wikipedia have been considered in collectively proposing their articles for deletion. I think we need to develop guidelines for collective deletions of articles.-- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as exemplars of articles about nonnotable things created by cut and paste from a database somewhere. There is no merit in trying to replicate everything that has an entry in some database as a Wikipedia article. These will then be stale copies of the original database with no automatic update function in place. A main article talking about the function history and types of masts, with a link to master databases elsewhere, would be far preferable. The oldest, tallest, etc could justify articles, especially if they have books, newspaper articles, architectural or engineering awards. There are no attestations of the importance of these things except that they exist.

<li>Several people have mentioned the same sentiment, but that's the alternative? 30 distinct AfDs? I sampled about 6 of them; they all appear to have the same fundamental flaw, which is that they're just data extracted from some tower database, with nothing notable to say about any individual tower. So what would be gained by discussing each one individually? If anybody (perhaps the creator?) thinks there are some subset of these which should not be painted with the same brush, they should speak up now. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 18:17, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see nothing encylclopediadic about this article for a single season of a college football team. However, perhaps there is a precedent that any single season of a sport at a division I (or II or III?) school is notable. I figure it's best to have this debate now, rather than after the author creates 100 articles. <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 03:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In order for Wikipedia to function as a "premier online resource," it needs to provide a complete historical view of Division IA programs. This article is part of that project and has been created in conformance guidelines established after extensive discussion (see discussion <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_College_football_296d.html#Non-Compliance" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football">here</a>, which is part of a larger discussion that starts <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_College_football_296d.html#Proposed_new_minimum_guideline_for_individual_team_seasons" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football">here</a>). There is no intent to create a single entry for each season, rather, the intent is to create a single page for all seasons under a particular coach (for example, see <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Bulldogs_football_under_Herman_Stegeman_7d14.html" title="Georgia Bulldogs football under Herman Stegeman">Georgia Bulldogs football under Herman Stegeman</a>). In the particular instance tagged, it just so happens that the coach only coached for one season. --<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 03:55, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, not merge</b> I had the entire history of the Colorado Buffaloes on a single article and it became so big as to lose it's value. The College football WikiProject had a discussion where it was determined that breaking up historical articles per coach was more appropriate than single year-by-year pages. Thus, for example, Colorado Buffaloes under Gary Barnett <i>instead</i> of a single article for each year he was a coach. For some coaches, they only coached a single year. Nonetheless, for completeness of the subject, each year a school has participated in the sport deserves to be covered. Failure to do so would result in an incomplete coverage of the topic. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 04:33, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, the naming convention used is the result of a long discussion on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_College_football_6060.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject College football">WikiProject College football</a>. The conclusion of the discussion was to group annual seasons for a team together under the head coach, otherwise, a team like <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Bulldogs_football_e553.html" title="Georgia Bulldogs football">Georgia</a> would have 112 separate stories for 112 seasons. Using the approach adopted by the Project regroups those 112 seasons under 24 head coaches. That being said, there is still room for detailed stories on noteworthy seasons such as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Texas_Longhorn_football_team_0b8b.html" title="2005 Texas Longhorn football team">2005 Texas Longhorn football team</a>.

<li><b>Keep it</b>, what would an encyclopedia be without information about products and computer games also - both downloadable and retail? I disagree with that almost everything small I see is nominated for deletion - if you don't acknowledge the fact that people contribute in a serious way, no wonder there are many who dislike Wikipedia. Just because it isn't very notable it still has a <i>huge</i> fan-community and countless mods and is definitely worth to be kept. It is your narrow-minded point of view on everything that lowers the quality of this great free project. I'm sure the sources can be fixed, just issue the topic a clean-up template.

<dd>You must allow the sources to be discussed in the AfD process. That is its purpose, not to just have an administrator judge the worthiness of an article and close discussions.

<dd>I don't really understand what you mean by "*professionals*". I'm an administrator just like you or them, and I can close deletions same as you or them. Wikipedia does not have "*professionals*" or special users with added judgmental power. At any rate, regarding your argument (which, being as you are <i>participating</i> in the argument, should really exempt you from <i>closing</i> the argument), Mr. Gilbert himself is not the <i>primary</i> subject of any of the sources you cited (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shivah_9cb3.html" title="The Shivah">The Shivah</a> was, and Gilbert was merely mentioned in connection with that), and WP:BIO states that "The person has been the <b>primary</b> subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" is a requirement. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 17:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>99% of comedy is timing, and this is really not a very amusing time for a joke. Anyway, a relisting of this deletion would benefit the process, and there's really no reason why we shouldn't just run the AfD again. WP:DRV exists to serve certain purposes that may be similar to this, but it is not unusual or inappropriate to just relist a deletion to build a consensus or remedy an out-of-order closing. Why, it just happened recently with another deletion of mine, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Adventures_of_Fatman_2c61.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Adventures of Fatman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Adventures of Fatman</a>. At any rate, I'm going to have to leave my computer now, so no more of this instant communication -- but please accept that your unconventional AfD closing has led to a confusing situation and the best fix would be to let this AfD run its course. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 17:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Much as I hate crystal-balling, the release date (stipulated by the developer) is now.. 4 days away? This particular developer has software which garners multiple reviews and seems to be very well received by the adventure game community. For the life of me, I can't see the point in deleting what's here for the sake of waiting for the inevitable reviews to appear as sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am actually a beta-tester on this game, and although I think its release may be a few days late, it will certainly happen this month. When reviews come out, I will add them as sources. If the article is deleted, it will be recreated in a few months anyway. The original "Bestowers of Eternity" game (from which this article was renamed/merged with) did win 2 AGS Awards, too. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaccormack_886d.html" title="User:Amaccormack">Amaccormack</a> 10:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I feel the admin (GWERNOL) who posted the article AGAIN for deletion, is, per his page, a self proclaimed Welsh trainspotter; so his interest in this genre: The Amercian Dance &amp; Pop genre may not be best to qualify this Subjects contributions as Scott Shermans industry does not seem to be of the admins interests; just as i would know nothing of British industrial narrow gauge railways, a history of narrow gauge railways in the UK, comprehensive listing of same, Minimum gauge railways.</p>
<p>Also that the <i>SAME</i> admin felt it necessary to tag <i>this</i> page, and renom it for deletion seems to indicate some personal malice, as he was overturned, rather than through objectivity, I hope i am mistaken and its a coincidence he found this page.</p>
<p>while perhaps someone with no knowledge may be of use in establishing <i>some</i> merit, it is EXACTLY THAT person, who may be the one needing at some point to find more information on the Subject in which they're not familiar; We personally source wiki on what we do not know&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Defaulted to more generic term Talent Executive at one point,as the listing of titles seemed excessive though thorough and more accurate note:previous versions included a DJ who is in no way related, also a fortune 500 member, fairly common name.</p>
<p>Subject is a well known industry Producer, Manager, philanthropist and Agent; Artists include Celine Dion, Jennifer Holliday C+C music Factory (most #1 dance hits guiness book world records) Amber, Ultra Nate, Currently President Atlantic Entertainment Group Clients include: Trump organozation, Paris Casino, Hilton Organization Created and initiated a common industry practiced known as "Shermanated" when you cross over acts regardless of who represents them to increase the turnout which has had marquees with Rock , impersonators, and jazz.</p>
<p>increased awareness to aids benefits by signing top entertainment legends to benefits</p>
<p>Involved in bringing Tony Bennett to MTV recharging Bennetts career brought the first pop and dance tour to Russia including boy bands, pop stars, and not only large venues, but to the "people' club tours.</p>
<p>Duke University graduate several industry awards, Grammy Award voter</p>
<p><br />
Seems a significant pedigree and anyone researching the industry, events, dance or pop music would run across his name,</p>

I assert those mentions are an aside and essentially of no import. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 14:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment:</b> Something very telling.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think he actually does represent Deborah Cooper; the other celebrities... I suspect he either worked for an agency as an underling, or just goes to Those Sorts of Parties; if you are in the entertainment industry and are willing to pony up money to go to a charity bash, you <i>can</i> get your picture taken with people.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Missy with all due respect, being disgusting is not a deletion criteria, Wikipedia is not censored. That said, this seems pretty silly and highly arbitrary, the precident set in "famous people with red (black, ect) hair" seems to apply here, that if you group all possible groupings of people then you could have literally billions of meaniningless lists. Being a playboy playmate might make breast size more cogent, but breast size is not an important factor of a person anymore than haircolor or anything. I couldn't see anyone making a "list of playboy playmates with blue eyes" or that being acceptable as encyclopedic material.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ideally, I think a list a Playmates would be preferable in tabular form with measurements. If that were permitted I would not oppose deleting this list.

On the talk pages at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Online_f9ca.html" title="Playboy Online">Playboy Online</a> and associated pages and in my undeletion campaign for such pages I compared these monthly <i>Playmate of the Month</i> and <i>Cyber Girl of the Month</i> winners to athletes who win <i>Player of the Month</i>. I note that it is not currently WP convention to have articles for such monthly winners. Thus, we do not have <i>Player of the Month</i> articles for 3.5 of the 4 major sports (baseball lists half player of the month, but not pitcher of the month). However, baseball has been able to get articles that are equally odd <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_runs.html#Single_game_or_season_achievements" title="Home runs">Home_runs#Single_game_or_season_achievements</a> instead.

<li><b>comment</b> this "penis size" argument is kind of weak. if there was some extremely notable magazine that, since the 1950s, had been taking nude photos of males and for most of that time had including statistics including the length of their penis, such a list probably would be notable and verifiable. however, there is no such magazine, so the situation you describe is hardly analogous. on the other hand, if you wanted to create a list of male porn stars known for their large penises (i am sure there are some, though I know little about the subject), then you would be creating a list analogous to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers.html" title="List of big-bust models and performers">List of big-bust models and performers</a>, which seems to enjoy stronger consensus for remaining on wikipedia than the article we are discussing here. So, in a narrow sense, your hypotheticsl list has no relation to the instant case because there is no analogous publication and, in a broader sense, wikipedia consensus seems to support creating a penis list such as you seem to find so absurd. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 17:13, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree the list is a bit icky (as would a list of male performers with an endowment above a particular length) but that in itself is not reason for deletion. Notability, verifiability and cruftiness are. As others have noted, all Playboy Playmates are inherently notable. Having larger or smaller breasts than some arbitrarily-chosen size (why D? Why not C or DD or F or some other size?) doesn't make them extra-notable. This differes from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers.html" title="List of big-bust models and performers">List of big-bust models and performers</a> because that list is performers by genre. That in itself may also be problematic; I don't know what consensus is on model by genre. Regardless, the two aren't comparable. Verifiability is an issue. As noted, not all of the articles have sizes listed. Including a model with large breasts without independent verification, based on looking at them or whatever, veers into OR territory. And this is fetishcruft. We've recently gotten rid of the fetishy lists of tall women and women with long hair. This is a more commonplace fetish or interest but it's still cruft. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> --- when dealing with a list of people as long as all playmates, subcategorization is useful. Also, sorry to break it to you, but in the world of adult photos, breast size is a distinguishign characteristic (as evidenced by the long term survival of the more general list of big breast porn stars). Also, there is utility to sorting adult entertainers according to breast size because <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_fetishism.html" title="Breast fetishism">breast fetishism</a> is a very real part of human sexuality. As for the arbitrariness of "D" cup, plese see the long discussion about this that on the page talk -- this was a consensus that derived from people wanting objective standards (more specific than "big breast"). Any time we use categories on wikipedia that use bright line objective standards there is sure to be a bit of apparent arbitrariness along the edges of those lines. This is precisely why consensus is important, and in this case the consensus is that breasts become notably large at "D". If you disagree with this consensus, challenge the cut off. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 22:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If breast size is such an important characteristic then where are the lists for A-cup, B-cup and C-cup Playmates? Why are only Playmates so lisified by cup size and no other women? As for the supposed consensus that formed around the issue, the "long discussion" was one editor who suggested it and another editor who suggested using the word "large" instead of "big." That hardly speaks to a thought out consensus process. And neither of them even moved the article to the current title anyway. That happened two months after the "discussion." And I acknowledged that big breast fetishism is part of human sexuality. Lots of things that are part of human sexuality that don't merit Wikipedia articles.

<dd>Oh boo hoo, my big tittie list is up for deletion, I better cry "censorship" and see if I can get that shit to stick. Sorry, but I have no sympathy for that <i>at all</i>. As I already said if you'd bothered to read it, I see a difference between this list and the list of big bust models and performers because the latter is <i>performer by genre</i> and this isn't. As I also said, the big bust performers list may very well be problematic because of its being performer by genre, I don't know what the consensus is on that. If it concerns you that this is nominated and the other isn't, I'll go nominate it right now. As for whether an RBI or an ERA article would pass Afd, that's completely irrelevant and you know it (or you ought to).

<dd>I certainly didn't mean to be condescending with "sorry to break it to you" -- I aplologize if it came off that way. And, yes, I do think that there is some risk of censorship re wikipedia articles related to risque topics. I am sorry, but I simply dont believe this debate would be getting so much attention if it were about artichokes or hitting statistics; I don't quite see what is uncivil about that. And I also don't appreciate the accusation of being engaged in a "smiling mamba" routine. Where is your evidence for this? I simply have an opinion that disagrees with your own. I presented pretty standard-issue wikipedia arguments to support this opinion. Although you chose to focus on my raising the possibility of censorship, which I stand behind, most of my vote dealt with the difficulty of setting objective standards (as any specific cut-off line can seem arbitrary). I also talked about the usefulness of subcategorizing large groups and made reference to the phneomenon of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_fetishism.html" title="Breast fetishism">breast fetishism</a> as a justification for this list. Again, while you might not agree with them, can you please tell me how these are not standard-issue, fairly non offensive arguments of the same ilk as one sees all over wikipedia? Again, I apologize if my initial tone may have been a bit snappy, but it bothers me that you insist on attacking and attempting to discredit a "vote" (and I know it is not really that) that contains at least three arguments that a reasonable person would likely call legitimite (even if such a person did not agree with them). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 15:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Deletionists love to throw around unsubstantiated, subjective terms like "unmaintanable," and "listcruft" (or, even worse, "disgusting" and "puerile") rather than making a cogent argument as to why the deletion of a certain article would be a benefit to Wikipedia. "<a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">Listcruft</a> is a term used by some editors to describe lists which they feel are <i>indiscriminate</i>, or <i>of interest only to a very restricted number of people</i>." The article: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers.html" title="List of big-bust models and performers">List of big-bust models and performers</a> is the 16th most-viewed article in the project <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?ns=articles&amp;limit=100&amp;wiki=enwiki" class="external autonumber" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?ns=articles&amp;limit=100&amp;wiki=enwiki" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Clearly the subject is neither indiscriminate (the criteria for inclusion on the list are quite clearly spelled out, quite limited, and quite verifiable), and clearly the subject is useful and of interest to a <i>lot</i> of people. Also, clearly, in a subject like this, <i>some</i> people are going to object strongly, and either openly call it "disgusting," or use more acceptable terms like "listcruft," whether they apply or not. Again, because one group of people disapproves of the subject this is no reason for deletion. This is a subject on which it is hard to find an objective, non-commercial, sourced reference. As long as the list is arranged in an informative way (this one is), and is sourced (this one is), this is <i>exactly</i> the kind of subject in which Wikipedia has an advantage over traditional, print encyclopedias. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 00:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with the above poster that many users will find this list useful. Actually, given the popularity of the general busty porn star list, I imagine this will turh out to be one of our more-used lists. Wikipedia has quite a bit of coverage of adult performers. This is perhaps because adult entertainment is (dollar wise) a huge chunk of the entertainment industry, which indicates that there are a lot of consumers out there. Playboy playmates are arguably the best known specific grouping of adult entertainers. If this is an area of widespread interest (it is) and we have a large amount information to be sorted (we do in the long list of playmates), it makes sense to sort it in a manner that is useful to its users ... and since breasts are the first thing most users look at on a playmate (and big breasts are a feature that many consumers fetishize), this does not seem like an irrational categoriization. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 14:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This switch of the reason for deleting the article, after nomination, from "disgusting" to "useless to anyone but 'horny teenagers,'" is not only dishonest, and another intellectually lazy non-reason, it is bigoted. Has anyone asked for proof that this appeals only to "horny teens." Or <i>why</i> it's OK to delete an article because it appeals to "horny teens?" This line of reasoning is a cousin to banning Spanish because it's of no use to <i>us,</i> only to-- eeeewwww-- foreigners. And who needs information on Islam, since it's only of interest to <i>heathens?</i> Arguments of this sort (<i>we</i> don't want to see it, so it's not useful) are despicable and fundamentally against the principles of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_freedom.html" title="Intellectual freedom">Intellectual freedom</a> which Wikipedia claims to espouse. "Ah," but the deletionists will counter, "<i>those</i> articles aren't <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruft</a>.</i> Well, neither is this one, by the definition Wikipedia gives. At best, this impulse to ban other users from obtaining information on subjects of which the banner disapproves stems from the sort of misguided prudish elitist do-goodism that kept <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Rice_Burroughs_5e8a.html" title="Edgar Rice Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, and the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oz_books_af0a.html" title="The Oz books">Oz</a></i> series out of the reach of children in libraries for decades. These books were too popular. Kids liked them too much, so they <i>had to be</i> be garbage which would rot young minds. At worst-- and this is the argument I am seeing here-- this impulse to ban stems from outright bigotry and intellectual dishonesty. Now we have people proposing deleting the article on grounds of <i>notability</i>. Apparently applying the label of "horny teenagers" to defenders of this list is meant to other bully editors from stating some very obvious facts: 1) <i>Playboy</i> is more than just a <i>very</i> popular, long-running magazine. It has become an institution unto itself. Lists on this subject are <i>useful</i> to those many, and various types of people with interest in <i>Playboy.</i> 2) The Playboy Playmate is central to its popularity. Merely appearing as a Playmate <i>once</i> passes a model of notability requirements under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)</a>. 3) And-- avert thine eyes here, o ye faint of heart-- <i>breasts</i> and their <i>size</i> are central to the popularity of the Playmate, so a list on the subject is entirely appropriate. And then we come to another bogus claim beloved of deletionists: <i>unverifiable.</i> Exactly <i>how</i> is this unverifiable? If you mean it is not yet properly sourced, that can be remedied. But saying it is <i>impossible</i> to source it is an absurd claim. To those who think they are elevating Wikipedia by attempting to cleanse it of everything a traditional encyclopedia does not cover, I think history will prove you even more wrong than the librarians who banned Burroughs and Baum. They at least had the justification of limited shelf-space for their book-banning. You do not. Wikipedia's <i>strength</i> is in covering non-traditional subjects <i>exactly like this one</i>, on which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find reliable, unbiased, objective, non-commercial resources. Those who seek to purge Wikipedia of subjects like these are harming Wikipedia, not improving it. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Quite. This is being driven by people who are morally offended by the existence of the article. And moral offense is not a valid reason to delete the article.

<li>Perhaps I'm not that familiar with the subject material, but aren't D-cup or larger kind of routine?

<li>This debate is being increasingly full of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_hominem.html" title="Argumentum ad hominem">argumentum ad hominem</a>, particularly on the part of <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a>. Throwing around words like "deletionists" and "people who are morally offended" seeks to undermine the input of those who support the deletion of this particular article and constitutes a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Those of us you accuse of "deletionism" have been keeping our comments focused firmly on the article itself and you would do well to follow suit. That aside, I certainly do not reject this page on moral grounds. Were it moral grounds, I would have to reject large numbers of useful articles on WP as well. I reject this because it is listcruft and unencyclopedic. There are plenty of places on the internet where one can make lists like this but they don't belong on an encyclopedia. Have a list of Playboy Playmates, sure. Even note their breast size on the list. It'll be tacky, and it'll lower the tone of the encyclopedia, but whatever, it's your Wikipedia too. But this kind of list, which is quite obviously a subjective "just the good ones" list masquerading as objective with its formal definition, is totally unnecessary and unencyclopedic. <i>It does not belong on Wikipedia.</i> <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelin_3044.html" title="User:Maelin">Maelin</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelin_3bd2.html" title="User talk:Maelin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maelin_b8b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maelin">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:32, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

But why bother defining Wikipedia as an encyclopedia when in reality it is just a collection of random information.

<ul>
<li><b>STRONG &amp; SPEEDY KEEP</b>. Most of the arguments above in favor of delete are, I must say, as strange as strange goes. And, if I may make an excuse to be crass - <b>These delete arguments are disgusting</b>. They are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b>This list is a list.</b> What? Are you guys gone completely ... (fill in a synonym for mentally challenged)? A list is supposed to be a <i>list</i>, for God's sake.</li>
<li><b>This list is trivial.</b> So, from when Playmate breast sizes have gone trivial? People are continously repeating - <i>trivial, trivial, trivial...</i> - without convincingly explainign why it's trivial. Is this one of those <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">Fascist</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> techniques that says - repeat something enough times to make it a fact?</li>
<li><b>Wikipedia is no place for a list like this.</b> Please, check out the essay on what Wikipedia is not before you start adding these comments. I guess, you'll find out faster that Wikipedia is nom place for such ... (fill in another synonym for mentally challenged) arguments.</li>
<li><b>This is useful only to horny 13 year old kids.</b> Good. So, are you starting a debate on usefulness of the articles? Should we delete articles that are useful mostly to science graduates, or Malaysians, or Orthodox Christians? I hope you guys have run a research to find out that big-breasted Playmates sell more to horny 13 year olf kids or something like that.</li>
<li><b>This should be merged with Playboy and/or List of big-busted models.</b> OK. But, that's an argument for <b>merge</b>, not <b>delete</b>. Please, learn to argue right before you propose something as drastic as a deletion, especially when there are plenty good argument against it (<i>see above</i>).</li>
<li><b>This list is unverified/ incomplete</b>. Just slap a {{Cleanup}} or {{unsourced}} notice there. It's easy, and less drastic. Why talk of deletion at this point?</li>
<li><b>This is sexist.</b> Most right. But, to hold this argument valid we should also be taking long hard look at <i>all other sexist articles and lists and categories</i>, like big-busted models, female pornstars, Playboy Playmates and a lot more. Check the porn portal, fight against all those model articles that carry info on their body measurement, and may be rewrite the Playboy article to read like:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Playboy is a sexist American mgazine, founded in 1953 by Hugh Hefner, who is identified by feminist acitvists and a number humanist groups as a prime anti-woman influence, and his associates, mostly made up of porn-industry henchmen. It has grown into Playboy Enterprises Inc. and is one of the world's leading system of demeaning women</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, jokes apart (though I enjoyed rewriting the Playboy article) - the ground for deletion should be <b>notability</b>, <b>neautrality</b> and <b>verifiability</b>, not opinions like - <i>"It's useless"</i>, <i>"It's disgusting"</i> or may be <i>"God will strike you down for having such filthy things in here"</i>. The previous deletion discussion about the list (which was titled - <i>List of big-busted Playboy Playmates</i>) was about these three things, not there moral or use value. Can we just stick to logical arguments, instead of proving our moral superiority? Repeating again like the ... (fill in yet another synonym for mentally challenged) arguments above: <b>This discussion is disgusting</b>.</p>
<p>Let me just one of those arguments, spread over half a dozen comments here, posted by <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelin_3044.html" title="User:Maelin">User:Maelin</a>, will be good exercise to press the point that this is disgusting.</p>
<ul>
<li><small><u>His last comment was</u>:This debate is being increasingly full of argumentum ad hominem, particularly on the part of Dekkappai. Throwing around words like "deletionists" and "people who are morally offended" seeks to undermine the input of those who support the deletion of this particular article and constitutes a personal attack. Those of us you accuse of "deletionism" have been keeping our comments focused firmly on the article itself and you would do well to follow suit.

But this kind of list, which is quite obviously a subjective "just the good ones" list masquerading as objective with its formal definition, is totally unnecessary and unencyclopedic. It does not belong on Wikipedia.</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, please, read this comment in light of his other comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><small><u>His verdict was Delete and his reason was</u>: This is the kind of idiocy that makes Wikipedia the subject of jokes. There is no conceivable situation in which anybody would have a legitimate need for just the large breast Playmates in a convenient list. It's cruft and utterly puerile.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><small><u>One of his ocmemnts was</u>: We are not discussing <b>List of big-bust models and performers</b> here. If you wish to discuss that article, feel free to do it on its talk page. This article is non-encyclopedic, and puerile besides. Wikipedia has no more need of it than it has need of <b>List of pornography websites that don't require membership</b> or <b>List of adult magazines featuring full-frontal nudity that cost less than $10/issue</b>. We are an encyclopedia, not a convenient index of pornography for horny 13 year olds. This kind of list is unnecessary and it contributes nothing to Wikipedia.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><small><u>Another of his comments was</u>: The points is not that it's disgusting (not legitimate cause for deletion, as acknowledged by everybody now), but that it is useless, non-encyclopedic listcruft. The potential for lists may be infinite, but that doesn't mean that the need for lists is. Also from Appropriate topics for lists, and quite necessary if one is to read your above quote in context, is: <i>Some Wikipedians feel that some topics are unsuitable by virtue of the nature of the topic. They feel that some topics are trivial, non-encyclopedic, or not related to human knowledge. If you create a list like the "list of shades of colours of apple sauce", be prepared to explain why you feel this list contributes to the state of human knowledge.'</i></small></li>
</ul>
<p>He also provided a link to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> which categorically negated his point(s). Jumping to conclusions is easy, research is not.</p>
<p>I guess, if someone makes a slander at you and says, it was not personal, the wise thing to do id taking it extremely personally. Once again - <b>These nay-sayers are disgusting</b>. Tow more points I must raise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Wikipedians here are discussing a <b>vote</b>. Please, understand that WP is not a democracy as voting goes (this comes from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> himself). We are expressing opinions here, not voting. Otherwise, all of you would have been barred from giving your vote twice or more times.</li>
<li>Some has also raised questions about the integrity of WP as an encyclopedia. I would suggest that they read the essay on why Wikipedia is so great, and take a notice of the term <b>Free Encyclopedia</b>, not just an encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck to all. Keep fighting, but <b>Keep</b>. I'd propose to all those who'd like to say <i>Delete</i> - please, read whatever <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> has written here.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: the points made in that well written post were rational arguments based on well established wikipedia rationales. Far from being personal attacks, they pointed out the numerous personal attacks that have been made by editors wanting to delete this article. Thus, I don't see why you are so worked up by them. I also don't see why an admin should close this debate, as it is still attracting new input. Finally, I freely admit to asking a few users who have been active in working on this list and who were active in the previous deletion debate to come here. They have demonstrated a concern for this list in the past and, as such, it seemed like a reasonable courtesy to let them know about this discussion in case they were interested in contributing. I know you are trying to imply that this is some kind of ballot box stuffing, but given the specific users I targeted and the fact that the result has been a well-reasoned argument for keeping the list (as opposed to a conclusory vote providing no rationale such as "trivial", as most of the delete votes have been make it quite apparent that nothing inappropriate took place here. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 17:43, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I guess, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">User:MartinDK</a> has a point which he has already pointed out on <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinDK_6ccc.html#Re:_Deletion_of_the_big-busted_Playmate_list" title="User talk:MartinDK">his talk page</a> is response to my apologies for hurting the user's feelings. The user was basically poitning at <b>... (fill in yet another synonym for mentally challenged)</b> and <b>... is disgusting</b> parts of my comment. I guess, I'll have to change my writing style to stop me from miscommunicating. Let me explain myself a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The adjective <i>disgusting</i> was taken from the original poster of the deletion proposal. The technique of repeating the same adjective was taken from the the repeating of the <i>trivial</i> argument. And, the idea of directing it against <i>the very discussion</i> was taken from quite a few comments above. I am sorry that it didn't come through that way. But, I'm still happy that the consumate effect of mal-argument did come through, which is happening for most part here.</li>
<li>The other, <i>mentally challenged</i>, bit was written in a lighter vain. I reasoned that if I make offers to fill in the blanks, instead of writing words like idiocy, confused and/or making accusations of dishonesty, it would go down better. Clearly, it didn't work that way everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that MartinDK made the same comment on the integrity of WP in an earlier debate, and some other Wikipedian actually agreed to it, instead of quoting an essay on <i><a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_Wikipedia_is_so_great_d3f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is so great">what makes Wikipedia so great</a></i>. So there was reason for the user to get angry at a lack of understanding on my part. Thoough I still don't understand why he terms you as my <i>friend</i>, especially when his <i>research</i> should've shown otherwise.</p>
<p>Well, <b>Reading that rambeling at times incoherent load of personal attacks left and right... A new low point in the history of Wikipedia</b> wasn't exactly a thoughtful comment free of personal attacks (which got the user angry by the user's own definition), but it surely can be excused in light of these things.</p>
<p>Just one more point for any more newbie who may join this discussion - please check the policy page <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>, as well as the article on <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> - before you make accusations of personal attack.

<p><b>Comment:</b> The hell with it. I don't care any more. Have your big tits list. What's one more porn resource on the internet, after all? It's obvious that most "keep" votes on this page are not driven by a desire to make WP a better encyclopedia, but rather by a love of convenient ways for finding pictures of boobs. I'm yet to see any lists of Playmates of the other breast sizes, no doubt because those determined to keep and contribute to this list find Playmates with smaller busts not nearly as interesting. I'm also yet to see a good reason why we need this particular list when we already have <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Playmate_9746.html#See_also" title="Playboy Playmate">over a dozen</a> Playboy related lists, but it seems that even with the noble <a href="http://www.boobpedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.boobpedia.com" rel="nofollow">Boobpedia</a> resource, as promoted by several of the "keep" voters, there just aren't enough tits lists on the net.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I agree that this list is somewhat distasteful and I personally find it offensive and sexist. However, this does not mean that it should be deleted. Playboy playmates are inherently notable, and there is a precedent for subsorting adult entertainers by bust size. Also, the size of playmates' breasts is verifiable. For these, and the various other reasons provided above (I see no need to rehash other editors' comments within my own, but I am taking them into account in expressing my opinion), this article should be kept.

<p><b>Comment:</b> So we can change your "delete" to "keep," Maelin? By the way, I think your idea of creating lists on the Playmates with smaller busts is an excellent one too. My own area of specialization is more in the Asian category than the US/Playboy, but hopefully another editor will heed your advice.

<dd><b>comment</b>: playboy provides this data for its own playmates. how is this not a sufficiently reliable source? sure, some playmates on the list do not have complete data sheets that include bust size -- the solution is to remove those unsourced playmates, not to remove the entire list. thus, this argument is really an argument for cleaning the argument up, not for deleting it. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 23:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: per <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>, this is something that should be categorized (at best) and not listed. There are no annotations, no non-article list items, all items are alphabetically sortable, list topic is redundant with some categories already available, poor precedent for alternate lists of similar topics (i.e., "do we justify lists for Playmates with C-cups, Hustler girls with every cup size, Bigguns with little'uns, etc?"), and finally, the list is founded on the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> violation that "big breasts" must be D-cup or larger and that the resulting list is Playmates with "big breasts". <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 00:09, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Position changed to delete</b>. It seems I got carried away by the <b>non-argument</b> of most nay-sayers. But, it seems the list has not established <b>verifiability</b>, <b>notability</b> or <b>neutrality</b> all that firmly. The D up threshold is pretty arbitrary, and the information sources pretty outdated. And, over and above all that, someone really needs to establish why a list of big-busted Playmates is notable, and that with appropriate references, not just gut-feel or heresay. P.S. <i>It's about tits</i> - argument is still unacceptable. P.P.S.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> 150 years is pretty old for a church in Wisconsin, and if members searched the newspaper clip files at the local historical society, or the historical files at the denomination's archives, they might just find enough material to write an interesting article and to show notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- disclaimer -- I started this article.
<ul>
<li>This article is important. There are many newspaper articles that get the details wrong. About six months ago some Arab journalists came away from a briefing from a DoD spokesmen, believing he had told them that there were only three minors in Guantanamo, and that those three were receiving schooling. Untrue, the three children who received schooling, and played soccer with their guards, at Camp Iguana were released in January 2004.</li>
<li>I'd encourage anyone who thinks they have noticed POV in the article to be specific about their concern -- on the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Talk%7EMinors_detained_in_the_global_war_on_terror_2d44.html" title="Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror">Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror</a> -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> What I meant by my "Definitely POV" remark above is the the topic of the article, as stated, is POV. If one wished to make an article with the opposite POV, one would title it Use of Child Soldiers by Islamic Terrorists. Both of these are going to be attack articles, inherently. However, I think this <i>is</i> a valid topic and a good start on an article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I first started initiating articles on the Guantanamo captives I had my first experience with the {afd} process. One day I found four articles nominated for deletion at practically the same time. Several of the nominators argued that the topic of Guantanamo was "inherently POV", and "inherently anti-American". I asked them to explain themselves more fully. But they declined. So far as I am concerned no topic is inherently POV. Some topics are merely harder than others to write from a NPOV. But I don't think this means we should try to create dueling articles from two different points of view. I think this means we should just try harder to write one article that we can all agree is written from a NPOV. If there are specific passages you feel don't measure up to the NPOV standard I encourage you to draw them to our attention, on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Talk%7EMinors_detained_in_the_global_war_on_terror_2d44.html" title="Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror">Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror</a>.

POV isn't normally a reason to delete an article, though it may be a valid reason for something that is irredeemably or inherently POV, where substantial efforts have been made to fix the POV problems.

<li><b>Question</b> Neutral on this particular article, but what's the justification for having the separate articles on each detainee? They may be encyclopedically notable as group, but this does not mean that they are notable enough as individuals for their own articles <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've done a lot of the work on the articles on the articles on the individual captives -- and their "notability" is a perenial question. Many wikipedia contributors have called for the deletion of particular articles, citing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Two wikipedians nominated <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Aamer_2d6f.html" title="Shaker Aamer">Shaker Aamer</a>, the first article when sorted alphabetically, announcing their plan to then do a bulk deletion of all the other articles on Guantanamo captives if that nomination succeeded. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shaker_Aamer_624f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shaker Aamer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shaker Aamer</a>.</li>
<li>I point out to them that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> acknowledges, right in its first paragraph, that it is <b>not an official wikipedia policy</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> acknowledges that it is just a guideline, one that is considered controversial by some contributors. Whatever authority it has is based not on being an official policy, but on its interpretation of three real official policies: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>.</li>
<li>My perception is that these challenges highlight the weakness of using "notability" as a guide to which articles should be deleted. It is far too subjective and vulnerable to unconscious influence from the wikipedia's systematic bias.</li>
<li>If there is ever an explicit debate to transform notability from a guideline to an official policy I will argue very strongly that it should not be transformed. Rather I would suggest this guideline be deprecated.</li>
<li>IMO we should stick with the more objective criteria <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>.</li>

<dd>Well, you're coming from an understanding of Wikipedia which is very much the opposite of mine. <b>Pointing out that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is just a guideline is a double-edged sword</b>. I've routinely point out the same thing when inclusionists use <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to argue for keeping articles. I would emphasize that proponents of encyclopedic notability see it as extending not just from notability guidelines but also from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> which is a <b>core official policy</b> as well as the <b>No.1 official policy &amp; mission statement</b>: <i><b>"<a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#Key_policies" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

<p><b>Keep</b> Future of Forestry (FoF) meets the following four requirements for notability (though admittedly the page should be updated with these references) which according to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, a band "is notable if it meets <b>any one</b> of the following criteria:"</p>
<ul>
<li>"It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." FoF was reviewed on DrivenFarOff.com, a music review site with a staff of nearly 20 people, as well as Infuze magazine, an online magazine on art &amp; faith with a staff of more than 20 people, and Melodic.net</li>
<li>"Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country" FoF has performed in several states and has upcoming tour dates in Oregon, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Florida</li>
<li>"Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels" FoF has an EP with Credential Recordings (indie) and is on a compilation by EMI (very major)</li>
<li>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city" FoF is the most notable Christian band in San Diego, playing in front of approx. 2,000 people at Flood Church weekly</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I strongly suspect that at least the FAQ section is a copyvio from the manufacturer's site, although the link in the article appears to be broken. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 19:21, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but as MER-C says it definitely clean up. I agree with Akihabara that it reads like a review, with a little how-to and speculation thrown in. Review, how-to, and speculation do not belong on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an ad for a product --- as well as most of its owner's manual. Perhaps the company that made the thing is notable, but this article is not about the company, it is just an advert, and a poorly written advert at that. <a href="../../../w/v/h/User%7EWVhybrid_6d13.html" title="User:WVhybrid">WVhybrid</a> 05:42, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> The company no longer sells the Pace Twin PVR and appears to have removed information from its website. A lot of this information is related to external support for this device. Having looked at the deletion policy there could well be justification for removal but I would point out that I have been unable to find such a comprehensive collection of information on this device elsewhere on the web. It seems to me important that the information be retained, (If this article is deleted, then the data should go elsewhere with a cross reference from <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_video_recorder.html" title="Digital video recorder">digital video recorder</a>).

<li><s><b>Keep</b> The page is just a collection of information about an obsolete product, but that currently still has many owners, to whom the information has proved valuable.

<li><b>Keep all (or merge/redirect)</b> Whilst these are fairly useless, and I think the creator probably needs to get out more, they are also harmless. They are NPOV and verifiable. Wikipedia hasn't got a space shortage. If the creator needs to find better things to do with his time, so does the nominator. No-one in this debate has presented any argument as to why Wikipedia would be better off without this information. Yes, this is 'cruft', and so what? Do people just enjoy removing minor information from wikipedia just for the fun of it? Does it make us feel superior?--Sandy Scott 12:50, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sandy Scott, we do not keep articles because they do not do any harm, but instead because they are found useful to this encyclopedia. If everything that didn't do any harm was kept, Wikipedia would be filled with balant spam which could kill the servers. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 14:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I though Wikipedia kept articles unless there was a compelling reason to delete them. What is the reason to delete this information? It isn't 'blatant spam' it isn't 'POV' and it is verifiable. I still see no reason. Is there a need to keep the number of articles down in order to spare the servers? I wasn't aware of that, but perhaps you are right. Can you point me to the information?--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandy_Scott_5a89.html" title="User:Sandy Scott">Sandy Scott</a> 15:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> as non-notable masts. Wikipedia, of course, should not have an article over each single mast, building, or large structure out there. If these had some amount of press-release or wide acknowledgment, I'd say keep. Otherwise, none of these are notable. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 14:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect all</b>. Somebody, who doubtless knows more about masts than I am ever going to (I hope), thought them worth making articles of, and they are still apparently worth being noted on lists, so there is clearly some sort of interest. As the articles are already in place, making redirects of them seems a far more sensible and productive course than totally eradicating them, and one which doesn't take up much server space either. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartofaDog_3faf.html" title="User:HeartofaDog">HeartofaDog</a> 18:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>. I hope you're not serious&#160;;-). Please note that all the articles are c&amp;p "[Towername] Tower is a [n] meters high guyed TV tower at [City, State, Country] at LONG°" N and LAT°" W. [Towername] Tower was built in [Year].". There are nearly 848 masts of under 500m in height listed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> (86% of total). In most of the articles proposed, there is not even the slightest assertion of notability, so this is pure cruft. I have furthermore taken care not to nominate any which have even slightest assertion of notability. IMO, the AfD process is sufficiently transparent that all the articles are easily checked if participants are prepared to spend the time, which admittedly not all are. Proposing separate AfDs for this "commodity" would be even a greater waste of kb and everybody's time. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:22, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This is simply an unwieldly, long list of any topic that may be remotely related to astronomy, including articles on general subject information, articles on specific objects, and articles on people. Remarkably, the list is simultaneously overly broad, overly long, and woefully incomplete. It conveys no useful information, and it is so long and so broadly inclusive that it is not useful for navigation. The article is not salvagable; deletion is the only option. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 09:13, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The talk page claims that its primary purpose is for tracking edits using the "Related changes" feature.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I will mention this at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Astronomical_objects_5ab3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical objects">Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical objects</a>, the best WikiProject to handle this page. However, I have the sense that this page would not be needed in that WikiProject; the Wikiproject already has a few unmaintained work lists. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 11:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I thought about using the list for tracking changes to astronomy-related articles and realized that the list is so woefully incomplete that it would not be useful for such an activity. For example, compare the list of NGC objects in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_astronomical_topics.html" title="List of astronomical topics">list of astronomical topics</a> to the list in <a href="../../../n/g/c/Category%7ENGC_objects_b669.html" title="Category:NGC objects">Category:NGC objects</a>. Given the incompleteness of the article (and the overwhelmingly impractical issue of adding all astronomy-related topics to the list), I would say that this page can no longer be used effectively to track changes to astronomy-related articles in Wikipedia through the "related changes" feature. This is an additional reason why the page should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 12:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Contrary to the nomination, this page is part of a navigation scheme. If one is navigating from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContents_3181.html" title="Wikipedia:Contents">Wikipedia:Contents</a> — which is the "contents" link right at the start of the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> — and follows the link thereon to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_topics.html" title="Lists of topics">lists of topics</a>, this list is the next step downward in navigation towards astronomical topics. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I did not claim that this was not part of a navigation scheme.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> At least in my view this list is much to cumbersome.

<li><b>Comment</b> — At one time this page was probably more useful than it is now. But I'd at least like to see the various red links moved to the Requested Articles page.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - This list can never be complete, and if it is will be completely unweildy.

<ul>
<li>Come now - at the very least, <i>lists are superseeded by categories</i> is long known to be false. "Incompleteness" is also a lousy criterion for deletion (For instance, it could be used to delete several featured lists), <i>unwieldy</i> is subjective and pointless (There's no "more wieldy" alternative) - and claiming it lacks a simple, coherent focus is absurd. This list fell out of the <i>simple, coherent</i> focus tree and hit every branch on the way down. It's a model of simple, coherent focii. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> at the very least, rather than deleting this list (which we all know would be supremely retarded) "For the sake of navigation" it might be sensible to trim it down to just the more specific lists and "foundational" articles, so that people would stop complaining about it's "usefullness" <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know it was already voted 3 times to deletion and voted to keep. But I believe it happened because of odd reasons, explained bellow.</p>
<p>The Unicode reference is very usefull, and was already properly added in wikipedia. However, for its insane size (more than 1 million characters) it was removed from wikipedia. It was resurected in wikisource, which recently was also removed from there. Actually it was hidden in wikibooks as part of "Windows Programming" book. So I re-moved it to its own book (Unicode book), so hopefully it will be easier to be found.</p>
<p>Why the hell I'm talking about Unicode, in a HTML characters article? It is because this page is in fact a Unicode reference, NOT HTML. It still persists "as useful" because there is no Unicode reference in wikipedia, for the reasons told above.</p>
<p>As most of the "keep" previous votes was because "it is useful", and because it is a shame to wikipedia this article still remaining as it is, I am providing the link to wikisource so you can compare</p>
<p>Note: It is a ambiguity why this page is so protected, still the Unicode reference was deleted from here and wikisource. So I will simply move this page to "Unicode reference" if this page will be kept again. And, please, don't vote keep just because it survived 3 times.</p>
<p>Note 2: if you compare the 2 tables, note this article's reference is in Decimal, and the reference in wikibooks is in hexadecimal. Beyond that it is the same.</p>
<p><b>Reasons</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a single implementation of Unicode. This list is not part the HTML pattern at all. There are many Unicode implementations out there (Java, Linux, etc...).</li>
<li>There is a much better, already divided, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Unicode/Character_reference" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Unicode/Character_reference">complete Unicode reference in wikibooks</a></li>
<li>It is not enciclopedian (it is a reference table - of 1M characters - , and its not an article)</li>
<li>It is still too big, incomplete, with broken links, misguiding, and will ever be.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Resolution</b></p>

Category listings and links to the entries in the French and German Wikipedias have already been added to the other entry.

<li><b>strong keep</b> you guys dont get the policy, this is a LIST not a guide, would you rather have stuff listed in the main article go here and read my counter for the delete</li>
</ul>
<p>here are my reasons</p>
<p>here is some text from the wiki strategy guide article this article does not include any of these in it</p>
<p>are instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific video games. The exact meaning of a "strategy guide" these days is very vague, as most could be easily ranked as "walkthroughs" or "hint collections".</p>
<p>detailed gameplay information, for example, maneuvers that are not detailed in the manual complete maps of the game, which show the placement of all items (including hidden and hard-to-find ones) detailed instructions for specific locations on how to proceed from there explanations of puzzles details of enemies, including techniques on defeating individual enemies (especially "boss" monsters) checklist of collectible items cheats and game editing, although this has been less common in official guides</p>
<p>none of these are in this list, and dont say collectible items becuase these are standard buildings not ones you gain by playing.--Superchad 19:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)superchad</p>

<p>1) is nothing more than a partial list 2) doesn't even clearly indicate what the contents of list are or even where 3) the only source listed is a map--not even the publisher or year 4) there is no encyclopedic information provided about the listed roads and it is very unlikely that much more could realistically be said about the roads <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 13:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>To elaborate a bit more, such a listing <i><b>might</b></i> perhaps be appropriate for an individual county article or as a subarticle related to the county, but there is nothing that intrinsically links the roads in one county with the roads of another county. I can recognize that the roads are in Michigan and the list could in theory be renamed to at least indicate the location, but I have no idea what a County Municipal Road is and there is no definition provided. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 13:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> AFAIK, by the guidelines, county highways aren't automatically notable, only state and federal ones are. BTW, the county in question is in Michigan.

<dd>The 'directory' point isn't much good. We have lists of books by Belloc and Blyton, Chesterton and Derrida ... need I go on?

<p><b>Neutral</b>. Actually, if you look at the artist's web site<a href="http://www.theoldkings.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theoldkings.com/" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, it shows that two albums have been released on the same label as <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> found on Amazon which therefore might meet criteria #5.

<dd>Well, there's the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a>, and then there's the ancillary criteria of WP:MUSIC, which only indicate possible non-trivial media coverage.

<li>Changed my vote to a simple <b>Keep</b> after I expanded the article. This stuff looks like real Wikipedia-type material, and it's worth having an article that comments on it.

Those with little mathematical background may not appreciate why <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Tao_7bd3.html" title="Terence Tao">Terence Tao</a> is relevant; the answer is that he is considered one of the best minds in contemporary mathematics, having just won a <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_Medal_f3ac.html" title="Fields Medal">Fields Medal</a> (a rare top prize in mathematics) and a <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacArthur_Fellowship_dc30.html" title="MacArthur Fellowship">MacArthur Fellowship</a> (sometimes called a "genius award").

Hmm. The article is a stub less than a month old, and the wiki form of the site has only existed since July 2006 (but using content hosted by Tao dating back to October 2000).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure I understand the arguments for "keep". Why should we have an article on some wiki because Terence Tao likes to contribute to it? It's more of an interesting thing about Tao rather than an affirmation of the notability of the wiki. Does notability just transfer like that so easily? I'm sure the wiki will do well enough regardless of what is decided here. I'm sure with contributors like Tao, the site is worth knowing about. I don't see why this means that it becomes Wikipedia's mission to advertise it though. For example, there are obscure books that are worth reading. Are we supposed to say they are notable because we like them? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I put the site's article up on AfD as it makes no claims of notability, and it doesn't appear to be notable. If it's got content that is useful, then by all means link to the site in articles on that topic (or better still, incorporate the content and reference it). But does the site need a whole article to itself? If so, please show that it is notable - e.g. news articles that discuss it, or references to it in the literature, etc.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not ready to cast a vote yet, but I did read the guideline <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And I looked at the website a little, and I searched Wikipedia for references to Dispersive Partial Differential Equations. The only relevant hits I got were in articles about Maxwell's equations, and about the Schrödinger wave equation. Those may not be the best understood PDE's in the world, but they are extremely important in physics. And I gather that the point of calling something a "dispersive" PDE is that its solutions don't look like persistent standing waves, but decay over time somehow (the sine wave versus a Bessel function, more or less). So it seems to me that the best solution might be to have an article that actually discusses dispersive PDE's, and why they're important, and maybe why mathematicians have unanswereed questions about them, and then link to Mr. Tao's wiki through that article. Oh -- I also read Mike Peel's home page, and see that he's in astrophysics. I understand now why he thinks Tao's website is not notable. The website is focusing on the well-posedness problem. I've studied with both physicists and mathematicians, and the physicists never seemed to care about the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirichlet_problem.html" title="Dirichlet problem">Dirichlet problem</a>.

So although I get the feeling we sometimes have too much crap on WP, I'm erring on the side of caution: do we through out the baby with the bathwater, by voting to delete things like this? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">Linas</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinas_7391.html" title="User talk:Linas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Linas_833c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Linas">contribs</a>) 01:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Mike Peel's comments. It's a great resource, but that is not a reason to have an article in Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, from 2000 until the wiki was started a few months ago, Tao hosted the content.

<dl>
<dd><i>Universal ZIME Belt (Josta) consists of 18.4 trillions single ZIMEs. More than 400.000 persons and concepts are located on Josta sofar. Each ZIME is able to store unlimited amount of infomation while not growing bigger or more complex. Using today's computer technologies it is easy to encode information in ZIME but it requires a future Quantum Computer to decode it. This is why ZIME is often refered to as a Quantum Harddisc.</i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - (1) A proof of 18.4 trillions ZIMES is purely mathematical: 16 ^ 16 and it roots in a graphical structure of ZIME. Every ZIME consists of 16 elements and each of them can carry 4 bits of information (0..16). That gives us 16 ^ 16 = 18446744073709551616 or 18.4 trillions. (2) The statistics of the EXPO project (www.zime.de) alone show that there are more than 300.000 participants of the project. Other round 100.000 participants are from other projects of ZIME Foundation (e.g. 'Your ZIME in Belt of Latvia' with more than 40.000 ZIMEs). (3) ZIME is encrypted using so called one-way-hash algorithm. It is a matematical concept allowing very fast encryption, but very slow decryption procedure that can even take years with the most powerful supercomputers. Other examples of one-way-hash algorithms include so called message digest algorithms (md5, sha, etc.). Quantum Harddisc is a term coined by physicists like David Deutsch to describe a storage medium that can be used only with the hypotetical Quantum Computer but not with the todays computers. --Turdus 20:51, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as hand-waving nonsense. <i>"Each ZIME is able to store unlimited amount of infomation while not growing bigger or more complex."</i> is not plausible if you want to recover the 'stored' data. (OTOH, a hash function does indeed have that property, but it's not designed to store data. Input from a Real Cryptographer would be helpful here. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 19:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> - As a Real Cryptographer I can only confirm the mathematical possibility to recover data hashed by one-way algorithms. The most common approach is so called Brute Force Attack (BFA) i.e. searching through the all possible existing data combinations. With ZIME it works this way: any amount of data can be hashed producing a Hex-16 digest. Digest is visualized as ZIME. This digest can be obtained reversly from any ZIME any time. Then the BFA is used to decode the original data. -- Turdus 21:50, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You're claiming to be able to recover a file from its MD5 digest? I don't think so.

<li><b>Comment</b> - pls read once more and carefully what I'm claiming. I never claimed *I* could do that! But a mathematical possibility is with no doubt there as I already explained. --Turdus 01:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i>: no, you can't, and no such mathematical possibility exists. Consider a 128-bit MD5 hash value: there are only 2^128 possible such values. Now consider a 256-byte file: there are 2^2048 possible such files. A simple <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counting_argument.html" title="Counting argument">counting argument</a> shows that it is not possible to uniquely recover input files from their digests, even with a quantum computer, because the files and digests cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 23:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> - you are right about one-to-one correspondence. But remember, that we are searching for a meaningfull texts. This limits possibilities dramatically! --Turdus 01:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was expecting you to raise that objection. Let's look at it in detail. "Meaningful" natural-language text contains just over one bit of entropy per byte (see <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/dcc2003.ps" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/dcc2003.ps" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>), and so, even if you restricted the 256-byte file to "meaningful" text, and conservatively assumed one bit per byte of entropy, there would still be 2^256 such files. The counting argument still applies. Please look up "unicity distance". -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 00:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>ZIME is coded using a very strictly standardized data structure. How do you think, how many of these 2^256 files can have such a structure? --Turdus 02:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are proposing that this is a universal lossless compression algorithm, then, with some input pre-expansion created by the "very strictly standardized data structure". Please see the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lossless_compression.html" title="Lossless compression">lossless compression</a> article to see why that is impossible. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 00:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have never said it were "universal lossless compression algorithm". I said: its a digest. There is a difference as you may notice. --Turdus 02:37, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you can invert a short digest into source files drawn from a pool with size larger than the number of possible states of the digest, you have produced an effective lossless compression algorithm. Or are you withdrawing your earlier assertions about invertibility? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 00:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its a pity that I have to vaste my time because some people dont want to read carefully enough and generate spam-like comments! Everything you say is true for the PC on your desk. But I said clearly: <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_computer.html" title="Quantum computer">quantum computer</a> is a solution. And nothing else. --Turdus 03:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Quantum computers cannot overcome counting arguments: even if it's a <i>magic</i> box (which quantum computers are not), if it can't get any more information than is encoded in the digest, it cannot possibly map its restricted set of inputs to the much larger set of outputs that must be generated if the digest is to be inverted. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 01:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am glad you found your own theory about quantum computing. In this case I naturally cannot oppose - every theory has its right to live and to die! Good luck with further opposing ZIME! May be you can get it out of WikiPedia (who cares!), but not from the minds of the creative people of the world! Best regards! --Turdus 03:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Counting arguments based on the <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigeonhole_principle.html" title="Pigeonhole principle">pigeonhole principle</a> aren't new, so I can't take credit for them. However, they work rather well on claims of infinite compression using message digests. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 02:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is true only for meaningless information. But can you imagine that a good message digest algorithm will produce the same output for the strings "The pigeonhole principle is an example of a counting argument" and "Hilbert's Grand Hotel can accommodate more guests without doubling up on rooms"? --Turdus 13:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please re-read my comment above containing the words "unicity distance". And, while you're here, you might want to quote the section of Deutsch's <i>The Fabric of Reality</i> that you claimed supports your assertion that quantum computers can invert message digests, but have so far been unable to supply. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:29, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Let me help you: the only question that really matters is: are there substantially more messages encoded into ZIME than a biggest possible digest hex number: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. The answer is no. And are not expected to be. And if - we just choose for ZIME2 a longer digest, kind of DoubleZIME. (2) Quantum computers, as described in "The Fabric of Reality" will be able to perform any computing operations in a reasonable amount of time (in fact at almost no time!). If we put this in the context of ZIME, it becomes obvious that a term 'Quantum harddisc' is a good one. --Turdus 16:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's not consistent with your earlier claim of unbounded information storage. The important question is not how many messages you expect to encode during the lifetime of the system (which will obviously be less that 2^128) but the space of possible messages. Let's take your comment above as an example. It is 570 characters long, and thus has an information entropy in excess of 500 bits. It is <i>almost certain</i> that another "meaningful" message of similar length (indeed, billions upon billions of such messages) will have the same MD5 digest, and that it is therefore <i>impossible</i> to uniquely recover that message from its MD5 digest. If we widen our scope to include the entire set of meaningful messages of information entropy 500 bits, the "almost certain" becomes an absolute mathematical certainty. This applies regardless of whether you have a conventional computer and an unbounded length of time for brute forcing the message, a hypothetical quantum computer of performing any computable task, or even access to a hypothetical <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercomputer.html" title="Hypercomputer">hypercomputer</a>. I have said this before, in several different ways. Putting the members of a larger set in one-to-one correspondence with a smaller set, which is what your compression scheme amounts to, is simply impossible. Even if you have a quantum computer. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 11:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) By now we have encoded near 400.000 ZIMES - each of them unique. Is the "unicity distance" big enough? I really do not insist to leave the theoretical claim of Quantum Harddisc in this article if its too controversial. But I think its worth mentioning it in some form. And: we have tested ZIME digest (DWD) against MD5 with the result that DWD produced much less redundant outcomes. E.g. we encoded 2.3 Mio different data sets with DWD and every single digest was unique. (2) A ZIME Quantum Harddisc theory is strongly supported also by the prominent physicist Prof. Dr. Andris Buikis, who is also a member of ZIME Foundation. (3) Even more important than decoding I regard the verification functionality i.e. only the person who has produced a certain ZIME can reproduce it again. --Turdus 02:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is not whether you can digest a set of a few million distinct messages and not have collisions (you could, for example, reasonably expect to digest about 2^64 randomly generated messages before seeing an MD5 collision -- see the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday_paradox.html" title="Birthday paradox">birthday paradox</a> to understand the reason for this particular number), but whether you can do this to the much larger set of all possible candidate messages. The difference in size between these two spaces is sufficiently big to make them qualitatively different: 2^512, for example, is 13,407,807,929,942,597,099,574,024,998,205,846,127,479,365,820,592,393,377,723,561,443,721,764,030,073,546,976,801,874,298,166,903,427,690,031,858,186,486,050,853,753,882,811,946,569,946,433,649,006,084,096, which is somewhat larger than 2.3 million. One is sufficiently large to overwhelm the message digest algorithm, the other one isn't. And this is only for 512-character natural-language messages: hardly "unlimited" storage. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 08:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Remember, AfD is not a vote: and even if it was, voting multiple times (four, at the latest count) is unlikely to persuade others of the merits of your argument: and, again, if it was a vote, after removing the duplicates, I make it four "deletes" against one "keep" so far, with the one "keep" coming from the original author of the article. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 23:26, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> or, failing that, very very weak <b>Keep</b>. I actually watched that episode just two days ago (it's on disc 2 of the DVD box set). It did show up on the TV Guide "memorable moments of TV history" list and seems to be one of the things about the show people remember best (In an interview on the disc, Brett Somers said the contestent was "robbed" and that Rayburn "lost control" of the show at that point). It also shows up on loads of clips shows and countdowns and such, like the recent "50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time" on GSN. I'd prefer it in the show's article instead of its own, but it definitely should be discussed somewhere. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:30, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd have to disagree. <i>Modern Pagans</i> is representative of "pop-paganism" and the commercialization and co-opting of neopaganism by profiteers and people with political agendas.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I've been involved in the Pagan community since the early '80s, and know many of the people in the Re/Search book (ironically enough, I'm also in it), as well as some of the folks involved in its production. However, I have *never* heard *anyone* refer to the book as any sort of "litmus test for notability". Vale and John interviewed a number of people they met at Starwood, and those they knew through friends in California. It is very focused on the West Coast and a particular subset of the Neopagan community, and while interesting for what it is, I never heard anyone involved in the project refer to it as an attempt to focus on those who are "notable". Some in the book are quite notable, others are simply people they thought were interesting or who were friends of theirs. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 19:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Jeff Rosenbaum is a MAJOR part of the neopagan scene in the Northeast (and, because of the size of Starwood, nationally); his work for the last 3 decades holding Starwood together is a huge contribution to that scene. He is responsible for putting together MANY notables who would not otherwise be working together. As a regular Starwood and WInterstar speaker, I write from experience. Rosenbaum's work is one of the main reasons the Church of the SUbGenius relocated from Texas to Cleveland, and (just as one example of hundreds) my current work as an instructor with Robert Anton Wilson's Maybe Logic University would not have happened had Rosenbaum not invited both RAW and myself to events in the past. Although Jeff is not known as a writer, especially, he is most certainly known very widely as an organizer -- not just a promoter. He is as important to the neopagan community as any of the (hundreds of) speakers and writers he has brought to the ACE events. If Larry Harvey is notable for Burning Man then Jeff Rosenbaum is certainly notable for Starwood! I do not understand why there is so much resistance to listing a person who is definitely one of the primary movers in the East Coast neopagan movement. RevStang 09:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, this is not a technique one uses in a "discussion", not was it relevant regardless of it's technical "truth". There are PLENTY of "true" irrelevant things you could refer to about someone to discredit him/her: "The person making this statement is a Jew", or "a woman" or "has no college degree". Just because the statement is true doesn't mean it wasn't designed to denegrate the subject. This was an obvious attempt to trivialize Jefferson Anderson's input by IMPLYING that it should be given less note. I do not have any contact with this individual, nor do I know who he is. He may have a great deal of knowledge to apply to this issue, regardless of when his account was opened.

<dd>I don't understand your point. What policy says that the Wikipedia article on a subject can't be more complete than other articles? Are you saying that no Wiki article can be anything but derivative of other articles elsewhere? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 21:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia is not for original research</a>, and articles must be based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable external sources</a>. An article based on someone's own perceptions rather than external sources violates Wikipedia's official policy (no original research), and one of its most central guidelines (use of reliable sources). So the answer to your question is, yes, that's precisely what I'm saying - articles must be derivative of external sources and not be original research. I think this article fails that test. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we disagree on this in several ways. First, a Wiki article can combine several sources and thereby become a more complete bio than any other single one that you might come across, partly because the others might have been created to fulfill a specific purpose rather than be a general article abut the person. Second, most bios DON'T require references and sources, which is why I originally said (as you can read) that this one goes beyond others. It is not just a bio, which has been done before, but an ARTICLE with references to interviews, written works, and a discography which has not been assembled in such a form before. I expect this is true of many Wiki articles. There is a difference between original research and the results one can get by gathering existing information and assembling a more complete profile than anyone has done before, and linking it with relevant other pages. I think the subject is notable and the article is worth keeping, and I'd appreciate help improving it rather than shooting it down. Perhaps some of the material is not sufficiently important, and/or the copy can sound more encyclopedic. Fine, please advise. But the tone of this discussion has not been one of an attempt to be helpful. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 22:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to address the last four sentences of your response, which I think are off-topic. (Sorry, that's how they look to me.) As to the rest, articles require references and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. If this were, as you say, an article that was pieced together from many different reliable sources, it would be fine. But I've seen no evidence that this was pieced together from external reliable sources. It seems instead to be an autobiography that goes far beyond any sources, and that therefore violates WP:OR and WP:RS (and WP:COI, WP:AUTO, and WP:Bio). That's why I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 23:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>On the fence</b> I also think the media coverage is sufficient to establish notability. Note that the media coverage does not merely mention the subject in passing, but mentions him as being notably related to the main topics of that coverage, such as the Starwood festival. With regard to the arguments about original research: yes, there is certainly a problem with original research in this article. These problems would need to be cleaned up if the article is kept. My big concern is that if all of the unpublished material is removed, would there really be much left to say, other than that Rosenbaum is a moving force behind ACE, Starwood etc? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 01:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia already has enough <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> through the inevitable demographics of legitimate editors. Letting articles made as spam stay in the encyclopedia tilts Wikipedia's contents too much towards their interests regardless of whether the individual article subjects actually meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines.

Googling for "Stephen Lin" gives nothing of relevance, the article is unsourced, and the "references" section is a list of academic papers which seems to have nothing to do with the subject (they're not even authored by him).

<p>Somewhat checkered history for such a small article. Was created by User:Precociousone with a C&amp;P from a dictionary,then tagged for speedy as a copyvio. The original editor then rewrote it, removing the copyvio, and I prodded it, as a dicdef. User:86.134.221.85 then blanked the page (removing the prod)&amp; rewrote it again. None of these rewrites have substantially addressed the real matter here, which is that this is a dictionary definition and can never grow beyond that. The same editor has also created Contumely and removed the speedy tag under similar circumstances. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 19:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sub-stub offering no information of any value. Unsourced. Not mentioned in any of the articles about the region or district, so may be unverifiable. Has been tagged for at least 6 months as needing cleanup and expansion; none has occurred.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree, it's not an accounting term, but it is in wide use, and sort of a point of controversy as with really old stuff it's sometimes difficult to tell what's new old stock and what's just used and cleaned up.

<p><b>keep</b> I have seen Matt Glowacki and he is incredibly articulate and gently holds an audience like no other speaker I have heard in years. I am excited that someone finally made an entry for him and placed it on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Matt dispalys pure genius in his presentations that touches us all with insight that disarms and tares down the walls of separation so he can weave his witty but factual tales that connects us all. Not everyman but the man that speaks to everyone about everything making all relevant and bringing all of us into the mix. In late 2001 just a few months after our national disaster his presentation on the commonality of man left not a dry eye in the house and not a laugh unused. A social commentator with rye humor and a compassionate soul with love to share he spoke to us each with what we required.

<p>The tone of this article is terrible, <s>but more to the point it's ultimately a recounting of a single newspaper article.

<dd>Anomo, you got the gist of it. Dibbell has received criticism for his "immersive" or melodramatic approach to the article (I'd like to find some that's citeable). He was a participant and new to online community and you could say he was drunk on the experience. Then as now some people are dismissive of the event itself, but the importance of the article is a different matter.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:26, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The externally linked article is well just horridly unreadbly written. The article appeared to be an improvement, but still a long way to go. What it gets down to appears is just more of a hacking/prank and not a rape. That is, if someone did that to a man, a man wouldn't be in tears, just angry. I'm not sure all women would consider that rape either--hardly embarressment since it's anonymous online.

<li>Exactly, Anomo. The debate over the meaning of the incident -- and Dibbell's comprehensive (although imperfect) treatment of its implications -- are why the article remains relevant today. There are people who read this and say it was just a prank; some of the participants were hard-pressed to explain why they <i>experienced</i> a prank as if it were sexual assault. That's the crux of Dibbell's essay. In any event, our article isn't here to explain the incident, but to explain the content and context of the essay. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I admit I never read the essay/article/whateveryoumaycallit in full, and it's been time since even looked at it, anyway. =) Anyway, I'm not questioning its <i>notability;</i> What I'm questioning is whether it warrants an article of its own.

<dd>I couldn't disagree more (okay I probably could but still). A couple of hundred years ago, it was common to print very long pamphlets instead of books, and there is always the question of what to call a book-length essay that hasn't been published with two outside covers. Articles and anything else that are both notable and verifiable can have their own Wiipedia article. If you're feeling sympathetic toward books, just to balance that, ask yourself, would this essay be notable enough for its own article if it were a book? If the answer is yes, then it should have its own article no matter what format it is published in. Let's discriminate purely on notability, not on format. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 20:39, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>*sigh* Okay, I really wouldn't like to argue about this, but my answer to whether or not an essay needs an article of its own would be a resounding "<i>That depends,</i> but probably not." If I'm saying essays aren't article-worthy and books are, that's just a rule of thumb - like most of the Wikipedia guidelines and policies, as interpreted every day. We're meant to look at the spirit of our policies rather than the letter; likewise, I can't say my ideas of article merging are universal and unbreakable. <i>In this case,</i> I'd say this is merge material. <i>However,</i> like I said, I'm saying this should be kept in some form. I'm <i>not</i> annoyed if someone elects to just keep this as a stand-alone article <i>for now</i>, and I can't bother to change my boldfaced recommendation because it's probably inconsequential considering other peoples' recommendations. All I'm saying is that please don't turn this into "Article sizes: Wikiality vs. Lutheranism" thing along the lines of "We don't have an article on Codd's relational model article, which has <i>only</i> been described as the most important computer science paper ever published, but we have an article on this cybersex incident." We're also <i>meant</i> to use common sense here. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 01:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Collegial discussion is good.&#160;;-) Wwwwolf, the question comes to whether there is sufficient material for an article on a specific essay. A merge recommendation is also problematic as there is no obvious article to merge with such as "cyberrape" (which may not even deserve its own article). The essay touches on aspects of cyber law and digital culture, but also postmodern concepts such as individual identity and the power of language. I know when I read it in the <i>Voice</i> so many years ago, I had no idea it would have this kind of longevity. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After someone on a message board called me a Japanophile, I decided to Google to see what that meant. Of course, one of the first link proposed on Google was Wikipedia. I was shocked that a made up Internet insult slang had it's own article here. Japanophile is a made-up word with no positive background, it was obviously made up as a last defense resort for debates Japanese Vs English language in Anime and Games.</p>
<p>I would like to nominate this article for deletion since the background of this word holds no water. I would bet $10 that a slang such as Americanophile would be removed from Wikipedia if it was created, so there's no room for Japanophile here either. <a href="../../../d/u/h/User%7EDuhman0009_0686.html" title="User:Duhman0009">Duhman0009</a> 22:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It gets a lot of hits because it's used a lot on message boards, which is the main reason why the Google test doesn't establish notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> I remember first stumbling over this article a while ago and being shocked to find that a legitimate, neutral word had an article where it was described as merely a synonim of <i>otaku</i>, <i>wapanese</i>, and <i>yellow fever</i>, all of which are derogatory. A great deal of the shock was of course stemming from the fact that as a scholar of Japanese studies, I consider myself a Japanophile, in the neutral meaning of the word, of course. The article is much improved, and if it manages to stay the way it is now, does not merit deletion. However, I do think that if the word has gotten a negative connotation in certain circles, this should be clearly stated as well.

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether it is a pejorative term or used as a pejorative is irrelevant to its inclusion in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> In my view, it isn't presently a dictionary definition, and it has plenty of potential for additional encyclopedic content.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that Grandmasterka just wanted to put it through AfD so that a final, consensus decision could be established on the status of the article -- it's been speedied and {{prod}}ed multiple times, and so if AfD sees fit that it stays, it can kind of put to rest the debate over it. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 23:12, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If an article has never had an AFD, or there is a new reason why it should, an administrator makes the nomination without stating an opinion.

<li>The self-editing/spamming is a problem, but that doesn't mean the subject is not notable. If the article is beyond repair (which I disagree with) but the subject is notable, it can be stubbed to restart. There is an obvious assertion of notability: the subject was one of the producers of <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Bella_%28film%29.html" title="Bella (film)">Bella (film)</a></i>, a notable film.

<li><b>I am Sorry</b> I genuinely did not intend to do anything wrong and i would be happy to fix anything you want me to fix or provide back up information that shows that my biography is accurate. Please advise me on what you would like me to do. Here is a summary of what has happened: First, i did not creat the article about myself. After i found that i had a page i added truthful facts and reviews on the film i made. I did not have the intent to create a "vanity" article. I did add content to other people's articles that linked to a film we made and i am sorry because i just learned that is spamming. I just read the "spamming" link you added to my page and now i realize that what i did was not right. I am genuinely sorry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you. Sean. User:Seanwolfington / User:76.18.54.173</p>
<p>This excerpt explains what happened to me: "Some people spam Wikipedia without meaning to. That is, they do things which Wikipedians consider to be spamming, without realizing that their actions are not in line with building an encyclopedia. A new editor who owns a business may see that there are articles about other businesses on Wikipedia, and conclude that it would be appropriate to create his own such article. A Web site operator may see many places in Wikipedia where his or her site would be relevant, and quickly add several dozen links to it."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I made the recommended correction</b>After discovering my page i updated a few missing facts from my bio and reviews of the film i made. One of the editors suggested that i remove the reviews of the movie i made so i did that today. As for my biographical information, it is all truthful and factual. All of the information on the page has appeared in many other publications and on the web. If you search Yahoo you will find alot of this info. Here is a link: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=sean+wolfington&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external free" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=sean+wolfington&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=sean+wolfington&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8</a> I understand that i have violated some editing guidelines and i would appreciate your advice on how to avoid this in the future.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s> <b>Merge</b> <s>Weighing in as a self-appointed vandalism/spam/crap-reverter of, and occasional content contributor to, Maine and New England-related articles, especially individual-community articles and the like.... I'd err on the side of <i>"all schools are notable,"</i> <i>"its a school,"</i> and <i>"i like schools"</i> until a more clear standard is established. I took a look at <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> and it isn't very clear, IMO.

Merge with <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel%2C_Maine_f46a.html" title="Bethel, Maine">Bethel, Maine</a> or with a to-be created Maine School Administrative Distict 44 article. <a href="../../../r/i/p/User%7ERipogenus77_e4f8.html" title="User:Ripogenus77">Ripogenus77</a> 00:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changed to <b>Delete and do not redirect</b>. Frankly, what's the point of having this redirected? 1)Hardly anyone will ever type this exact name when searching for the school. 2)Even if they would, they already know that the school is located in Bethel. What use could it be in redirecting someone to the town article which they did not ask for? --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 14:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While there is a shred of an argument present, the fundamental questions are 1) should this information be shifted somewhere?, 2) should the stub be retained as a redirect? and 3) how should users be redirected to the target of the merge? In each case, the suggested choice of <b>delete and do not redirect</b> is fundamentally wrong, if not vindictively destructive. There is useful information in this article that could be and should be moved somewhere, and I'm suggesting <s><a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel%2C_Maine_f46a.html" title="Bethel, Maine">Bethel, Maine</a></s> <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine_School_Administrative_District_44_eb40.html" title="Maine School Administrative District 44">Maine School Administrative District 44</a>. While individuals are unlikely to go directly to the current qualified article, its retention as a redirect will allow any history to be retained in the not so unlikely event that a standalone article can be created from the existing shell at some point in the future. The <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crescent_Park_Elementary_School_8ec9.html" title="Crescent Park Elementary School">Crescent Park Elementary School</a> schooldis article should be changed to redirect to <s><a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel%2C_Maine_f46a.html" title="Bethel, Maine">Bethel, Maine</a></s> <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine_School_Administrative_District_44_eb40.html" title="Maine School Administrative District 44">Maine School Administrative District 44</a> and avoid the double redirect that would result from a merge/redirect. While I am willing to accept that there are perfectly valid reasons that an article does not stand on its own -- including school articles -- I am disturbed that there are so many who are willing to destroy these articles without taking any effort to see how useful information could be retained via a merge/redirect. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:00, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>My position is not vindictive, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> Alansohn. I just don't think that there's anything worth saving from this article and I expect a redirect to be useless. It irks me the notion of having the history kept for the sake of someone improving this article in the future, which I also find useless but there I believe we disagree due to our antagonistic views regarding school notability. Still, I have to express my view and I reiterate my position. But not vindictively, really.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 19:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

It seems to me to be a staggering example of bad faith to refuse to consider a merge/redirect because it irks you. That one could be irked by the presence of a redirected article goes a long way to further demonstrating that there is a strong level of vindictiveness at work here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:39, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I verified the content by downloading the software and testing it - so it's verifiable. But some quick poking around on my part found two more sources, plus I'll try to find more. However, I'd like to point out that, so far as I can tell, the company's web site isn't selling anything ( it looks more like a hobbiest site ) and that this is freeware. I'm not sure what harm there is in having this article here, but Wikipedia's own pledge drive ( which I'll be donating to on payday ) says <b>Imagine a world in which every single person can share freely in the sum of human knowledge ... Donate today!</b> This article is most certainly a part of "the sum of human knowledge." <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalEnthusiast_4e7d.html" title="User:DigitalEnthusiast">DigitalEnthusiast</a> 22:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia does not use the dictionary definition of "verifiable" for its verifiability policy. It also does not aim to collect the sum of all human knowledge.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - Found out about this on photo.net, and came to Wikipedia to find out more. I'm saddened to learn that someone wants to delete a good source of information like this. I always come to Wikipedia to learn more - it's where I start any kind of learning I want to do, then I branch out from there. And I can't see any reason but spite to take down an article that's useful to a lot of people. I started using the "Exif Harvester" program and it's the easiest thing I can find to shrink my pictures down so they'll fit in an email, but I can see how I'll also learn about how the manual modes work if I put in the time with this program. Plus, the program has a lot of users, who seem happy and vocal, both here and on photo.net. 71.216.188.161 21:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>keep</b> - For weeks I've been trying to figure out how to parse a exif jpeg with VBA for an Access database. Knowing that this software exists saves me an awful lot of hard work. But more generally, this is an very notable article about an important concept in digital life, filling a gap we face with digital cameras. I'm glad/lucky I found out in time. Knowledge in an encyclopedia shouldn't have an expiration date, though - it would be a disservice to wikipedia's readers to delete this article. 62.189.83.4 20:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I beg to differ with you. When you type "Information Sharing Customer Outreach" into Google there are seven entries. The ISCO directorate and its director are also both mentioned by name in the Wikipedia entry for Intellipedia. Every effort is being made to write the article in a non Point of View/advertorial way. It is what it is: an office within the US federal government that deals with approximately 100,000 federal employees conducting the work of the sharing information across the intelligence community.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiriusfarm_e2e1.html" title="User:Siriusfarm">Tom</a> 04:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see where the different results come from. "Information Sharing Customer Outreach" gets no hits, "Information sharing and customer outreach" gets eight.

<li><b>comment</b> I just made two similar articles (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Program_Manager_Information_Sharing_Environment_b8e3.html" title="Program Manager Information Sharing Environment">Program Manager Information Sharing Environment</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Sharing_Council_0832.html" title="Information Sharing Council">Information Sharing Council</a>). This article is related to it. I didn't start this article. I didn't even know that it existed until I started browsing the afd's. I think that the page should be named <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Sharing_Customer_Outreach_a9dd.html" title="Information Sharing Customer Outreach">Information Sharing Customer Outreach</a> without the trailing acronym. The reason that there are few hits on google is because this office is brand new. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Program_Manager_Information_Sharing_Environment_b8e3.html" title="Program Manager Information Sharing Environment">PM ISE</a> was just established in March. I am debating creating a new <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Sharing_Customer_Outreach_a9dd.html" title="Information Sharing Customer Outreach">Information Sharing Customer Outreach</a> article, and filling it with the information in this article. This one here looks like it needs a lot of work. While I was adding the "See Also" links to it, I got a chance to look at it, and there are a lot of &lt;br/&gt;'s to remove. A couple of "section citations" too.

<li>Google is refreshed so often that I don't believe that the fact that there are few google hits is related to the office having been established only in March. That's nine months ago. Surely a organisation of the US federal government should be able to acquire some more google hits in nine months time.

<li>I don't know whether ISCO is notable enough to merit its own article, but if we are going to keep this, I'd suggest we at least <b>rename</b> it to Information Sharing and Customer Outreach.

<li>I agree that the name should be changed to Information Sharing <b>and</b> Customer Outreach to make it more clear. It is a part of the DNI but like the PM ISE, the Information Sharing Council, and many other components of the DNI which have their own stub or article it is notable and deserves its own entry.</li>

<dd>From General Meyyerose's speech <s>today</s> to AFCEA (<s>18 DEC</s> 24 FEB 06)- We in fact have a Senior Executive whose title is the Deputy Associate Director of National Intelligence for Information Sharing and Customer Outreach. And notice that it doesn't say anything about the intelligence community because we have customer outreach and information sharing responsibilities <b>across the entire government</b>, and that's an important thing to realize.</dd>

<dt>Regarding Deletion</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I just read the following wikipedia advice on deletions that I believe applies in this case: "Before nominating a recently created article, <b>please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape.</b> Unless it is obviously a hopeless case, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a "cleanup" template, instead of bringing the article to AfD." This article has clearly evolved from its original state and substantial additions and improvements have been made since it was nominated for deletion. It will continue to improve unless of course it is deleted.</li>

<p>Prod was removed. My original rationale read "Joke page. And pretty unfunnny too." I never imagined the prod would actually be contested but it was and the opposing rationale was "merge with <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy%27s_Law_7a83.html" title="Murphy's Law">Murphy's Law</a>". I guess I could be bold and redirect the page but I think it's important that the page be deleted and <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a>. We are writing an encyclopedia and 99% of people here remember this but this kind of page makes Wikipedia look less like an encyclopedia and more like a bad repository of popular culture. Clearly this article violates a number of core policies like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. More importantly, it degrades the overall image of Wikipedia as a serious project. Note that <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murphy%27s_Law_7a83.html" title="Murphy's Law">Murphy's Law</a> already struggles to stay encyclopedic (since people keep adding their own oh-so-funny examples so merging should certainly not be an option. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
