<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Inclusion of other articles is not a reason to keep; Mr. Unicorn has to stand or fall on his own merits, which appear to be lacking.

<p>Non-notable Flash cartoon. Lots of Google hits due to common terms, but nearly all are blogs or Newgrounds-type links. No major citations in first 100 results or so. Article also appears to be part of a concerned effort to get anything connected with Robert Benfer listed in Wikipedia, all of which have failed multiple AfDs. Author of cartoon is also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jason_Steele_9786.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jason Steele">currently up for AfD</a> as well. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 16:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This may be a cartoon video, but it's a notable cartoon video. On ONE of the many Charlie the Unicorn Youtube videos the video has over 1,000,000 views. This has also been posted on tons of other websites, so there's no doubt it has had at least 2,000,000 views. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacaman_ff05.html" title="User:Pacaman">Pacaman!</a> 17:31, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If this is not kept I think Jason Steele and Charlie the Unicorn should be merged into a new article about Film Cow. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacaman_ff05.html" title="User:Pacaman">Pacaman!</a> 17:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Why? If they are deleted for not being notable enough for inclusion, why would the company behind them somehow become notable? An article on Film Cow would have to succeed or fail on its own merits, which right now don't look very good, after a quick Google search. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 18:05, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If Youtube videos are deleted for not being notable enough for inclusion, why would Youtube somehow become notable? It's a popular website. Other websites like <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestar_Runner_f289.html#HRWiki" title="Homestar Runner">HRWiki</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Leaky_Cauldron_e5bd.html" title="The Leaky Cauldron">The Leaky Cauldron</a> also have articles. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacaman_ff05.html" title="User:Pacaman">Pacaman!</a> 20:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument, for obvious reasons. I suggest that you try to come up with <i>at least</i> as many references for this cartoon as can be found in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Leaky_Cauldron_e5bd.html#References" title="The Leaky Cauldron">The Leaky Cauldron#References</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Counting search engine hits is not research, and search engine hits are not arguments for either keeping or deleting. If there are no sources, an encyclopaedia article cannot be had. If you want to demonstrate that an encyclopaedia can be had, you must <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> Yes, there should be a standard established such as number of views to judge stuff which only appeared on the internet and was never written about in books, magazines or newspapers. But lacking a standard, I can only judge that no independent reliable and verifiable sources were cited to prove notability. I suspect that such internet notability has a short shelf-life. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:44, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a primary source</a>. If no-one has yet documented a meme, Wikipedia is not the place to come to document it first. If people want to document memes firsthand, then they should be out there creating the very source material that you are lamenting the lack of, and publishing it in books, magazines, journals, newspapers, and the like. Wikipedia is not a mechanism for remedying that lack. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, saying it's not verifiable is nonsense, this video <i>exists</i>. If there is something else you are referring to, you should be more specific. I'm not the biggest fan of this video (it gets annoying after the first time and only the last line is funny), but it warrants an article. <b>Cite sources and clean up the article</b>.<a href="../../../m/k/6/User%7EMk623SC20K_8362.html" title="User:Mk623SC20K">Mk623SC20K</a> 13:58, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You should probably take some time to familiarize yourself with our policies if you want your vote to be taken seriously, particularly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. There have to be reliable sources for us to write an article from; if none exist, we can't have an article on it.

<li>Unless <i>you</i> cite sources, your argument does not cut the mustard. The onus is on you to demonstrate that sources exist if you want to make an argument for keeping the article. It isn't on anyone else. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I don't know if it's popular enough to be an internet meme (though there definitely seem to be a lot of spinoffs on Youtube). However, judging by the number of views on Youtube, Newgrounds and other websites it does seem like quite a large number of people have seen it. Does anyone know how many people have to be aware of something before it becomes notable enough for wikipedia? On another note... <b>comment</b>: I find MikeWazowski's suggestion that there is a Robert Benfer conspiracy afoot to be a rather serious one, and I challenge him to provide some proof of it or else strike out his words (the suggestion seems to be that the constant recreation of articles related to Robert Benfer is a sign of a concerted effort by a small group of people to get him on wikipedia, rather than an unrelated effort by many people owing to his large fanbase, which, according to <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, may be a sign of the need for an article). <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 19:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. Obviously the thing exists, but the article has no reliable or verifiable sources or citations. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 19:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>LOL!</b> I saw the cartoon on YouTube the other day and decided to check here to see what it was all about. I had no idea there was such a controversary about it being on Wiki. I say <b>keep it</b> on here. If the popularity of the toon gets bigger it's gonna wind up back here anyway. The skit is pretty funny in a mental sorta way and I find myself quoting it alot whenever I see someone named 'Charlie' or someone talking about candy. I'd like to see further information about it though. How and when the creator came up with it and such. As for those of you who don't like it on here: "Chaaaaaaaarlie.....Shun the non-believer!
