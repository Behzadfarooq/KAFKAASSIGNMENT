<p><i><b>Would editors please note that there is another discussion for a related article at the bottom of the page!</b> Somebody requested the debate be split and I have agreed. So, please contribute to that debate too as that one is being passed by at the moment. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_bad7.html" title="Talk:List of schools in the United Kingdom">talk page</a> (where there are several comments about the pointlessness of this list), there is in the order of 25,000 schools in the UK. The list is already 177k, which way over the recommended article size. I believe <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (indiscriminate info) applies. Really a list like this is lacking on context, and it does nothing for <i>the reader</i> that the already quite intricately structured schools categories can't do a lot better.</p>
<p>Please note, this is <b>not</b> an anti-schools nomination (I'm in the "schools are notable" camp), it's anti-listcruft. Second note (very important one) - I anticipate that some editors will say "this list shows red links but categories don't" (and that, frankly my friends, is the <i>only</i> virtue of this list). <b>Wikipedia is optimised for readers not editors</b>, and categories are optimal for readers. If a redlink list is needed, it belongs in the schools WikiProject (see <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBeatles_3fa2.html" title="WP:Beatles">WP:Beatles</a> for how we've been approaching this issue). <b>Delete</b> or <b>move to the schools WikiProject</b>. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:01, 31 March 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<li><b>Keep</b> Essential lists. America has similar lists. The point about readers versus editors makes no sense at all: the red links tell readers the names of schools which don't have articles.

<ul>
<li>The old "someone else has it so we must" excuse? (Last seen in a forumcruft debate near you). It's a list of potentially 25,000 articles which makes it indiscriminate information. Why don't we have List of schools in Europe? Because it makes no sense, and nor does this. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<p><s>This was lumped together with a much smaller and more specialist list, which was unreasonable.</s></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. There are only a few hundred independent schools in the UK, and the sector is important in its own right. The categories have been divided by county, which means that they don't offer the alphabetical list that this does. Also there are red links, which encourage the creation of articles and inform <i><b>readers</b></i> of the existence of schools without articles. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 17:48, 31 March 2006 (UTC) Refactored, as he'd actually struck out my nomination and put his comment where the nomination should go! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:19, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Adding a <i>late find</i> onto an existing AFD when there's only been one contributor is par for the course.
