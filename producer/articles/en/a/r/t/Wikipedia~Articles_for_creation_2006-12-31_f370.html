</pre>
<p>Saying the name of Ayikudi will give you subiksham – wellness; Ayikudy is a holy place where Hanuman river flows, the river is named after Sri Hanuman who was said to have stopped by here on his way to Lanka. The temple is situated at the base of the auspicious Aswatha tree. By looking at the baby face of Balasubramanya at the temple, one would get all the prosperity.</p>
<p>Ayikudi Balasubramanya Swami Temple is located in Thirunelveli district near Thenkasi. The little temple is a treat to pilgrims and tourists who come to visit the Kutralam waterfalls, Kasi Vishwanathar temple &amp; Thiruchendur. Until 1947 this area was under the regime of Thiruvadhankur Kings. The temple is situated on the banks of Hanuman Nadhi. Sri Hanuman who was said to have stopped by and rested on the banks of this river on his way to Lanka, hence the river was named Hanuman nadhi. Obviously this is why Rama &amp; Subramanya are popular names in this region.</p>
<p>Lord Karthikeya appears among five Vrikshas (trees) and the five Devatas in the form of a young Balasubramanya. The five Vrikshams are Arasu (Surya) , Vembu neem (Ambhikai), Kariveppilai Curry leaves tree ( Mahesha), Madhalai (Ganesha) &amp; Mavilangu (Vishnu).</p>
<p>A devotee named Mallan at Nanjaipara, found the main deity Idol of the temple in the Mallam River. Once there lived a Brahmin Mugura Bhakthar sanyasi who obtained samadhi in that area. His samadhi was built on the shores of Hanuman Nadhi. An Arasa Tree was planted at that place &amp; his community was conducting pujas &amp; ceremonies there. The idol of Balasubramanya Idol that was found at Mallapuram was installed on the samadhi of that Sanyasi and the pujas were continued. Until 1931 the top of the temple was only made by coconut &amp; palm leaves. About 150 years back the Thiruvadhankur Royal family took up the temple management. Then the temple was renovated and festivals were organized. The Utsava Murthi was known as Muthukumara swami. The Balasubramanya Mulavar Pujas were conducted in the traditional way by the Brahmins and the Utsava pujas &amp; processions were conducted by Shivacharyas.</p>
<p>The Idol: Both the Mulavar &amp; the Utsavar are identical, The idol is a small Vigraham, with the young baby faced Muruga, with four hands Vajram, Shaktivaram &amp; Abhayam with a Peacock on the left and the lord sits on a lotus Padmapeetam.</p>
<p>Special ways of Prayer: The Arasa leaf Vibhuthi Prasadham ( Holy Ash) available in this temple is very powerful. Padi Payasam, Kavadi, Pallkudam are some of the important ways in which the devotees show their love to the Lord. According to legend, on the steps leading to the Hanuman nadhi Sri Balamuruga takes payasam along with other children.</p>
<p>Special Days: During Aipasi month Nov 15- Dec 15, During Skandha shasti Soorasamharam festivities are popular for 7 days in this temple. Each day of the Utsavam the Lord is decorated differently and there is a Huge crowed of devotees attending the festivities. Special pujas are conducted in the temple during Chithirai Vishu, Vaigasi Vishakam &amp; Masi Makam. The lord is taken on the Peacock on the streets as a procession around the temple.</p>
<p>Those who get the dharshan &amp; pray to this Balasubramanya will attain all the prosperity.</p>

<p>Martand- the abode of Sun God</p>
<p>Martand - Mattan (J&amp;K) India, is a tiny hamlet situated on Anantnag-Pahalgam road, about 61 kms from capital City Srinagar of Jammu and Kashmir State of Indian union. The Place is famous for ;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Ancient Martand Ruins.</li>
<li>Temple dedicated to Sun God with natural fresh water springs with fish abound.</li>
<li>Pilgrimage centre of Hindus.</li>
<li>The special rituals on occassions like Parshotam Mass or Adhik Mass after every two and half years, Vijay Saptami, Solar or Lunar eclipse days, Amawasya, Sundays are being performed here for the Salvation and peace of the dead. Martand is also important stop over for the two-day halt of Charri-Mubarak (Holy Mace) on way to Amarnath. Some of the holy pilgrims after completing the Amarnath yatra would visit Martand on their return journey to seek blessings of the Surya Narayan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Legend :</p>
<p>In his introduction to the Rajtarangini Pandit Kalhan speaks of the Vale of Kashmir thus: “It is a country where the sun shines mildly, a place of great glory created by Kashaypa- high mountains, houses, the saffron fields, iced-water and grapes—things which are found only in heaven abound here”.</p>
<p>History bears testimony to the fact that millions of years back, Kashmir had been a vast lake, . Goddess Parvati had been so enamored of the picturesque lake, which was surrounded by high snow peaked mountains that she would often sail through it in a pleasure boat right from the point of her abode on the Hara-Mukh on the North to the Vishnu Pad in Kounsar Nag in the south. According to Nilmat Puran (200 BC) once Dash Prajapat, the Himalayan King and the father of Goddess Parvati extended invitation to all Gods and Goddesses to a Yagya ceremony, but did not invite Lord Shiva. Goddess Parvati who took it as an insult, got infuriated to the extent that she jumped into the havan kund and committed the act of Sati. Lord Shiva, the legend says, immersed the half –burnt body of his consort into the deep waters of the lake. That is how the lake got the name Satisar or the taru of the chaste woman.</p>
<p>In the lake Satisar, after centuries came and went by, a cruel demon by the name of Jalad Bhuva appeared and went on a destruction spree. He began annihilating life inside the waters and on the high lands. The sacred legends say that this demon was blessed with a boon by Lord Brahama, that as long as he remained under the water level of the lake, no power on earth could harm or kill him. Around the same time marked by the terror and destruction unleashed by the demon, Munni Kashyap is said to have been visiting the holy places in North India. On reaching the region of Himalayas where his son, Raja Niel, the king of Kashmiri Nagas, told him about the miseries suffered by the people there on account of the atrocities committed by the demon, Jalad Bhuva. Upon learning the story of great sufferings, Munni Kashyap is believed to have promised his son of the help in ridding the lake of the cruel demon. He soon prayed upon Lord Brahma and the Divine Trinity met at Nav Bhandhan peak near Kaunsar-Nag (15323 ft above sea level) and drained the Satisar after breaking a huge rock at Baramulla. The demon was killed but not before a terrible fight in the low waters at a place where Hari Parbat is situated today, and the land came to be known as Kashyapmaer or Kashmir.</p>
<p>Kashyap Rishi then is believed to have invited all the Gods and Goddesses and assigned each one of them a place in the valley. For example, Goddess Sharika was assigned the Hari Parbat, as she is said to have played a vital role in killing the demon in the form of Haer. Hari Parbhat is also known by the name of Pradman Peeth and Pradman Giri.</p>
<p>Pandit Kalhan writes, “There is not a single place in Kashmir which is not holy”. Martand or Mattan constitutes one among those sacred places. Situated about 61 Kms from capital city of Srinagar on main Anantnag-Pahalgam road, it occupies a special place in the Hindu mythology and is considered as old as the Sun itself. It is believed that thirteenth Sun , Martand was born here.</p>
<p>Legend says that between the two wives Kashyap Rishi had, Ditti gave birth to Danvas and Aditti bore him 13 sons of whom first twelve became the rulers of Surya Loka, in rotation with the twelve months of the year. Between the two, legend says, Aditti was pious and spiritually inclined who would spend most of her time in religious rituals and prayers. It is believed that because of her religious disposition, Lord Vishnu had blessed her with a boon that she becomes mother of Thirteen sons.</p>
<p>However, when she was pregnant with her thirteenth son, she did not stop the ritual of fasting, much to the displeasure of Kashyap Rishi. This led to the premature birth of her thirteenth son which resembled an Andkar pind or Oval-shaped substance like an egg, but glowing like a sun. Using her spiritual powers Aditti dropped it in the depths of Satisar Lake. Latter, when Rishi Kashyap came to know that his son lay in the depths of Satisar at a place (now known as Martand) he called upon Brahmaji to accompany him to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and Lord Vishnu and they all reached where the lifeless egg or Mrit-aend was dropped. There Lord Shiva smote the Mrit-aend, the upper side became a spring now called “wemal” and the lower side became another spring now called “Kemal”. A spark of energy ignited out of it which turned into Goddess “Barga Shakha” worshipped on the mountain-hillock overlooking the shrine. Three more Shakti Swaroopni Jyoti's became famous as Beema, Bagwati, and Shree Bhawani, all worshipped there to this day. The legend says that the light that ignited out of the Mrit-aend became Martand (Aur Iss sei jo surya kiran swaroop tej pragat hua wohi Martand kehlaya). And by virtue of the chakra the stream that gushed out from there became chakarsuta or chaka nadi.</p>
<p>Greatly impressed with the divine and aesthetic beauty of these springs of ‘Wemal’ and ‘Kemal”, she blessed the fish therein and ordained that those who will take care of the fish will attain salvation. Also, Lord Shiva is believed to have blessed the dead with peace and salvation if pind-dhaan, Pitrashraad, tarpan etc., are performed under certain stellar positions and special areas here.</p>
<p>The special rituals on occassions like Parshotam Mass or Adhik Mass after every two and half years, Vijay Saptami, Solar or Lunar eclipse days, Amawasi, Sundays are being performed here for the Salvation and peace of the dead. Martand is also important stop over for the two-day halt of Charri-Mubarak (Holy Mace) on way to Amarnath. Some of the holy pilgrims after completing the Amarnath yatra would visit Martand on their return journey to seek blessings of the Surya Devta.</p>
<p>Grand Kings of Yore and many devotees have constructed grand temples, Dharamshallas, bhawans etc. The springs have also been renovated and decorated many a time since their appearance. Also since times immemorial pilgrims from as far countries as China, Tibet, Samarqand, Afghanistan, North Indian states and NWFP (now in Pakistan) would visit Martand. It would be a must see in their itinerary.</p>
<p>History makes us believe that it had been the Raja Ramdev of Pandva dynasty who first built the original temple devoted to Sun God. Many subsequent kings and monarchs repaired and renovated the temple complex. However, it goes to Maharaja Lalitaditya (8th century AD) who gave a complete face lift to the ancient temple and made it known all over the world. The Sun temple of Martand stands in the middle of a large courtyard having 86 fluted columns. The temple proper contains garbhagraha, antarala and closed mandapa, approached by a grand flight of steps. The pliant supporting the central shrine has two tiers, both with niches having 37 divine figures. According to Walter R. Lawrence, the noted historian and a Kashmir expert of his times, “The ruins of the Hindu temple of Martand, or as is commonly called, the Pandav-Koru House- the Cyclopes of the east are undoubtedly, occupying the finest position in Kashmir. This noble ruin is the most striking in size and situation of all the existing remains of Kashmir grandeur”. He further writes, “There are in all eighty-four columns- a singularly appropriate number in a temple of the sun. The number eighty four is accounted sacred by the Hindus in consequence of its being the multiple of the number of days in the week with the number of signs in the Zodiac ( Rashis)”.</p>
<p>Cunningham, another historian, thinks that the erection of this Sun temple was suggested by the magnificent Sunny prospect which its position commands. “It overlooks the finest view in Kashmir and perhaps in the known world. Beneath it lays the paradise of the east, with its sacred streams, orchards and green fields, surrounded by vast snowy mountains, seem to smile upon the beautiful valley below.</p>
<p>The history of Martand or Mattan is incomplete without any mention of Bumzua, a sleepy hamlet at a distance of one Kilometer and situated at the mouth of the Lidder, more known for the cave temple, dedicated to the Kaldeva that stands at the far end of a natural, but artificially enlarged fissure in the lime stone cliff. The entrance to the caverns is 60 ft above the river Lidder and is carved into an architectural door way. The huge Shiva Linga inside the cave is believed to be there since the days of Pandavas. At a striking distance from the cave is yet another cave, some hundred feet long and is said to have been a Samadhi of some ancient sage.</p>
<p>According to Dr Stien, “The temple is the same as the Bhimkesava temple mentioned by Kalhana. It was built by king Bhimasahi, king of Kabul in Afghanistan”. Hugel states that the Bumzua caves date back to the year Kali-2108 or 993 BC, when Raja Nara ruled the Kashmir and these occupy very conspicuous place in the fables of Kashmiris. He tells us, “During the reign of Raja Nara, a certain Brahmin wanted to marry Chanderasha, the daughter of Susravas, a serpent God, who lived in lake near the city of Nara, near the Vitasta. Raja Nara also noticed the movements of the beautiful daughter of the serpent in the lake. He was struck with the deepest admiration and resolved to carry her off but failed. To avenge the insult, a storm was called up, which swallowed up the king and his court. The sister of the serpent God also helped him and hurled stones from the Bhawan or Mattan mountain. The caverns of Bumzua are on the spot where these rocks were upturned”. (Hugel, Growse).</p>
<p>The foreign scholars have praised the superiority of the Kashmiri Architecture. “The architectural remains of Kashmir are perhaps the most remarkable of the existing monuments of India, as they exhibit undoubted traces of Grecian art.”-(Reference., Bate’s Gazetteer). “Martand or Mattan are all known by the general name of Pandavan-Ki-Lari or “Pandava house” a title to which the statement of Ptolemy (2nd century AD astronomer and scientist of Greece) can be considered a sufficient authority. He says, “ Circa antem Bida spun Pandovorum region”, meaning—The kingdom of the Pandavas is upon the Betasta or (Behat) that is it corresponds with Kashmir”.</p>
<p>“Truly speaking, there is hardly a river, a spring or hillside in Kashmir that is not holy to Hindus”. ( Walter R Lawrence). Again Abul Fazal ( 1550-1602) writes, “ The Hindus regard all Kashmir as holy land. Forty-five places are dedicated to Mahadeva, Sixty-four to Vishnu, three to Brahama and twenty-two to Durga. In seven hundred places there are carved figures of snakes which they worship”.</p>
<p>It would mean endless space if one attempts to give description of places famous and dear to all Hindus in Kashmir. As regards with the Martand temple, these like many other places of Hindu worship fell victim to the fanatic zeal, soon after the end of Hindu rule in Kashmir in 1339 AD. Gibbon writes, “History is little more than a register of the crimes and misfortunes of mankind, chances and changes of human fortune; prosperity and decay of human institutions”.</p>

Companies have for years tried to solve the challenge of attracting qualified employees that are not actively scouting for jobs – the passive candidates. There is now a unique opportunity in expanding the candidate search from the employee networks and headhunter databases to a shared global internet solution.</p>
<p>Xpertize.be is a jobportal that enables employers to identify job candidates (currently employed in other jobs) that they normally wouldn't be able to reach, i.e. candidates that are not actively looking for a new job, but that will consider changing if the right offer comes along. We reach these candidates through a web-based network of individual head hunters that are motivated by a reward for referring the right candidate.</p>
<p>The ambition of Xpertize.be is to play a unique role of facilitator for companies wanting to recruit qualified Candidates as employee or as freelance.</p>
<p>The power of Xpertize.be relies on the quick and pyramid-type activation of a network made of people curious about new job opportunities but also made of <b>Connectors</b>. <b>Connectors</b> are people who are substantially rewarded to introduce their friends and colleagues into new jobs, posted by our client companies on our website.</p>
<p>This whole network is a unique solution for companies to identify and recruit outstanding people, not specifically looking for a job and not present on traditional recruitment websites.</p>
<p>The activation of this network is encouraged by rewards (trips, trainings, computers …) offered to the <b>Connectors</b> through which a Candidate has been hired by a client. Rewards are also foreseen for <b>Connectors</b> recommending the website to other successful Connectors (<b>viral networking</b>).</p>
<p>Xpertize.be is a perfect practical illustration of Internal social networks. These networks are based on the “Six degrees of separation” thesis according to which anyone on Earth can be connected to any other person on the planet through a chain of acquaintances with no more than five intermediaries.</p>
<p>Unlike other websites such as Zubka.com or H3.com, Xpertize.be does not work on a ASP model basis, meaning that the system still is proprietary to Xpertize.be.</p>

<p>Per Christen Hækkerup, Danish Social Democratic politician and minister, born December 25th 1915 in Ringsted, died March 13th 1979 in Herritslev. Per Hækkerup was little brother to Hans Erling Hækkerup and father of Hans and Klaus Hækkerup.</p>
<p>Per Hækkerup covered a number of ministerial offices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Jens Otto Krag government</li>
<li>Minister of Foreign Affairs (to 28th of November 1966) in the Jens Otto Krag government</li>
<li>Finance and budget minister in the Jens Otto Krag government</li>
<li>Finance and budget minister (to 27th of September 1973, after that just Minister of Economic Affairs) in the Anker Jørgensen government</li>
<li>Minister of Economic Affairs in the Anker Jørgensen government</li>
<li>Minister of Commerce (from 8th of September 1976 to 26th of February 1977) in the Anker Jørgensen government</li>
<li>Minister without portfolio with reference to financial co-ordination (to 13th of March 1979) in the SV-government (the third Anker Jørgensen government)</li>
</ul>
<p>Per Hækkerup was one of the first Danish politicians in the time after World War 2 to realise the meaning of European political co-operation. That is not least due to Per Hækkerup's work in the young European Social Democratic movement after World War 2. Per Hækkerup was one of the first Danish politicians to suggest the UN could be used as a platform which could give small countries like Denmark more influence than what would otherwise be possible. Per Hækkerup had a hard time understanding the youth movements in the sixties so that (along with the choices made in 1971 and 1973) when that generation came into the Danish Parliament the foundation was made for a historical split between the young and the old in the Social Democrat party, which has meant that there is a lack of political talent in the party today.</p>
<p>As a Minister of Economic Affairs in the start of the 1970s, Per Hækkerup managed to bring about an extensive agreement which would remove the grants, parties and organisations that had built up over time as a result of politicians granting compromises to each other. Just before it became law prime minister Jens Otto Krag pointed out that there had to be a reduction for pensioners and other social groups - which caused the whole agreement to collapse. Queried by a journalist whether he had to go home and lick his wounds, Hækkerup answered "I can't do that - they are on my back".</p>

<p>Coyotes can weigh 20-50 lbs., depending on where they live, and can be several different colors. Coyotes that live in the desert typically have tan or light grey fur, and a black-tipped bushy tail. Coyotes that live farther above sea level have thicker, darker, and longer hair than the desert coyotes. The chest and stomach are nearly white, and a white-tipped bushy tail. In the winter, mountain coyotes have long, silky fur.</p>

<p>Once a year, during late winter, female coyotes come into “heat.” Two partners might breed yearly, but not necessarily for a lifetime. Litters can be from 2-12 pups, but the average is six. The gender ratio is about 1:1. When there is plenty of food, the number of breeding females and litter sizes enlarge.</p>

<p>Coyotes are known to eat deer fawns and turkey poults especially, but also lizards, snakes, rodents, rabbits, fish, carrion, insects, grasses, and fruit. Coyotes live in almost all of the terrestrial and marsh habitats. They can live in urban or suburban building developments in the western U.S.</p>

<p>Coyotes are awake mostly at dawn and dusk, but you can see them any other time of the day or night. They often vocalize when encountering others using yips and barks. Coyotes carry very many diseases, such as rabies, eastern equine encephalitis, and salmonellosis. Coyotes also have at least 11 different kinds of parasites, such as lice, ticks, heartworms, whipworms, and lungworms.</p>

<p>Richard Legs is a british company, owned by 3 Entertain group which was created in early 2006 with the launch of the <a href="http://www.richardlegs.funtigo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.richardlegs.funtigo.com" rel="nofollow">official website</a>. After extensive plans for the website were completed, it was created on a <a href="http://www.funtigo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.funtigo.com" rel="nofollow">Funtigo</a>website and remains so today, however, the company has no relation to the host provider Funtigo whatsoever.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://pic.funtigo.com/img/i209769926 22432.gif">Image:Http://pic.funtigo.com/img/i209769926 22432.gif</a></p>
<p>The website originally contained relatively little content, however after the refurbishments were complete at the end of summer 2006, content increases by a vast amount. The features on the site are branded unformally, for example sections include lifeline, evidence, moments and a paraody of a dating service. All notable progressions are listed in the moments sections and a popular 'daylegs' countdown - a humour of the company name, is included with live countdown timers.</p>
<p>Although deemed to be as the year 2007 began, from December 30th 2006, the homepage was replace with an exact replica, and the former page was 'infected' by the milLEGium bug. As the name suggests, the company often brands its links and products as a humour of its name - beyond this, the site 'regulars' Mr &amp; Mrs Legs often supposedly send their 'leggy' greetings.</p>
<p>Despite popular belief, Richard Legs is a 3 Entertain company. This is viewable from their corporate website <a href="http://www.3entertain.funtigo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.3entertain.funtigo.com" rel="nofollow">3 Entertain</a> from the preview section. 3 Entertain also proudly display the '3' logo on the Richard Legs Homepage and regard creating Richard Legs as <b>"a complete success"</b></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-31_f370.html" title="Edit section: Zektzerite">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zektzerite</span></h2>
<p>Zektzerite, a member of the tuhualite group was first found in 1966 from the Willow creek basin below Silver Star mountain in the agpaitic granite phase of the Golden horn batholith, Okanogan county Washington by Bart Cannon of Seattle Washington. The mineral was misidentified as alkali beryl (morganite) by both Mr. Cannon and the author of this article at that time. Subsequently in September, 1975 the author found additional specimens of the mineral in a float boulder on the north side of Kangaroo Ridge at an approximate elevation of 6500 feet and recognized that the material was not beryl. The mineral was then referred to the Mineralogy Department of the Smithsonian Institution in November 1975 by the author with subsequent puhblication by Pete Dunn et. al in the American Mineralogist. Zektzerite has been subsequently found in blocks of pegmatite as rock forming grains in a lateral moraine of the Dara Pioz glacier in northern Tajikistan and in the agpaitic granite of the Del Salto pluton Aisen, Chile as rock forming grains.</p>
<p>P+roperties:</p>
<p>Crystal data: Orthorhombic (often pseudohexagonal) Largest crystal reported 3.7 cm high (in the possession of the author)</p>
<p>Physical properties: transparent to translucent, colorless, pale straw to pale pink or pale peach, vitreous luster hardness 6 density 2.79, {100} and {010} cleavages perfect. Fluoresces bluish cream under short wave ultra violet light.</p>
<p>Chemistry: LiNa Si6 O15</p>
<p>Occurrence: A mineral of agpaitic (peralkaline, arfedsonite) granites occurring with smoky quartz, microcline, arfedsonite, okanoganite, sogdianite, astrophyllite. Found in cavities as euhedral crystals in the agpaitic granite phase of the Golden Horn batholith, Okanogan County Washington at such places as the Silver Star viewpoint on Washington state route 20, the ridge above that lookout, Kangaroo Ridge, Willow Creek basin and the slopes of Silver Star Mountain; in blocks of pegmatite as rock forming grains in a moraine of the Dara Pioz glacier Northern Tajikistan; as rock forming grains in the Del Salto pluton Aisen Chile</p>
<p>Named for Jack Zektzer of Seattle Washington who first recognized that the maneral was unknown.</p>

UnitedHealth Europe was established in the UK in October 2004. Headquartered in London, England and with a satellite office in Maidenhead, Berkshire; the original leadership team included:</p>
<p>President - Simon Stevens; former Healthcare Policy Adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, CEO - Richard Smith; former editor of the British Medical Journal COO - Gail Marcus; a former executive with Cigna</p>
<p>UnitedHealth Europe is wholly owned by UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH). UnitedHealth Europe seeks to exploit the expertise and successful strategies of UnitedHealth Group's operations in the United States, bringing these to bare on patient populations in Europe. The first major project delivered by UnitedHealth Europe was a pilot of the Evercare model for older peoples care.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth Europe offers a range of predictive risk services that identify patients carrying a risk of experiencing an unplanned hospital admission and has also developed a strategy for primary care delivery in England.</p>
<p>In March 2006 The High Court delayed the takeover of GP Practices in Derbyshire by UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>In November 2006 a review of UnitedHealth Europe's Evercare pilot was published in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>The former Chief Executive of UnitedHealth Group; Dr. Bill McGuire, left the company in 2006 following an investigation into the backdating of stock options.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth Europe advocates strong partnerships with Health Systems including the NHS in England and to this end has established a heavyweight advisory panel and recruited UK trained clinicians and nurses to ensure clinical services meet the needs of both patients and fellow clinians.</p>

<p>The Food Quality and Protection Act, ratified by Congress in 1996, was the "most comprehensive and historic overhaul" of the Nation's pesticide and food safety laws. The Act itself was an amendment to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947 and the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), which was originally passed in 1938.</p>
<p>The safety standards of the country's pesticides became stricter, especially in regard to infants and children, and the tolerance levels of all existing pesticides was reassessed.</p>
<p>The Act is implented by the EPA (The Environmental Protection Agency).</p>

<p>In 1928 insurance salesman and financier named <b>Thomas E. Braniff</b> financed an aviation company with his brother Paul Revere Braniff, named Paul R. Braniff, Inc. The airline was named Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airways and offered passenger service between most of the major cities in Oklahoma. The original Braniff brothers would remain a part of the company, even as the ownership was transferred repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Braniff brothers restarted another airline in 1930 as Braniff Airways, Inc. During the 1930s, Braniff Airways expanded its service throughout the Midwest. Braniff’s long-term survival was assured when Paul Braniff, then General Manager, flew to Washington, D.C., to petition for the Chicago-Dallas airmail route. The United States Post Office granted Braniff its first airmail route. In 1935, Braniff became the first airline to fly from Chicago, Illinois, to the U.S.-Mexico border. <b>Tom Bran</b>iff took sole control of the carrier in 1935 and hired Charles "Chuck" Beard to run the airline's day-to-day operations. Beard would become President and CEO of Braniff in 1954.</p>
<p>During the 1950s the airline expanded nationwide. The acquisition of Mid-Continent Airlines in 1952 allowed Braniff to add several more domestic cities to its already established north-south route system.</p>
<p>In 1954, <b>Thomas E. Braniff</b> died in one of his personal planes, which crashed lakeside near Shereveport. Jan. 10, on the shore of Lake Wallace, 15 miles outside of Shreveport, Caddo Parish, Louisiana. According to information from Captain George A. Stevens: <b>Mr Tom Braniff</b> was on a hunting expedition with a group of important citizens of Louisiana, (including Milton Weiss - brother to Seymour Weiss, of Huey Long Fame). They were departing from a small duck hunting lake out of Shreveport in a new aircraft with no deicing system. The wings iced up and they attempted to land. One of the wings hit cypress stumps and the plane crashed against the shore. It caught fire and all 12 lives aboard were lost (including a number of Shreverport's most important civic leaders).</p>

<p>Jane Moore attempted to assassinate US president Gerald Ford on September 22, 1975, in San Francisco - just 17 days after a previous and unrelated attempt was made on his life. Moore took aim at the president with a .38 revolver from 40 feet away. An observer, a disabled former US Marine, pushed her arm up as she fired causing her to miss the president by a few feet.</p>
<p>Moore was sentanced to a term of life in prison after pleading guilty. She escaped from prison in 1989 but turned herself back in two days later.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-31_f370.html" title="Edit section: River Surfing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">River Surfing</span></h2>
<p>River surfing was pioneered by jon imhoff in 1989 on the shotover river in Queenstown, New Zealand. It started by simply riding a body-board down through white water rapids in the same way a raft does. Since then, many company's have started up around the world offering this experience to clients. There are three distinct aspects to river surfing: Running rapids, surfing standing waves and a phenomenon thats been named 'Squirting'. This involves catching a strong downward current with your board and being pulled down many meters under water, where you fly downstream with the current. Some people may of heard of surfing a wave along a coastal river created by the tide change. But in this type of river surfing the wave is stationary on the river, caused by a high volume of water constricted by flowing over a rock and creating a wave behind. A river surfer can face up-stream and catch this wave and have the feeling of traveling fast over water but not actually be moving. The equipment used in river surfing is usually the same for ocean surfing, but with a life jacket and helmet for the extra safety needed. Most river surfers will use a body-board, but a stand-up Malibu board can be used for surfing standing waves. Or a device called a river sledge has been invented made from hard plastic, with handles to grip. Which offer more protection from rocks in shallower rivers. River surfing is mainly practiced on high volume rivers and many people around the world have had the idea of taking a board onto a river. An annual surfing competition is held on a standing wave in Munich, Germany</p>

<p>Simply Gorgeous x x 23:48, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Iconator is a website, used by teenagers, to make icons and avatars, for AIM, Yahoo, and HotMail messengers. An icon is the small picture, of your choice, that is at the bottom of your conversation window.</p>
<p><a href="http://screenshots.xnavigation.net/viewimg/36/aol/instant/messenger/aim.jpg" class="external free" title="http://screenshots.xnavigation.net/viewimg/36/aol/instant/messenger/aim.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://screenshots.xnavigation.net/viewimg/36/aol/instant/messenger/aim.jpg</a> * ^^The pictures of the dog, and penguin in that picture are someones chosen buddy icon</p>
<p>On Iconator, you can create icons, and download them. But is it safe? For the most Iconator is safe, but here are some things to watch out for...</p>
<p>On Iconator you are to create a profile using your Name, Age, State, City, and Screename. By Using all of that information, it can lead a stranger RIGHT to your front door, so be careful what info to provide for viewers. -Iconator people. They may be fibbing. Just like MySpace, you can search a person, and they may lie about their age and name, so that you think that they are your friends, or family. To avoid this, do not speak with other iconator members unless you know them -Icons. Here is a tip about making an icon. Don't use your full name such as Allison Smith* or say "Carla and David Forever*" Because think, how many couples names are Carla and David? <i>* indicates name is changed for safety of others</i></p>
<p>More Information about Iconator.</p>
<p>To download an icon click DOWNLOAD ICON, and when a pop up comes up asking "WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE THE AIM ICON FOR SWEETIE99077*?" Click yes, and then your icon will be made onto your AIM.</p>
<p>To add to favorites simply click add to favorites. Then when someone is viewing your profile and they click Favorites, they can see all of your favorite icons.</p>
<p>This is all that there is to know about icons but also...</p>
<p>To make icons you should use Paint, which comes with your computer or Jasc Animation Shop 3.</p>
<p>Thank you, for anymore information on Iconator that you would like to add, you may edit this at ANY time!</p>
