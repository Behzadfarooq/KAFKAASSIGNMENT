<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVacuum_abf8.html" title="User:Vacuum">Vacuum</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vacuum_f424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vacuum">c</a> 01:03, Jan 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete.</b> This page is a jumble of conspiracy theories about <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and his family. A vast majority of the "theories" are nothing more than Bush-bashing. Few of the theories have credible sources. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 18:13, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> There's nothing wrong with this article. It's descriptive, NPOV, and heavily sourced. User Carrp confuses the map with the territory: his critique concerns the validity of the theories described in the article -- not the article itself. A similar leap would be to suggest deleting 'Cold Fusion' or even 'Kennedy Assassination,' ignoring their historical or sociological relevance by claiming that many of the claims described in those articles were 'not proven.' Point = missed. This may be a good candidate for the 'VfD abuse of the week' award. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 19:18, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you believe this page should kept, that's certainly your right. However, I am rather puzzled by your reasons:
<ul>
<li>Descriptive - Many of theories are similar to this example: "More banking tomfoolery with Riggs by Jonathan Bush." It's a link to an blog with a conspiracy theory. That's it.</li>
<li>NPOV - By nature, it's extremely difficult for this page to be NPOV. It's a page of attacks against Bush, but since they're called theories, it's somehow OK.</li>
<li>Heavily sourced - The 18 conspiracy theories have a total of 4 sources. That's certainly not my definition of "heavily sourced." One theory is nothing more than "Prescott Bush supported the Nazis."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Vote to keep if you want, but don't pretend there's nothing wrong with the article.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 19:40, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is nothing about this article that qualifies it for deletion under Wikipedia guidelines. Theories critical of George W. Bush, and the Bush family, are absolutely allowed in articles such as this one. The title is, "Bush Family Conspiracy Theory." Do these theories exist? Yes. There's a vast literature, some of it by highly credible authors such as Kevin Phillips. I'm very curious as to why there shouldn't be an article on this topic.</p>
<p>Inter alia, I count at least thirty sources listed, and wonder how you can see only four. And apropos 'Prescott Bush supported the Nazis,' a conscientious author would have linked to the relevant government records -- Bush family assets were seized on grounds of trading with the enemy. This was also in the news recently, etc. It's not a 'conspiracy theory,' but a historical fact. I raise this example because you singled it out. There are other things in this article that I find dodgy or unlikely. The title is, after all, 'Bush Family Conspiracy Theory' -- a quite accurate title. I find that the author was quite evenhanded in stating that some of the listed theories were grounded in credible research, while some were, as he wrote, "specious and unsubstantiated."</p>
<p>It's certainly possible to edit the parts of the article that you feel violate, or strongly test, NPOV.</p>
<p>So how does this road lead to deletion, and under what policy? <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 19:57, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The goal of Wikipedia "To become a complete, accurate encyclopedia." Conspiracy theories are inherently inaccurate because they deal with circumstantial evidence and attempt to make links where it's likely none exist. A page called Bush Family Conspiracy Theories is not only inherently inaccurate, but has an anti-Bush POV. While I concede that it's theoretically possible that this page could be brought up to Wikipedia standards, it needs so much work that, in reality, it will never reach that goal. Take a look at the history of the page and how little work has been done to maintain accuracy and NPOV.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My position isn't that this page should be deleted because it's critical of Bush. My position is that this page serves no useful purpose and is easily abused. Anyone who dislikes Bush or his family can post whatever garbage they desire on this page. I'd also support the deletion of a page of Clinton Family Conspiracy Theories (if it existed). Articles on these subjects are nearly impossible to maintain as evidenced by this Bush page. This information should exist, but it has no place in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 20:31, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Articles <i>about</i> conspiracy theories are not the same as articles <i>propounding</i> conspiracy theories. The article is accurate in that it lists current conspiracy theories involving the Bush family -- some of which are grounded in fact, and some of which (as the article states) are not to be taken seriously. They exist, and this is an article about them.</p>
<p>When you say, "Anyone who dislikes Bush or his family can post whatever garbage they desire on this page," that's true, but also trivial. Anyone who likes Bush can also edit the article to their heart's content. The fact that Bush-dislikers could post negative things about the President is not a reason to delete an article from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I assume there's an anti-Clinton article like this one. I'd argue against deleting that page as well. The anti-Clinton conspiracy theories were a real political force in America in the '90s. I'm trying to underline a distinction. Am I explaining well? <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 20:48, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wyss: I'm also amazed that people could believe in witches and flying monkeys, therefore I submit <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_of_Oz_e93c.html" title="Wizard of Oz">Wizard of Oz</a> for deletion. It's simply amazing that an article could advance such unsubstantiated nonsense! The article refers to flying monkeys as if they were a proven fact!</p>
<p>Wait. Oh. It's <b>about</b> the movie, The Wizard of Oz, and not propounding the view of reality shown in the Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p>You can tell I'm frustrated from feeling I've had to overexplain this. The article is <b>about</b> these conspiracy theories. I recommend reading the article, for anyone who wants to vote for or against deletion</p>

Please tell me if that is the correct thing to do in this circumstance, this is my first VfD. The current revision does not demonstrate any significance.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. This article seems to have been re-created after having been deleted as a result of the earlier VfD basically for the reason that you state. That makes it a candidate for speedy deletion. I see from the history that you added the {{delete}} to it, which was correct. An anonymous editor removed it, probably the same anonymous editor who recreated the article, although the IP address is different. I'm replacing the speedy-delete tag, but I have no confidence it will stay there without a battle. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:38, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It wasn't deleted before only because it was a stub or sub-stub; among the reasons it was deleted before was that college dormitories generally are not notable and the article didn't establish that this dormitory was any exception. It still does not. It should be speedy-deleted, per Wikipedia policy, as the recreation of an article that has been deleted through VfD. If the previous decision was incorrect, or someone wants to argue that they have a new version that does not have the problems of the previous version, it should be submitted to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>, where the burden of achieving consensus will be on those who want to reinstate the article.

Since Wikipedia has a decent search engine facility, we don't need this substub as anyone searching the name would get Caltech anyway, which has enough details on these houses to suffice.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Playboy Magazine is notable. The only notability that most of the young women who pose for them have is that they are in the top couple of percent in looks; and they are willing to be photographed in the nude for payment and to have the pictures published. Neither of which makes them especially notable. Some of them manage to turn their Playboy exposure into successful modeling/acting careers, in which case they may become notable and merit a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:56, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You persist on making this comment on almost every VfD vote you comment upon. Notability is not only de facto one of the main reasons articles are deleted via this page, but as has been explained numerous times, notability is derived from the basic requirement that an article be "encyclopedic" which is most certainly mentioned in the policy as the basic principle underlying all the others, and which is also implied by several of the more specific categories under "What Wikipedia is not". --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:13, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>The word "notability" isn't on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> either. A lack of notability is a possible indicator of other problems, but you've named those neither in your original nomination nor in your response. I can only conclude you don't have any reasons that actually accord with policy - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 09:41, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>False, if you are going to accuse people of not having it read it, you should read it yourself first. Paragraph 17. "The people who have biographies here should be important or otherwise <b>notable</b> for some reason." --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:34, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if notability <i>is</i> a "proper reason" for including a biographical article or not, certainly the same standard can be applied to other topics?

<ul>
<li>Thank you, RaD Man. I don't set the same standard of notability as you do, but I certainly can deal with the idea that people might differ. What I can't deal with the idea that there is no such thing as notability, or that there is some algorithmic way to decide what belongs in Wikipedia that is free from the exercise of human judgement and community consensus. You have made a clear statement of a well-defined criterion which provides a reasonable upper bound on the number of such biographies (approximately fifty per sufficiently-notable skin magazine). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:40, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless a GFDL image can be procured. The only notable thing about a Playmate is the ability of photographers and retouchers to use them as sources of images which inspire erotic reveries.

<li>Neutral, leaning toward delete because of the very real possibility of this becoming orphaned. I think the info is better served by being a part of a total list of Playmates of the Year. There isn't much here beyond what Geogre frequently refers to as a "predicate nominative." In other words, anyone searching for info on this woman already knows these basics. - Lucky 6.9 00:16, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's possible to look up individual dates, but why make it difficult? I find it interesting when two persons are born on the same day, and I think it'd be very nice to have the info easily accessible. I don't find it "silly" at all. Besides, there's a huge war going on now over whether it should be mentioned on Charles Darwin's page that he was born on the same day as Abe Lincoln, and both of them are highly respected. Imagine if two wildly disparate people were born on the same day--say Madonna and the next Pope. It'd be very interesting, but also certain to cause another fight.

<p>The page in question is about the second episode of the television show <i>Star Trek, The Next Generation</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I admittedly am a Star Trek fan, so admins should bear that in mind when counting votes; however, I would like to make a few points. First of all, while I wish NoPetrol had only listed one article to "test the waters," I don't think he deserves such censure or has violated policy (although reading <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper#No size limits</a> would have been helpful. In general, I don't think "fancruft" is necessarily a bad thing. To respond briefly to the points he raised on the talk page:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I don't think that having articles on episodes will destroy Wikipedia, nor do I think it will destroy the search function.</li>
<li>No, of course Wikipedia should not and could not have an article on everything anyone has ever created. Yet is does include works that people have created, including <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">an article on itself</a>. Whether one is a fan or not, there is no denying that Star Trek has had a significant impact on society, whereas urine-writing and second-grade short stories most likely have not.</li>
<li>In regards to "That article was deleted, and rightfully so, because it was about something that I just made up, and it was not relevant to anything. These Star Trek articles should be deleted for the same reason [because they were something that someone just made up, and are not relevant to anything]," I agree that it something that (many people) created, but one could not seriously argue that Star Trek episodes are not relevant to anything. That you fear harm from "rabid Star Trek fans" as you put it underscores your awareness of the large impact they have had.</li>
<li>Your World War II analogy ("Yes, Star Trek is notable, but to warrant the amount of detail about it that Wikipedia has, Star Trek would have to have had a greater impact on society than World War II") is flawed. Star Trek and World War II are not in competition for a finite amount of space. Both can be expanded. I also think that it is hard to compare the impacts of two different entities. Additionally, sometimes one subject has more information that can be written about it, even if it less important. I could write far more about World War II than I could about the development of spoken language in hominids, yet I feel the latter is far more important.</li>
<li>Going to high school <i>is</i> a notable part of many people's lives, as you mention, and yes, Wikipedia <i>does</i> have a page about <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high schools</a>. Furthermore, I am unaware of the Wikipedia policy against specific high schools (and we do have a fair number of such articles that have survived VFD). I apologize for the length of this comment but I wanted to ensure all of the nominator's concerns were addressed. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker দ</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">talk</a>) 10:01, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I'll vote <b>Merge</b> into an appropriate season guide. This is the appropriate way to deal with such things in my opinion, although I can see there are far too many Star Trek obsessives to win this argument. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:34, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> unless there is a specific Wikipedia policy against doing so. There are other articles devoted to individual episodes of other Trek series such as Enterprise, as well as individual books in a series (see <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>).

I would like to add that I hope this type of request for widespread deletion will be restricted in the future.

<dd>Actually, if an article about a Sherlock Holmes story is not about a story that has any significance on its own, then it should be deleted too, I think.

<dd>But if you haven't time/opportunity/etc. to read the whole story or watch the whole episode?

Or behind-the-scenes information about the controversial reasons <i>why</i> this actor was cast in the guest-star role, and <i>how</i> that particular special effect was done? You can't get all that just from reading/watching the episode, especially if you're skimming through it in a hurry.

<li>Yes, it created a group of people that everyone else stereotypes as being over the top obsessives (see the character of Comic Book Guy in The Simpsons). This is what the vast majority of people think when you say Star Trek - that it's followed by really, really obsessive fans who dress up as Klingons at the drop of a hat. And it should be noted that it is not the Next Generation that started that, it was the original series (which I used to watch as a kid). Apart from having the first interracial kiss on US TV and having fans campaign to get a Space Shuttle named Enterprise, I can't think of that many major contributions to the world that it really achieved. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:43, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

We shouldn't have a Star Trek episode guide for the same reason we shouldn't include listings for the local movie theatre. -- <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaltpohl_11fc.html" title="User:Waltpohl">Walt Pohl</a> 21:52, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I have looked and looked, but I can't find any part of the definition of a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> or an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> that mentions anything about it being important that the information is difficult to obtain elsewhere. It uses inclusive words like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compendium.html" title="Compendium">compendium</a> or general. Plus, I just don't get your anology. We shouldn't include local movie listings, because that information is constantly losing its value and there is essentially no chance that the information will be of interest beyond a small group of people. Neither case is true here. The information about the epsiodes is not expiring, and it certainly is of interest to a large group of people. How do you feel the anology fits? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_L._Kaufman_28ed.html" title="User:Michael L. Kaufman">Michael L. Kaufman</a> 02:00, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page has no potential to become encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base. Wikipedia articles are neither encomia/fan pages, nor critical pans. Biographies and articles about art works are supposed to be encyclopedia articles. But of course critical analysis of art is welcome, if grounded in direct observations.</p>
<p>The page in question is about an episode of the television show <i>Star Trek, The Next Generation</i>. The episode that this page is about is not notable, and is completely stupid, even for Star Trek (yes, I've seen it, along with all of the other episodes that I am listing here to be deleted). It is not a biography about an art work, but a mere synopsis of a Star Trek episode, and it has little potential to become encyclopedic because it was not a notable work on its own, and did not affect society in any observable way.</p>

<dd>You know, Geogre, I can see the case you're proposing. And I might agree with it, if this were a different encyclopedia — and with that, I mean an encyclopedia with a different user base. You're basically asking for people without a primary interest in meeting these encyclopedic standards to weed out their fancruft, which seems hopeless, or you're asking people without a primary interest in the <i>topic</i> to weed out other people's fancruft, which, given the first group, seems equally hopeless.

<dd>Well, the purpose of the back end of Wikipedia is to clean up, somewhat, the messes created by eager authors. The question is whether we exist to serve any author, no matter what, or to serve readers. For example, why no exquisitely detailed per episode article on "Diff'rent Strokes" or "Eight Is Enough" or "Lassie?" The answer seems to be, "Because our authors think Star Trek is kewel, and not those other shows." That, to me, makes us Everything2. This is not, so far as I see it, the Internet palimpsest. It's still an attempt at an encyclopedia, and what I consistently argue is for the logical organization of this information. In some cases, I think the information is utterly worthless, but most of the time I'm thinking of how and where the information can be retrieved and do some good. We do need to do the work that authors aren't doing, I'm afraid, and that's why I vote "merge and redirect" only if I think the information is vital and/or not written elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:07, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't disagree with any of the above points, but we started making lists before we had categories, and the authors in this list almost all have their own articles already.

<p>It's a short page about a series of adverts for an American airline - are the adverts of notable cultural significance?

There is in fact <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> which mentions many specific cases.

If the VfD page is not where consensus emerges on what belongs in the encyclopedia and what does not, where is the correct place?

In any case, schools are perfectly notable. They are responsible for the education of thousands of people and are a central part of their communities. Leaving them out of an encyclopaedia that is the repository of all human knowledge is senseless.

<li>You are very wrong: "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/28/1351230&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=11" class="external autonumber" title="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/28/1351230&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=11" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:22, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Because there are far too many people whose idea of an encyclopaedia is extremely narrow. Jimbo's vision is inspiring; Geogre's is not. We already have Encarta. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:28, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I doubt that "the sum of all human knowledge" in Jimbo's "vision" includes my shirt-size, although my wife finds this helpful to know when shopping for Christmas presents. Somewhere between an article on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and an article on my shirt-size, there is a line.

<li>What does "verifiability" have to do with "sum of human knowledge". By the way, it is easily verifiable: I can upload photographs depicting my shirt size being measured, with close ups of the measuring tape. If you are hoping that verifiability is the thing that is going to filter out all the trivia: nice try, but it won't. There is tons of verifiable trivia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:12, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Dude, I'm not the guy trying to "filter" the encyclopaedia. If several people besides you and those who know you want to write about your shirt size, it's in.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:57, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, dude, if the aim is "sum of human knowledge", why even rule out articles about my shirt-size written by me and those I know. It's knowledge, and its even verifiable. What difference does it make whether I write it or someone else? Is there maybe some notion that it should be of wide interest creeping in here? If so, I would agree, and now we only have to debate how wide an interest is wide enough. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:04, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A very good question. I cannot think of a good reason for ruling them out. "Wide interest" would be important were this a book but given that it isn't, why should there not be an article about your shirt sizes, perhaps with a graph of them over the years? Really, I'm not seeing from you a good reason not besides your belief that an encyclopaedia should only cover "important" things.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:14, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The sum of human knowledge" actually was the Encyclopedia Britannica's slogan. "Knowledge" has more than one meaning. If you use the widest meaning, rather than the meaning associated with the "-paedia" root—teaching, erudition—then "the sum of human knowledge" means a general knowledge base rather than an encyclopedia. Yes, Jimbo has used the phrase "sum of human knowledge," but he has also said that Wikipedia "is a free encyclopedia, meaning it <i>must</i> be <i>free</i> and it <i>must</i> be an <i>encyclopedia.</i>" There are many good reasons why Wikipedia can and should include more than a traditional paper encyclopedia, but it should not automatically include everything that happens to be a fact (such as autobiographies of non-notable people). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:49, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, did he go on to say the stuff you tacked on the end or are <i>you</i> saying it? I think he's been perfectly clear on several occasions that he believes an encyclopaedia should be very broad and I agree with him. You don't, that's fair enough, but don't be making out that it's the <i>policy</i> here. That's clear enough. Notability doesn't figure in it except that people should be notable in some measure. "Notable in some measure" and "world-famous" are not necessarily synonymous.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:59, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The stuff after the closing quote is mine, not Jimbo's. Due to careless editing on my part there was one revision posted I failed to close the quote, for which I apologize.<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:58, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>So, Dr. Zen, are you saying that notability is a valid criterium for <i>real people</i> but not for <i>schools or fictional characters, creatures, weapons, etc.</i>? If you believe so, please tell me what your reasoning for this belief is? <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 08:30, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm saying that's what the policy says. I've said more than once that I do not believe this encyclopaedia should be cut to my personal taste. FWIW, I think "notable" is as "notable" does. What's "notable" to me isn't to you, and vice versa. My mother is "notable" so far as I'm concerned, but you'd never have heard of her. Do you see? It's a poor criterion as generally understood. What the policy suggests is that people should have been noted because this is not a primary source. IOW, you shouldn't write about your mother unless you use other broader sources to do so. (Yes, I know, she might feature in your uncle's blog; it's not straightforward.) The latter is explicitly barred because it is vanity to write about your mum if no one else knows her or her achievements.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:47, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh yes, BEEFSTEW is intended for secondar schools, so Dpbsmith says he is also inclined to give primary schools and middle schools -3 bonus points, giving Kent Middle School a score of -1/10, or if you're being generous 0/10.

<li>Well, we can agree to differ. I believe ZEEFSTEW correctly identifies articles that should be kept in accordance with our aim to make this a great encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:42, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm the one who added most of the article's information content. For what it's worth, I think the school is utterly un-notable, but that it should still be kept. It has the potential to improve its score on the BEEFSTEW test. How do you expect it to improve if it gets deleted within a few weeks of creation?</li>
<li>The school appears to be fairly internet-savvy. The students do a web-page creating project every semester. Possibly we could get some of the students interested in improving the article as part of their project. If this page survives deletion, I intend to propose that idea to someone at the school. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">Dbenbenn</a> 00:51, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That last comment is incorrect. I tried to track every school article for a month, November 2004, to satisfy my own curiosity on this point, and what I found was that during that month about 65 school articles were created. Of these, <b>only 19</b> were nominated for VfD. One or two were speedy-deleted, one or two were deleted as copyvios. The other forty or so sailed right in. Conversely, of the 19 nominated for VfD, about ten were actually deleted, suggesting that these were not frivolous nominations. In point of fact, it is quite easy to get a school article into VfD; it just has to be a half-decent article that gives a glimmering of a reason why the school should be included. Produce an alumnus who invented Murphy's Oil Soap and an Olympic gold medalist and your article will be quite safe. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:07, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Dr Zen, he's saying 19 since November were placed on VfD in total out of 65 school articles. Of those only 19 VfD votes, only 10 resulted in deletion. Considering that there seem be a number of automatic "Keep" votes for any school, that it requires two-thirds voting the same way to be considered consensus, and that "Merge" and "Redirect" votes muddy the waters, those 10 were probably very stubby articles about very non-notable schools. I'm surpised actually that so many as half of the VfD's resulted in deletion. My impression recently is that it is basically impossible to get a high-school article deleted. And this vote is about to extend the precedent to middle schools. So Dr Zen, unfortunately, your view that every one of hundreds of thousands of schools on Earth is notable and should be in the Wikipedia seems to be prevailing. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:25, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree with Ld and Tuf-Kat. Interesting (but sadly so) and useful list...horrendous title. Maybe merge this to the main article? - Lucky 6.9 00:09, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: already remerged into main article. There's a bit of tussle between the people who want to keep all the earthquake info on one page until the situation stabilizes in a few days, and those who can't stand the fact that its above 32kb and are cutting sections out and pasting them on new pages (or just blanking the end of the article). <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a> 01:11, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>off-topic question, sorry: are they 'blanking' it because their browsers can't cope with edit boxes that big? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:49, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete. Or merge/redir back in. First, the 32K "limit" is somewhat archaic and arbitrary--I test software for a living, have current versions of all common browsers, and they don't have a problem at 32K--older versions, such as Netscape 4 look like crap, let alone editing. And _if_ something must be split off, there's got to be a way to do so under a cleaner title, such as moving the discussion of the tsunami effects to a separate article from the earthquake itself. Looking at the talk page, only one user wants this division under discussion, and all others think it is not the way to go. Make sure sections are under 32k, put a 'fake' edit link on the first section if necessary, or whatever, but splitting this particular chunk off to meet the 32K 'desired' limit seems ill-advised. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 12:59, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>: Doesn't need to be its own article. There are only about 200 countries on the planet, so even if 190 of them lost citizens beyond those directly affect, it won't take up too much space to list them. Plus until the Tsumani/Earthquake is no longer a current event, this type of information should be in one place otherwise we'll end up with duplication. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:57, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, after perhaps merging some of the information to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>. Usenet is notable. One of the notable things about it is the number of petty squabbles. Particular squabbles aren't likely to be individually notable. If this is one of the more long-lived and far-reaching squabbles on Usenet, the most it merits is a mention in the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> article. Apparently, Usenet just continued, as did the lives of those involved. Just a bunch of kids typing away at night. Nobody got arrested; nobody got kicked out of school. Nothing actually happened except a bunch of narcissists got some attention, mostly from each other. While it isn't the main reason for my vote, it also occurs to me that Wikipedia doesn't do Usenet, slashdot, etc, any favors when it acts as an enabler for trolls seeking attention and notoriety. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:40, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Notoriety is of course given as a reason for inclusion. It's quite clear that these people have "some measure" of notoriety. Few people who use Usenet don't know who they are, and in particular anyone who is interested in trolls, trolling and the like -- and people are, whehter you approve or not -- is familiar with them.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:56, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete. I'd vote to delete an article on some drunk bar brawl, too, and drunks have better reasons for fighting than these people. That someone would remember enough to write this almost ten years after the fact gives me pause, but not enough. Give it a brief mention on some article about trolling or whatever. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:49, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's interesting, and that's reason enough. Plus, if it has already survived one vfd, then there is no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 11:01, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
