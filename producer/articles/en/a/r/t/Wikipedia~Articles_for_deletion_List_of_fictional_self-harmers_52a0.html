<p>This has no rigorous criteria, lacks references and gives no indication of the type and severity of self-harm. It is classic listcruft: a mish-mash of fictional characters united by some ill-defined trait. It includes magical creatures such as <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobby.html" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> the House Elf and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_%28Buffyverse%29_7116.html" title="Spike (Buffyverse)">Spike</a> from Buffy, who presumably have nothing to do with the <i>medical</i> definition of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Criteria: it is outlined in the parent article, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a>. References: aren't the films, plays, books, etc. themselves references?; Severity and type of self-harm: that can be added yourself if you want, but some characters practice several kinds of self-harm simultaneously, which bloats the list. If you think it's ill-defined, then fix the parent article (<a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a>) instead. Dobby and Spike are there because they fit the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-loathing.html" title="Self-loathing">self-loathing</a> part of the self-harm article (which deals with medical definitions of self-harm). So if they don't fit the definition, I don't know who does. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 16:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian%2C_or_bisexual_figures_in_fiction_and_myth.html" title="List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth">List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth</a> for other examples of "lists of fictional characters meeting certain classification". There seems to be consensus that being fictional is not a reason to delete (much of Wikipedia covers fictional subjects). I don't know what you mean by "mish-mash". <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">Self-harm</a> is in most cases well-defined, at least as much as sexuality. There are borderline cases, but similarly we could quibble about male characters who once kissed a guy, and ask if that makes them gay? Such borderline cases do not detract from characters which clearly are portrayed as gay, or self-harmers. I'm also not sure why a non-human character means the concept of self-harm can't apply? The list could certainly do with references/explanations, similar to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a> - we should make an effort to add these, rather than simply deleting (I note that many of those under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian%2C_or_bisexual_figures_in_fiction_and_myth.html" title="List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth">List of gay, lesbian, or bisexual figures in fiction and myth</a> are also guilty of this). By the way, I would actively argue <i>against</i> trying to classify by people "type and severity of self-harm" - <i>that's</i> where things would start to become very ill-defined. How do you define severity? Should we list how "gay" people are in those other artices? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 17:53, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This is utterly useless and needlessly controversial. The fact that the self-harmaers are fictional makes me want to forget about them as soon as the TV broadcast is over. This is nothing but "self-harmer" boosterism. Sorry, screw your affliction. Go listen to [Nine Inch Nails] and [My Chemical Romance] until you feel like living again, or go ahead and kill yourself. Really we'd be better off without these fucking flakes. They take valuable time from interns and residents who have to sew up their stupid wounds. I myself am sick to death of stitching shut these dumbassses' abdominal cuts. Self-harm is a subject. Fictional self harm is a bunch of bullshit. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> If we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a> we should defintely keep this one. The only distinction is that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a> could run afoul of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. This list won't. The fictional work itself stands as the reference per Buchanan-Hermit. Is <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a> a recognized and diagnosable condition? Yes. Then we can include it. Controversy is not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Comment:</b>How about List of fictional wig wearers or List of fictional drug users? Non-humans are not covered in the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a> article which is being touted as the 'definition'. The list currently contains characters like Agatha Ripp, a one episode character from Nip/Tuck, or 'Person praying to God in first chapter' from <a href="../../../h/e/y/Hey_Nostradamus%21_65f0.html" title="Hey Nostradamus!">Hey Nostradamus!</a>. As well as Dobby (twice), it also includes 'Non-fictional characters from books, television shows and films'. --<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 06:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the "Hey Nostradamus!" addition: Not all characters are named, even the main ones. For example, I <b>think</b> the main character from "Fight Club" was never named directly, and was referred to as "The Narrator"? Besides, the entire Nostradamus book had 3 chapters in total, making the chapters quite long; I don't think there's a better way to explain who the character is without naming him like that. And also, why wouldn't Dobby be named twice? He's in both the book and the film; we can't just simply list one of them, for example, because that'd be regarding the film or the novel superior to the other. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 08:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> We do have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_alcoholics.html" title="List of fictional alcoholics">List of fictional alcoholics</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Or maybe List of fictional characters missing an appendage - but wait, we do have that. The human issue is irrelevant, since this is not List of fictional non-human self-harmers. If you feel we shouldn't cover non-human characters, then take this up in the Talk. There are still plenty of human fictional characters who self-harm, so that's clearly not a reason to delete the article. (One might also ask how <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doop_%28comics%29.html" title="Doop (comics)">Doop (comics)</a> can be considered bisexual! But again, the action there should be to remove him from the list, not delete the entire article.) <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 15:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While elves and vampires are fictional creatures, they are metaphors for human beings. As sentient creatures they could be considered fictional people, and therefore under the list's definition. And to clear up what they do: Dobby beats himself, and Spike claws at his chest in an attempt to remove his soul (leaving bloody gashes). --<a href="../../../o/g/o/User%7EOGoncho_d155.html" title="User:OGoncho">OGoncho</a> 07:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Do alchoholics go on this list? What if someone pushes away loved ones? Are they self-destructing? Self-harming? What about chronic over-eaters? Seriously, much too broad.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">Self-harm</a>, according its article, "is deliberate injury inflicted by a person upon his or her own body".

<li><b>Delete</b>. Much too broad, also borderline <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or even <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation as comments above suggest the list was created based upon the creator's interpretations of whether a fictional characters' actions constitute self-harm ... and anyone who has studied literature will tell you characters' motives are not always cut-and-dried. This is beside the point, but the term "self-harm" sounds a bit too much like "self-abuse" and might be misinterpreted. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> How it is POV? I do somewhat agree that the biggest problem with this is knowing whether the motivations would be what is usually considered <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a> (there is a similar issue with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-harmers.html" title="List of self-harmers">List of self-harmers</a>, but there we can go by what the person themselves have said); having said that, this is also an issue with many of the others in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_fictional_characters_by_medical_condition_dd6c.html" title="Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition">Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition</a> and elsewhere (e.g., List of fictional characters with phobias). Also it could be said that there's less reason to worry about borderline cases on a fictional list - the problem with labelling someone as bi/gay/a self-harmer when they don't consider themselves that is that it's bad for that person, and potentially libellous, but obviously this doesn't apply to fictional characters!</li>
<li>By the way, I would be happy to trim down the list to get rid of any borderline cases; there are still plenty of cases where there has been a clear intent to portray a self-harmer (the book Drawing Blood, or the film Secretary).</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">Self-harm</a> is defined and explained in its article, so I don't see why that should be a problem. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 15:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Doby and the like are considered to be self harmers on self harm support forums so I do not see the problem with including mythical characters.
