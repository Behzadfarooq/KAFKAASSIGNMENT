<li><b>Keep</b>. This is actually my project and I'm stunned (and thrilled) to see it on Wikipedia. Just so you understand, this is not your normal MMORPG build. This is an experiment in a sustainable virtual government which has it's own constitution. We're currently moving on to the second phase and I'd love to rewrite the page to reflect the true depth of the project, post our novel constitution, and share some details on the governmental structure. I feel it's not a vanity page rather a potential reference for a unique and notable virtual governmental experiment. --Ulrika 08:51, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I thought I'd add some more information. It appears that this description has been copied from the <a href="http://history.secondserver.net/" class="external text" title="http://history.secondserver.net/" rel="nofollow">Second Life History wiki</a>, a wiki created to record the development of the Second Life society. When we created our government, we drew very heavily on Wikipedia for references, utilizing a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democracy_235d.html" title="Social Democracy">Social Democracy</a> for our <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_government.html" title="Mixed government">Mixed_government</a> which combines a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">Democracy</a>, a <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meritocracy.html" title="Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>, and an <a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergatocracy.html" title="Ergatocracy">Ergatocracy</a>. Seats in our representative body are assigned using a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borda_count.html" title="Borda count">Borda Count</a> from scores generated from a unique ranked vote.

It stands in contrast to LDS lay-clergy, who have their own unrelated employment and work in the priesthood as part of their role in life. More of <i>this</i> should be mentioned in this article. It's not merely a criticism—it's a theology as well. You see, in LDS belief, the love of money is considered evil, and to tie religious work with monetary income is perceived a conflict of interest. There are other kinds of uses of religious money, such as tithing (which applies to 10% of everyone's income across the board), as well as fundraising and such. But it's not considered appropriate to pay someone a wage or salary for religious work. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 09:24, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do not believe it should be redirected to swinging, since swinging involves <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a> and other various sexual practices. The main goal at swinging parties is to engage in sexual activities with other couples, mainly intended for adults.

<li>As the author of the page, my defense is that I wish to get some sense of the global impact of Jesuit Education, as possibly one of the most succesful education networks in the world. One way of doing that is to develop a comprehensive list of Jesuit alumni or students. Wikipedia seems perfect for this as it opens this list for contributions from areas of the world where this information is difficult to encounter, eg Egypt, middle East, Russia, Japan, etc..... SO clearlt my vote is to keep it... Hope that convinces you! Timsj 11:30, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but only if renamed. A major movement like Jesuits would deserve a page on famous members - but this page title implies that anyone who graduated as a Jesuit could be listed there, which is unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:41, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A point of clarification... there is a already a page on the Jesuits which incorporates a list of famous Jesuits and link to pages about them. This is not a page of people who have graduated as Jesuits, but of famous and influential students who have graduated from educational institutions founded and run by the JEsuits. There is a a section on Jesuit Education in the original page on the Jesuits and this page is a link from it. I have changed the title as suggested to avoid this ambiguity. Timsj 14:17, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this is kept, I believe to something like List of famous Jesuits alumni would be a more suitable name. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 13:30, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and rename (I suggest <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_alumni_of_Jesuit_educational_institutions_1863.html" title="List of alumni of Jesuit educational institutions">List of alumni of Jesuit educational institutions</a>). <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 22:10, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I moved it as per suggestion and then spotted that it says in the blurb that articles shouldn't be moved during discussion. Oh well, it's not a list of "freedom fighters" moved to "terrorists" or the like, and it can always be moved again if the new name is intensely unpopular. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 13:26, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (especially under the new name, which is clearer.) If there is insufficent support to keep it, at the very least, it should be merged into the main article on the Jesuits. It's an interesting and noteworthy demonstration of the influence of the Jesuit movement on the world. Note that it could be made even more keep-worthy if it contained information on the Jesuit educational philosophy, or quotes from members of the list on how their Jesuit education influenced them. (Note that I'm not proposing that the author engage in personal speculation as to the influence of a Jesuit education--that would be original research.) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobw_974e.html" title="User:Jacobw">Jacobw</a> 15:29, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotamus_Defence_a32b.html" title="Hippopotamus Defence">Hippopotamus Defence</a> should be deleted because the article is technically inaccurate. The page can't be repaired because Hippopotamus Defense is not a well defined term in the chess literature.</p>
<p>The opening given in the article is not commonly called the hippo. (There appears to be only one fringe website that claims this move sequence is called the hippo.) Most commonly hippo is used in the sense of the Hippopotamus System, which is a Black hedgehog formation featuring a double fianchetto. Unlike precisely defined openings like the <a href="../../../r/u/y/Ruy_Lopez_6f76.html" title="Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a>, the Hippopotamus System is a type of postion, not a specific move sequence or even a specific position. A Hippopotamus System page could be added, but no content from the existing page is useful for this purpose. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 06:17, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Quale put the vfd tag on this article, but it seems that he did not submit it to the vfd-page, so I have done it. If the problem merely is that the article has the wrong name, <b>move</b> to the correct name (unknown to me) is perhaps the best measure. I would like to add however that this opening is <i>very</i> rarely played, even in amateur tournaments, so I will leave you to decide on the notability of this opening.

<li>Most of those references are links to the single Bogon page or copies of wikipedia. Others don't give enough info to tell what opening moves they are referring to so are no help, and others still give opening moves different and not related to the Bogon/wikipedia version. The only somewhat authorative sites are <a href="http://www.chessopolis.com/ecolong.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessopolis.com/ecolong.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> or copies derived from the same source material (apparently an openings list from gnuchess). Still, I've reconsidered a bit. This opening isn't notable enough to deserve an entry of its own (note that the article doesn't have anything to actually say about the opening itself), and I agree with Sjakkalle that we don't want it on the main <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">chess opening</a> page. The main page is primarily devoted to general opening strategy and popular openings and is already medium-long, and needs more material added to cover the history of the evolution of opening theory. Instead, perhaps <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippopotamus_Defence_a32b.html" title="Hippopotamus Defence">Hippopotamus Defence</a> could be made to redirect to a new B00 Openings page similar to the way that <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amar_Opening_88ee.html" title="Amar Opening">Amar Opening</a> and others redirect to <a href="../../../a/0/0/A00.html" title="A00">A00</a>. Or perhaps there should be a single Irregular Chess Openings page that could include <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_openings.html" title="Chess openings">ECO</a> codes A00, B00, C00, D00 and E00. Looking just at the B00 section, we have Hippopotamus defence, Corn stalk defence, Lemming defence, Fred, Barnes defence, Fried fox defence, Carr's defence, Reversed Grob (Borg/Basman defence/macho Grob), St. George (Baker) defence, Owen defence, Guatemala defence, Colorado counter, and Neo-Mongoloid defence. Of these, really only the St. George is notable (GM Tony Miles used it to defeat then-World Champion Karpov). But the names are cute, and it probably wouldn't hurt to have them as redirects to a single page. In addition to the redirects from these opening names to a new Irregular Chess Openings page, the existing <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">chess opening</a> page could link to it and I could pare down the list of openings there. How does that sound? --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 01:37, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well C00, D00 and E00 are not really "irregular" and the most common B00 is the <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimzowitsch_Defense_3f07.html" title="Nimzowitsch Defense">Nimzowitsch Defense</a>, which is reasonably regular and respectable if somewhat uncommon. If we merge this anywhere I think merging it to <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregular_chess_openings.html" title="Irregular chess openings">Irregular chess openings</a> is a better option. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:27, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Have you noticed that irregular openings have a phletora of names attached to them? I made an article on the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunst_Opening_520d.html" title="Dunst Opening">Dunst Opening</a> today and have already discovered <i>three</i> alternate names. Compare that to the popular <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_Defence_953a.html" title="Sicilian Defence">Sicilian Defence</a> which only has <i>no</i> alternate names. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 10:30, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Reading through the discussion thread, many of the comments refer not to the article but to the nomination. Those comments which to address the content are about evenly split but still seem to be to be tainted by the controversy of the nomination. I am going to call this a "no concensus" defaulting to keep but without prejudice against a renomination.</p>

<p>Pyoro is a simple, rather unremarkable bonus mini-game in Wario Ware, a title which <i>itself</i> consists of micro-games. This is the starring "character"'s sole appearance so far. While I have no objection to this entry's information being <b>merged</b> to the main game's <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wario_Ware%2C_Inc._Mega_Microgame%24_3d83.html" title="Wario Ware, Inc.

<li>Actually I used to think of fancruft as "stuff made up by fans", which should be deleted, but Vfders apply it to pretty much everything so I adopted their vocabulary. I will add that I think the question of whether or not something should "have its own article" is of interest only to editors/users of that particular subject and to random page users and thus should not be a big priority for wikipedians in general. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:11, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Reading through the discussion thread, many of the comments refer not to the article but to the way the nomination was made.

<li>And we too, as we know not the nature and qualities of virtue, must ask, whether virtue is or is not taught, under a hypothesis: as thus, if virtue is of such a class of mental goods, will it be taught or not? Let the first hypothesis be that virtue is or is not knowledge,--in that case will it be taught or not? or, as we were just now saying, 'remembered'? For there is no use in disputing about the name.

I don't really have a stake in what happens to it, but for informational purposes, it should be noted that I didn't create it, and I don't maintain it.

<li><b>Delete</b>, You know, on second thought, I'd vote to delete. It's got all that trolly stuff about $70,000 and tax fraud in there, which is nonsense. Dropping it would make Wikipedia a more accurate place. Kuro5hin 01:31, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've spoken to Rusty several times and never detected vanity in his nature. I'm slightly less confident, but only slightly, that he's encyclopedically notable.

<p>Why exactly are there other listings commercial listings? i.e. goto the los angeles home page and their are several businesses listed there. I'm sorry I didn't really believe that I was spamming or doing anything that was of a questionable nature. Only adding a listing that didn't exisit yet. Here are a several examples that are already in the wiki to support what I mean.</p>

<li>I thought I recalled a similar VfD a while ago and a suggestion was made to merge into some sort of page of unusual names. If one exists then <b>merge and redirect</b> there. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:21, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sigh...Kappa, with all due respect, the person who listed this for deletion is up for an RfC for possible abuse of the VfD process as a sort of Socrates or even that Mike Myers character. "Discuss amongst yourselves." I remember this case. Weird story and not without its humorous overtones. You're right that odds are good that no one could even spell this correctly and therefore look this up. BUT it's in the unusual articles page which makes it highly visible. No change of vote. Back to Wikivacationing. - Lucky 6.9 03:10, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
