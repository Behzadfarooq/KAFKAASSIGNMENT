<p><b>When Process Goes Bad.</b> I originally tagged this as a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} after noticing that some of the article content (which I have since removed) was intentionally misleading in an attempt to give the subject some desperately needed notability oomph. Fifteen minutes later, an admin came along and turned it into a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} with the single-word rationale "notability". After more than five days had passed, and no admin had taken action, a regular editor came along, pulled the prod tag, and decided to <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumbaya.html" title="Kumbaya">initiate a merger discussion</a> where, unsurprisingly, there has been exactly zero discussion. On top of all this, I just discovered a few minutes ago that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jill_Pike_0076.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jill Pike">the article's a G4 recreation of deleted content</a> in the first place!! So, obviously, I think it needs to come here for a full AfD. My&#160;!vote is to <b>delete and salt the page</b>. Subject's only assertion of notability is as third mike on a little-known radio talk show; the rest of the article (what little there is) is unsubstantiated fan cruft and a photo. If anyone wishes to move this material over to the radio show's article, that's fine, but as we know, a "merge" consensus = a "do nothing" consensus, so I say full delete. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

While accepting that process may have gone bad here, I wonder why being a radio personality on <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_America_Radio_2609.html" title="Air America Radio">Air America Radio</a> is not considered sufficiently notable to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In addition, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Mankiewicz_623b.html" title="Ben Mankiewicz">Ben Mankiewicz</a> should definitely not be added onto this AfD, as he is one of the programming hosts for <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Classic_Movies_cc46.html" title="Turner Classic Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a>, a notable network with very few programming hosts. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 18:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is purely about Pike; being third mike isn't notable in and of itself. I should, however, note that their show has only been on Air America for about three weeks now, while the Pike article has existed since at least June 2005. In any case, being an Air America personality does not confer one with inherent notability, because Air America is not a radio network in the same way that, say, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> is a television network; while almost all NBC affiliates carry the entire NBC schedule, very few AAR affiliates carry the entire AAR lineup. And while <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morning_drive.html" title="Morning drive">morning drive</a> is generally considered the "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a>" of radio, it's a death slot for a politically-oriented show like this one. It's entirely possible they had more listeners when they were on <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius</a>. I can't imagine why they jumped to AAR in the first place, unless it was about money. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 19:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
