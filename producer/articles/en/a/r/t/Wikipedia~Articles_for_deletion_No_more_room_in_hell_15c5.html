<li>Hey, Morgan, I dont mean to be rude, but what does how active a user is matter into anything? Just because I'm not all that active doesn't mean I dont figure into the discussion at hand. Same with StukaAce and MindlessDrone, just because they don't spend all their time on Wikipedia doesn't mean their voices don't matter.--<a href="../../../i/u/2/User%7EIU2002_8174.html" title="User:IU2002">IU2002</a> 00:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't blame me, it's just that Wikipedians tend to be more suspicious of less-active-in-main-namespace users and especially users seemingly created solely to contribute to an AfD. You seem to be less suspicious than the rest, especially MindlessDrone. (Our name for "mindless drones" on Wikipedia is <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>.

<ul>
<li>A simple look at the forums will show how notable this modification truly is. Neotokyo is just another mod, there is nothing "official" about a modification unless it is purchased by the makers of the actual game. Just because a mod has a slick finish doesn't mean it is "official." --StukaAce 00:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm still not listing it for deletion because it's an article of much better quality than either of the other two. Others may disagree. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 00:58, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><strike>I am leaving this debate in the hands of others. I'm done.</strike> I voted neutral. I know it looks like I'm opposing the article, but I just saw how similar the three keep votes from you, Drone, and IU2002 were and it set off my sockometer. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 01:54, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's alright Morgan, I understand the position you're coming from. You were just trying to kill off would-be abusers of wikipedia and its assetts. I would do the same if it happened on our forum. --MindlessDrone 02:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>

<li>Iron Grip's AfD was actually no consensus, and most keep votes actually wanted to merge it with a list of Half-Life 2 mods. Per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, only claims to notability are PC Gamer ref (whether or not it's "trivial" is questionable) and player numbers for a game that's not out yet (forum numbers are worth considering, but what are the standards for a mod?). I get the impression that WP:SOFTWARE does not include reputation in the HL2 mod community. <b>Very very weak delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 03:00, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should stop trusting impressions and actually become a member of the community. How can a person from outside the HL2 news feed possibly understand how popular or not a mod is, and pass judgement properly? I don't know how many mods can claim over 100,000 posts over a period of three years, many mods cannot even claim to have lasted three years. No More Room in Hell is the first of many HL2 zombie modifications, has been published in a noted gaming magazine, and needs to be treated with the respect it deserves. --StukaAce 03:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the only sources I consulted for the above ref were the image you linked to (I can't imagine it would have gone much, or any, longer than what was in the image) and WP:SOFTWARE. Second, so far the only person defending this article that hasn't started posting in the past day is IU2002. You seem to be conferring a lot of notability on a mod that hasn't even been released yet. I did not claim that this was not unpopular, only that I didn't know how popular it had to be and that I didn't know if certain standards of popularity mattered at all. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 03:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - While it is policy to treat with newcomes with respect (as all editors here have), more weight is traditionally given to arguments from editors who are more <i>experienced</i>.

<li><i>"The outcome of AfD nominations are primarily determined by the quality of arguments for or against deletion; the process is immune to ballot-stuffing or sockpuppetry."</i> The notice at the top says this is not a vote and it does not matter how many people vote for keep or delete- it matters more about the quality of arguments on both sides.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoob_cannon_lol_5f36.html" title="User:Noob cannon lol">Noob cannon lol</a> 15:43, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Exactly. However, the quality and opinions expressed by experienced users tend to be given more credibility.

<li>By what you say, it seems it's obviously not judged by a hardcoded policy, just by people who have been around wikipedia longer then the newcomer has. I understand what you're thinking and that it's human nature to assume that those more experienced are more credible then those that are new, but it is conflicting to have a policy saying to treat all newcomers with respect and to consider their ideas while the members of wikipedia judge more on the basis of join date or edit count.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoob_cannon_lol_5f36.html" title="User:Noob cannon lol">Noob cannon lol</a> 16:05, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<b>Comment'</b> As per Xiliquem on the AFD:NeoTokyo debate, just because something is unknown outside of its core following (in this case, players who are into modifications of already existing games) does not mean that the subject should be non-notable, as editors are going to have different tastes, and would consider different pages Non-Notable and worthy of an AFD. As someone who has spent sometime covering the gaming modification scene off and on for the past almost two years now, the modification scene is getting to a point where the makers of the mods are quickly becoming the next generation of game designers, and the modifications only differ with actual games on a price point and the fact that unlike most retail titles, the mods work on an almost beta testing status once they go public. Is the subject non-notable to me? Not by a longshot. Is it non-notable to the nominator? Yes, ,but in my opinoun there may be some articles on some topics that I would find non-notable that likewise appeal towards the taste of the nominator of this AfD. Is it non-notable to others? Well, that depends on one's taste. The facts have been established that the subject has been featured at least once in PC Gamer, which is one of, if not THE, top magazines in the United States covering the PC Gaming industry and I would consider a respected technical magazine on the issue, thusly in this editors' eyes satisfying WP:Software, as well as anywhere from 14,200 to over 20,000 Google hits depending on the search terms, which in my eyes passes the Google test. Furthermore, even IF the subject truly is non-notable, its not like the subject is taking up valuable space on Wikipedia, its not going to harm a darn thing if heavenforbid a page with information on an unreleased modification was allowed to stand, just like its not going to hurt for some other page pertaining towards a niche audience to remain standing. --<a href="../../../i/u/2/User%7EIU2002_8174.html" title="User:IU2002">IU2002</a> 05:01, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, but it's a fan-made mod. I would say that only mods that are commercially-released could be said to automatically attain notability by their release. Fan-made mods need to <i>earn</i> their notability, otherwise the place would be clogged up with every single one ever made. Since this mod hasn't even been released, and that there therefore exists nothing to tell us how many people have downloaded/played it, how can it assert notability? Come back if it becomes an insanely popular mod... but at the moment the article verges on both advertising and crystal ballism. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 08:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I visit many forums and hang out with nerds of all shapes and sizes, and this is the first time I've ever seen the term "sock puppet" used in that way. It seems to be exclusive to Wikipedia and yet, for some strange reason, it has it's own page. What's so "notable" about an inside joke? For that matter, why is there a page about Ugoff from the Burger King commercials? Three years from now no one will remember him, nor will they care. You all seem to be under the impression that this is a legitimate encyclopedia, when the reality is that it's a haven for external links and disposable pop culture references. I guess the reason we're all new is because we didn't feel passionate enough about a subject to edit it. Are we all supposed to correct 50 minor grammatical errors to be accepted into your elitist encyclopedia society? What a joke. Ouij 09:17, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

The <i>NMRIH</i> project exists and is verified by at least one external source. This voids the claim of not being <i>notable</i>. Wikipedia articles are not legitimated by hitting a made up number of people knowing about the subject of the article, as this would be against the idea of having a wikipedia. Also popularity of the subject is not a concern, either, otherwise articles like ["<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide</a>"] would have to be deleted due to being "unpopular" and "politically incorrect". The accusation of advertisement is not applicable for wikipedia entries in general, as wikipedia articles require the user to actually inquire about the subject. The only way to use an article as advertisement is to bias it in favor of the subject and then link to it externally. Being a freely available product instead of a commercial one does not make a subject inferior to others and does not prevent it to have it's own wikipedia article. The only difference of information value presented in this article caused by an release would be to change it from "has been attempted" to "has been done", the innovation value would be very similar. My main issue with this article is the estimated release date, as that is speculation, although it is not enough to justify a deletion of the whole article and may be considered custom for modifications in general. IMO the page is well structured and rather unbiased and anyone looking for informations about game modifications will find suitable information about the project. I'd like to see similar information on other modifications in their respective articles, as I doubt that this would cause damage to wikipedia's structure or credibility. -- Anapher 11:00, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a webpage hosting company. If the modmakers want a place to host information about their mod, there is a place called the 'internet' they can use. Also, there is never any guarantee of a mod ever being released, so this mod could simply drop off the face of the earth. If the mod is actually -released-, then perhaps it might be notable enough for Wikipedia, but unless someone on the mod team is famous, definitely delete this article.

<p>This modification is eminent in the modding community, never dropping below fifth on the top 100 half life 2 mods list on moddb. There have also been two magazine articles that found the mod to be worthy of notice. If you have a problem with the mod being free and not a commercial production, then maybe you can understand that it was included in publications that are sold commercially. This mod is very prominent even without being released, which is saying something don't you think? The fact that NMRIH can attain so much publicity and support without even being released yet shows how notable the soon to be released game is. I don't know why people have it out for this article, but there are literally thousands of other articles that are less notable than this. -Bizarro1</p>

<li>You should also read it more clearly. Deletion debates are not limited to established Wikipedia editors. The conclusion of the debate is reached by the consensus of a whole determined by the administrator. The consensus depends on the quality of arguments no matter the edit count or join date, not how many people vote for keep/delete. Point me to the policy that says that the argument brought by an experienced editor should always be considered more highly than someone who has contributed much less. Don't give me any of that "tend to" crap.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sure, go ahead and delete this Wiki, but if you do, how about we delete every wiki that has been made to cover a movie, a book, a mod, or any thing else that has work put into it and is not yet released. And if your are so hellbent on deleting things that you "don't cover", why don't we go ahead and delete EVERY wiki just to keep everyone happy? .

<li><b>Keep</b> First off, yes, I'm from the forum, same name. I'm currently not very active in the forum, and instead stay in the IRC channel for the mod. Also, I've only made a few minor edits to Wikipedia outside this article. That shouldn't matter, really, and I'm getting it out of the way first. I'll try to repeat as little as possible, but this modification has achieved notability in a Subscription Magazine distributed to a very large audience, and is one of the top Half-Life 2 mods on Mod DB. At the time of this comment it is #3 on the list, with more "Unique Hits Total" (14,818) than even <a href="../../../g/m/o/Gmod.html" title="Gmod">Gmod</a>. That's almost 15,000 unique hits from a single webpage. It has been interviewed by an internet radio station and featured in a magazine, <i>for being notable</i>. It is respected and lauded by those both within and out of the internet community of zombie modifications and Half-Life 2 modifications in general. I vote keep for this article because many of the arguments against are biased or irrelevant due to the circumstance in that this mod is due to release soon, anyhow. The prediction that is being termed under Crystal Ball is a statement by the team mebers themselves. Though the general lack of media as opposed to other modifications may seem to work against my point, the team has been incredibly tight-lipped about the modification, hiding the overwhelming majority of their work from the public. Taking the released media as a sign of the mod in general would be like looking at a drop of rain and claiming that there is no such thing as a flood. As for my statement that the arguments against this page are biased, other mods mentioned earlier in this discussion were only paid attention to during this discussion. They were allowed to sit unviewed until brought up as 'evidence', and only then were they properly brought to debate. It seems that too many of those voting Delete are skipping over the discussion and going straight for the kill, as that is what seems to be the opinion of the other Wikipedia regulars. This argument is undoubtedly biased on both sides, but there are valid arguments within that bias. The only way that this article could serve as an advertisement is if it was featured on the main page, and even then I use the term advertisement very lightly. The intention of this article is to inform those who wish to be informed, the same as Wikipedia itself. --RelicLord 01:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

It seems that you are trying to belittle the opinions of those against you by bringing up background information. You have not told the background of those who say Delete, only those who say Keep. We are all stating opinions and facts to support our respective sides on the issue. I would appreciate it if the debate could be taken at value, and above a personal level. Are my words denounced by the sole fact that I am writing them? What person, only knowing of me through this page, can properly judge me? Categorizing me only through an opinion is prejudice, and nothing more. --RelicLord 20:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I just briefly had a look over this discussion after just being informed of its existance only minutes ago. I am the project manager for No More Room in Hell. Theres just a few points I would like to make in defense of keeping this article on wikipedia. First off, this project is very notable having been mentioned in PC Gamer (US) and PC Format (UK). Both magazines are highly respected in the field of PC Gaming and mod development news. Another reason, as mentioned before, is that this project is usually in the top 5 of the ModDB Top 100 mods. We have a highly dedicated fanbase as well as a thriving community. What would be the point of deleting this wiki entry? Does this entry harm anyone? Does it hurt anything? No, it doesn't. As for the arguement about it being advertising, that is rediculous. In order to find this you would have to actually search for it (to the best of my knowledge). This entry to me seems completely legitimate and should be kept. Thanks. --Cs42886

<li><b>Comment</b> (Because I always stick my nose in). Out of curiosity, what is everyone's beef with just deleting it, and then recreating it upon a successful release? With everyone seeming to expect an imminent release, it's not like you'll have to wait long. Minimum effort, minimum fuss - everyone's happy. Unless, of course, you don't think it'll be successful. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngry_Lawyer_b02e.html" title="User:Angry Lawyer">Angry Lawyer</a> 11:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> People search Wikipedia for information. If someone wants quick information, they usually consult Wikipedia. The article exists to inform others of the mods existence, and can be updated with newer information quicker then a normal webpage, as the webmaster may be on break or something similar.--StukaAce 13:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia is not supposed to be free web-hosting; all that publicly exists of the mod so far are screenshots and other media, some text and a promise that something playable will get released one day; also, if the mod creators have a website that's difficult to update, then that's their problem. And they shouldn't really be significantly editing a Wikipedia article about themselves, anyhow. --<a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHiddenInPlainSight_7a9d.html" title="User:HiddenInPlainSight">HiddenInPlainSight</a> 16:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Only editing of the article done by developers was removing redunancy under developers. The rest of editing has been done by forum moderators and fans, most of whom (if not all) do not have proper access to the website in order to update it.--<a href="../../../i/u/2/User%7EIU2002_8174.html" title="User:IU2002">IU2002</a> 18:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No other mod in PC Gamer screenshot has an article. Therefore using it to establish notability is questionable. I have already stated that whether it is not a <i>trivial</i> mention, per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, is something that could be debated, and that is the main claim to notability for this article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 19:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
