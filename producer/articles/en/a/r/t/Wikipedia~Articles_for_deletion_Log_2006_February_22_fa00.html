<p>This is an unsourced textdump, which could very likely be copyvio. This is the only article edit of the user who uploaded it. Therefore, it's unlikely to be research but simply a copy-paste job. Regardless, it's in an incorrect namespace (should be: Nuclear weapons timeline), and it essentially duplicates the purpose of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_nuclear_weapons.html" title="History of nuclear weapons">History of nuclear weapons</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: No evidence of a copyvio: some users prefer to work in a word processor before creating articles. An incorrect title is also not a reason for deletion: simple move the page to the correct title. We also frequently have separate articles for [[History of X]] and [[Timeline of X]]. That having been said, this aritcle does not appear to be an actual timeline. However, I would vote keep on an actual timeline of the history of nuclear weapons as a subarticle of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_nuclear_weapons.html" title="History of nuclear weapons">History of nuclear weapons</a>. This article does appear to contain a lot of the appropriate dates. Perhaps its just needs cleanup. No vote at this time, though. Just pointing out that the reasons given for deletion aren't that compelling. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 02:44, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right. Perhaps I was a bit hasty. I didn't think the author was likely to respond, as they only made one real edit ever, and that was several months ago. I figured the account was abandoned, but I should have checked. BTW, I moved your welcome and inquiry to the user's talk page, where they'll get a proper talk page notice.âthames 14:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

While the article is interesting, it does not look like a professionally written article to me and so I don't know what the source of copyvio would be.

<li>I'm not trying to be argumentative, but based upon what? If you give a clear indication of what your argument in based upon, then someone else who comes along may be swayed by your reasoning. The difference between "D - NN" and "K - N" is subtle, but the former depends upon facts already in evidence while the latter depends upon... well, we don't know what yet.

<li>Hello! Apathy is my comic and I'd like to say exactly three things. 1. I didn't put this entry up. That must say something. 2. Since this article was considered for deletion my hits from Wikipedia have increased. Thankyou. 3. You might want to look more carefully at the wordings of your policies. The dream of "[building] a comprehensive and detailed guide to webcomics on Wikipedia" is somewhat at odds with the notability guidelines for websites. It might even be worth sticking in stubs for lesser-known webcomics that link to the Comixpedia articles. Just a thought. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewTaylor_bf80.html" title="User:AndrewTaylor">Andrew</a> 12:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC) Additional: Oh, and Hahnchen, your punctuation is appaling. Any good editor will tell you that posessive its has no apostrophe, "no, there are not" should have a comma, and you only put one space after a full stop. I know it's picky but if you want to be considered a good editor these are the sorts of things you should know. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewTaylor_bf80.html" title="User:AndrewTaylor">Andrew</a> 23:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Doesn't Hahnchen have any sort of vocabulary beyond "This webcomic is not notable."? I mean, first he says this about PokÃ©mon X, now this comic. I think we really need to just accept that Hahnchen is unfit to be in any position of power at Wikipedia due to his completely stupid bias against webcomics (don't like them? Don't read them. they aren't harming you with their existance, and neither are these wikipedia pages). I also quote from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Websites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28079761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Websites&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28079761" rel="nofollow">proposed Wikipedia policy</a> about website articles, specifically the part about webcomics. "Unusually large readership. If a webcomic is exceptionally widely read, and this can be verified, it should be included. If this is verified by means of Alexa, it should have a ranking of 100,000 or lower." Now this is either a really stupid mistake on the part of the author, or it's currently proposed that GameCheetz is considered widely read due to it's Alexa ranking below 100,000. So biased idiot Hahnchen aside, get all of your useless policies on the same page. Furthermore, the google search with 100 links brings back the site in question first. Now, if it gave the link to this site, but on the 3rd or 4th page, then I could see the point behind that argument. But it's the first link returned when you google for gamecheetz, so getting 99 other links is really unimportant if you were looking for this site. Guess what, you google it and find it easily. No point in mentioning this google search except to create a false image of unpopularity. mjc0961 13:39, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>No Vote</b> As the creator of the comic, I've been asked by fans to put a few statistics here. As the creator of the comic, I doubt I have much say on the matter of the Wikipedia article's deletion, so I did not put a vote. Sites that link to mine: 231. Average monthly hits: Aprox 1,000,000. Unique IPs per month, range about 7,000 to 14,000, not counting the month it was 31,716 (during which I advertised). The reason for such variation is the dip it took when I ended it for a couple months (I later changed my mind about ending it). These numbers are all statistics straight from my webhost. 24.45.158.238 19:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC) 2:26PM</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. What makes this webcomic different than any others? The amount of hits you get from Google cannot accuratly represent the popularity of the comic. I assure that if you were to type in a search for any other webcomic, a good percentage of those sites will either be fan-made or have no relationship to the comic at all. Also, looking through the categories of webcomics that are listed, a good few of them have not been updated in quite a while and seem to not have a chance of ever being updated, while Gamecheetz is still being updated, and people read it. There's my two cents. 139.55.28.135 23:08, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just so you know, as an anonymous editor, identified only by IP, your vote in these discussions does not count. Anons and new users go through a period known as 'suffrage' whereupon they prove they are committed to the project, by staying on for a certain amount of time and/or edits. As it is now, you are just distracting from the true debate. -<a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> 01:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not <i>quite</i> correct. This isn't a vote, it's a discussion that's composed of two parts: examination fo the facts, and examination of editor's opinions about the facts, with emphasis on the former.
<ul>
<li>Very new or anonymous editors are always welcome to contribute evidence, and ten long-time contributor's recomendation of <i>"delete as not notable"</i> can be blown away by a single IP recomendation of <i>"keep as notable as evidenced by (insert link to new york times article)".</i></li>
<li>It the second half of the debate where very new contributors tends to have less say. Understanding of the complex interactions between the policies and guidelines takes time and experiance. Thus the closing admin will listen more to the <i>opinions</i> expressed by someone with two years and twenty feature articles than to those of someone new.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So please do join in, very new people, but best to do so by providing facts to sway the opinons of long-time contributors. And welcome to Wikipedia!</dd>

<p>I originally nominated this for speedy deletion but the creator of the article laughed at it due to the nomination of several of his articles yesterday for deletion. However, this article should be deleted because it is <i>an empty or very short article providing little or no context</i>. There really is no such thing as <i>Islamic athletics</i>, no specific relationship between <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">athletics</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 00:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like the submission of the possible copyright violation was incomplete - Deiz has to follow the instructions at the top. Additionally, I'm not sure if there is a violation, since the site has a pretty lenient policy: "Permission is granted to all to take material from this site, subject to the following two conditions: (1) Material used must be attributed to www.islam-qa.com , (2) Material must be reproduced faithfully and without alteration or omission." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 10:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I personally have nothing against this article, indeed it's interesting and scores well on the anit-systemic-bias-o-meter. However the copyvio (which is a section of rather than the whole article, I have now listed it at the relevant copyvio problem page) does not reference its source, rather it says "one scholar says..." which is as good as saying "my mate thinks..." or "this bloke down the pub said...". If it is properly referenced per point (1) from Schizombie then it's probably no longer an issue. <b>However</b>, the article still needs lots of work and it would be a credit to those who are spending time blowing hot air defending it on this AfD page if they focussed their efforts on wikifiing the article. For starters a going over by a native English speaker familiar with the topic and au fait with Wikipedia style policies is <b>urgently required</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b></a> 11:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bro, queit it will ya? Why are you so gang ho on deleting? Stop making me answer to all of this, please! You saw it yourself, i expanded Islamic athletics to a full article in no-time, and the same can be with the other articles. As you said YOURSELF: "Islam is considered a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_%28Arabic_term%29_6751.html" title="Din (Arabic term)">dÄ«n</a> (way of life) rather than a simple religion, we could connect Islam with practically any topic".

<p><b>Comment.</b> Someone added additional articles to be proposed for deletion above, after people had already begun expressing opinions (below) on this AfD. I've removed those additions, because it appears to me that adding articles to be deleted after people had already expressed opinions is a very improper abuse of process. The closing admin may wish to review this page carefully to ascertain which votes were cast before, during and after these changes. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 09:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ikkyu2, I think you are over-emphasizing the significance of that move regarding the related articles. You deleted the additional articles which was reasonable. But then to go back four hours later and add another comment regarding the move as well as clarifying your vote (which after your deletion was not ambiguous) is just rubbing it in. I talked to the editors whose votes appeared to be ambiguous or split between the original and related articles and they have all responded. Clearly all of the votes below relate to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_athletics.html" title="Islamic athletics">Islamic athletics</a> as they all clearly refer to the name of this article in some way, were cast before the addition or after the removal of the related articles, or were fixed after contacting the respective editor. To say adding the related articles was a "very improper abuse of process" is a complete exaggeration. Clearly, no harm was done and no careful review of this page is necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 11:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again i become upset at geting articles deleted due to not knowing enough about the subject --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I apologize if I am not educated enough about a topic. When an article sits unattended for two and a half months and when it pertains to something I believe I should have some knowledge of (in this case <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>), I have no choice but to come to the reasonable conclusion that there really is nothing noteworthy about the topic. But Striver, you also should not take offense at a request for deletion. It simply offers a chance to discuss the merit of an article. You, however, seem to be defensive whenever this arises. Given that Islam is considered a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_%28Arabic_term%29_6751.html" title="Din (Arabic term)">dÄ«n</a> (way of life) rather than a simple religion, we could connect Islam with practically any topic. But we don't need an article about Islamic shopping, Islamic space travel, and Islamic web-surfing just because some (trivial) relationship exists between Islam and those respective subjects. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 02:07, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Are athletics studies?</b>. Bro Did you read the fatwa section? Did you read the article i added? Did you read about how athletics got formed in the historical Islamic world?

With regards to the map: Core blue belt counties are those that have voted Democratic three out of the last four elections, and are verifiably trending left. Secondary blue belt counties have voted Democratic in presidential elections when Democrats won (i.e. 1992 and 1996). Accuracy of elections and trend information can be verified at <a href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uselectionatlas.org/</a> The term "Ohio's blue belt" is typically used within Democratic circles, so it would be fair to merge with <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Democratic_Party_faff.html" title="Ohio Democratic Party">Ohio Democratic Party</a>. The term points to the reality of a significant difference in the socio-political climate of northern and eastern Ohio when compared with the state at large. floridahistory 09:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is by all evidence one persistent vandal who keeps blanking it without explaining themselves. Given the subject matter, possibly (but not clearly known to be) connected to the subject of the article. There's nothing apparently wrong with the article (it's critical, but not abusively non neutral point of view). It appears to meet bio standards for living (at least slightly) notable people. An AfD of any sort is the wrong way to deal with this.

<li>This article was orginally prodded without comment, therefore I am moving it here. The article looks pretty good actually. I'm voting <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 02:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>delete</b></s>. The article has only one incoming link, from <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permaculture.html" title="Permaculture">permaculture</a>, the permaculture page originally linked to the two terms <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable.html" title="Sustainable">Sustainable</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitat.html" title="Habitat">habitat</a> individually. Both of those articles are much better and more extensive than this one which dose little more than say it is a habitat which is sustainable. The article was created by the owner of the only web page it links to <a href="http://www.the-shire" class="external text" title="http://www.the-shire" rel="nofollow">The new Shire Institute</a> (the other link is a similar wiki-style entry by the author on another site). There are no (0) google links to this web site, which just consists of a single page. The page could be expanded a lot. But currently it is a case of the whole being much less than the sum of its parts and a clever case of non notable link spam.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've heard the term. This biological concept is very similar to the (very good) <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainable_development.html" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a> article, but just needs a cleanup and some more information. The fact that the one site that is linked by the article is non-notable is not grounds to delete. Googling the term produces 23,700 results, one of which is the <a href="http://www.habitation.gouv.qc.ca/en/savoir_faire/developpement_durable.html" class="external text" title="http://www.habitation.gouv.qc.ca/en/savoir_faire/developpement_durable.html" rel="nofollow">Canadian government</a>. Granted, that link refers to sustainable development, but with a rewrite this article could be a feature someday. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 02:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> On further citation hunting, there seems to be very little (or no) evidence for the classification of some individuals as Anti-Masons - Moody seems to be there because he was an evangelist, but nothing is stated in his wiki article about his position on Masonry at all. According to <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry03.html" class="external text" title="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry03.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, many people apparently think Marx was a Mason. However, as an atheist, Marx would not qualify - this does not, however, make him anti-Masonic, and I have not found any reliable evidence to support that claim. Bordiga seems to be on here because he was a Marxist ("Marx was anti, so is he") - no corroborating info is available. Hitler, Mussolini, JQA, Finney, and 'any' Pope, for that matter, are documentable. Morgan is debatable for many reasons. See his WP article. <a href="http://masonicinfo.com/people.htm" class="external text" title="http://masonicinfo.com/people.htm" rel="nofollow">Masonicinfo</a> has a pretty exhaustive list of historical and contemporary individuals with an anti-Masonic POV ('sans' Popes, however), and other than those mentioned above, the others do not appear on that list at all. Furthermore, there is an insinuation that John Paul I "died mysteriously while trying to purge the Masons from the Vatican", which is simply a conspiracy theory (see the relevant WP articles) that has no place here. So, out of nine entries, five are reliably citable, four are not, and except for JQA (not added yet) and Finney (nn as far as anti-Masonry as a movement goes, it seems), the others appear in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Masonry_654a.html" title="Anti-Masonry">Anti-Masonry</a> article already. So, apart from the subtle POV-pushing, the lack of citation and the incorrect information, what is correct is already covered. Most importantly, almost none of these people were notable 'as' anti-Masons (save Finney, who published his book 48 years after he quit his Lodge). <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 07:29, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This should really be deleted. We've had 13/16 say delete it, 2/16 say merge it, and 1/16 say keep it. 13/16 is a pretty good consensus. Someone should delete this already, unless the Amazing Race discloses the official rules to the public, which they probably won't do anytime soon.

<p>This page has gotten out of sync with the list of characters already on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22.html" title="Catch-22">Catch-22</a>. There are also dozens of separate articles for characters from the book including minor characters. Someone obviously likes the book quite a lot and did a bunch of work on those articles but I think they should be merged. While I understand some books like LOTR have lots of separate articles for their characters, those situations are somewhat special and I don't think Catch-22 is significant enough these days to warrant that unusual treatment. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 04:19, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is also partly a question of what to do with all the separate articles about the minor characters. Merging them to this "list" article is a reasonable option. I don't have the energy to put up separate AfD's for all of them until there's been some discussion. If merging them all is a popular choice then maybe I'll make putting up the AfD's into an exercise in bot programming. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 04:44, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article, and the other two that follow, are about trivial subjects that have no encyclopedic meaning. Given that Islam is considered a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_%28Arabic_term%29_6751.html" title="Din (Arabic term)">dÄ«n</a> (way of life) rather than a simple religion, we could connect Islam with practically any topic.

<p>Islamic comedy is now updated, and no longer a empty stub, as it was when nominated, and all above votes where cast.</p>
<p>In other words, all votes regarding this particular article need to be re-evaluated. However, the article itself needs heavy editing before it can be called a good, or even ok article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 03:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll reconsider on the Islamic comedy article, I'm still not convinced this isn't a neologism; I've never heard Mullah Nasrudin referred to as an Islamic comedian before this article.

<li>Comment. It isn't so much mathematics of the quran, but mathematics of the quran according to a small sect of islam, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Submitters_International_a69f.html" title="United Submitters International">United Submitters International</a>, a break-off sect of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_alone.html#Dissident_Submitters" title="Qur'an alone">Qur'an alone#Dissident Submitters</a> and some individuals who agree with it. The majority of muslims and non-muslims don't see what they see because of inconsistent counts, etc. There might be some counts of nineteen that are accurate, but to most they are not <i>significant.</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 18:00, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The IP edit 202.69.193.66 is my friends and we use the same internet connection as we work in the same office.

<li>If you want it to stay, you should work on it. The second section doesn't follow from the first. What does a count of 24 occurrences of the word Rejul/Man have to do with 19? Why is it significant (should we count how many times "man" is used in every book?). Also, were the arabic words counted, or were the english words counted? A translation might use the word man for more words than just rejul, and might sometimes translate rejul as something other than man. Additionally, the translations sometimes add words that aren't in the arabic because they are somehow implied by the other words, which they'll put in (parenthesis). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 22:50, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Perhaps I could have phrased my question better, because either I'm projecting or you seem to have taken my comment in the wrong way. Unfortunately, I cannot verify for myself. I do not speak Arabic. As far as English translations go I have only read bits and pieces. A quote comes to mind: <i>The heart of the believer is the highest heaven</i>. I cannot remember whether that's from the quran or one of the poems of Hafiz or Rumi. I have read several volumes of English translations of Hafiz and several dozen by Rumi. I find both men's stories fascinating and love the poetry. That is neither here nor there though. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 12:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My Dear Friends can we clean this up please.. I guarantee you all that this article will grow fast with more resourceful references. Have we finished voting? (or does it go on forever? Can you please tell me I am new to wikipedia) my opinion is some of the earlier votes cannot be counted. Because as you can see the article has changed quiet significantly (or completely) since it was voted for deletion. I accept the fact that initially the article did not have any references or proper structure. But now it has changed. So all of you who voted before 26th feb 2006 can you kindly reconsider your votes. (<a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsath_05ad.html" title="User:Arsath">Mystic</a> 03:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC))

<li>All the above counts, people don't have to change them unless they feel changes to the page warrant it. It isn't over until an admin closes it. I think if the page remains it should be renamed. I deleted a disinguous quote that was added suggesting <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Gardner_3269.html" title="Martin Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> was impressed by the claims, which was decidedly untrue; see my talk page for more. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 03:52, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>a comment from a guy who uses wiki to gain knowledge everyday.</p>
<p>dont delete article because its not notable enough, any article infact, as far as pranic healing goes, its not a cult, i have attended a few classes and there is reason in it (thats what i think), i would like to say with as much of a neutral stand point as i can that some of the teachings work in real life, he teaches to make donations, meditate, help people, those are the teachings, as far as the debate on how true scientifically the methods of healing are thats upto the research minds who will draw out a conclusion once they perform exhaustive amount of tests. the teachings are simple rules in life thats my opinion.</p>

<li>Could you point out the parts which you claim are not 'spelt properly', please. By the way, the correct grammatical phrase would be 'not properly spelt'. Brother No. 1 12:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I figured. Perhaps you should know that the sole reason as to why I've never written an article on the English Wikipedia by myself is that... english is not my mother's tongue, and I am quite certain any articles written by me would not be <i>properly spelt</i>. Otherwise, I would obviously correct all these errors. Furthermore; it's missing capitalization at beginning of sentences at least once, and the creator seems to be unable to decide whether to write anarchostalinism or anarcho-stalinism.

<li>Thank you for your admission that you were untruthful about my spelling errors. Brother No. 1 13:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also; I still don't understand why it's called "stalinism". To me, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">stalinism</a> is a marxist-leninistic ideology characterized by extreme oppression from the ruling party - gulags and all that. The article is also implying that marxism-leninism is the same thing as stalinism, which is obviously not true. ("marxism-leninism (often known as stalinism)"). Ah well. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:JobjÃ¶rn">JobjÃ¶rn</a> 12:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your individual opinion on the definition of 'stalinism'. The word 'stalinism' refers to people who deem themselves Marxist-Leninist-Communists. See the online lists of Communist Parties (Marxist-Leninist) for your further educationBrother No. 1 13:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For YOUR further education, you might also browse through the articles about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism-Leninism_8ebb.html" title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>. Then, it will become clear to you that Marxism-Leninism is not often known as Stalinism - such a wording would imply the two are synonyms, and the mere fact that there exists two separate articles for them contradicts this. And I've never even heard the term "Marxist-Leninist-Communists". Would you please point to a source where such a wording is used? Now, regrettably, I must leave you in order to do some proper work.

<li><b>Comment</b>One cannot be a Maoist if one is not a member of a Maoist Communist Party (usually denoted by the title Communist (Marxist-Leninist) Party. Maoism is based in areas with large peasant populations, e.g. India, Nepal, Peru, Bangladesh, China. Anarcho-stalinism is an industrialised, urbanised, non-party variant of Maoism, which only exists in countries where there is no peasantry. I'm not sure whether I am confusing you here, or baffling you, but political theorists will understand anyway. Wikipedia should appeal to specialists and experts as well as laypersons like yourself, in order for it to be truly in-depth and comprehensive. A catch-all 'Maoism' just doesn't work. How do you reconcile anarcho-stalinists belief in industrial and scientific advancement with Maoists' belief in iron-smelting furnaces in every peasant's backyard?Brother No. 1 07:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Abigail's Ghost is actually fairly popular in the underground progressive music scene in Louisiana and has somewhat of a cult following locally.

<li><b>Keep</b>.Incorrectly entered or not, Carmine (Sillyfeetmcgee) has a point. Besides being leaders of the Louisiana art rock scene, acquiring corporate sponsorships after only a few months of forming and getting extensive media coverage, the lineup of Abigail's Ghost includes world's fastest drummer record holder Seth "Bad Boy" Davis on which numerous articles have been published. This band is beyond well on its way to expanding its region of influence.

<li>There was no accusation -- there was a statement of logic.

<li>There's also a chance that there may have been a hint of sarcasm in his reply. Whether or not he's a sockpuppet or not, he did make somewhat of a point. Just do some research of your own and you'll find that deletion of this article is totally unnecessary. I'm making it a point to add more information about underground or obscure artists on Wikipedia and I think that deleting articles on a whim without taking into consideration the valuable knowledge that can be gained (regardless of whether or not the article is properly formatted or cited) is at complete odds with the principles of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seth Davis is a W O R L D R E C O R D H O L D E R. How much more notable does he have to be?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Quality of the music is not an issue. Abigail's Ghost hasn't even recorded a full length studio album.

As for the label being started by people associated with the band, are you aware of how many great musicians/songwriters have started their own label AND released their own music on it successfully? Frank Zappa-Zappa, DiscReet, Barking Pumpkin Steve Vai-Favored Nations Berry Gordy-Motown.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In reference to Flonkus. Of course the quality of their music is an issue! The basis of your argument is based upon not only Seth's but the whole band's notability. [<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/notability" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/notability" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>]. The exceptional quality of their music, whether it be the style of music you enjoy to listen to or not, embraces notoriety.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: In reference to Samir_grover. Samir_grover you are definitely correct. You know very little about drumming and even less about research. Firstly, if you were to look a little deeper in the the worlds fastest drummer web site you would have noticed two names that you had made reference to, right next to Seth Davis'. [<a href="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/wfdchampions.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/wfdchampions.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>]. Thatâs right! Right there in front of your face. Mike "Da Man" Mangini, &amp; Johnny "3 Bomb" Rabb. Not to mention other famous drummers such as Art "The God Father" Verdi, &amp; Tim "Silver Feet" Waterson. Secondly, take a good look at your Guinness book of world records page. [<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>]. If you were to read the headline carefully you would understand that an individual has to challenge Guinness for a record to be recorded.[<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faqs/FAQ_Answer.asp?ID=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faqs/FAQ_Answer.asp?ID=18" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>]. They do not just show up at any given event to record records. Finally, I am extremely tired of doing your research so here is your last site. Why don't you prove that he isnt notable.

<li>mRNA, You've missed the argument. Notability is established if the person has won or placed in a major music competition. As a corollary, a Guinness record for fastest drummer is notable per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The question is whether "World's Fastest Drummer" is a major music competition. If it is, great, Seth Davis should be included. If not, then no, he should not. By saying that <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Mangini_26f8.html" title="Mike Mangini">Mike Mangini</a> had a wikipedia article for "World's Fastest Drummer", I was establishing WFD's notability (i.e. supporting you), despite the absence of a wikipedia article. -- Samir â <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 06:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Valid points and it kind of makes sense to me to merge it with the <a href="../../../u/b/u/Ubuntu_Linux_07a4.html" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu Linux</a> main article. However, I like that way the article is laid out with headings such as Big News, Characteristics, Improvements, etc. If this was merged with the main Ubuntu Linux article would it be possible to retain this information in the concise way its presented here? True that there are no individual articles for releases of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Photoshop_5466.html" title="Adobe Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a> but there are individual articles for each version of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. -Etienne</li>
<li>I agree with monkeyman. <b>Merging</b> this with <a href="../../../u/b/u/Ubuntu_Linux_07a4.html" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu Linux</a> would also make it easier for readers to find the article. Having articles about essentially the same thing scattered around is just difficult for readers.

<li>A yet to be released version of Ubuntu Linux doesn't deserve its own article.

<p>Before anyone thinks I object to the subject matter, I don't. I've put this up because it's not encyclopedic. Some of the information is inaccurate &amp; misleading, e.g. "rach air muin" does not refer specifically to "doggy style". It also uses the very dubious "insultmonger" as a source. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 14:06, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is some potential to cover profanity in various languages if it is culture-specific. However, this article does not reflect the fact that sexual swearwords are not commonly used in Gaidhlig traditionally, and that when they are, you usually hear the English ones, e.g. <i>fuc</i>. Most profanity was, and still is mostly, of a religious nature. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 14:49, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the mistakes and inaccurate data can be fixed. That is the point of an open-source encyclopedia people! Peer review is suppose to improve on the messed up articles over time. Just blanket deleting b/c you think it's more of a dictionary entry is short-sighted as language and words are foundational to culture, which I think is an encyclopedia type of entry?

<li><b>Delete</b>, While this article is one i personally find vaguely interesting ( Gaelic being my native language ) it is not accurate nor really the kind of article which should be found on the English Wiki ( id be quite happy for it to be stuck onto the Scottish gaelic one however ). In modern Gaelic speaking society profanity does not really exist - this is due to the religious history of the society i think - and i had to look back to the poems of the Jacobite era to find any literature containing what might reasonably be termed "cuss words" or obscene insults. You could confront almost any native speaker of the language with the words listed and they most likely wouldnt know what youre going on about. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></li>

<dd>I just noted that you added a page called "Wikinomics" to Wikisource. I should point out that this document reads like something that you yourself wrote, and since there is no information regarding a possible source for it, I'm guessing you did write it. Unfortunately, this type of document isn't covered under Wikisource. I would propose that you export the page to probably Wikipedia, where a document of this kind is accepted. Thank you for your involvement in Wikisource!âZhaladshar (Talk) 19:56, 22 February 2006 (UTC) Retrieved from "<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmccreary" class="external free" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmccreary" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmccreary</a>"</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Right now, it's arguably speedy deletable as the content does little more than restate the title.

<p>Advertising for a small privately held telecommunication firm. Ranked 79th in Inc. Magazine's fastest growing private companies...is that notable?

<dd><b>Answer</b> <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> If you had about $500,000 you could buy a stock car and enter a NASCAR event. He apparently ran in some races that provide monetary winnings, but running in "several races" does not make someone a "professional racecar driver." Couple years ago there was a dentist in Indianapolis who put together enough money to buy a car and enter the Indy 500...that doesn't make him notable enough for a bio in my opinion. Seems to be the same kind of instance here. I'd say he's notable if he competes for a whole season or for a couple seasons. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 01:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>Uh, the dentist <i>won the race</i>, the most notable race in the world, isn't that worth a bio article?</s> Mr. Ferrazano doesn't seem to have won even routine races in Italian F2000. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:18, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The dentist did not win the race. In fact, Jack Miller, the dentist in question started 17th and finished 20th in 1997. He's still a dentist...about 3 miles from where my parents live in Indianapolis. So, look through this list <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indianapolis_500_winners_3341.html" title="List of Indianapolis 500 winners">List of Indianapolis 500 winners</a> and tell me which one of them from the past 30 years that won the race is a dentist in Southeast Indianapolis by day, and an Indy Car driver on the weekends.

<li><b>weak delete</b> usually I want to keep the articles for all professional racers, but this guy has no established notability. In my opinion, Jack Miller would meet notability criteria as the Indy 500 is one of the biggest races in the world and he had a major corporate sponsor (Crest). However, Ferrazano has not participated in any races that are even on the radar on a worldwide scale, let alone won any of them. Also, if you had a $500000 NASCAR you'd embarass yourself in NEXTEL cup and definitely wouldn't qualify.-<a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrdisque_8d32.html" title="User:Drdisque">Drdisque</a> 18:13, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The band was featured on the most recent Tony Hawk video game as listed on the Wiki article for said game, and the new and not yet released album was produced by the current Guns N Roses bassist. The band might not meet the criteria of mainstream music award winnings or billboard charts, but I do believe these things make it very notable. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadangry_e9cc.html" title="User:Madangry">Madangry</a> 01:04, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: Croquet is a research project -- market share &amp; installed base requirements are a bit premature&#160;:) But it is Real Software that works Right Now -- you can download it from opencroquet.org. The folk who work on it tend to favor writing code rather than wiki articles, but it's definitely not Duke Nukem Forever.... or Looking Glass for that matter. It's a 3-D multiuser environment which scales without central servers, and in which every 'object' is programmable. I invite you to try it before dismissing it.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: It is a significant research project that, although in its infancy, is important in enough circles that it deserves an entry. It is not 'vaporware' (you can download it and try it now). Honestly, I was surprised to see it marked for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This is a major project (I've downloaded it - 135MB!) just about to release 1.0. It has been discussed at several conferences (more scheduled) and Alan Kay is closely associated with it. This isn't some tiny, obscure Sourceforge project. Sure, it's in an early stage, but IMHO it's worthy of Wikipedia. Planned capabilities go far beyond LookingGlass and include a full 3D collaborative environment with a physics engine. Being based on SmallTalk, it has possibilities unrealizable with Java. I suggest you review the screenshot presentation on the website. (I disagree with almost every reason that the OP gives for deletion. While proprietary vaporware is not worthy of inclusion, it's a different story for FOSS. The presence of a Wikipedia article may help drive development.)--<a href="../../../k/b/k/User%7EKbk_e3f7.html" title="User:Kbk">Kbk</a> 21:21, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Keep in mind for free software, usually release 1.0 is far more meaningful than for commercial software.

<dd><a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">Wikpedia Deletion policy</a> does not say that anon comments are "ineligble" nor is any tally relevant, because the decision is made by rough consensus, not by a tallying of votes.

<dd>This isn't the way things are done on AfD. The closing admin handles the determination of which comments count towards the final decision. By common practice anon votes are left in place. If you disagree with the practice, you ought to seek to develop a consensus for a change. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion</a> is probably a good place to do that. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 21:25, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do not delete- per the notability defintion 'Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above.'

<li>A track on a minor compilation CD which you have to pay to get on is not really "featured in major music media." Not to mention, the website does not list the artists on the CD, so it cannot even be verified that he is on it. In addition, the contributions with Essra Mohawk are also unverifiable (he doesn't even mention them on his site). What is verifiable (if we treat his site as a reputable source) is that he's putting out a demo in hopes of landing a record deal.

<li><b>Keep</b> you're wrong. If you read the MySpace test page <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_Myspace_test_d025.html" title="User:Stifle/Myspace test">myspace test</a> it says: 'most notable concepts, people, bands, etc. at least own their own domain.' He does own his own domain it's www.alexvera.com. The MySpace rule applies only if MySpace is his ONLY domain, in this case it's an additional domain and not his only one. Madonna has a MySpace page too, www.myspace.com/madonna along with Marcos Hernandez www.myspace.com/marcoshernandez and Gorillaz www.myspace.com/gorillaz. Does this make them ineligible too?

<p>Furthermore let the record show that www.alexvera.com is NOT a new domain name as you mention, per www.godaddy.com it was created on January 16, 2001.

<li>A great argument for an article on soccer supporters groups! A bad argument for an article on a single group with no apparent claim to notability.

<li>So what you are saying is that you aren't opposed to soccer in general (which is the American name for the sport coined by a British student at Oxford in the 1880s and shortened from "Association Football"), but instead to the American involvement in soccer because you are offended by our interest in "your" sport. Well, this attempt at bias shouldn't be tolerated. If you delete MLS supporters groups, you should also erase every listing for a supporters group for every other league in the world.

I could list hundreds of others on Wikipedia if necessary, but I think you get the point. MetroNation is as legitimate an organization as any other listed by Wikipedia; Its members have raised thousands of dollars for Hurricane Katrina relief funds, cancer and multiple sclerosis treatment and the promotion of youth soccer in the United States through the US Soccer Federation's PassBack Program. Since both precedence and Wikipedia's NOT policy both support its continued existence, there is no reason for MetroNation's entry to be deleted.

<li><i>Obviously</i> a supporters group for the MetroStars is going to seem/be somewhat trivial to somebody in the UK (Reading fan?). What is the standard of notability for a suppoter group? --<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EElliskev_d446.html" title="User:Elliskev">Ellis</a><a href="../../../e/l/l/User_talk%7EElliskev_db08.html" title="User talk:Elliskev">kev</a> 18:47, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I'm really surprised that this is even up for deletion. Soccer supporter groups are known throughout the world, MetroNation is one of them, it's new, but so what? I agree with Ellis about systemic bias on this issue.--<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilicz_0b7a.html" title="User:Milicz">Milicz</a> 17:53, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a soccer fan (DC United), but not a supporter's group memeber, I do think that the supporter's groups play a role in soccer culture around the world, and an emerging role in the United States. Consider the article on <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tifo.html" title="Tifo">tifo</a>. Yes, MetroNation is a smaller group right now, but given the somewhat strange history of the Empire Supporter's Club, there is almost enough material for an article there alone. That being said, incorporating supporter's groups content into the club pages seems a reasonable measure until such a time as the amount of unique NPOV content with a utility seperate to that of the team is sufficient to support a unique article. --<a href="../../../z/o/o/User%7EZoomzip_250f.html" title="User:Zoomzip">ZoomZip</a> 18:37, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As a quick addendum, I would be even more comfortable with a vote to Keep if the article were more specific in terms of what MetroNation has done and what recognition it has achieved, in accordance with Wikipedia's long-standing views on notability. I think there's the seeds of material there, but it has not been stated in a way that makes the case easy to make. For instance, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barra_Brava_fb91.html" title="Barra Brava">Barra Brava</a> notes the recognition it received when Christian Gomez joined them in the stands at Giants Stadium. For someone reading an article on that event, which received play in multiple media settings, they might well turn to WP in order to determine what on god's green earth a "Barra Brava" was. The MetroNation article, if it could provide examples of instances in which it was notable or viewable, could then make a case against deletion on notability grounds much easier to make. --<a href="../../../z/o/o/User%7EZoomzip_250f.html" title="User:Zoomzip">ZoomZip</a> 19:18, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
