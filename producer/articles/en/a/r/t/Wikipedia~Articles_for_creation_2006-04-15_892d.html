<p>Ziebel is an innovative group of persons from many cultures working together, finding quick and efficient methods to solve problems or optimize traditional methods. When a good and efficient solution to a problem, or a better optimized result is obtained, it is referred to as a Ziebel: E.g. "We understood that we did not have the good performance that we knew had to be possible, so we did a ziebel.", or "Instead of waiting around for something to happen by itself, we did a ziebel".</p>

<p>Megadeuce</p>
<p>Also Mega-Deuce</p>
<p>A "Megadeuce" is a slang term refering to a piece of freshly excreted human fecal matter that is equivalent or excessive of 20 inches long, or comprised of 5 or more seperate, formidable pieces. Similiarly, it can simply be described as a huge amount of defecation that was ejected in a single sitting.</p>
<p>Example of usage: 1: Man, I wouldn't go in there, I just dropped a MEGADEUCE, and it's peeling the paint off the walls as we speak. 2: Hold up, before I do anything, I gotta take a fatty megadeuce.</p>

<p>Martin-Baker performed in-house studies of aircraft projects beyond that of the M.B.5 fighter of 1945. These were not to any official British specification but rather to test out different ideas concerning both high-speed flight and the development of aircraft escape systems- especially ejection seats. In late 1945 a high-speed interceptor concept was contemplated with the intention of mounting a mammoth 32 cylinder ultimate project Rolls-Royce RR-Guinevere "X-engine" of 4,400 hp driving a 6-blade superprop. The "X-engine" concept was envisioned as four banks of eight cylinders each with twin exhaust ports on either side of the long bullet-shaped forward fuselage. This configuration of engine had already been suggested for a super heavy tank program but ruled out as too exotic with only one quarter of the hp output. Estimated maximum speed for the long nose machine would be well over 550 mph! The aircraft was to be covered in a black aerosheen gloss finish giving the concept aircraft the nickname "Black Bess". Small flight models were made but the concept was abandoned in 1947 with the further development of both British jet aircraft and Rolls-Royce centrifugal jet engines. The "Black Bess" name was attributed not only to the black aerosheen gloss coating for speed and tremendous hp of the engine but due to the fact that the engineers scoffed at the estimates that this aircraft could attain 550 mph in level flight and easily Mach 1 in a "short dive"- which was said to be just as "impossible" as highwayman robber Dick Turpin's "legendary" ride with his horse Black Bess! In almost all of Martin-Baker's historical references both the earlier M.B.6 WW2 jet aircraft project with an odd spring-loaded swing-arm ejection seat and the fantastic M.B.7 concept are omitted because they had little chance of success and were just novelties. Martin-Baker is known for the incredible performance aircraft M.B.5 (Britain's Mustang) and for developing zero/zero ejection seats.</p>

<p>Hi folks, anyone here who is able and willing to add some stuff or start the English version? The Germans need more facts.Thank you. Greetings 195.93.60.136 09:41, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Jennifer Stewart</b> (* 29. September <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redondo_Beach_f987.html" title="Redondo Beach">Redondo Beach</a>) ist eine <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">US-amerikanische</a> Pornodarstellerin und eine Schauspielerin.</p>
<p>Jennifer Stewart, die mit bürgerlichem Namen <i>Jennifer Noble</i> heißt und auch unter dem Namen <i>Jennifer Steward</i> in pornografischen Filmen mitwirkte, begann schon als Teenager mit kleinen Rollen im amerikanischen Fernsehen, z.B. in <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_Gold_%28TV_series%29_a5f3.html" title="Solid Gold (TV series)">Solid Gold</a></i>. Danach arbeitete sie im <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim.html" title="Anaheim">Anaheim</a>. 1989 begann sie eine nur zwei Jahre dauernde Karriere als Exklusiv-Star der Firma <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivid_Video_cde7.html" title="Vivid Video">Vivid Video</a>. Höhepunkt ihrer Karriere war der Gewinn des <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_Award_9906.html" title="AVN Award">AVN Awards</a> 1991 als „Best New Starlet“. Sie drehte ungefähr 20 Porno-Filme, wobei die teure, da auf 35mm-Film gedrehte Kino-Produktion <i>The Swap</i> als ihr bester gilt. Sie spielt darin eine gelangweilte <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">Yuppie</a>-Hausfrau. Im Gegensatz zu vielen ihrer Kolleginnen hat sie während ihrer Porno-Karriere nichts an ihrem Körper "verbessert". Die einzige Veränderung, die sie zuließ: Sie trug braune Kontaktlinsen statt ihrer natürlichen blauen Augen.</p>
<p>Auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Bekanntheit beendete sie aus persönlichen Gründen die Porno-Karriere, um 1997 in der komödiantischen TV-Serie <i>Hot Springs Hotel</i> unter dem nur leicht veränderten Namen <i>Jen Stewart</i> wieder aufzutauchen.</p>

<p>203.129.148.202 10:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)The word Bref was formed by a combination of two names, Briony and Stef. The first two letters from Briony (br) and the last two letters of Stef (ef). Bref is a very famous organisation, providing food for the homeless, making people rad etc. Bref was first created in 2004, at the school of Christian College, when two young ladys named Briony and Stef became best friends, and formed an allyence, soon to be the greatest team in the world. The two girls were later to be in a freak accident, causing them to have super powers. Briony obtained the power of flight and telekanesis, Stef obtained the power of light speed, invisiblity and super strength. After finally accpeting these new gifts, the two girls decided to form together and fight evil-doers in the humble city of Geelong. After many successful attempts to stop evil, the girls were known as "the pirates" because of they're pirate type style and slang. Moderatly displeased of this name, the girls put the name "BREF" on their pirate clothing, so civilians would know who they where. Soon, everyone knew them as "the bref pirates". They were pleased by this. During the day, the girls would go to school as normal, but when the clock hit 3:30, they would run into the bathrooms and become THE BREF PIRATES. With stefs handy invisibility, and brionys flight, they would easily get out of the school grounds undetected.</p>
<p>the bref pirates were their name, and fighting evil were their game. they were everywhere, the news, the papers, even on little kids stickers. the girls were respected and thought of as gods. these days the girls are still at school and fighting crime. its a tough life they lead, but the thought of kicking evil-doers ass gets them through.</p>

<p>Kinderen van moeder aarde (children of mother earth) is the first part of the trilogy of Thea Beckman, published in 1985. It's a futuristic roman set ten centuries after World War III, describing the struggle between utopian Thule (Greenland, after a climate change made it prosperous) and Baden (militaristic European nation).</p>
<p>Please note: Reading the rest of this page may spoil the fun if you still want to read the book.</p>
<p>Kinderen van moeder aarde is about Thule (former Greenland). It's a utopian country, governed by women, where all people live together with nature. Thule is invaded by people from Baden, a country in Western Europe, where barely anything can live, because of the exploitation of the soil. The Baden Empire is reigned by the Egon, a male, absolute ruler, and many people are poor. Because of the lack of food and resources, the Egon decides to send some people on a mission to North America.</p>
<p>When they reach Thule, they are astonished by the huge amount of green. They stay in Thule for a while, and then want to go back to Baden to tell everyone about the paradise they found. The Konega (a kind of queen) of Thule, doesn't want her country to be exploited like the Baden Empire. She attempts to stop the Baden people from going back, and she succeeds. The son, husband and brother-in-law of the Konega helped her a lot, and they think the law must be changed, so men could also rule. The Konega has the feeling there will be other Baden missions in the near future, and she thinks men could help her a lot in protecting her country, so she does change the law.</p>
<p>The Konega's feeling was right, and in the second book, het helse paradijs (the paradise from hell), five war ships from the Baden Empire come to Thule. In the last part of the trilogy the Baden people have colonised parts of Thule, but many Thuleen people survive in the inland. A young Baden girl decides to go into the inlands, and she does everything she can to establish peace.</p>

The song became a #1 hit for Z100 in 2006 and was soon a top 10 hit by March. The song was a strong digital seller, and made #4 on the U.S. Billboard Digital Downloads chart. A music video for the song was released in late February. The song will soon be released in the U.K. by AATW records and a new music video will be shot.</p>

<p>In the novel "The Algebraist" by Iain M. Banks, "needle ship" is the term used for a special type of spaceship (usually warships with large crew and cargo capacity) designed for wormhole travel. The name is derived from their shape – needle ships are much longer than they are wide, owing to the fact that "the average 'hole diameter [is] under fifty metres".</p>

<p>You don't have to publish this this, but when I saw the article stating the Miami Serpentarium (sp), I had to read it. My name is Nina and I'm from Miami, FL, a few blocks from the Haast, my mother was good friends w/ Clareta. I was great friends w/ Naia Haast, the daughter of Bill and Clareta, they also had another daughter, Shonta. I HATE snakes, although I used to spend the night w/ Naia. Dr Haast, as we called him, would have those white cloth laundry bags in the laundry room of the home (in back of the serpentarium) full of snakes!! It would scare me to death but Naia was my good friend and I wanted to stay the night with her. I was in elementary school back then. During the day we would "ride" the GIGANTIC turtles, on their backs, they were like a built in saddle how tuff their skin was, in between the 3 pits that had these humongous alligators in them. Each pit had 2 or 3 alligators in them @ the same time and would thrash their tails around and bite and chew them until they were mostly raw. Now that I think of it I must of been out of my mind but when your kids it's exciting. I used to wonder why all those people were watching us so intently, but now I understand!! It's a wonder those turtles didn't buck us off their backs!!! I tell you what...I still HATE snakes to this day!! Insert non-formatted text hereInsert non-formatted text here=== Sources ===</p>

<p>Frontosa is a fish from Lake Tanganyika. It has black vertical bars adorning a white or blue body. They may have undertones of other colors, adding to the beauty of the species. A large protrusion will form on the posterior portion of the frontosas head, which is more pronounced in the male of the species. It is formed of fatty tissue. Older frontosa can get as large as 12 inches or more. They are open water swimmers. The frontosa is not the largest Lake Tanganyikan fish, this is instead the emperor chiclid.</p>

<p>Danish Holiday celebrated on the 4th Friday after Easter. The day is known as Store Bededag (literally "Great Prayer Day"). The day may be translated as “General Prayer Day”, “All Prayers’ Day”, “Great Day of Prayers” or “Common Prayer Day”. In fact, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims that it does not have an English translation. It is a collection of minor Christian holy days consolidated into one day. The day was introduced in the Danish Church in 1686 by H.M. King Christian V as a consolidation of several minor (or local) Christian (Catholic) holidays which the Church observed that had survived since the Reformation. Store Bededag is a statutory holiday in Denmark. Some sources date this day of prayer more recently to the time of Christian VII, when his worldly Prime Minister, Count Johann Friedrich von Struensee, decided upon one great day of prayer. The day was introduced as a more efficient alternative to individually celebrating a number of holidays honoring various minor saints in the spring. Bells in every church announce the eve of Store Bededag. In olden days it was customary for Copenhagen burghers to greet the spring by putting on new clothes and strolling along the city ramparts. Then they went home and ate “varme hveder”, a kind of small square wheat bread, served piping hot. Today people still eat the traditional bread. Some still dress in spring finery but, instead of walking along the ramparts, they promenade on the famous Langelinie, or boulevard which faces Copenhagen's water front.. On Store Bededag many stores and places of business are closed and special church services held.</p>

<p>There seems to be a geat deal of confusion and disagreement about who is the First Generation American in a families' lineage. Is it the immigrant who first arrives here and begins a family? Or is it the immigrant's first US born children?</p>
<p>I have always assumed that those who endured the hardships to come here, establish a permanent life, achieve US citizenship, have children and raise a family were First Generation Americans. They were the first in their lineage to become Americans. It would follow then that those fortunate enough to be born here of immigrant parents were the Second Generation Americans. Some would even argue that US citizenship is not needed to be called a First Generation American.</p>
<p>Wikipedia does not seem to have any information on this subject. What is the prevailing opinion and most reliable source?</p>

<p>RCA clean is a term uses in microprocessor fabrication. It refers to the a standard procedure to clean the surface of Si wafers. Its name is derived from the original wafer cleaning process developed by Walter Kern at RCA Laboratories in 1970. This clean consists of a sequence of cleaning steps using “standard” solutions. Standard Cleaning solution #1 consists of a mixture of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and DI water (H2O). A typical concentration ratio for the mix is 1:1:5 NH4OH:H2O2:H2O, although recently ratios as low as 0.05:1:5 have been used for better cleaning performance. The SC-1 solution is the best known treatment for removing particles from the surface of the wafer. The SC-1 solution is also very effective at removing organic contaminants and some metallic contaminants from the surface of the wafer. It accomplishes this by continually oxidizing and then etching the surface of the wafer, thereby dissolving the contaminants into solution. It is typically operated in the temperature range of 50-70 C, and plastic tanks with a filtered recirculation loop are utilized to remove particles from solution.</p>
