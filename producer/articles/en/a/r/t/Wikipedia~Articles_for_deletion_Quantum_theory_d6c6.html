<p>Looking at a text book for guidance, I find in Bjorken and Drell (1965), chapter 11 (page 2 of the second volume):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Our approach is best illustrated by the electromagnetic field, The potentials A<img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/e/f/eefd5d1da2c8a92c0ce03a0b7993d1ef.png" alt="\mu\" />(x) satisfy the Maxwell wave equations and may be considered as describing a dynamical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. By this we mean that A<img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/e/f/eefd5d1da2c8a92c0ce03a0b7993d1ef.png" alt="\mu\" />(x) at each point of space may be considered an independent generalized coordinate. To make the transition from classical to quantum theory, we must, according to the general principles proclaimed in Chap. 1, elevate coordinates and their conjugate momenta to operators in the Hilbert space of possible physical states and impose quantum conditions upon them. This is the canonical quantization procedure. It is a straightforward extension to field functions, which obey differential wave equations derivable from a lagrangian, of the quantization procedure of non-reLativistic mechanics. When it is done, there emerges a particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field-in the sense of Bohr's principle of complementarity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If photons emerge in such a natural way from the quantization of the Maxwell field, one is led to ask whether other particles whose existence is observed in nature are also related to force fields by the same quantization procedure. On this basis Yukawa predicted the existence of the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/8/5/d85a11dccd888d77343545939bd3db9d.png" alt="\pi\" /> meson from knowledge of the existence of nuclear forces. Conversely, it is natural from this point of view to associate with each kind of observed particle in nature a field <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/2/c/a2c671b2cdd4667d9f5663c5e73018eb.png" alt="\phi\" />(x) which satisfies an assumed wave equation. A particle interpretation of the field <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/2/c/a2c671b2cdd4667d9f5663c5e73018eb.png" alt="\phi\" />(x) is then obtained when we carry through the canonical quantization program.</dd>
</dl>
<p>They find nothing revolutionary about this. It is just proceeding to fields, according to the standard methods of quantum mechanics. The first volume is called <i>Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</i> and the second <i>Relativistic Quantum Fields</i>, but there is no suggestion that these are distinct theories. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<p>Messiah makes the point that if electromagnetic fields were not quantized, they would allow measurements to violate the uncertainty principle, so the underlying physics of field theory was already present in early QM.

<p>Hold on, PLEASE READ THIS!</p>
<p>Nobody is coming here to LEARN Quantum Theory. People just want to learn <u>about</u> it! The history of it, or brief history of it. We just want to read and get a general idea of what it is. When I come to the page, and see all of this nonsense about it being deleted, I can't really learn ANYTHING about physics because I don't know if any of it is real or not, when MOST of it is! The person that made this page, never said that what they wrote down and reported here was the end all be all about this subject. Just RELAX! You are putting seeds of doubt in everyones head. That is wrong. Or maybe you are just upset and jealous that he/she got here first, and YOU wanted to do the physics page. Thats just great, "nerd fights". Just relax, and go watch some Star Trek TNG.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The term "third quantization" exists -- including its use at the physics e-archives e.g. arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0606021 arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9611057. Making it a pure disambiguation page is a good idea (in fact I raised this suggestion on the talk page shortly after its creation). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<ul>
<li>Have you <i>read</i> those papers? I find both of them quite incomprehensible in detail; neither is peer-reviewed (although that hardly means anything anymore); and they use "third quantization" in two different, equally nonsensical (in my book), ways. Ioannis Raptis has transcended mere manifolds and spends forty pages of verbiage (and precious few equations) quantizing something he calls "Abstract Differential Geometry - Vacuum Einstein Gravity". A. Zhuk, on the other hand, seems to think that solutions of the Wheeler-deWitt equation need quantizing, and writes: "Similar to the quantum scalar field theory in the curved space-time we can expect that the vacuum state in a third quantized theory is unstable and creation of particles (in our case, universes) from the initial vacuum state takes place." If you have some sort of insight into this and can demonstrate that they are one and the same, methinks it would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If not, you probably don't want to be using the phrase "third quantization". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K. Edwards">Michael K.

<li>No I haven't read those papers&#160;:-), I just picked the first two that came up. There are others on the arxiv, have a look. My point was to demonstrate the term is in use. BTW google yields 11,400 web hits for the search string ("3rd quantized" OR "third quantized" OR "3rd quantization" OR "third quantization"). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am concerned that some of the definitions and used in this article are either entirely non-standard or else do not reflect universally-used physics terminology. It's not clear to me, really, that "quantum theory" has a precise and universally-understood meaning. Likewise I believe that QFT can (and is) described as "quantum mechanical," which would seem to negate the stated division between the two. This article needs to cite sources and clarify whether terms are universally used, if it is to exist at all in its present form. I'm not advocating a particular course of action yet, but this clearly requires discussion. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 06:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The word "quantum mechanics" cannot be used to mean both the set of all theories and one of them. While useage seems inconsistent in various text books, wikipedia must make an editorial choice between the 2 possible meanings. <a href="../../../p/c/a/User%7EPcarbonn_cbe1.html" title="User:Pcarbonn">Pcarbonn</a> 07:05, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Historically speaking (in my unqualified opinion), "quantum mechanics" is the class of rather ad-hoc semi-classical Hamiltonian-based techniques which preceded QED, and QFT as the term is now understood (action-principle-based gauge theories) was only one of many possible successors to quantum mechanics. Many alternatives were explored between about 1927 (when Pauli and Dirac started fitting spin and special relativity together and identifying the proper form of the electron current) and 1960 (when experimental confirmation of the Ahanarov-Bohm effect validated the gauge potential as a physical field). Bohr/Heisenberg/Schroedinger style quantum mechanics is still taught to undergraduates, not least because it provides some insight into atomic physics without the forbidding mathematical machinery of QFT; and a sort of hybrid QM-QFT semi-classical technique still has a lot of value in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_chemistry.html" title="Computational chemistry">computational chemistry</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_physics.html" title="Plasma physics">plasma physics</a>. Trying to cram all that into QFT, or vice versa, wouldn't work very well. Hence the need for a disambiguation page at <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_theory.html" title="Quantum theory">quantum theory</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K.

<li>I don't think editorial choice is acceptable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Is it too much to ask that people read the article and evaluate it against the standard of major physics topics in Wikipedia? Or that they check an actual encyclopedia for the historical usage of "quantum theory", "quantum mechanics", and "quantum field theory"? Not that encyclopedias always get it right, either; but "quantum theory" does not appear to have any value other than as an umbrella term when describing developments later than about 1927 (when the observation of electron diffraction validated de Broglie / Schroedinger / Heisenberg "quantum mechanics" over the original Planck / Bohr / Einstein ansatz in which only radiation was quantized). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K.

<li>"and evaluate it against the standard of major physics topics in Wikipedia?" - That isn't an issue for AfD.

<li>"Or that they check an actual encyclopedia for the historical usage of "quantum theory", "quantum mechanics", and "quantum field theory"?" - If we deleted things on the basis of "an actual encyclopedia", then we would be Britannica.
