<li>Come on, do you honestly think that Wikipedia is going to have council memebrs for the tiniest remotest settlements in the world? Or that that's even an aim? Who'd update them daily? Where would people even get the information to do that? Are they any more notable than the guy who owns the local laundomat? We're talking hundreds of thousands of people who hold some sort of official position some sort of minor government body, not to mention school boards. We still don't even have articles for every member of the House of Representatives. Of course, you want to keep the principal of every high school as well. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That the House info is incomplete is entirely irrelevant. Because people are working on some pages of Wikipedia doesn't necessarily mean they're diverting their efforts from other pages. Everyone works on what they're interested in, and only what they're interested in. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> 10:46, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I only mentioned the House to give an idea of what a pipe dream including every elected official in the world is. By the time we have the House complete there will probably be a new House (although with the incumbent re-election rates it won't be terribly "new"). I admit this guy <i>may</i> be notable enough for an article (I haven't competely changed my mind) but this idea of including any person who won an election (or lost, some people want to have articles for losing candidates as well) anywhere at any time is silly. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, we aren't. The local councillors whom I vote for do a good job, but what they do is only relevant to a few thousand people, if that. I'd vote against encyclopaedia articles on them if their jobs were all that could be said about them. Unfortunately for those who also serve by keeping their eyes on vandalism and litter, politicians who are involved in scandals that reach national news outlets <i>do</i> rate the encyclopaedia articles, if only barely. TINJ. There's a lot of padding in this article, too. <b>Weak Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:44, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. How is he not notable? He is the only Tory councilor for a large constituency in Wales, and was the centre of at least a moderatly well known scandal.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I thought this might get listed by the author at some point (look at the similarities in all the IP addresses used, including the one at the top of this page) but I haven't been keeping an eye on it. The author, who I initially thought was John Paul Jenkins himself but claims to be someone close to him seems to object to the idea that creating a Wikipedia article doesn't give you the right to keep unwanted facts out of it, in this case the only thing that makes this man notable: his (alleged) homophobic comments. I recommend a look at the article history and the talk page where I have tried to engage in discussion with the rather reticent author of the article. I have also made efforts to NPOV it and I intend to do some digging and write a bit more on what Jenkins is alleged to have said and the controversy that ensued. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 20:46, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this looks likely to be hugely more encyclopedia-worthy than, say, anything whatever in List of vehicles in Star Wars. But I still don't see anything noteworthy about this man. Welsh tories are indeed rare, but what has he done about it? He's made homophobic comments in an internet chat room, which is routine behavior for young right-wing twits, and then claimed that they were taken out of context, which is ditto. His campaign slogan was as vacuous as they come: is anyone going to respond, "No, <i>lying down</i> with Llanelli!"? He strikes me merely as a young right-wing nonentity. Tell me something he's done, and I'll vote "keep". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:14, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. I want to say keep as an example of what one should expect from people of such political persuasion... but he is just a local councillor.
