<li>OK, I never heard of this guy until now, and I have no idea of just how much of an internet phenomenon he was, but there is clearly a precedent for the inclusion of major internet phenomonena in wikipedia. Reading this page and looking at the photo it struck me that this guy really reminds me of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a>. Is there any evidence that he was the inspiration for that character? If so then maybe merge and redirect there? <b>No vote</b> as of now, but I'm curious about this. Anyone have any information on this? Am I off my rocker? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:19, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose only Borat's creators know for sure, but my guess is no. Their countries of origin are different, for a start, and Borat's most prevelant characteristic (anti-semitism) isn't something associated with Mahir. They do have some similar physical characteristics, but I think Borat is more of a reference to a stereotyped foreign guy (like a less-cute Andy Kauffman's "foreign man") than a reference to any specific person. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:33, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't call anti-semitism Borat's most prevelant characteristic, at least not in the beginning. I think it sort of grew as Cohen realized how useful it was in what he was doing. Anyway, it wasn't just his appearance that got we wondering, but the "I like sex" thing as well. Their countries are different, but I know Cohen chose Kazakstan because he was pretty sure he wouldn't have to worry about running into someone who was particularly familiar with that country. A google search leads me to believe that I'm not the first to make the connection, but there is no evidence that Borat was directly inspired by Cagri, so maybe merge a few sentences into the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a> article and <b>redirect</b>. He's already mentioned there. That would mean losing the great photo, but we can live with that. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:53, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>

</li>
<li>Major internet phenomena do get included in Wikipedia. This one, however, gets 837 googles, which does not even remotely qualify as such. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:45, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This <i>is</i> a major Internet phenomenon. This guy spawned the "I KISS YOU!!!" thing; Googling that yields over 100,000 hits. Don't delete Mahir, who wants come to Turkey, he can invitate! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:57, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Come on, now... do you really think every time the 3 common words "i kiss you" appear next to each other on Google, it's a reference to Mahir? I think not. If I run the same exact-phrase search, more than half of the result on the first two pages are obsviously not Mahir references, many are merely part of "can I kiss you" or "may I kiss you", etc. If I add "mahir" to the search query, the number of results drops more than 90%. Besides, even if he coined a minor internet catchprase, does that necessarily make him encyclopedia-worthy? "Have A Nice Day" is a far bigger catchprase, and I doubt that whoever made it up has an entry (and rightly so). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:42, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, no, but the name of whoever created "Have A Nice Day" was not linked to the catchphrase itself, whereas the name of "Mahir" spread along with "I KISS YOU!!!" If we had a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_memes_8f8a.html" title="List of Internet memes">List of Internet memes</a>, I'd say it could be merged there. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:44, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that's a really good idea. Internet memes are a bit like local politicians and others who tap-dance around the notability line: a fairly large number of people don't think they belong in an encylopedia, but enough people care about them that they can't be entirely ignored, either. A list would satisfy both groups. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:57, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D'oh! Chalk that one up to lack of caffeine. I must have been thinking that "I kiss you" is ungrammatical/uncommon enough to only catch what I was looking for... anyway, where do you get a 90% dropoff? Google for <i>"i kiss you" mahir</i> returns 32,000 hits. I stand by my claim that this is a well-known enough meme to have its own article. If not, well, it's time to put up stuff like <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a> for VfD as well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 15:55, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm, now that's <i>really</i> strange. I get 10,900 for <i>"i kiss you" mahir</i> and even if I remove the quotes it only goes up to 13,800. It idn't Safe Search, either, because that's turned off. I dunno. I probably would support a VfD for Badger3, even though I personally find it amusing. Overall though I like Antaeus' list idea for topics like these. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:03, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As his heydey was apparently 6 years ago, a google search now would not reflect how popular he was in his prime. The guy who popularized Mahir's page claimed he got 500,000 hits in two weeks, which is quite a lot. Also Mahir's page counter which has only been active since 2002 (still 3 years after his initial popularity) has a comparable number of hits, which is still a lot for a personal web page. I'm not a good judge of exactly when an internet phenomena is really widespread enough to warrant inclusion, so I'm still wavering on this one, but I think we do have to look to what other such things are included in wikipedia, and compare. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:11, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Despite some people's assumptions, this was a major Internet phenomenon. The guy made Wired!

<li>This was nominated for deletion months ago and, I thought, deleted. I can find no record of the prior discussion, though. I think it pre-dated our archiving procedure.

<li>This wasn't nominated for deletion before. There are only a handful of edits to the article and so it's rather quick to check all the diffs and verify this. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 23:42, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Human memory is of course fallible, but I am sure beyond any shadow of doubt that this topic has been previously nominated. (I am not as sure of the decision.) The fact that there is no evidence in the article history is, unfortunately, not proof that a nomination never took place. 1) I can not say for sure that this topic was previously created at this exact title. It might have been a slightly different transliteration of his name. 2) It was long enough that it might have been prior to one of the database failures that took out some history files. Regardless, I still can't find a copy of the prior discussion. Unless someone else can, it's probably moot. My own vote is not based on the prior discussion but on my assessment of the current relevance of his impact. Clearly I am in the minority on this one but no change of vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:00, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
