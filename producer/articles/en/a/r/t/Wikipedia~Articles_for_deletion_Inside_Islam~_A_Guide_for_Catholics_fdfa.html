<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example. Aside from this, the scholarship of the author is also believed to be fundamentally flawed by university professors like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a>, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Furthermore, if there is any controversy, it should be addressed in "Criticism of X" articles. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Spencer's views are controversial and not taken seriously by scholars to the best of my knowledge; he also runs a website that contains material that's arguably Islamophobic, as well as legitimate material. Most importantly, he isn't notable enough to have so many pages devoted to his views; the descriptions of his books can be added to his biography. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, there is nothing wrong with having 1000s of notable books on WP, given that tens of millions of books have been written throughout human history. Just because there are 1000s of something is no reason to exclude them from WP: for example, heads of state, battles, chemical compounds, etc. Oh, and <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:06, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nothing to prevent a proper article from being created in the future.The standards that only books as notable as Dante, the Bible and the Koran are worthy of articles does not agree with Wikipedia notability policies, and the arguments that the author is wrong and controversial do not address notability. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a bad-faith nomination that does not cite policy in its deletion reasoning.

The argument by analogy with Britannica is also outside of policy, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. The argument against the author's "scholarship" is a content dispute and does not belong at AFD.
