<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_about_ongoing_enterprises_ee2f.html" title="Edit section: This should be official Wikipedia policy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">This should be official Wikipedia policy</span></h2>
<p>I am suggesting that this article should become official Wikipedia policy. It should be self-evident. An ongoing enterprise could be libeled by a Wikipedia article just as easily as a living person, and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is already official policy. Think about how badly a libel suit could hurt Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There's a federal law that would probably provide immunity in most cases, but it hasn't been tested in court. In particular, if a Foundation employee is aware of a false statement in an article about a living person or ongoing enterprise, and does nothing to remove it, Wikipedia could be vulnerable to civil liability in spite of this law.</p>
<p>Even if Wikipedia eventually wins the lawsuit, it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees. And here's the killer ending, mystery fans.</p>
<p>Wikipedia just finished a fundraiser that took two weeks to raise $1 million. A Fortune 500 company makes that much money in profits before the CEO finishes his first cup of coffee in the morning. They could afford to engage in certain tactics during litigation that would bankrupt Wikipedia before the case could be dismissed.</p>
<p>Wikipedia needs policies that will empower administrators, and even ordinary editors whose hearts are in the right place, to protect the project. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 00:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why not amend the existing policy instead of making a new one that is basically identical, and in large parts word-for-word the same? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 00:38, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a good idea. The existing policy is called <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and your proposal might require a name change. Also, the policies aren't quite identical. This one addresses the possibility of edits by PR employees of a corporation, press releases, self-published corporate websites and other factors that you don't normally encounter when writing about someone like <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Pournelle_b36d.html" title="Jerry Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a>, for example. He's just a science fiction writer. He probably doesn't even have his own website, and he certainly doesn't have PR employees or generate press releases. This seems to be a person who is representative of the people protected by <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.</dd>
<dd>Corporations and other ongoing enterprises, even the small ones, have employees who duties include PR. This could prove to be problematic. We need a policy that addresses edits by such employees. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 01:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Dino: <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> seems to address it pretty succinctly... <i>"If you fit either of these descriptions: 1. you are receiving monetary or other benefits or considerations to edit Wikipedia as a representative of an organization (whether directly as an employee or contractor of that organization, or indirectly as an employee or contractor of a firm hired by that organization for public relations purposes)... then we very strongly encourage you to avoid editing Wikipedia in areas in which you appear to have a conflict of interest."</i> <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 07:13, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd certainly support changes to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> to ensure it is clear that the rules there apply to corporations as well as individuals. I don't think any additional rules beyond what are described there are necessary.</dd>
<dd>(BTW: Pournelle has a rather extensive web site -- probably better to pick a different example!) <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:27, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd agree that the best way to go around this is to edit BLP to expand it, rather than create a semi-redundant page to the side. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I support the proposal, by analogy with BLP. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 19:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>I support having organizations covered under BLP or similar policy.</s> --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 21:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that there is an arbcom case, I need to look it over and see what comes out of it. But, agree in principle that articles about corporations need to be watched more closely for compliance with policies. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 15:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I 100% support this proposal, and the above comments on BLP. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAJackl_fc2f.html" title="User:AJackl">Alex Jackl</a> 00:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I continue to oppose it as unnecessary in the vast majority of cases. We should always be factual and neutral in our presentation of subjects. But organizations are not people. They are granted fundamentally different rights under law and in the common expectation. They do not need the somewhat draconian controls and protections that have proven sometimes necessary for biographies of living persons. The ordinary controls of editing, consensus-seeking and if necessary the blocking of vandals are sufficient. The unintended consequences of this proposal outweigh the potential benefits. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I support this, either as a separate policy or as an update to BLP. I'd be interested though, for Rossami to expand what s/he means by "unintended consequences". As I see it, BLP pertaining to individuals is simply a "stricter" form of NPOV and RS which is what <i>all</i> articles should be compliant with. I think expanding this is good for the project in general and I note that COI still applies. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a>
<ul>
<li>BLP is already creating edit wars because it exempts editors from the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a> and encourages a very aggressive stance in editing. As you say, it is a <i>stricter</i> form of NPOV and RS and it has been used as a blunt instrument at times. For articles about controversial figures, there are serious claims that BLP is being (mis)used to stifle coverage of the controversy. (Whether you consider it proper use or misuse depends, of course, on your point of view in the particular controversy.) The normal processes of editing by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus-seeking</a> are suspended and we get an increase in appeals for admin intervention, etc.<br />
Now for articles about living people, I agree that these process-costs are justified. I don't see the same need to suspend normal editing for companies and other organizations. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 14:07, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with your assertion that BLP creates more edit-warring. Someone who breeches 3RR better have an airtight case or they <i>will</i> be blocked. I submit that for every article that BLP inflames editing, there are just as many where it stops it, because someone wanting to inject POV know they don't have the RSs to back it up. As for stifling reporting of controversy, if there are multiple RSs reporting it, it <i>will</i> be included, perhaps not every minor one, but then, they probably shouldn't be anyway. I'm skeptical that this really is a suspension of normal editing (or at least, it shouldn't be) or that it will "increase the process costs". However. even if they do marginally, I can see a couple reasons why they can be justified: 1) Misinformation regarding companies and orgs can have real bad effects on real people's reputations and livelihoods (for example, imagine a companies stock falling on the back of rumours disseminated here) and 2) companies and orgs can have much deeper pockets than the typical individual does, while an anon POV-pusher has very little at stake, the project as a whole, and the foundation in particular has a lot. If we're going to write that Microsoft eats babies, we had better be able to back it up with verifiable, reliable sources. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 10:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found these results to be alarming, however even with those IPs, we shouldn't "<a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite the newbies</a>" Maybe those folks are not aware of WP:COI. After being informed of it, and they continue the behavior then it is a problem.</p>
<p>Examining the situation involving the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse_fdeb.html" title="National Institute on Drug Abuse">NIDA</a>, I found that this (and similar) articles are edited infrequently and watched by few. Thus, COI edits can get in easily without anyone noticing. With the article, last edits before the NIDA IP edits occurred in March 2006. This material was added in April 2005 by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERad_Racer_55af.html" title="User:Rad Racer">User:Rad Racer</a> who has since left the project and thus not watching the article. The next edits occurred between August 28 - September 29, 2006 by person(s) associated with NIDA, essentially stubbing the article and stripping out the controversy sections which was the bulk of the article. I assume good faith of Rad Racer, but don't know enough about NIDA to be able to judge how accurate or not the criticism section was or what (valid or not?) concerns NIDA had with it. When a living persons bio gets blanked, we need to consider the possibility that they were removing erroneous or libelous material. I think this case should have been treated like <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">Living people</a> bios. This editor was never asked on their talk page about their edits, informed of WP:COI and other policies. After the NIDA edits in September, the next edits were not made until January 5, 2007, and deleted material restored on January 25. While the fact that NIDA blanked the article is regrettable, it's also regrettable that Wikipedians were not paying any attention to the article for so long and no one tried to work with that IP editor back when those edits occurred.</p>
<p>I think these articles need to be watched more closely for both COI edits and vandalism/libel/errors. I'm not sure the best way to do that, but think having <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> or similar policy covering these types of articles would be helpful. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 21:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not following the Arbcom case closely, but many times find that COI edits consist of removing libelous, extreme POV, or erroneous information. By having <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> and this policy, Wikipedians are watching these bios more closely. I went through each individual edit to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allstate.html" title="Allstate">Allstate</a> article. There's been significant spamming of external links to the page, including attack sites - "AllstateInsuranceSucks.com" and a page on "Allstate Insurance and Scientology" which made some very strong critical claims. In June 2006, someone added a big section to the article itself on "Scientology Infiltrates Allstate", which was then deleted by someone from the company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58555224" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58555224" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which was restored by a Wikipedian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58818264" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58818264" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, deleted by Allstate and reverted a few more times. At the end of June, someone drastically trimmed the section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61284781" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allstate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61284781" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and it's now gone entirely. From now on, I'll 'adopt' this article and watch it, maybe find some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> material to add, and watch a few other corporate articles. But there are so many articles to be watched. People that hate the companies will insert criticism, often poorly sourced. With many inadequetly watched, then it's likely that the company itself will come along and cut out anything critical. We need more Wikipedians to watch them for compliance with our policies and make articles neutral and comply with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 15:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

The edits coming from Allstate affiliated individuals would already be covered under <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> if they were taking out verfiable information from reliable sources (which in this case I don't think is true, but that is another issue). the insertion of the "Scientology Infiltrates Allstate" section and "AllstateInsuranceSucks.com" link are covered by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> respectively. I've run into a similar series of issues on other articles and at this point making sure that articles meet the core policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as well as relevent guidelines like <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> should be more than sufficient. All that is needed is for Wikipedians to watch articles where there is a high potential for POV-pushing based on poorly sourced, skewed sources, or "information management" by involved parties (<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> for example).

<dd>But they aren't. If the articles were neutral and well-sourced, I don't think COI edits would be as big of an issue. It's because of how poor and inadequately watched these articles tend to be, that the companies come along and "fix" the articles themselves. In particular, nobody was watching the NIDA article. I'm as much to blame for not watching the articles, but there is only so much I can put on my plate to monitor. The issue needs more awareness, and maybe a tag like <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> would help for watching recent changes to these articles. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 16:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Dino:</b> Could you please source your claim that&#160;: <i>"Truthout.org is the subject of a current Foundation action that stubified the article after a Truthout reporter, Jason Leopold, reported that Dick Cheney was about to be indicted in the Valerie Plame investigation."</i> I know the article has been 'officed' for quite a while, but I didn't think it had anything to do with Dick Cheney. Truthout received a lot of valid criticism for claiming that Karl Rove would be indicted, but I never read anthing there saying that Cheney would be indicted. Maybe I missed it. Source?

<dd>With all due respect to Jimbo Wales, Wikipedia is not his personal plaything. Nor do I believe he wants it to be. And it certainly isn't yours, sir. We don't need to have you on board in order to have a consensus on this issue, sir. There are others here who recognize that an ongoing enterprise, even an "extremist political website" (and I'm sure you mean Free Republic), can be libeled by a Wikipedia article, particularly since there are extremists of the opposite persuasion who are dedicated to pumping the article full of whatever unsourced or poorly sourced criticism they can find.</dd>

<dd>I want to protect Wikipedia from such an event. Just one such event involving a Fortune 500 corporation could bankrupt Wikipedia. Even without the money issue, there's the reputation of Wikipedia to consider. With literally millions of man-hours poured into it by some of the most brilliant and educated minds in the world, one would think that it would have a reputation as a reliable, neutral encyclopedic resource by now. But it doesn't, in part because these reckless partisans cannot be controlled effectively under current policies. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 00:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Add me to the object list.</b> WP:BLP is becoming an excuse to create Positive/Sympathetic POV articles, not NPOV ones and I object to anymore stretching of that.

<li>Dino, I find your reasoning to be rather flawed. First, if there were actual legal hazards, I'm sure the MediaWiki board and/or their lawyer would inform us. I'm not a lawyer and I suspect you aren't either, so any reasoning we base upon our understanding of U.S. law is likely to be incorrect. Second, I think you're quite wrong that Wikipedia is considered unreliable because of "reckless partisans"; indeed, criticism tends to focus on other areas (such as "lowest common denominator"). And third, Schmucky has a good point that paid POV pushers are potentially problematic, and this would likely be worse for commercial institutes. We should be extremely careful about creating policy in such areas. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:00, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I did say, <b>"in part."</b> The criticism I've heard is that it's too easily altered by people who have agendas that are inconsistent with the idea of a neutral encyclopedic resource. Some of them are corporate PR flacks. Some of them are employed by political campaigns. Some, but certainly not all of them are random radical nutcases (the "reckless partisans" I've referenced). Some are adolescents who want to turn this into the world's most comprehensive resource for Pokemon trivia, or comic book trivia, or video game trivia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To resist these pressures, this place needs better supervision. Recruiting more admins isn't going as well as one might hope. So, as I've said, each of the limited number of people available to review these articles needs more firepower at his disposal. By this, I mean better policies: unambiguous and clear policies that allow admins and others to take decisive action, when it is warranted, to protect Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The most frequent targets of editors who are "on a mission" are articles about living persons. That's already been addressed by a splendid policy. I am suggesting that articles about corporations and other organizations are not far behind, as favorite targets of editors "on a mission." Those who believe that such organizations do not need or deserve such protection may wish to bear in mind that even the largest and most profitable corporation consists of shareholders, employees and their families, many of whom might be harmed financially by false claims that damage the company's reputation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The concerns that have been raised about corporate PR flacks who whitewash articles are quite valid. We need a policy that addresses them as well. The goal here is not whitewashed articles, but balanced, well-sourced NPOV articles.

<li>Deletion is probably overdoing it, but Kevin is correct in that it's overlapping. A <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">merge</a> and redirect would be useful. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see much reason for a merge. Since this has not reached consensus it seems inappropriate to specifically merge; however, I support Dean in modifying ORG to achieve his purpose. I think that we should develop an essay whcih is linked from WP:N discussing the reasoning. I think that a simple redirect is appropriate, unless there is a consensus otherwise. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with that, Kevin, is that this entire discussion and proposal called WP:AAOE has nothing at all to do with notability. It addresses edits by company employees and members of organizations, and how to deal with their COI issues. It also deals with the issue of libel. It has nothing to do with WP:N.</p>
<p>Right now, WP:ORG is all about the question, "Is it notable enough to have a Wikipedia article about it?" WP:AAOE deals with the follow-up question, "Since we have already decided that it's notable enough for an article, how do we avoid and/or deal with certain problems when writing the article?" So linking an essay from WP:N wouldn't be good. Linking it from WP:COI and WP:LIBEL would be good, perhaps WP:BLP as well.</p>
<p>Also, I think that the issue of consensus is awaiting resolution of the ArbCom case. So developing a discussion about a merge, and starting the ball rolling by getting folks to start thinking about it would be good. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 16:59, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An impossible assignment, Kevin. BLP deals with people (individuals) and the notability guidelines regarding people should be merged there, IMHO. BLP has only reached its current status in response to the direct intervention of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> in the wake of the Siegenthaler case. I believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That's why I'm trying to elevate this to policy status somehow, before there's a Siegenthaler type case that involves a corporation or other entity (rather than an individual). Also, there is powerful consensus against any further substantial modifications of BLP. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 18:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Moller settled this lawsuit by agreeing to a permanent injunction and paying $50,000.

<p>This is the working journalist's guide to libel law. It tells you how to stay out of trouble without being overly conservative. If Wikipedia management is worried about libel suits, that's the place to look for policy guidance.</p>
<p>On a personal note, during the dot-com boom and collapse, I ran <a href="http://www.downside.com" class="external text" title="http://www.downside.com" rel="nofollow">Downside</a>, a web site devoted to predicting which dot-coms would go under and when. Predictions of corporate "death dates" were generated by automated processing of company SEC filings. The accuracy was suprisingly good. I received hate mail and occasional legal threats, sometimes from CEO-level people. But nobody ever actually sued. They knew they'd lose. So don't cave in to corporate pressure when you don't have to. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 02:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The enterprise template was mis-worded given that this is just a proposal. I've fixed that. As for your other question, policies become policies because they are widely supported by the community. If you feel that this proposal should become a policy, you should follow the proposal right now. If the community is in agreement, other people will start to do so as well. If a lot of people disagree with it, then that should become pretty obvious really quickly. Note that this is not an opinion on the validity of the proposal itself, just a suggestion as to what you should do if you feel the proposal is valid. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 19:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please justify the Merge idea or delete it. It makes no sense. BLP is a well defined policy. This is not even a fully defined proposal. What it applies to is not identified.

This proposal is not well defined enough to be able to be merged. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 08:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed, the merge is the wrong way to go. There will be parallels and differences between the two standards. If anything, it looks like this started as a cookie cutter copy of BLP and we are now trying to work out here what the differences ought to be. BLP started 17 December 2005 as a proposal, was upgraded to a guideline at some point, and was upgraded to policy on 18 July 2006 (on the it is being so used basis), and the community as a whole is still coming to realize that BLP is a policy and figure out how to apply and work with it. If it still looks like basically a cookie cutter copy of BLP this time next year, then merging will be a good idea. For now, let's work out what this ought to be. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I put a "fact" tag on "Well-founded complaints about articles about ongoing enterprises from their subjects arrive daily in the form of e-mails to the Wikipedia contact address, phone calls to the Foundation headquarters and to Jimbo Wales, and via postal mail." That unsubstantiated claim doesn't belong in the policy without substantial backup.

Negative press and sourced facts are that; and we don't have to concern ourselves with the hurt feelings of a given political party or corporation, in the same regard as we do a living human being. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:29, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess it depends on whether <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, as our only specific effort to prevent <a href="../../../l/i/b/Wikipedia%7ELibel_9d80.html" title="Wikipedia:Libel">Wikipedia:Libel</a> (with the possible exception of <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>) , is viewed only by its ethical considerations, as opposed to its Legal considerations. I believe this page is more about the legal considerations involved, something which we cannot just ignore. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly, the legal comes first, and then consideration for the ethical. What I mean is that if negative press about Megacorp, LLC is uncovered by a reliable source, it would be negligient to not report on it at least in passing. For example, a very small incident could be handled safely by a line or two, with a link or two to RS detailed it more fully. I simply mean that this proposed policy should not be used to shield organizations or corporations from "bad press" simply because Google or other SE results will have disproportionate weight via Wikipedia being what it is. The goal is not to assist in spin control or minimizing negative associations for the subject of an article, but to be the sum total of human knowledge as Jimbo has said. And, of course, companies are not and never will be people to have hurt 'feelings'. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
