<li><b>Delete</b>. The article itself says: <i>This may not be a problem in the year 10,000, as it is unlikely that any of the technology or software in use today will still be active at that time.</i> I'd go even further. I doubt any computers in operation today will even exist then. It may deserve a merge to the Y2K problem where it was originally mentioned, but it certainly doesn't deserve its own article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:10, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a legitimate topic that has had some media exposure. Someone's going to type in "Year 10,000 problem" and expect to see something. My only concern is the use of a comma; there's no need for a separator. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 10:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the nominator of this, I think that, given the sources Uncle G has found, merging this with <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_2000_problem.html" title="Year 2000 problem">Year 2000 problem</a> would be reasonable. The majority of this article is still about the Y2k problem, with basically one paragraph which is actually about the "year 10,000" problem. As Uncle G's source on this also mentions the possibility of a year 100,000 problem, and as the creation of <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_100%2C000_problem.html" title="Year 100,000 problem">Year 100,000 problem</a> is therefore possible but undesirable, merging seems the best course to me. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:41, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>All modern computer systems store dates as a number of days since January 1, 1900. There may conceivably be an issue in 2079, when that number passes 65,536, the number which can be stored in one 16-bit word of computer memory. The only <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> issue about year 10,000 is that Excel formatting routines can't handle displaying the value.

<li>True, there are other time storage formats. None of them have an issue with the year 10,000, because none are storing the year as decimal text. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:57, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is clear crystal balling folks. First off, does anyone actually believe that current software/hardware is going to be used in the year 10,000? Common sense says, No, no one will be using them in 7990 years. That said with how fast computer technology is evolving, this is fairly a null pointed article.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is another aspect of the phrase 'Year 10,000 Problem' that is not in this article, but could be. We use this phrase in our software development group and I have heard others use it in others groups with an ironic twist. It describes a problem that would require a systematic examination and overhaul of all the code to address a theortical problem whose real significance approaches zero. "That's a Year 10,000 kind of problem--let's leave it for my successor." We also have occasionally used this rather non-ironically to describe in a generic sense any kind of problem that would require large scale code examination for a payoff, that while perhaps important, does not produce new features and is not very sexy. Obviously this by itself would not be the basis for inclusion in the article. But if my description of the phrase had wider currancy and was verifiable, it would provide a non-crystal ball componant for the article that would be useful. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 13:25, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Y2K problem turned out to be science-fiction as well, so even if this "problem" turns out to be nonsense, there should still be some evidence on the sort of nonsense it was. Furthermore, please note that i ended up reading about this issue after some research on "The Long Now" project which should be deleted as well if we do decide that such long-term thoughts are none of our business. -<small>— Eyeprotocol (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eyeprotocol_72ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eyeprotocol">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
