<p>1) If the term genocide applies on the Greek war of liberation, then it MUST be applied on any other war of liberation where the oppressors are eliminated; 2) AND it MUST be applied on all the acts of agression, murder, destruction, deportation, occupation and enslavement committed against the Greek - Byzantine - Romioi - Christian people since AD 634 by the Ottoman Turks, the consequence of which acts can be seen by comparing the map of the East before AD 634 and now. The alleged genocide against the Turko-Albanians committed during the Greek war of independence doesn't compare to this long and brutal genocide of the Greeks and those of a Greek origin, as well as of the Christian Orthodox, which is still carried on until now, 2006, when Greek churches were attacked in Palestine. The Turks have committed hundreds of genocides against the Greek people (not only in Greece) from AD 634 till now with facts about acts of conquest, massacres, deportation, enslavement etc.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Probable bad faith nomination. User Atalanti has no other edits aside from this nom and a similar edit to the talk page of the nominated article.

<li><b>Comment - Reply to user "Caknuck"</b>: User Atalanti is a PhD in history and Archaeology, and has no other edits for she is not driven by bad faith, but only by the good faith to prevent distortion of history and make wikipedia a better encyclopedia. She is the one who finally decided to propose this article for deletion after careful consideration (wrong citation, erroneous name ["Tsar Petro"], defamatory qualification ["foaming mouths"] =&gt; propaganda, ill-written and one-sided POV essay).

<li><b>Delete</b>: The article should be deleted. It is in its total a racist nationalist hate propaganda, reproduced by the extreme turkish racist nationalist anti-hellenic organisations (Grey Wolves, and militaristic turkish government agents, opposing the international recognition of he Genocide of the Armenians and West Asia Greeks and other Christians, permitted by the Turks.) It is like as if we had reproduced as a Wikipedia independent article named "Genocide of the Aryan Germans (permitted by the Jews in the 20th century)" the whole <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Rosenberg_3df4.html" title="Alfred Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a>'s book "The Myth of the Twentieth Century", instead of the valid articles about 20th century history! There is no such terms in worldwide academic-valid International History as "genocide", "terrorist organisations" as regarding the Greek War of Independence (which is revolution against conquerors). These terms are being currently used only by turkish nationalist propagndists, not by worlwide recognized academic historians.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this page. Its history is flavored with nationalistic undertones, turning upside down what social scientists have beem trying hard to do, namely, give genocides their appropriate "light" in history. A revolution and war of independence is defined as a genocide, in which case alll wars and revolutions and rebellions involving the killing of the oppressor defacto become genocides. This compromises the heuristic tool or use of the term genocide. What then is the difference between Holocaust and Armenian genocide on the one hand and wars of independence by people fighting against an external oppressor and conqueror? Thank you.

<dd>U do not know Greek, but u got my point;-). In fact, this is what more or less i say in Greek above, with also an invite to him to say something in Greek (with the note that it is really easy for a native Greek to understand if the other is a native Greek-speaker...). But judging by acts and comments, no Greek would ever say that he is "uncultured" and "racist".

<li><b>Keep and Correct:</b> I'm the creator of this article. First of all I'm neither a racist nor a fashist. I have friends all around the world including greeks and armenians. I just wanted to tell everybody what happened in Morea 180 years ago. This article is not written in a hatred manner. Everyone muslims of morea deserve to be remembered. My souces are all writting under the article; a long list of academical papers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Few words to those who talk about turkish-hate: Well, after 400 years of turkish reign in greece, greeks are still christian and greek speaking. But turks of Morea were totally exterminated after 1-2 years of greek reign. Some people critise the mis-spellings. They're right. I'II correct them.</p>
<p>I see some comments here citing the year AD 634. That is the year prophet Muhammed passed away. In those year Islam was only in Arabian Peninsula, even not in Jerusalem or in Iran. The ignorant greek nationalists have to learn so many stuff about Islamic history.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmorgil_be3c.html" title="User:Mmorgil">Mmorgil</a> (<a href="../../../m/m/o/User_talk%7EMmorgil_c87d.html" title="User talk:Mmorgil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mmorgil_9aa3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mmorgil">contribs</a>) 13:31, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Read the comments here. The language u use is by far not academic, unencyclopedic, full of hate. Your spelling mistakes indicate (as mentioned above by a fellow wikipedian) that u scanned a paper. the sources u have added are like footnotes that do not work. all these are suspicious enough concerning the reasons and the validity of the sources (if they indeed say what u claim they do). Lastly, keep Greeks and Islam aside... It was not a religious war, nor a crusade! it was a war for independence against the conquerors. and, btw, have in mind that the Greeks ("nationalists" as u say) have excellent relations with the islamic states. better than any western country, and by far better than Turkey itself.

<p>Hectorian. Do you mean, that you greeks are so innocent angels? Then please tell me the fate of turks of Mora and Crete. What happened to those people? Where are their graves? If you know it so much then Why dont you write an article about "Turks of Greece after 1821"</p>
<p>You, all greeks in Wikipedia, are so organised and protective. You all seem to be in a panic in a simple logic. If turks kill someone its "genocide", but if there are killed "normalities of a war". Blaming turks in front of the world and maybe gaining some benefits from it. Like you are doing since 180 years. Cry like a baby and maybe super powers give you a candy. Our lovely ridicilous former slaves&#160;:-))</p>
<p>Your claims about:"...war for independence against the conquerors" is funny. Greece lost the war in 1825. But England and Russia wrote the fate of war in Navorino. Greeks can never win a war. In its history greece always had a master power controlling it. You were our colony for 400 years then we sold you to Russia. Then England took you. Then USA and today EU. For greece its only about having a master.</p>

<dd>I would just advice to open a history book (U know, Grey Wolves' leaflets can poison your mind:)...). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 21:50, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Am I detecting an inferiority complex on the part of our Turkish friend? If so, then it is wholly justifiable in my opinion, I mean the main difference between Greece and Turkey is that standards of living in Greece are significantly higher than those in Turkey (although we must give the Turks some credit - after all, I do hear they do have one of the highest standards of living in the Third World). Perhaps the military dictatorship in place there won't let the economy blossom.</p>
<p>On the other point you raised, I think you should know Greeks really don't hate Muslims, <i>au contraire</i>, they get on together perfectly, and see what happens to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_Irenaios_87cc.html" title="Patriarch Irenaios">Greeks who don't follow that line</a>. Maybe this is why, unlike Turkey, Greece has yet to experience Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p>As for Russia, it's a known fact that Greece is Russia's mouthpiece in the EU, all former communist states in the EU despise Russia now, Greece is their only traditional and actual ally in Europe. This is obviously due to them saving us from <i><a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmitude</a></i> (Britain and especially France were more skeptical).</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to know the fate of the Muslims (a term which includes and is not equal to Turks) of Morea and Crete, they were repatriated to Turkey as part of the population exchanges directed under the Treaty of Lausanne. If you really want to compare the situations, see what George Horton in his book <i>the Blight of Asia</i> has to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"[o]ne of the cleverest statements circulated by the Turkish propagandists is to the effect that the massacred Christians were as bad as their executioners, that it was “50-50.”" On this issue he clarifies that "[h]ad the Greeks, after the massacres in the Pon­tus and at Smyrna, massacred all the Turks in Greece, the record would have been 50-50—almost." As an eye-witness, he also praises Greeks for their "conduct [...] toward the thousands of Turks residing in Greece, while the ferocious massacres were going on...", which according to his opinion was "one of the most inspiring and beautiful chapters in all that country’s history."</i></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Any admin coming here is probably waiting for a few more experienced users who may be deemed neutral in a Greek-Turkish conflict area. One (yes, only one) of the Turkish keep votes seems to be from an experienced user. The closing admin may actually ignore the "votes" of Turks and Greeks (many single purpose accounts on both sides) but also of Armenians and perhaps even of a "Russian" Belgian like me. Leaves four deletes and two keeps. It does not help that the two keeps were the first votes. But one of them did say (s)he could not see the page because of vandalism. Perhaps (s)he can have a fresh look at the page, now that it is semi-protected?--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 11:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
