<p>He now seems to be trying to circumvent this by creating a parallel or duplicate article at Asian tsunami : The earthquake.</p>
<p>As further evidence of bad faith, he had earlier used an anonymous IP User:203.120.68.68 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.120.68.68_ae04.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.120.68.68">contributions</a> 5 Jan – 7 Jan only) to spam every article in <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_f121.html" title="Category:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">Category:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> with links to <a href="http://www.asiantsunami.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.asiantsunami.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiantsunami.org/</a> , which indicates he has some kind of vested interest (perhaps financial?) in pursuing this. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:29, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because it was only created a few hours ago (copying most of the content of the original article) and because of the bad faith involved in its creation, this is a candidate for deletion and not for merging under <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">Wikipedia:Duplicate articles</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:49, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Wiki contributors, admins &amp; sysops. <b>You have been mislead by Curps</b>. Please see that article in question and decide for yourselves if deletion is a correct Wiki thing to do. I have decided not to pursue the re-naming of Curps's article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> and through consultation with other helpful Wikis, I have decided to start a series of Asian Tsunami articles on my own ... there is freedom to initiate such a move right&#160;? The articles in questions is proposed to drill deep in the subject in question. In Asian tsunami : The earthquake I have attempted to focus just on the earthquake that caused the Asian Tsunamis. In <a href="../../../t/i/m/Asian_tsunami_%7E_Time-line_cce4.html" title="Asian tsunami : Time-line">Asian tsunami : Time-line</a> (currently vandalised by Curps), I have drilled down to the exact minutes to minutes account of the waves of deadly tsunamis. I will be added other article in the Asian tsunami series like the humanitarian aspects, current news &amp; occurrences etc. because I think it is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 06:55, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Kenkam, you should not spam the above message to the Talk pages of everyone who has voted here so far. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 07:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Curps, you definition of spamming is grossly questionable. To 'spam' (by Wiki definition) is to broadcast unsolicited messages. My messages, on the contrary, to every contributors of this vote, is a communique rather than a spam. Your other accusation of me spamming your articles are also not acceptable. When I posted "asiantsuani.org" (a forum site for relief work) to the specific relevant sections (perfectly OK because you have other forums &amp; blogs there too) you deliberately deleted my entries and launched unwarranted accusations at me for spamming ... is that the right thing to do, Curps&#160;?? I have left the deletes as it is because if the originator of the article does not appreciate the particular contributions (though very relevant by me), I will never force it on him. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 07:39, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia's common-law policy disallows article forks as a method of resolving disputes. Calling Curps a vandal for attempting to follow general Wikipedia consensus on the article name is hardly a way to win support. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 07:24, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Cyrius. I resent being spammed on this issue, which is more likely to result in a ban. Clearly people other than Curps are making their opinions clear about this article, so it can't be considered simply one user's viewpoint. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:02, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Terrible title. No merge. User's disregard for Wikipedia policy and consensus is troubling. I applaud his energy but would prefer to see it spent improving articles rather than quibbling over names. He cannot proclaim ignorance; he was well aware that <i>not a single user</i> (aside from a possible sock puppet) <i>voted in favor of the proposed name change.</i> Kenkam, you also seem overly attached to the idea of "ownership" of articles. The articles are neither yours nor Curps's; it does not matter who initiated them.

<p><b>Comments on Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</b> Hi all, I have listened to BanyanTree's advised &amp; visited <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> ... found out some interesting pointers to share with you.</p>
<p><b>Key policies</b> 1) Avoid bias. Articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing differing views on a subject fairly and sympathetically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was Curps Neutral when he deleted other points of view, even if they were differing. The term "Asian Tsunami" is an accept term or name for the event that happened on the 26th Dec 2004, covered by news media and the net. Blatantly calling <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> is silly because there have been hundreds of earthquakes very week since 26th Dec 2004 but there is only one deadly tsunami that has been named by the media as the "Asian Tsunami".<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Point is, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the name of the article that already existed. Renaming an article that lots of people are following is a big change. That article is in a state of flux at the moment, because the tsunami is a current event. After a few months, things will settle down. You'd be better off making whatever contributions you have to the existing article, and if, later, consensus develops that it is badly named it might be moved then. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 12:53, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the earthquake was in the COAST OF NORTHERN SUMATRA (if we want to be precise) not exactly in the Indian Ocean per say ... 2004 Indian Ocean is wrong big time&#160;!! There were more than a few hundreds earthquakes in the Indian Ocean in 2004 too&#160;!! <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 08:26, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The earthquake epicentre was about 150km west of far-northern Sumatra. In the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean does not begin at the west coast of Sumatra there, it begins at the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Sumatra is well and truly IN the Indian Ocean. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Image%7EIndianocean.PNG_1c91.html" title="Image:Indianocean.PNG">Click here</a> for a map of the Indian Ocean. As for how specific the title should be, I don't know. But it's already been to a vote once, and you were the only person in favour of your proposed title. Finally, it is not entirely relevant whether our title matches what the mainstream media has been calling it. We have redirects in place that also show up in search engine results with the same content, so people searching for any of the titles will be able to find the Wikipedia article. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 09:22, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Similarly, if you dip your toes in the water at the eastern coast of Northern Sumatra, you are dipping your toes in the Indian Ocean. The earthquake happened in the Indian Ocean.

<li>Kenkam, if something is off the coast then it is in the ocean. And 150 kilometers off the coast of Sumatra is well into the Indian Ocean.

</li>
<li>Finally, with regards to the three-revert rule which you have listed this under, you have already twice reverted the addition of the VfD notice to the top of Asian tsunami : The earthquake. Adding this message is a matter of Wikipedia policy, which you now seem familiar with, so why did you revert Curps with a edit summary like <i>"Deliberate vandalism by User&#160;: Curps"</i>? - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 09:22, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>On the other hand Curps has deleted my comments too (he reinstated it) and moved articles without first seeking move consensus, when the intent of the new article are not about earthquakes in indian oceans but about the aftermath of the Asian Tsunami (true to it title) ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenkam_7e3c.html" title="User:Kenkam">kenkam</a> 10:13, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Kenkam, you keep saying "Curps has moved articles without consensus". Can you clarify what you mean by this? Do you mean that sections of articles have been moved around within one article, or that articles have been renamed without discussion? If the latter, were these substantial articles, or duplicates of larger articles that needed merging and redirecting? Did anyone else complain about these edits? You need to be exact (and preferable point to the appropriate page histories) when making claims like this. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 13:03, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
