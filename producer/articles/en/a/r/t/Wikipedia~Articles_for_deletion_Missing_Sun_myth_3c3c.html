<li>hello? you don't need a vfd for this. Simply <b>redirect</b> to the original, any user can do that. If I remember correctly, we do have a MoS guideline to capitalize celestial bodies like <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> etc. Not that I care, though, clearly one of these needs to be a redirect, never mind which. If people decide they want the article at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_Sun_myth_4d77.html" title="Missing Sun myth">Missing Sun myth</a> after all, the place to go is <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, the MoS says we capitalize the bodies when used in a scientific/astronomical context. The example on <a href="../../../c/a/p/Wikipedia%7ECapitalization_1e76.html" title="Wikipedia:Capitalization">Wikipedia:Capitalization</a> "the sun was warm today" (or something like that) clearly shows that in other cases it is lowercase.

<dl>
<dd>No, the point is quite relevant, you just aren't following along. If you made an entire article bold, breaking Manual of Style guidelines, it'd be undone. If you miscapitalizae the word sun, you are also breaking the guidelines.

<dd>While I agree with you in theory, Gabrielsimon, it is the copy-paste one that has to go. Once it is gone, we can try to work out an arrangement by which "<a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_sun_motif.html" title="Missing sun motif">Missing sun motif</a>" can be moved back to its original name.

<dd>Putting the article back at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_Sun_myth_4d77.html" title="Missing Sun myth">Missing Sun myth</a> involves not one but two blatant errors (improper capitalization and incorrect word choice) and isn't at all likely to happen. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 15:13, July 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Nope, I just fixed the problems with the article. The edit war began when people ignored the errors and decided to return it to the original incorrect version out of personal spite (as shown in the RfC that already happened over the article). And if it is a petty issue, why is that you feel so strongly about it that you kept reverting it even after the VfD started so that the pages in question had to be protected? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 16:08, July 18, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You reverted the page more often than I did. This is a petty issue, and you are the one enforcing your determining of "errors" based on a Wikipedia <i>guideline</i>. When consensus did not support your point of view, you acted against the wishes of those engaged in the discussion and moved the page and you used snide comments to discredit your opposition.

<dl>
<dd>Consensus does support my view... the only people who do not are the original article's creator and two people (yourself and Gabrielsimon) who actively looked through my edits to undo things I did. What you call consensus was really just a gang up of people who didn't care about the article and wanted to get back at me personally... Now that more people have weighed in they are overwhelmingly against you. And your failed RfC on this issue further proves the point. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:26, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Only if by "consensus" you mean the original article author and two editors with a proven history making incredibly bad decisions solely to undo changes I made without having any history or knowledge of the articles in question... Now that editors who are willing to actually look at the article have done so, consensus is clearly established showing that you were wrong. You already lost your RfC, you've lost all these other disputes you've caused just to be difficult, isn't it about time you just gave it a rest and stopped your petty harassment for a change? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:53, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because [[Missing sun motif] wasn't a copy &amp; paste, it was moved, following standard Wikipedia policy concerning moves, taking the article, history and talk file with it.

<li><a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">User:AI</a> and then <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">User:Elvenscout742</a> requested that I'd vote here, althought I find it rather amusing that the whole thing began about a disagreement about capitalization. Now, in the old <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaterasu.html" title="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaterasu&amp;oldid=1106030" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaterasu&amp;oldid=1106030" rel="nofollow">edit</a> (couple of years ago) I used the term <i>I am familiar with</i> and, as far as I know, capitalization is irrelevant. However, I know more about history than mythological studies and more about <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Jung_ba49.html" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> than <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Campbell_2650.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>. If there is another, more scholarly or official term for these mythological tales, I'm afraid that you have to consult people who have <i>majored</i> in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_mythology.html" title="Comparative mythology">comparative mythology</a> and <i>state your sources</i>. My information in that respect is second-hand.</li>
<li>Now, as far as I can see, the article in question is a copy of the other one. Since WP usually tries to preserve the edit history of the original text, the copy-paste <i>should</i> go. Regardless of the final name of the article, at least one version of the "missing sun myth" should stay at least as a <b>redirect</b> (and mentioned in the article), since it is in use at least in the circles I know - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 12:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
