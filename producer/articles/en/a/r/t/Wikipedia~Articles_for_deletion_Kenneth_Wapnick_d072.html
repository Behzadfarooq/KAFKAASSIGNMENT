<dd><b>Comment</b> Just a little background here. The editor in question who started this article is not in any way a "close friend" of Kenneth Wapnick's. He is a "student" of A Course In Miracles (which means that he reads the book), as well as a "student" of Kenneth Wapnick's (which means he reads books by Kenneth Wapnick, books about ACIM interpretation). To my knowledge, the two men have never even met.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I hope everyone is aware that Ste4k has a personal vendetta against all ACIM-related articles on Wikipedia. In addition to supporting the deletion attempt of the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, this user has initiated deletion attempts of the following ACIM-related articles: <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, Kenneth Wapnick, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>. And on the main ACIM page, this editor will not accept anything, not even the official sites of Foundation for ACIM and Foundation for Inner Peace, as acceptable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a “bad faith” deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as “verifiable” websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for finally using the word "believe". That is all I interjected into your above statements, that you <i>believe</i> this page should be deleted because.... That is hardly "tampering". And I did not understand that those comments were viewed as your own "personal" comments, as they are largely verbatim transcriptions of Wikipedia policy. Therefore, all I felt I was doing was copyediting Wikipedia policy which I felt was incorrectly displayed. My apologizies. And you fail to recognize that when you nominate more than half a dozen ACIM-related articles for deletion, <i>you</i> begin to look suspect. The only thing I could assume is that perhaps you are a conservative Christian who doesn't like ACIM. Thankfully, I've been enlightened to the fact that you have a history of behaving this way with articles. You simply don't understand that there are better ways to resolve content disputes than to nominate an article for deletion. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 23:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment by nom</b> There aren't any sources in any of the "Course in Miracles" category that have any biographical information on Wapnick. Merging this information without any references will compromise the integrity of the newer version of the article on the book. Any of the other superfluous information on Wapnick's biography (this article under consideration) is already present in <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">the newer page</a> and would be redundant in a merge. The picture from this article has already been merged to the newer article on the book. I'd like everyone to reconsider their votes here since many changes have occurred over the entire category. Thanks. Ste4k 15:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
