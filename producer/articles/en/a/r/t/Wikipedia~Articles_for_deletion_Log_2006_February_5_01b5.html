<p>You people use the words "spam", "dishonest" and "hideous" to describe the company page for Techlogica? Its almost as if you don't even know the meaning of these words. Spam? No, spam comes in your email, our page isnt being forced on anyone. Dishonest? No, I reverted my page after what in my opinion was vandalism. Attempting to delete an article for no reason, now that I would consider dishonest. Very strange how you (Perfecto in particular) seem to be on some kind of crusade to get our page deleted for no reason other than the fact that you don't like it. Our page isn't any different than the other company pages listed here. It was simply a resource for someone interested in our company to see some general information. This whole thing has been very silly, asinine in fact, and very juvenile. I'll never understand how people get off on making things hard for other people.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>, especially in light of the above statement. Juvenile actions like this won't save your page, regardless of whether the nominator has a bias or not. Your company is simply not notable under the guidelines set in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and if you don't care for that, then get yourself an account and work to change the guidelines there. Coming here and expecting what is essentially free advertising is both disingenious and contrary to good company ethics and thus shows a company clearly needing a gimmick to survive...just like so many other fly-by-night companies that have come trying to get "free Wiki ads".--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 01:06, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I was the original <i>prod</i>der, not knowing that there appears to be a general "keep" consensus for schools. It still seems to me that a completely generic school (in whatever county), with nothing to distinguish it from hundreds like it, is no more notable and inclusion-worthy than a generic road, tree, house, etc. As to systemic bias, I wasn't aware that this ought to be a notability consideration - or do we now have an "affirmative action" policy for non-Western content? -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This appears to be an English language fee-paying school (a Public School in the sense used in England rather than America, I feel), and therefore does have some note and separation beyond that of the immediate geographical location. As such, and given that the article states the school advertises in in-flight magazines, it would appear to be more notable than the average school, and therefore may well warrant an article in its own right, so <b>weak keep</b>.

<li>Yes, I have often wondered why people consider deleting articles such as this to be such an important job.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Acctualy we are only passiv readers of the english wiki. Since my english isn't that great I prefer editing the german wikipedia... That's, again, why I had to create an Account here just to take part on this discussion on the article... Anyway. I guess if pages like Zeldapedia (or lots of other <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWiki_communities_9539.html" title="Category:Wiki communities">examples</a>) may exists, there is a eligibility to keep <a href="../../../s/2/3/S23_Wiki_0080.html" title="S23 Wiki">S23 Wiki</a>. It's no reason to delete a page just because it has been started by someone like Jarlaxle, who may have started some zany pages, I think. But we can see it as an positive side-effect, that, as I have heard, some guys from the s23-comunity are workin on an improvment of <a href="../../../s/2/3/S23_Wiki_0080.html" title="S23 Wiki">S23 Wiki</a>&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7ETook77_7d5c.html" title="User:Took77">Took77</a> 11:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted: I can't find anything about this supposed Jedi online other than mirrors of the wiki page. Furthermore, have talked to multiple star wars fanatics who have no recall of him at all. I strongly suspect that someone made this character up and put him on Wikipedia. In any case, highly non-notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:04, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well Kinu, I'm glad you're able to just use your resources of Google and IMDB to find information. Here's a better question for you. If you're judging the information I'm submitting. I think we need to verify your information of being a graduate of Economics from Yale University's Davenport College. If that's the case, why are you doing technical support for Wikipedia. Shouldn't you have a job doing economic research for a Wall Street firm. I'd be hard pressed to see proof that you actually graduated form Yale with an economics degree
<ul>
<li>Please try to keep this discussion <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civil</a> and relevant to the matter at hand. I have not personally attacked you by making the aforementioned edit; it was a judgment call based on the fact that the information was not readily <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. We are more than open to a source that would verify this information, and if it is indeed true, it would be reinserted in the page and kept (assuming a lack of deletion per this discussion). Again, I am not trying to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite</a>, just explain. And, as a show of good faith as to verifying information, <a href="http://yalestation.org/directory/person?id=5d66c171-dae2-49da-80f2-326184656477" class="external text" title="http://yalestation.org/directory/person?id=5d66c171-dae2-49da-80f2-326184656477" rel="nofollow">here's my YaleStation profile</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 08:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well there are plenty of facts out there to prove the information. I'm sorry that it's all not Google accessible. Not all information is found on google. Plenty of Court documents and Mission statements from him are out there, sorry if they're not on google.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was aware of the article history. I didn't mention it becaue I didn't want to overly complicate what I expected to be a quick consensus to delete, after which I could restore the original article. But now that it's been mentioned: It was <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">Dbenbenn</a>, an admin, who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=23300312&amp;oldid=17622930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bright_green&amp;diff=23300312&amp;oldid=17622930" rel="nofollow">originally blanked the article</a> and turned it into a redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a>, with the odd rationale (according to his edit summary) that there was "no content here" (which, as you can see from the diff, is factually incorrect). <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> then nominated the redirect for deletion, which I can only presme failed, as <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoph_6de1.html" title="User:Stoph">Stoph</a> removed the RfD tag a little over two weeks later. It was then the anonymous user User:71.37.1.43 that hijacked the page and turned it into the environmental neologism that I nominated for deletion a few hours ago. We may have to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> on the anon user's actions, as <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> rather confusingly says, "Note: If all you want to do is replace a currently existing redirect with an actual article, you do not need to list it here. Turning redirects into fleshed-out encyclopedic articles is wholly encouraged at Wikipedia. <b>Be bold.</b>" I personally don't believe that means you can change it into an article on an <i>entirely different subject</i>, but you have to admit it's pretty damn vague. Anyway, now that I've explained all that: As long as <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> has already reverted, I'm going to revert back a little further to the last version of the true article stub about the color itself. (This was a legit article from the moment it was created, as there are a large number of articles about colors on WP; see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_colors.html" title="List of colors">List of colors</a>, which to this day includes a link to the long-since-hijacked <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_green.html" title="Bright green">Bright green</a>.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 07:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see no problem with the version you've reverted back to... I'd like to say that when people think "bright green," they think of #66FF00, as its a pretty standard version of it. It's a lot more useful in this form than redirecting to "just plain old" green, and I'd <b>keep</b> it in this form. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 07:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whatever the final consensus is on this article is fine by me - I only discovered it while digging around trying to figure out what was going on with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_February_5_01b5.html#Bright_green" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 February 5">bright green</a> article - but I do want to say that I'm not sure Salix alba's cites are particularly mainstream. Bruce Sterling appears to have had a very long personal relationship with the <i>Whole Earth Magazine</i> (which is out of business), so it's not at all surprising they let him edit an issue. As for <b>Time Digital</b>, it was not <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a> magazine, but an offshoot magazine about the Net that didn't last very long (and doesn't appear to even have a WP stub about it). --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 17:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am quite leery of a sociological topic that is getting a lot of current media coverage, particularly in this era of Fox News.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a well-written article that explains the concept's significance quite well, although it could probably use more citation. It's not the same thing as <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hikikomori.html" title="Hikikomori">hikikomori</a> and I feel it deserves its own article (but I'm no expert on Japanese social concepts...) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a> 07:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The concept of Yuppies has been around for decades. Can you establish a history for this term longer than the past few years? Otherwise it seems like popular slang. At the same time, I'd like to see some evidence that this is a recent social phenomenon, and not something that has happened almost everywhere throughout history -- I mean come on, kids living with their parents is nothing new. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 19:43, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Kids living with their parents is nothing new, but a large fraction of people in their twenties feeling no real pressure to marry or contribute to household expenses, and spending almost all their income on discretionary purchases, is fairly new... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 20:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Especially in a society where early marriage is normal and expected. Oh, and the term "yuppie" dates to 1984, and I seriously doubt that you would have used the "only the past few years" test in the 1988 equivalent of Wikipedia. "Recent sociological phenomenon" is, strangely enough, recent. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Oh, I don't know, maybe because it's a significant alteration in a conservative society's behavior and affects everything from economics to the country's low birthrate. The multiple Google Scholar and Google Book hits might have been the tiniest clue as to significance.

<li>Why do I ask rhetorical questions? Because this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not some spurious letter to the editor about "those darn kids who won't get jobs."

Calling it <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParasite_singles_b147.html" title="Talk:Parasite singles">bullshit</a></i> or <i>crackpot theory</i> does not aid a factual discussion.

<li><i>For future voters on this article, copied from The <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Google test</a></i>: "This technique works reasonably well for weeding out hoaxes, fictions, and personal theories and hypotheses. It can also be used to ascertain whether a topic is of sufficiently broad interest to merit inclusion in the wiki, though this application is highly subject to bias...In some cases, articles have been kept with Google hit counts as low as 15 and some claim that this undermines the validity of the Google test in its entirety. However, in fact, this reflects on the rather uneven and subjective nature of the Wikipedia:Articles for deletion process more than on the usefulness of the Google test. The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an imperfect tool used to produce a general gauge of notability. It is not and should never be considered definitive." .<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadangry_e9cc.html" title="User:Madangry">Madangry</a> 00:58, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s>If it didn't assert notability, it would have been speedied.</s> Although on second thought, I think only biographies not asserting notability are speedieable. I think my point still stands, though. By default, anything on Wikipedia is notable enough for inclusion as per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The original author's behavior is not grounds for deleting the article if it otherwise meets inclusion criteria.

<li>Why do you think it is relevant to focus on one and only one of the indications of notability I mentioned above. Why do you think Google Scholar <i>alone</i> gives an accurate picture of an academic who has been active since the 1960s, when it has a bias towards electronic publications from the last few years? The fact that his dissertation from 1965 has been re-published thrice and translated to Swedish, a language with a much smaller book market than English, says something, doesn't it? (BTW, checking the <a href="../../../k/v/k/KVK_1aae.html" title="KVK">KVK</a>, I now find a German translation from 1966, as well as a German translation of one of his other books, in German titled <i>Hiroshima: die Entscheidung für den Abwurf der Bombe</i>.)

<li>My connection was not a coincedence, emperor Cenestrad] came across the article while I was triing to make an article about the term panty waste, and suggested that it would make a legitimate article. I am not as knowing as many wiipedians, so its hard for me to contribute on some of the more comples articles...but this one hadnt been written yet, so it was a bit easier. The museum is a real place, although it is only open one for a couple of weeks every year. I think with help it may become a pretty good article, and will attempo to kep working on it even while its being considered for deletion.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">pickelbarrel</a> 18:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no indication that this is anything more than a one-time exhibit in a gallery. It seems to have opened in 2003, and it doesn't look like the exhibit is there anymore. Obviously we can't make articles about every art gallery exhibit. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 19:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I had found info of at least three years(i beleive) of this exhibit running. But I was blocked for a month for writing this article before i could add the info(My block was eventually reverted). I will try to relocate the information, but dont assume that just because we only have the one date so far, that is the only date. I am also Triing to get ahold of Ricky Lee to see if she can add info. If you do not like the article I respect your oppinion, but I do hope the silliness of blocking editors because they have written an article that the knowing ones veiw as being beneath wikipedia ceases.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I tried the "more reasonable" <i>"panty waste" +museum</i> search, and only around 10 of the first 50 hits (297 total) were about the actual exhibit; they were mostly about other topics with use of "panty-waste" as misspellings of the invective "panty-waist". - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 07:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So that would average out at about 60 hits by my math...I think that checking "panty waste" + "art" might give a more accurate result of related articles, allowing for articles that talk about pieces featured in at Panty Waste as well <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">pickelbarrel</a> 17:34, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A more reasonable search of "Panty Waste" + museum netted over 300 hits.

So while I won't argue that this small following doesn't exist, the Google hits are out of distortion because these are not, by and large, websites about or even discussions mentioning phooning. Many are individual photos uploaded to shutterfly, etc. before being sent in to the phoon.com website. Davilla 23:02, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is another of a series of made up genres on Wikipedia. The term Post-Black Metal doesnt exist, because the bands advertised are figure heads of the black metal scene (See the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Metal_8348.html" title="Black Metal">Black Metal</a> article. It also claims its a genre that includes <b>black metal bands that do new things</b> - which doesnt exclude them from being Black Metal. The term Post-Black Metal, also claims that the Black Metal scene is no longer prominent, when its grown to be a leading pioneer in Metal Music, as <b><a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_Metal_b381.html" title="Heavy Metal">Heavy Metal</a></b> previously was. The article also makes claim it isnt the same as Symphonic Black Metal, but then goes on to repeat the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_Black_Metal_d618.html" title="Symphonic Black Metal">Symphonic Black Metal</a> article, and its subsidary on the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_Metal_dd70.html" title="Symphonic Metal">Symphonic Metal</a> article. As such, this article is somebodys obvious distaste for a minute number of Black Metal bands, and has No Notability, No Sources, uses Weasel Language and is overall a complete Neoglistic Strawman Attack at Black Metal bands that do not conform soley to the original sound of Black Metal. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 13:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I visited the story on the "International Thespian Festival" provided as a reference in the article. It is a <i>high school</i> affair, which leads me to believe he's in <i>high school</i>. The listing of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Brothers_bcca.html" title="Blood Brothers">Blood Brothers</a> under <i>Broadway</i> as I mentioned above was definitely misleading. No wonder IBDB didn't know who he was: it's amateur theater. Seems to be vanity.

<p>Some local notice paper at an apartment building. Hardly of any interest to anyone outside the local area, but hey, this is an encyclopedia, and it's supposed to note all things in the world and not play elitist games.

<li><b>Comment:</b> is it really posted directly at the wall, rather than on a board of some kind? In either case, Wikipedia lacks either The wall of the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, where the notice on chaining bycycles was posted or The board on the wall of the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, where the notice on chaining bycycles was posted. A merge of these important, encyclopedic topics with the article on the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland would obviously be the correct thing to do in this case. We also lack a List of notices posted in the corridor of the ground floor at Hietalahdenkatu 7A, Helsinki, Finland, in chronological order.

<li>In response to the above comments, the key virtue of Wikipedia, apart from not having to pay people to insert and edit articles, would have to be inclusivity and scope. Here was the possibility to have an encyclopedia so comprehensive that no other could possibly compete. Even the most obscure facts could be embraced at no cost, apart from a few kilobytes of disk space. This notice in Hietalahti, Helsinki is certainly a very obscure fact and not very notable at all. However, it is a real notice and its existence can be verified simply by visiting the apartment building in Hietalahti. How many people does the notice need to be notable to in order to be included? Comments like "this is about as notable as my breakfast this morning" are spiteful, unnecessary and are simply a case of shooting oneself in the foot, by alienating people. Tragically, it seems that Wikipedia is failing miserably to play to its strengths of immediacy and inclusivity. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:13, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> While I have some sympathy with what's being said, it was fairly clear that this was a test Afd to make a point. The virtue of an encyclopedia is that it can give some context and is not just random data. At this level of detail, too much is less useful than too little (rather like Mark Twains German mapmakers). <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Carlson-Sabelli et al. (1992) and Carlson-Sabelli, Sabelli, and Hale (1994) have criticized the traditional sociometric measurement for (a) focusing on choices and ignoring why choices are made, (b) treating opposites (choice versus rejection and indifference) as mutually exclusive categories or as the opposite ends of a continuum (i.e., love and hate toward the same person can coexist resulting in push and pull processes operating simultaneously), and (c) using a linear scale whereby choices are rank ordered from least to most. Carlson-Sabelli et al. (1994) described a sociodynamic approach that uses the traditional nomination procedure (with or without ranking) along with the measurement of opposite processes of attraction and repulsion via the "plane phase of opposites"--or less technically "the diamond of opposites"--toward a person, activity, or opinion (p. 162). The diamond of opposites can be used to gather data in writing or in action. To use it in action, draw a large diamond in the center of a room and ask group members to place themselves within the marked areas of the diamond in a location that best reflects the intensity of their combined positive and negative feelings toward a significant other. In Carlson-Sabelli et al.'s (1994) scheme, the bottom vertex of the diamond represents indifferent, neutral, or zero feelings, and the top vertex represents contradictory, ambiguous feeling characterized by intense but opposite (equally positive and negative) feeling. Thus, the area within the diamond of opposites is divided into four quadrants: (a) bottom (weak feelings of both attraction and repulsion), (b) top (strong contradictory feelings of both attraction and repulsion), (c) left (attraction), and (d) right (repulsion) (see Figure 1). According to Carlson-Sabelli et al. (1994), the diamond can be used to prepare interpersonal profiles for a variety of criteria such as harmony-conflict, approach-avoidance, and attraction-repulsion represented as opposite axes of separate diamonds. Respondents are asked to rank order their significant others in terms of how much time the respondent (a) wishes to spend with their significant others (ideal rank order) and (b) actually spends with their significant others (actual rank order). Next, they locate their significant others by marking points in each of the diamonds (harmony-conflict, attraction-repulsion, and approach-avoidance) first to indicate the actual rank order and second to indicate the ideal rank order. Connecting the dots within each diamond provides interpersonal profiles (for criteria of interest) for significant relationships, which can then be compared. Carlson-Sabelli et al. mentioned that their approach can be used in conjunction with the SNI (Treadwell et al., 1993) to determine social distances. (See Carlson-Sabelli et al., 1992, 1994, for more information on the mathematics of the sociodynamic approach.)</p>

<dd>The article and quote considered in combination indicate a highly confused use of two continua to form two-dimensional space. I have explained why on <a href="../../../d/i/a/Talk%7EDiamond_of_opposites_4fa1.html" title="Talk:Diamond of opposites">Talk:Diamond_of_opposites</a>. No citations indicate the 'diamond of opposites' has received any recognition in psychometric literature as a scaling method. I have removed it from psychometrics category. If it has sufficient notability as a method in psychodrama (and I have no comment on this), then it should be presented as that, not a scaling method in psychometrics. The fact that it was placed in the category of psychometrics suggests to me it should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolon_0029.html" title="User:Holon">Holon</a> 11:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b> I just found out that "Diamond of opposites" technique is included in the test for becoming psychodramatist in the US. It is used as sociometry measure. I think that this does make this entry notable enough for Wikipedia article and for inclusion in the scaling methods and psychometrics category (psychodrama after all deals with psychology!). <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 19:20, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I previously removed it from the Educational psychology category because it has never been used in peer-reviewed educational psychology research. But editing the categories is a very different matter from deletion. Also, I'm not sure it is useful to debate the quality of the idea itself as a way to decide deletion (omigod that would wipe out most of the articles on pop culture!) -- rather, the wikipedian question seems to be whether the method is notable enough to warrant an article. Prefering to err on the side of inclusion, seeing that it has been used in peer-reviewed research, and hoping to rehabilitate <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> into a great wikipedian&#160;;-) I am sticking with my keep vote. Lakinekaki, perhaps you should post an external link to the certification information you mention above if it's on the web. I'd suggest a compromise where Lakinekaki commits to not categorizing the article as psychometric and removes the psychometric links in "See also" to persuade <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolon_0029.html" title="User:Holon">Holon</a> to change his vote. By the way, I think the article is substantially better now, and could benefit from further improvement. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesbit_c111.html" title="User:Nesbit">Nesbit</a> 19:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree Nesbit. So long as it's not represented as something it isn't, I have no problem with inclusion of this article. It should not be referred to as a scaling method or in the category of psychometrics without appropriate references. My reason for voting to delete is that it was unambiguously entered as a scaling method in the category of psychometrics, which creates serious doubt in my mind regarding knowledge of the subject matter. These doubts remain, but I'm quite happy to abstain from voting if your proposed compromise is satisfactory in Lakinekaki's mind (either that, or appropriate references are provided).

Certainly he is an impressive force at running, i have seen his photo many times in the local news papers, and on saturday night i was treated to a magnificent performance of "The Symphony for Solo Piano" by C.V<a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkan.html" title="Alkan">Alkan</a> from the Smithster, he is one of the few pianists to master this composer, well up there with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc-Andre_Hamelin_1a40.html" title="Marc-Andre Hamelin">Marc-Andre Hamelin</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ogdon_a89a.html" title="John Ogdon">John Ogdon</a> in terms of tehnique and musicality, I really believe he is worthy of an article.</p>

<li><b>Save</b> I have also have had the pleasure of eating in his Curry House, simply georgous curries. He is an amzing cross country runner having competed in all the major cross country championships throughout the UK, so what gives you the right to delete his article? Further, he is an a talented tiddlywinks player, currently running the school tiddlywinks club at Adams' Grammar School in Shropshire, where he teaches the German language. As a friend of Robin I disagree with the deletion of this page. I was also stood with the camera crew on the set when Robin performed his stunt double for Les Battersby off Coronation Street.</li>

<dd>Continuing, with a reality check: a search of a database of the Boston Globe and Boston Herald for about the last twenty years for exact phrase "Pandemonium Books" gives ten hits, <i>none of which are articles about the bookstore</i> or mention it other than in passing, in lists of bookstores or retailers. Eight are book signing announcements; one is an article about a locally produced magazine, "New Genre," with Pandemonium mentioned at the end as one of five retailers selling it; one is in a long list of places selling First Night buttons. Compare 289 (!) hits on "Brattle Book Shop" (a redlink, you'll note). The most recent, "Downtown Crossing is Losing Its Essence," December 1, 2005, p. 6, laments the loss of local institutions but rejoices that "Thankfully, some venerable Downtown Crossing destination establishments still thrive. The jeweler E.B. Horn, the Brattle Book Shop, the newly renovated Paramount Theatre, Lambert's open-air fruit and flower stand, the pinhole camera-sized Bromfield Camera." "Brattle Book Shop" appears six times in headlines; "Brattle Book Shop's Kenneth Gloss to speak in Manchester," "From across America: Offers of Help for the Brattle Book Shop," "Brattle Book Shop Reopens." "WordsWorth books" (in Harvard Square) gets 623 hits, and a quick check suggests that most <b>are</b> about the store, not the poet, and "Kate's Mystery Books" gets 192. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not arguing that it's notable because of its status in the Boston-area market, but its status in the specialty fantasy/science fiction/horror market.

<li>Nothing happened to "going back roughly 50 years"; that's just one of the older web references I've found so far. Web references aren't everything. It's well-known in its field; its activities have been frequently reported by the major trade magazine covering its field; and it hosts a relatively large number of notable-author events, indicating it's viewed as significant (especially for an independent bookstore) by publishers in the field. Hey, what happened to those "two dozen bookstores" in your area?

It's treated as a notable enterprise in its specialty field, by relevant publishers and authors, and by the major trade magazine covering its field. And that shows notability under Wikipedia criteria. That Wikipedia covers a particular field badly (as with your reference to possibly notable specialty retailers without articles) is hardly a reason to make its coverage worse. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 03:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The links you yourself provided show that dozens of independent bookstores host book signings every day of every week. That means none of them are a notable enterprise even in their own specialty field. I need something to set this apart from what I'm guessing must be thousands of other bookstores. The reason all those other bookstores don't have articles is simple - every article would be the same! Just the name and location would be different. If you'd like to make a list of every such bookstore, that's another story (I think it would get Afd'ed as well...), but don't put the whole Wikipedia world to sleep by acting like each one of them is worth its own article. That would - as one clever guy said recently - turn Wikipedia into the Yellow Pages. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 04:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't tell if you're being silly or malicious now. Arguing that a business can't be notable unless it's unique is so plainly contrary to Wikipedia policy that it's either bad faith or completely unreasonable. Let's try the argument out in a different context. "Dozens of actors appear in movies every day of every week. That means none of them are notable, even in their own field." Let's get busy; where do we find the SAG/AFTRA membership lists?! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 04:42, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Huge difference. Every actor has a high degree of uniqueness. Do you think Silence of the Lambs would be unaffected if you swapped Jack Nicholson in for Anthony Hopkins? Of course not. Bookstores are cookie-cutter. Bookstore X is 95% the same as bookstore Y and 97% the same as bookstore Z - and quite often X, Y and Z are all on one stretch of road. How boring would it be if you just copied and pasted the same article from X to Y and then to Z - with only a sentence different? And there was nothing else you could think of to distinguish them? And then you did the same for the other 40 bookstores in the city and then again for the 80 or so more in the rest of the county, etc., etc... Then, you have ---- the Yellow Pages. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 05:11, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Every actor has a high degree of uniqueness"? That's ridiculous. You want to take a personal position that bookstores can't be notable, fine, but it's a position a large number of authors disagree with, based on informed experience. Especially in specialty markets. You want Wikipedia to be a tool listing only successful corporate enterprises, fine, hold that opinion. But it's not, and shouldn't be, Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure what's ridiculous about that. Every actor has a different list of TV shows or movies or whatever. What is supposedly interesting about this bookstore? Do they have a different set of books? A unique brand of games? Have they made the news for anything except for being the 93rd stop on a book-signing tour for some author I've never heard of? I'm not saying bookstores can't be notable - just that this one isn't. I'm also not saying that only successful ones can be notable - just interesting ones. I figure either you have an affinity for this place because it's nearby - which means you want the article for vanity reasons - or you're a general inclusionist - which means there's no point in me arguing further. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 20:06, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Do they have a different set of books?" Yes, that's pretty much what specialty market retailers carry. Where the standard local bookstore might carry 1-2% of the genre titles in print, and a chain superstore 20-25%, a top-tier specialty market store would aim at carrying 75-90% of the available mass market titles. It would typically carry books from 50-150 small press/specialty publishers that aren't made available through general retail channels. At the market's peak, the top-tier SFFH stores would carry 100-250 independent magazines that didn't have general distribution; that number is smaller now, since many of them were subsidized enterprises that have moved to the web. They're typically run and staffed by people with expertise and influence in the specific field. "Have they made the news for anything except being the 93rd stop on a book-signing tour for some author I've never heard of?" Who really cares? Unless you can accurately claim that you're familiar with virtually all the significant authors in the world, you're just declaring that <b>Wikipedia promotes aggressive ignorance</b>, and that's just bad policy. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 23:29, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Time to come clean. I've been here since 2003, and not all my contributions have been... stellar. All the stuff I actually made up was either discovered or turned in by me when I reformed. However, there are still a lot of things I think probably deserve to be evaluated as to whether or not they deserve to live.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> "List of real people appearing in fictional context", <b>Weak keep</b> "List of mythical and religious beings appearing in fictional context" (which is much, much lower-quality and less interesting, but still has tons of potential if future editors spiff it up). No justification for deletion; "too long" is not a reason, in itself, to completely eliminate a page, and it confuses me that you'd list these with so many much less interesting and valuable pages. There are countless ways to combat excessive length, like subdividing alphabetically, or by work of fiction (i.e. "List of real people appearing in novels", "List of real people appearing in fictional television series", etc.!). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:18, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ted Hamelin wrote songs which have compiled over 250,000 downloads. The song "SOS" pushed Lincoln Park out of the #1 spot on the power pop top 100 in the world on mp3.com. All verified. There have been numerous Canadian television shows documenting this. Ted Hamelin was also nominated for producer of the year for producing the Tone cd "Brand New Lunatic". This indie cd broke the top 100 chart in Canada and was in major rotation on Toronto's #1 modern rock station the Edge. He was up against Bruce Fairburn who produced AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue etc. <b>Do Not Delete</b> per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> looking at qualifications qualifies in atleast 3 areas.

<li>2.A link to Mr.Saks' biography.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for sources on the songs and notability, Mr.Saks has met the criterion based on the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award,i.e.,Official Song of Memphis.</li>
<li>2.Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above., ie, the late Mr.Ruble, as noted on the Fast Mothers site and by the city council resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a collection of works for the piano are made available on Mr.Saks site. The Fast Mothers site discusses the awards presented Mr.Ruble. In the City Council resolution Mr. Ruble is praised along with Mr.Saks for giving the city of Memphis,"A wonderful celebration of itself." Mr.Saks is more than qualified to be represented, and certainly worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. As to other details in the article, you should edit as you find appropriate, regards verification of his education and, among other items, his musicianship. As I am new to the forum (five days), I apologize if my corrections and actions have been misunderstood and out of keeping with protocol. I can only learn as I progress.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't know what's going on with the Heim business, but there is no mathematical subject of selector calculus AFAIK nor do the standard mathematical resources such as MathSciNet mention it. The article doesn't even make clear what "selector calculus" <i>is</i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: it's good that a reference has been provided, but the problems with the article remains. Additionally, the reference is good if someone were able to understand it and write an article based on it, but that doesn't appear to be the case here. It still doesn't explain what selector calculus is, although it says it's "something like" something else and makes an unsubstantiated claim that it is something very near tensor calculus. The only other info in the article is rather muddled and nonsensical:
<blockquote>
<p>"The approach differs from conventional differential calculus which does not place a finite lower bound on infinitesimals. In selector calculus, the limit of Riemann sums taken to infinity has no physical interpretation, as the smallest unit of measure is a metron, rather than infinitesimal."</p>
</blockquote>
Since I know "conventional differential calculus", I can say this comparison is wrong as it shows a misunderstanding of calculus. The article also says, "See Heim theory for details." Well, if the article on selector calculus refers to another article for an explanation of what selector calculus <i>is</i>, what's the point of having such an article? Since all the details are apparently in the Heim theory article anyway, a merge would appear pointless; I'm sticking with my 'delete' vote. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: As someone has added the above reference to the article, I think we should know how you got that reference and why you think the selector calculus is "apparently" covered in it. There's an issue of verifiability here, besides the other issues that have been mentioned. (Note: I have removed the reference from the article as I don't believe at this point that the editor had actually used the reference to verify the information) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This enables any differential expression to be metronized." However, the basic problem remains: the article is not encyclopaedic because it does not attempt to define selector calculus, and it also seems to be not notable: it is not clear whether the calculus has been used by anybody but Buckhard Heim himself, and even if it has, nobody except for the handful of people working on Heim theory have used it. So, I remain of the opinion that the article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:08, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Merge</b> Based on Jitse Niesen's comment above, would it be a satisfactory alternative to merge the article with the existing articles related to Heim? Perhaps not notable in and of itself, but since it shows up in Heim theory, perhaps this would be a better alternative. I would not want to lose this content - it is not written very well compared to other articles, but surely if someone had the time to look at it, they could exapand the material. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 14:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He also wrote paper <a href="http://www.cs.ioc.ee/tfp-icfp-gpce05/tfp-proc/06num.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cs.ioc.ee/tfp-icfp-gpce05/tfp-proc/06num.pdf" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> about this language. On the other hand I checked database of ACM and it contains no mentions about the subject. Kogut is an experimental language. I am not sure whether it does not fail under no primary research policy. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJan.Smolik_bd31.html" title="User:Jan.Smolik">Jan Smolik</a> 22:37, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, it's not speedyable patent nonsense, and it tries to make a case for being a meme of communication. It's actually one of the most common and widespread ones in the USA.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not nonsense at all, it is a common idiomatic expression in North American English (perhaps some voters above are unaware of this). It is not a pure dictionary definition either, because it would be interesting to discuss its origin, and how it came to be the canonical example in North American English of an obvious question whose answer is "yes" (another variant of which is "Is the Pope Catholic"). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
