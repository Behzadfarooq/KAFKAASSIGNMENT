<p>"If the PFR had ever been used successfully as a defense in a Canadian criminal case I'd vote differently." Canada's most famous fugitive from the American drug wars Renee Boje is the 11th signatory to the PFR petition. The word diatribe means "A bitter, abusive denunciation." if you had read the PFR you would see that there is nothing bitter or abusive in it.</p>
<p>Wide acceptance should not be a criteria. Over 200 people believe enough in the Primary Fundamental Right to risk the wrath of the police state by signing the PFR petition. Many others endorse its principles privately. {Bernard Palmer|220.239.49.36|12:06, 13 October 2005 (UTC)}}</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not confuse "wide acceptance of the principle itself as positive law" with "wide acceptance of the existence of the principle as a well-known, verifiable theory of law". Wikipedia does not, indeed, require the former; but it does require the latter, and there is no evidence of that. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 02:27, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The UN declaration on human rights accepts the principle of mans right to own their own bodies when it states there shall be no slavery anywhere. The Primary Fundamental Right is a title for this embodiment. Bernard Palmer</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism loosely related to right to privacy. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 19:27, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since when is neologism a bad thing? Quote Chick Bowen, "Wikipedia is wonderful, but it is scattershot—its function is to present as much information as possible without distinguishing within it. That is its chief strength." <small><i>(Unsigned comment by User:220.239.49.36. — <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">CB</a>)</i></small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Neologism is not a bad thing, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia, per community consensus and the will of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">our founder</a>. I certainly didn't mean that statment to defend anything that anyone puts into Wikipedia. On the contrary, my point about the strength of not distinguishing between categories of knowledge is that we can devote 10% of our resources to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> crap and not impact our treatment of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcaeus_%28poet%29.html" title="Alcaeus (poet)">Alcaeus</a>. But that doesn't mean we should put forward your original idea as if it were encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:47, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

 I have made major changes, there is no advertising. Please review before deleting. Bernard Palmer

<dd>Reviewed. It's still <i>your</i> idea and not a pre-existing one. How can an encyclopedia put forward a claim about what Madison would have done were it not for slavery? Anyway, please see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> for the policy in question here. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:51, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The phrase "original research" in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication;". I agree the Primary Fundamental Right has not been published in any reputable publication that I know of. The Primary Fundamental Right is very much a child of the Internet, it was born of the Internet, is disseminated by the Internet. No idea so precise and simple could have bloomed anywhere else. Same as Wiki. "the will of [[Jimmy Wales|our founder" was much influenced by Ayne Rand. The Primary Fundamental Right is a bible for 'Objectivists' who advocate laissez-faire capitalism, Jimbo's perfect society. I guarantee if you ask Jimbo to click on the link to 'What is the Primary Fundamental Right' he would recognize the important role the PFR could play in changing society for the better. It is such a simple concept that its real beauty is in its simplicity. Imagine everyone legally owning their own body. It sounds preposterous but none of us in this wonderful technological age actually do. We let it slip away and it is sliding faster and faster. The Mises Institute anticipates totalitarianism will engulf the USA early this century. I think they are right that's why I built the PFR. That's why I am pressing my case with you. I want you to see that just because it hasn't been accepted by the 'elites' it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Bernard Palmer</p>
