<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. 6 delete votes and 2 keep votes. User:Shocker Toys, User:MerchLAD, User:Sithfighter and User:AoiJuuni are sock puppets (accounts created after AfD started, no other contributions) and thus their votes, whether keep or delete, have been ignored. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 15:41, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"There is no evidence that Shockini toys are so popular and well-known that they require their own article"I think the Shockini fans would beg to differ there is almost 300 of them! <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 01:13, 6 September 2005</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable advertising. Shocker Toys has now edited the article to be less encyclopedic, using the first person. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 05:43, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: 300 fans can be wrong. More importantly, the company/product is not significant. Were all of its fans to be gathered together, they'd number fewer than the smallest of small towns, and we wouldn't want a mayor of a town with 300 votes. We wouldn't want a restaurant visited by 300 people. We wouldn't.... You get the idea. Far too minor. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:00, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia dosen't seem that popular maybe we should delete It! And trust me 300 fans do mean alot maybe not to you but they consider themselves a close group and 300 for you info is just the ones we see that are signed on our forums there is 100s more not signed up or are children! As well as the listing for Stikfas on Wikipedia was written by a member of their company and was confirmed! <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 13:26, 6 September 2005</small></p>

<dd>Yes i admit that <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stikfas.html" title="Stikfas">stikfas</a> was poorly written as well and should be cleaned up (or deleted if it meets the policy), but that's all in another day's work. i respect very much the fan base of Shockini, but please understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for a worldwide audience (at this moment it has 419,707 registered users) and is not a hall of fame or something like that. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 13:58, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that is why we have shortened it to a brief dictionary type description. We just want people to know it is a word and we do not need any links pointing to our site either!If you would like to leave it up we would be happy to be on Wikipedia if not it is your call! <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 14:09, 6 September 2005</small></p>

<li><b>Retract delete vote</b>. Hey guys, sorry i'm going to the other camp and back this one. i put it up for VfD at first because the entire article stank of advertising, but now i feel that it is worthy to remain as a stub wanting further improvement.

<p>Sorry guys I think i erased something I wasnt supposed to I got a message I am new to wikipedia. I hope we can just leave the small bit up and let fans and people add to it. We have a link at our forums for fans to visit and add and try out wikipedia. <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 00:56, 7 September 2005</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Google reveals that these toys are sold by numerous online stores. Seems notable enough. Make that a double keep if Shocker Toys sends me some samples - they look pretty cool. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 05:21, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>LOL you can get a free Shockini after 20 posts at our forums all members get that. So come on by all and try em out! <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 06:03, 7 September 2005</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> void of encyclopedic value, shameless add. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 18:21, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I think it is short and sensable and can be added to by fans of the toy. I think I get a vote since I am a wikipedia member? Plus we do link to quite a few other companies here on Wikipedia that did deserve articles! As well as the other product <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stikfas.html" title="Stikfas">Stikfas</a> has external links to their company page and their distribution sales page and if they are listed and we are a similar product people should know the differences. I think it helps define differences in similar toys. Also instead of burning us at the stake maybe the knowlegable folks here can tell us how we can improve the article and make it more of a learning defining description. I happen to like Wikipedia and so do my fans and wanted to contribute not for advertising but for the sake of Wikipedia, this is why I tried to keep the advertising and external links out of it unlike others!-- <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 20:28, 7 September 2005</small>

<li>Add a clear, high-resolution picture of a Shockini toy if possible. All the pictures i found at your website are too small and unclear. Also, next time sign your messages with four tildes (~~~~), it will be automatically converted to your username and datetime of your message. Thanks. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 03:18, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really hope it stays and think it should since its less advertising then the other guys and more info like and waiting to be added to. Thnaks for fixing the pic. I would like to add company info and styles and such and have asked fans to add things as well. Thye are excited about seeing it on wikipedia as some of them are members here as well but I guess they don't know how to vote or haven't seen this discussion article. So viva la wikipedia and long live our article!Shocker Toys 02:47, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

You people really need to lighten up you do not rule the world and will get no where with Wikipeida treating people like they are always advertsing!Anytime you speak of something it's advertising so we should delete all of Wikipedia!What's funnier is the more Keeps we get the more mysterious Deletes we get!Shocker Toys 23:22, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
