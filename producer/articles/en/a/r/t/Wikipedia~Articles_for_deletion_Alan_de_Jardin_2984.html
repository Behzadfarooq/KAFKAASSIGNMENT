<p>His only claim to fame appears to be a horribly unsuccessful bid for head of his provincial party.

<li>I was wondering when this issue would come up. We've already clarified that party leaders are notable in all (or almost all) cases. I suppose this is as good a time as any to clarify the rules for leadership candidates as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Manitoba Liberal Party is a significant force in Manitoba politics -- it doesn't have many seats in the provincial legislature now, but it was the official opposition party less than twenty years ago. Its history dates back to 1882.</p>
<p>A credible case can be made that anyone who runs for the leadership of this party is automatically "notable". I grant, however, that de Jardin's situation is borderline. If the general consensus is to delete, I could easily move these three sentences to the page on Manitoba Liberal Party leadership conventions. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 18:49, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Since notability is os so very subjective, I vote <b>Keep</b> on the basis that Wikipedia is an appropriate place to gather information on political figures, including those who are not elected. He's notable to me, even if he's not notable to you. Also, the leadership of a party is not "internal", like, say the position of membership secretary. The leader is the public face iof the party. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 17:33, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think we can all agree that the leader of a Canadian provincial party is notable. But this guy was never a party leader, nor did he ever hold another party office. He made a single run at party leader, in which he garnered only 6% of the vote. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 18:12, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, Sam, it seems that quite a few of us are interested in learning more about this guy. It would be a shame if those who are not interested decide to delete the article and prevent it from ever gathering more information about him. But I guess there are always the endless Wikipedia articles about video game characters to keep us amused. Many people believe that they are notable enough to keep, but not real world political characters. &lt;Sigh.&gt; <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 21:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As Ground Zero says above, this <b>isn't an internal position</b>. The leader of a political party in a Westminster system is both the head of that party's caucus and its candidate for the executive office. Calling it "local" is also doubtful; <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> is about the size of Afghanistan, and is a senior level of government. The closest American counterpart would be somebody who did similarly running for Democratic or Republican nomination for governor of Hawaii, which has about the same population. Alan de Jardin ran for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Manitoba_6714.html" title="Premier of Manitoba">Premier of Manitoba</a>, by seeking leadership of a major party, and he did find a non-trivial base of support in that party. I'd like to know more. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 06:05, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC) (corrected <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 06:29, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>I'll say it again -- nobody's saying that the office Jardin ran for is unimportant or unnotable. But running for that office <i>by itself</i> does not make you notable, any more than every person who ever ran for Governor of Hawaii is notable. (Or even Governor of California!) So yeah, we need to know more. The person to address that point is <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a>, who created the article. (And who has shown commendable detachment in discussing its proposed deletion!) So how about it? Do you have anything more on the guy, or should we assume that the article is more or less in its final form? ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 06:25, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wish I remember whose comment I got this from, but... it's a core principle of Wikipedia that its contributors only do what they want to do. And all in all, this works pretty well. Undoubtedly, CJCurrie is our house authority on Manitoba politics, but we shouldn't put him in the hot seat for expansions to any given article. Anyone with access to a newspaper microfilm collection with any Manitoba daily could surely find out more about de Jardin's candidacy. I should have access to an Ontario reference library soon enough and can see what they have. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 06:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Verifiability of the content isn't an issue. We only care about the <i>notability</i> of the subject.

<li>Why is a vanity page unverifiable? Everybody can prove they exist, and their major achievements. And why can't a person write NPOV material about themselves?

<ul>
<li>The point is not that it is impossible for a vanity page to be NPOV but rather it is impossible to <i>prove</i> that it is NPOV.

<li><b>Comment: comparison to U.S. politicians</b>. If I understand the Canadian system, a provincial premier is pretty much the equivalent of a U.S. state governor. And when a party comes to power, its party leader becomes premier. So in effect, somebody who runs for party leader is trying to become premier. ¬∂ I know, I know, there are factors that don't apply to U.S. politics -- coalition governments, party leaders have other responsibilities, etc. But it's a close approximation. ¬∂ So the nearest U.S. equivalent to would be somebody who once ran for Governor, lost by a big margin, and never did anything else to make the news. There are <a href="../../../r/e/s/Results_of_the_2003_California_recall_c4a4.html" title="Results of the 2003 California recall">plenty of people like that</a>. How many of them are notable? I'd argue that the answer is zero, or close to it. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:47, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
