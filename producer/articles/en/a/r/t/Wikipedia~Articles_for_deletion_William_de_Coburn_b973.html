<li>Just took a look at the article; it mentions People magazine and Sports Illustrated. If People and Sports Illustrated really have written about him, then I think that establishes notability enough to <b>keep</b> the article. However, the references to People and Sports Illustrated are not proper citations; making it impossible (or at least difficult) to verify. They could be made up just to give the article a venieer of truthfulness; but someone ought to verify before deleting. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 19:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
