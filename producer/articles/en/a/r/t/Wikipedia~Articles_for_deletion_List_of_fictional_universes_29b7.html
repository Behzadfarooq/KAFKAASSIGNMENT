<p><b>Delete</b> per nom (me). I stated my opinion concerning the usefulness of this article on its talk page first, and received only agreement on the matter. Cut and paste follows.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hate to rain on this obsessive-compulsive parade, but couldn't this article include every work of fiction ever produced, in some form or another, especially speculative/science fiction and fantasy? It took me a moment to even think of one useful purpose such an article might serve, but there is one: to simply outline the conceptual differences between such fictions, as this does to some degree by detailing the different categories of fictional universes that can exist. There is absolutely no function served by creating a repository in which everyone can note their favorite fictional universe. Examples are useful, sure, but I think some limits should be in place. I put my opinion out tentatively--clearly someone is interested, if so much has been done here, but I think this is more a case of interest on the part of the creators than on the part of potential readers. No one can really gain any kind of knowledge from these "shout outs" to our favorite works of fiction. Fearwig 03:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am confident that this article can serve no worthwhile purpose, and should be considered a good reminder that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. (Please note - <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> "received only agreement" from <i>one</i> user, Peter S.) Fearwig mentions one purpose the article may serve: "to simply outline the conceptual differences between such fictions, as this does to some degree by detailing the different categories of fictional universes that can exist." Please remember that everything here is a work in progress, and per the talk page of the article in question, there are many hands and brains pondering how to make the article accessible and informative. I take exception, also, to the claim that "no one can really gain any kind of knowledge" from something, simply because one person (or two) doesn't see its wor th. As you may have already guessed, I have learned something from the article and think it should be kept. <font color="green">♥</font> <a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegship_9306.html" title="User:Pegship">Her Pegship</a><font color="green">♥</font> 21:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>What exactly does the <i>list</i> portion of the article achieve, other than to catalogue what could conceivably be every single piece of fiction ever produced by mankind?

<li>I did not pretend that agreement was in abundance--only that no one cared about the article in that period of time save the one individual who agreed in its worthlessness. I am not sure why a "strong keep" would be the immediate result of the consideration that "not enough people have agreed with the deletion yet". You simply can't clean up something so conceptually flawed as a list of every fictional universe ever imagined. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 22:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> – this list (and it analysis) does provide a useful purpose. Firstly it provises a place to review the various fictional universes (and yes that will mainly mean SF and Fantasy). Secondly it provides a grouping of types, particularly for anyone wanting a read of a similar kind to one previously enjoyed or one of a dissimilar kind (for variety). This is not just a listing. All I would say is that it does need work to improve this information.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 08:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep and cleanup</b> ... I could go either way on this one.

<li><b>Comment</b> Going back to Fearwig's original observation, "couldn't this article include every work of fiction ever produced": yes, it could. I see your point, F, and I removed the section referencing "Earth as we know it"; such a list would be ridiculous indeed.

<li>I agree that a more... moderate list would be within the approrpiate purpose of WP.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think there is an argument for having an article on the types of fictional universe that can exist. That is, the current section organization of the article is itself of interest, though I think the list is potentially infinite and that is a serious problem. Unless the infinitude of the list is fixed I can't see a way out of deleting this article. But if the list is restricted to notable examples, and the article reviews the types and gives early and important examples, that could be worthwhile. However, I'd then suggest it be merged with the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article. The category already exists, after all; either the list duplicates it or it supplies analysis, and I'm not sure why that analysis wouldn't belong in the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 01:27, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree completely, I think the analysis (if it is in fact not OR--I'm not sure whether it's taken from secondaries) should be retained. I only suggest that this page be deleted, not the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article (though that should perhaps be changed to <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">Fictional universe</a>, to meet naming conventions, if I'm not mistaken).</li>

<li><b>Question</b> Who would arbitrate that? Apparently some people think the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernstein_Bears_20d6.html" title="Bernstein Bears">Bernstein Bears</a> series is set in a "notable universe". Also, are you using Wiki standards of notability, because Wikipedia does have well over a million articles, a great number of which are based on works of fiction (and thus set in fictional universes). <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 14:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>—We'd started a lazy process of organizing a consensual method of tackling what is admittedly a daunting task, and had a general agreement on how to make the thing better. Splitting it was one initial thought, then Peg came up with the table. Agreed the scope of the beast needs narrowed, but the telling point to me is not what 'use' the article may have to someone like Ferwig, but that there had been a lot of people that put their valuable spare time into building it in the first place. That also shows a certain amount of love and care to take the effort of putting up the data in the first place; D'ya hear a winsom echo of Jimbo here—that's somewhat like the answer he gave the interviewer about what surprised him most about the encyclopedia. In sum, you need not help, but do respect the time others <u>devoted</u> to putting this nascent seed together. There is a fun factor to remember as well, not everything in a e-publication need be limited like a dead tree publication. Sneer at it as listcruft if you like, as I do when people go ga-ga over so called celebrity entertainers who are just doing their jobs in something they love. But you can blame those same entertainers for the population of this list. Deleting it is only consistent with a vow to be a lifelong ascetic and never ever enjoy anyform of entertainment. The converse is also true, if you are a fan of anything at all in the realm of entertainment, integrity and respect for others, and especially perhaps, respect for others donated volunteer time clearly demands it be kept — least you know yourself for a hypocrite and insensitive uncaring person. I'd rather you didn't inflict that wound on your psyche, and thought about why the list came to be in the first place! Is love and affection so unworthy so as to be unnotable on it's very existance? No, they are the most precious commodity of all. (danged edit conflict!

<li>I have some sympathy with this view; I understand that this can be a labour of love for many editors. I'm not suggesting that the work be destroyed, but it does have to be consistent with Wikipedia goals. It has to be encyclopaedic. My criticism is not of the idea of documenting fictional universes within Wikipedia -- that's clearly within Wikipedia's scope. The problem is that the article, in its current form, is absolutely unmaintainable. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is a key problem for several who have voted Delete here; and it has not been addressed by the responses or the Keep votes. If this can be corrected I would be likely to vote Keep. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 15:56, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

That cuts the redundancy to a mininum, cross references the occurences across media, and keeps what is a fair archival tool. Some of us get strangely inspired by such cross-fertilizations, and if one is browsing (translation <i>playing</i>) stumbling across such can be a fun read. Last time I looked, the foundation and such were delighted when we got accessed for any reason. Any text containing 'keywords' increases our hit count and exposure on the various search engines, and I'm quite sure the foundation wants those as high as possible. A <i>everything but the kitchen sink</i> article like this helps achieve that, as does all the 'Pop culture' stuff I care less than a plugged-penny for personally, save as an editor of this project. That requires a professional hat that looks at such pop factors, search engine factors, etc.</dd>

<dd>&lt;g&gt;Haven't ever really seen much of a guideline citing <b>Wikiworthy</b>, an iteresting idea of an IdeaL, but not one shared much by Jimbo and the foundation board, nor evident in any of the pop culture articles which are daily created herein; this one just needs a bit of 'managed care' and top-down organization. 'Nuff said.

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, though even that is not a hard guideline. Same idea, more entertaining word. In this case we are talking about something so <i>general</i> as to be non-notable, rather than so specific--I am not, for instance, going to create lists Things that can be made wet or People whose first names begin with R, because, well, it would be quite stupid. And while two or three people might enjoy seeing essentially random articles on R-named people, absolutely nothing beneficial would come of the article itself. While this article outlines several hundred "universes" (potentially including say, the Smurfs "universe" or the Friends "universe"), the list doesn't actually <i>say anything</i> or provide any new information at all. "'Nuff said,"--not quite. (And the smarm is unnecessary). <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 14:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just want to address this Ferwig note found on the talk:<i>If you believe there are more actors in IMDB than fictional universes ever invented, you are sorely, sorely mistaken.</i> I believe we've had discussion on limiting the article to <i>Series</i> sorts of universes... which would be the criteria for inclusion. 'One-of' novel milieus or films sans sequels would be in their own article.

<dd>If you limit the article in this way, you are changing the article's subject and thus (if you are going to do it properly) its title. As such, you aren't really keeping it, are you? <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 14:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the limitation agreed upon elsewhere, was that we're only listing complete "Universes" as opposed to local/regional fictional settings. See <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_fictional_places.html" title="Index of fictional places">Index of fictional places</a>. Which narrows the inclusion criteria massively.

<dd><b>Comment</b> — The categories all should have a 'Main' Article giving them scope. This is the one for that useful category. I do tend to think of it as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">Alternat(iv)e Universes</a>, especially for written and screen fiction, both 'Arts'.
<dl>
<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that main article be <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">Fictional universe</a>, not <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_universes.html" title="List of fictional universes">List of fictional universes</a>? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 12:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would expect the only fictional universes to go in there would be the ones put in by someone who cares enough to do it.

<dd>Well, your first point means that it is in the nature of the list to be incomplete, which is the <i>other</i> big complaint about it. The second point means (I expect) that criteria <i>should</i> be put in place... but even then, the nature (and thus the name) of the article would have to be changed, or else, again, it's an incomplete article.

<p><b>Delete/Merge</b> per Mike Christie: Instead of a list, I think the way to do this would be to translate this information: (1) categories and subcategories, plus maybe (2) an article explaining what fictional universes are and linking to the categories and subcategories.
