<p>There is no such thing as a hybrid-electric bicycle. The article made this clear until some text from the deleted Series Hybrid Cycles was merged in. There is essentially no such thing as a series hybrid cycle, either, outside of the research of Andreas Fuchs, the author of that article, which is why it is deleted. There almost certainly never will be a series hybrid cycle before room temperature superconductivity comes down to consumer prices, because it would be ruinously inefficient. Shaft drives are very low maintenance, cheap, and upwards of 80% efficient and they have still made little headway against the chain because the human body puts out liimted power and efficiency is <i>everything</i> in human powered vehicles. There is nothing here which is not either outright speculation, substantially unverifiable, or redundant to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>As the main contributor to this article being considered for deletion I disagree with all statements above:
<ul>
<li>Whether a "hybrid-electric bicycle" exists is a matter of definition. In the strict sense every electric bicycle which includes pedals is a hybrid. In a wider sense only those using a third source of power would be hybrids, e.g. solar power, wind power or fuel cells. These all exist as prototypes but not to my knowlege as manufactured items.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime I've seen that other editors also regard ordinary electric bicycles as <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">hybrid vehicles</a>, and those with additional input from other energy sources such as solar cells even as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribrid_vehicle.html" title="Tribrid vehicle">tribrid vehicles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 09:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The sentence from the original stub "A hybrid-electric bicycle is a theoretical non-existent bicycle that might allow its rider to build up charge in battery or supercapacitor when going downhill or waiting at a red light, and then add the stored power to his or her immediate power at start or for hill-climbing." is wrong because the prototypes of Andreas Fuchs and collegues do exactly that and they do exist. I've ridden on them myself and they work well. The other French vehicles also exist.</li>
<li>Superconductivity is not an issue here, but whether highly efficient generators - which do exist - can be procured at a price which customers will pay. Currently the best electric technology is about as efficient as a poor mechanical transmission, but the gains lie elsewhere, in particular the high configurability without mechanical means (meaning you can have a tailor-made load curve and don't need to change gears) leading to ideal on-road training devices, and the suitability for larger vehicles, even marine vehicles.</li>
<li>Nothing here is speculation and it is all verifiable in the literature give.</li>
<li>I did not recreate the deleted material but rather included those bits from the deleted "Series hybrid cycles" (about 30%) which I felt were up to Wikipedia standards and also improved the wording. I am a former editor of the publication "Human Power" and a current editor an author at <a href="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ" class="external text" title="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ" rel="nofollow">Human Power eJournal</a> so feel qualified to do this.</li>
<li>I do agree that there is a hodgepodge of articles all revolving around similar topics and several of these should perhaps be merged into a suitable new article. I'm not sure that <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">Motorized bicycles</a> should be the container for all these subjects as it is quite large already. I don't think that Guy's method of going and deleting all these - like recently someone did <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedelec.html" title="Pedelec">Pedelec</a> - is the optimal method. I would be happy to work in a group of us to try to bring order to this unwieldy field.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime I've seen that Wikipedia articles shouldn't be too long: somebody suggested 32kB was OK whereas 72kB was too long. Maybe this would be a criterium to decide whether an article should be split into two different articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I do agree that the name of this article (previous existing stub) isn't all that good, also because often the vehicles involved are actually tricycles or quadricycles.</li>
<li>In a nutshell: I disagree with deleting this article at this moment but might agree with a deletion in the future if we can find a suitable structure for the components in this field which might be too much for <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">Motorized bicycles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 11:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've since come to the conclusion that the name of this article is poor, as it really should be "Human-electric hybrid bicycle" but this is cumbersome. Also, I saw that <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">Hybrid vehicles</a> already had a section on two-wheeled vehicles saying much the same. Therefore I have expanded this section and now recommend Hybrid-electric_bicycle to be <b>deleted</b> as it is redundant. OK with everybody? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 10:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and create redirect. The claim that they don't exist appears to be false, but they don't seem to exist in large enough numbers to merit their own article.

<li>So, judging by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a>'s comments, it's not talking about a hybrid <i>bicycle</i> but a gas-electric hybrid <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">Moped</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a>. You'd be better off including such information one of those articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article provides no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Human-battery powered bicycle conversions are for sale today, so the article covers an efficient transport mode. The article is clearly of encyclopedic notability, and has sources, so keep it. I am considering purchasing a human-battery powered bike, at <a href="http://www.electric-bikes.com/cruizers.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.electric-bikes.com/cruizers.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Problems with what the article says? That's an issue for editing, not deleting. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 07:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>We really should be looking at this in a wider context. I've started a user subpage <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_Coordination_of_alternative_vehicle_articles_4497.html" title="User:Theosch/Coordination of alternative vehicle articles">User:Theosch/Coordination_of_alternative_vehicle_articles</a> in order to attempt this. Feel free to go there and contribute. However for <i>this</i> article, I'll <b>comment</b> on the new responses below the "new notice line". Hybrid-electric bicycle is about <b>parallel</b> hybrids <i>and</i> <b>series</b> hybrids. The former includes almost every manufactured moped, electric bicycle, pedelec, powerbike, power-assisted cycle, electric power-assisted tricycle and quadricycle and so on. Except for the relatively few multitrack vehicles, these are all <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and this article is in turn in the category hybrid vehicles. But because they are so widespread, nobody thinks of these vehicles as hybrids and so it is OK to have them in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a>. However <b>series</b> hybrid bicycles, tricycles, quadricycles and even marine vehicles exist only as prototypes built by a handful of researchers and hobbyists. They are all electric and most have more than two wheels. Therefore they don't fit very well in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a> and also not in Hybrid-electric bicycle. I think that <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">hybrid vehicles</a> is presently the best place for this information and it is there already. Therefore Hybrid-electric bicycle should be deleted, but not for the reasons most people here have given, but because it is redundant and because the name doesn't fit the content properly. Therefore I would ask Edison to reconsider his "keep" request and let us delete this article, even if for the wrong reasons (the info is verifiably sourced and notable), and move on to help out in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 16:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
