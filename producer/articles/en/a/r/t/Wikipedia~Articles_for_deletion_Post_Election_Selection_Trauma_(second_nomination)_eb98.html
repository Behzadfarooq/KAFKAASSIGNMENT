<p><b>Comment</b> I have added a couple of more sources to the external links section, and removed the hoax tag. This is not a hoax article, and I hear this term in use alot, especially by Rush Limbaugh. I would request that all editors on this AFD posting before my timestamp reconsider and reaffirm their vote. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> see below. The source you point to as evidence of the claim's notability is itself a hoax. Rush may have said it, but he says a lot of stuff, most of it does not require an encyclopedia entry. Lexis nexis shows no use at all of this term since December 2004 in print newspaper sources. This is an artifact from an election which is over.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:20, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>This is a hoax</b>. I read the CJR article about it and the writer is pretty clear that this is all the fault of a too-gullible reporter at the Boca Raton paper. He didn't check up on these articles apparently, and CJR ridicules him. I did some more research and the AHA reference is bogus; "Rob Gordon" at the "AHA" is a character from the movie <i>High Fidelity</i>. <a href="http://markbyron.typepad.com/main/2004/11/yes_you_are_a_p.html" class="external text" title="http://markbyron.typepad.com/main/2004/11/yes_you_are_a_p.html" rel="nofollow">This blog post</a> has some info. The Boca Raton paper refers to AHA as a Boca based organization; if it exists, it is a private organization, and not an organization endorsed by most health professionals in America, as the name would imply. I don't think this article should be kept, but if it is kept, it should be made clear that this is an example of small town journalism getting hoodwinked rather than of a recognized psychological condition.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Update - this AHA does exist apparently; it's "an award winning non-profit community service organization" known for <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2004/12/prweb186233.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2004/12/prweb186233.htm" rel="nofollow">donating beanie babies to orphans in Iraq</a>, not a mental health professional organization. <a href="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2004/12/06/186233/rob.jpeg" class="external text" title="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2004/12/06/186233/rob.jpeg" rel="nofollow">Here's a photo</a> of Dr. Rob Gordon, who looks nothing like John Cusack. So at least the guy exists, but the idea that he lends legitimacy to this term as a psychological condition is laughable.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:58, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Comment</b>: Hmmm, tough one. As I recall, the esteemed Dr. Gordon was dead serious when he made this up, but it was laughed out of the psychological community almost immediately and ended up being used almost entirely on conservative talk radio and blogs to disparage kooked-out liberals that couldn't handle the 2004 election results. This term may come back to life in November 2008, or maybe even next month depending on how things go. <b>Cleanup</b> in any case, as it's pretty much an essay in its current form. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 02:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</s> Changing vote; see below.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Bad faith nomination. Nom put in a hoax tag, but didn't discuss it on talk, then nominates for deletion two minutes later. Nothing has changed in the article, nothing suggests that (lack of) consensus would change in a month's time (since the last AfD). Can you point to discussions you've had with editors regarding that consensus on this article might have been formed? Not that I see much worth to this particular article, but seems it could be improved and I see no evidence consensus has changed (or formed) that would validate a renom per <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a>. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 02:24, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure it does. It mentions "you should ask around a bit (e.g. at the Village Pump) to see if people agree with you. You cannot declare a new consensus all by yourself." There's no suggestion of the nominator "asking around" regarding a (new) consensus prior to bringing forth the AfD. Lets say this AfD goes thru as no consensus. Nominate again in a month?

Here's what I wrote on the first Afd about this page and it is still true -- "Only 12 hits in Lexis/Nexis, all of them tongue-in-cheek laughs at the doctor who designated this, and two of them letters to the editor. Only five actually are about "PEST"; the other seven just mention it as a joke. All of the articles that mention this phrase are from November and December 2004, indicating this was a brief news item after the election and that is it." I don't think we need a wikipedia page for every joke that someone made up during the election. It's over. Bush won.

<li>There's no new arguments to be had since previous AfD. I'm not even arguing the merits of the article, I'm arguing procedure here.

There are more sources, and the article can be rewritten some for much improvement and NPOV, but I really don't want to waste my time if the article is going to be deleted.

<li>Read more carefully. Those are all blogs, and the "anti-PEST" article is tongue in cheek. Ted Kennedy never said that; Crockspot, are you joking or did you just not read it closely? All we have is Crockspot's assertion that a notorious drug addict may have once recently used the term on the radio. Not enough notability to keep; perhaps those who cite crockspot as their reason for believing this term is notable might reconsider.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be honest, I didn't even finish the first paragraph. Funny article though. I still think this is a notable term, aside from the syndrome aspect, that is obviously still in use. I would like to do some rewriting of the article to reflect the punditry/mocking use of this notable term, but as I indicated previously, if this article is going to get deleted, I've already put in too much time on it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here's a longer explanation for my vote. As someone who reads some conservative blogs, I remember the coverage of this from November 2004 and I've noticed continuing references to it in those blogs. The "syndrome", the psychologist who coined it and the 2 or 3 newspaper stories about it are, IMO, way below Wikipedia's standards for notability. Getting mentioned by the <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Journalism_Review_5be6.html" title="Columbia Journalism Review">Columbia Journalism Review</a></i> is more significant, but still not enough for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:Notability</a>.
