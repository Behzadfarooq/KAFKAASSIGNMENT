<p>Customer service representatives (CSR's) are people often females employed by companies to serve as a direct point of contact for customers. In the 24/7 world today companies need to ensure their customers receive an adequate level of service or help with their questions and concerns. Such customers may be individual consumers or other companies each with different needs. Many companies provide customer service via the telephone through call centres. The CSR's interact with customers to provide information in response to inquiries about products or services. They also handle and resolve complaints and communicate with customers through a variety of means. Telephone is the most popular but increasingly customer service is supplied by e-mail. Faxes and regular mail correspondence and even a direct meeting can also be used by the CSR. Some customer service representatives handle general questions and complaints, whereas others specialize in a particular area.</p>

<p>Haloacetic acids are acids in which a halogen ion takes the place of a hydrogen ion in acetic acid. Acetic acid is written as HC2H3O2. Thus, in a monohaloacetic acid the single halogen would take the place of a hydrogen. For example, monochloroacetic acid would be written as C2H3ClO2. In the same manner, in dichloroacetic acid the two chlorines would take the place of two hydrogen ions. Thus HC2H3O2 would become C2H2Cl202.</p>

<p>Two White Guys is a popular podcast that has a huge cult following. The proclaimed Two White Guys consist of Ryan Simmons, and Kyle Totaro. They are described as "A couple of Port Jervis dirtbags" by the host of the show Ryan. Although the show is dubbed <i>Two White Guys</i>, Ryan and Kyle have a couple other friends that join them in certain episodes. The show originally started out about college life, but then turned into much more. Discussions of video games, Cherry Coke, Dane Cook, and much more eventually followed. TWG (as the show is dubbed by its fans) is a weekly comedy show.</p>
<p>Ryan said in one of the episodes: "I was listening to 'Did You Get My Message' by Jason Mraz on my iPod and I said 'This is it. Podcast time.'"</p>

<p>The Harbor Towers apartment complex was completed in 1971 by the Berenson Corporation, as an affordable housing option near Boston's financial district. Deisgned by I.M. Pei, in conjunction with a local Boston architect, who also collaberated with Pei on the design of Boston's City Hall, the towers are well known in the architectural community. A project sponsored by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), as a way to bring new life to Boston's waterfront area, which was, at the time, a seedy, dusty area mostly made up of parking lots, the project became a cornerstone for future progress in the area. Originally planned with three forty story towers, only two were built, along with an adjacent parking garage. The much derided design has garnered many critics in Boston, for its "brutalist" design, wholly inconsistent with the historic quality of Boston, in particular the waterfront area, as well as the adjacent "North End", known for its Italian community, and its preservation of 17th and 18th century architecture.</p>
<p>As the growth of the city moved toward the waterfront, the unparalleled nature of the apartment tower's location and harbor and city views, drew the attention of the "condo conversion" craze of the early 1980s. In 1981, both apartment towers started the 2 year process of conversion to condominiums, with special incentives for existing renters to purchase at heavily discounted prices. Many of these early apartment renters now own several units, often combined to create breathtaking wrap-around units with as much as 5,000 square feet of living space. Some of these "early adopters", now own multi-million dollar units, with as little as $100,000 to $200,000 of total investment. The newcomers buy units for between $600,000 to as much as $3,000,000, primarily for the spectactular harbor and city views, but also for the location, which is less then three city blocks from the city's financial district.</p>
<p>With the more recent development of the adjacent Rowes Wharf/Boston Harbor Hotel, a landmark development of signficant architectural and aesthetic significance to the city's skyline, as well as the expansion of the New England Aquarium, has made the twin towers even more deisrable. The completion of the central artery project (The Big Dig), with its expansive necklace of greenspace, gardens and public space, scheduled for completion in 2006, will make these now historic apartment buildings a central character in the most costly urban improvement project in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The much maligned towers have survived tremendous change along Boston's waterfront, and those lucky enough to have purchased homes early in the process, have seen the largest increases in property values of any urban Boston location. As they say, in Boston, if you live in Harbor Towers, at least you don't have to look at them.</p>

It housed Grades 9 to 12 until the 2002-2003 school year when Grades 7 and 8 were added. It is two storeys for the most part, except for the north east corner where it features a basement in which the classrooms are almost exclusively for mathematics. It has an auditorium which also serves as a public discount cinema on selected evenings. It used to feature a gymnasium in the centre of the school, but an extra one was built and opened in 2002-2003. Sports teams play under the moniker/nickname "Notre Dame Silver Eagles". The present site at 710 Broadview was once the site of Broadview High School.

<p>Term coined by Curator and Critic Bruce Johnson (John's Newfoundland) to link concepts of voyage and immobility. A contraction of the words "telesma" (mystical energy) and "ark' (mystical repository),"telesmark" fits with Johnson's idea that cognition, and the process of visual narrtive, is a field of interactions involving flux and stasis. He is best known for what he call's "photographic field thory", which alongside theorists including Roland Barthes and Geoffrey Batchen, examines photography as a verbal process.</p>

<p>Jill Greene is the younger sister of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Greene_0d00.html" title="Rachel Greene">Rachel Greene</a> of popular American sitcom <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a> (1994-2004). Reese Witherspoon plays the much humourous and annoying character. Jill, like Rachel is spoilt, pampered and highly self absorbed. She is pretty and she knows it. In Season Six Episode 13 - The One With Rachel's Sister, she makes the grand appearance of someone who is thought to be very shallow and not much common sense up there, continues to torture Rachel by attempting to date Ross Geller in The One Where Chandler Can't Cry, who appropriately decides to reject her after much manipulation on Rachel's part.</p>

<p>Quarter-Mile Joe, the Six-Toed Hobo</p>
<p>In 1802 Samuel Tscheudi commanded an army of 200 Indian-fighters who made Madison County, Illinois habitable- after a fashion- for white settlers. In the mid 1800’s, his son started a road house bar called the Judy Inn where cold beers are still served. I do, on occasion, drop in and wet my whistle.</p>
<p>This afternoon- after running some errands- I found myself with both the time and the inclination to knock back a cool one before my girls got home from school. Seated at the bar was a gangly old man who squinted at me with bright blue eyes. “That’s a mighty tight haircut you got there” he says. I replied it’s cool in the summer and doesn’t muss under a hat in the winter. “Well at least it ain’t white yet- when I was your age my hair was already white as snow…on account of Quarter-Mile Joe”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you ain’t heard of Quarter-Mile Joe, Aw, Lord, I gotta story for you- ain’t that right Sally?” The bar girl flashed a smile and looked me square in the eyes and said “My grandpa remembers the six-toed hobo and Karl, here, he does too.”</p>
<p>“Back during the Great Depression many men left there homes and families and became bums…hoboes. They would hang around looking for handouts or work. There was one – Joe- who used to sit right outside this very tavern. For a shot of whiskey he’d show you his extra toe. We called him Six-Toed Joe. Well, in nineteen hundred and thirty five I was twenty years old and I worked as a freight conductor on the railroad. One night when I was checking the equipment I came upon an old boot stuck in the cow catcher. When I wedged the boot out it was heavier than it shoulda been- this boot was still full of foot. I dropped it right then and there as you might imagine and went and got the Pinkerton man. He was a tough guy and kind of a show-off so there in front of the group of us he pulls the foot right out of the boot and guess what we see…six toes. Well this changes everything. We knew that Six-Toed Joe had his little camp by the tracks next to Judy Creek and so off we went to see if he was still kicking. There was just a sliver of a moon and the trees made it awful dark, but we had our flashlights and made our way up the tracks. It wasn’t long before we saw a whole lotta blood splattered on the tracks and railroad ties- this was where he got hit, but he was not there. We looked more closely and saw the tracks told a horrible secret. Heading off up the tracks there- right there on every other railroad tie was a bloody O-shaped scrape and next to it on the ground a bloody boot print. He was using the raised railroad ties to make up for his one short leg. Scrape, step, scrape, step.</p>
<p>We followed this trail of blood and pain for a full quarter of a mile before we found his body, empty of blood, curled up and dead in a ditch. We were too late. Too late to save Quarter-Mile Joe, the six-toed hobo.”</p>
<p>I took a deep draw of my beer and asked Karl if that was how his hair turned white. “Nope, nope, Quarter-Mile Joe, he dead but he ain’t done. Back at the station house the Pinkerton fella, he’s looking long and hard at the six toes. Wasn’t long he had a two quart mason jar filled with vinegar and the foot floating around inside. He said the college would pay him good for a six-toed foot, but I heard that when he pulled that jar out of the bag, the college people just laughed out of the office. We laughed at him too and he didn’t like that. Nobody much liked him and it was fun to poke fun at his foolishness, but when we found him dead in his bed- the mason jar clutched to his cold silent chest we didn’t laugh no more.</p>
<p>I looked at the foot. By all rights it should have been mine from the get go. I was the one who found it and now it belonged to me- if I wanted it. Well gypsy season was coming up and if I know anything about gypsies I know I could get ten maybe twenty bucks for a freak trophy like this. So up on the mantle it went- just until the gypsies come through I told myself.</p>
<p>Well that night there was just a tiny sliver of a moon and the sound of the crickets outside in the woods was keeping me awake.</p>
<p>Didn’t you read the coroner’s report? He was six foot tall, and one foot short! Lying in my bed, trying to relax, I hear a weird noise coming up the tracks. It’s not a howl, it’s not a hoot, It’s Quarter-mile Joe saying “Where’s my foot”</p>
<p>“Where’s myyyy foooooot?” I thought I was hearing things but there, there it is again- “where’s my fooooot?” My heart is pounding and I break out in a cold sweat. This is how the Pinkerton fella bought it. “Where’s my foooot?” the raspy voice was closer, the crickets are silent. The jar, the jar is on the mantle there for anybody to see. “Where’s my foooot?” I’ve got to hide it before the corpse sees it through the window. “Where’s my foooot?” Up I jump as quiet as can be and back in bed in a flash, the jar clutched in my shaking hands. “Where’s my foooot?” the voice is close –maybe out in the yard. I pull the sheet over my head but I know that ain’t gonna fool nobody- I’m gonna be dead soon just like the Pinkerton fella. “Where’s my foooot?”</p>
<p><br />
TAKE IT!</p>

<p>A word derived from Cooperation and Competition. It has emerged from corporate world. Overcapacity in manufacturing by a firm has led to the competing firm tying up for the manufacturing capacity. In essence one firm produces goods for itself as well as for its competitor bringing down the capital expenditure for both the firms. However, the two differently branded goods will compete in the market against each other.</p>

<p>Melanie S A Thomson was born in Melaboure, Australia on the 31st of October 1991. She born in Boxhill hostpital. At the age of five she was told by numerous directors a countless number of times that she should begin an acting career. Unfortunately as good as were her acting techniques her parents both being Indian, did not allow her to act.</p>
<p>A couple of years later Melanie was asked to act in Home by the moon after she auditioned behind her parents back as a "trial". Yet again she had to turn down a role which could have made her immensely famous. But despite the odds if you watch carefully during a scene where the couple whom are driving alone in a small car, stop when they see a dead body in the middle of the road, you will notice that the girl is actually a pretty looking indian girl. Put two and two together and you realise she's Melanie, but you'll notice they didn't put her name in the cast for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Melanie modeled for Martinee (a french designer) since she was spotted at the age of 12 in an Australian airport, but it was only for a couple of months since she insisted on gettting a proper education.</p>
<p>Recently Melanie has disappeared but there have been rumours that she will appear on a new tv series/movie.</p>

<p>Max Weyl was a prominent Washington, D.C. artist of the late 19th century known especially for his landscapes of Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River. He was born on December 1, 1837, in Muhlen-am-Neckar, Germany. In 1853 his family emigrated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where Weyl worked in watch and clock repair, a trade he had learned through an early apprenticeship. In 1857, he moved to Washington, D.C. and became a jeweler with a retail store on 7th Street NW in a building that still stands and currently is used as a "Ruby Tuesday" restaurant across from the Verizon Center. Weyl began to paint as a hobby and displayed some of his works in his shop window. Weyl also was active in the then-small Washington Jewish community.</p>
<p>In the 1870's, local businessman, Samuel H. Kauffman, publisher of the Evening Star newspaper, took noontime walks on 7th Street and observed Weyl's paintings on display in the shop window. Kauffman purchased some of Weyl's works and became his patron, financing a trip for Weyl to study art professionally in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1878, under Kauffman's patronage, Weyl undertook a year of study abroad, visiting studios and galleries in Munich, Paris, Vienna and Venice. After his return to Washington, he and a group of fellow artists formed the "Washington Landscape School", resulting in paintings "plein air" paintings of Washington pastoral scene.</p>
<p>Weyl came to be called the "American Daubigny" and his works became very popular among Washington art collectors. His work became part of collections including the White House where purchases were made by Mrs. Grover Cleveland and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, Georgetown University, the Virginia Military Institute, Kiplinger Washington Editors, the Cosmos Club and many others.</p>
<p>On Weyl's 70th birthday in 1907, the Corcoran Gallery held a retrospective exhibit of his work. A group of local citizens purchased and donated a work by him to the National Gallery of Art. In recognition and praise they stated: "From the standpoint of art you have contributed works of genius that will stand for all time: while your bearing as a man, citizen and friend has been of that modest and yet far-reaching character that wins the love and retains the esteem of those with whom you have come in contact."</p>
<p>Weyl died in 1914. His great-grandson, Christpopher Wolf, has a large collection of Weyl's works and continues to live in Washington, DC as a fourth-generation Washingtonian.</p>

<p>I like the article about Captain Michel Aikpe because unlike what former commandant Assogba said recently, there was in it exactly what we've always heard as history of the beginning of the Revolution in Benin. I got the same story from my late father Col. Michel Alladaye. As said in the article I mentionned earlier, they were three to plan a coup d'état in 1972. What happened later is that they choosed the favorite chief the army would give their support to. That was General Mathieu Kerekou. Did that decision turned out to be a good one? My father said to that no. If you look at what happened to each of three leader of the junta under Gen. Mathieu Kerekou, you will understand my father point of view. Lately, Col. Assogba said Gen. Kerekou was the one that planned the whole coup. That's from his point of view. I was not yet born when al this happened. My only regert is that Col. Assogba brought the "truth" out two years after the late Col. Michel Alladaye's death. I guess a whole period of my country's history will remain a mystery to all of us. Maybe one day, a soldier that partook to the event will bring a new version out. Who knows? Me, I will just stick to my Daddy's version. The main truth that no one can deny is that there were brave officers in Benin and their names are Aikpe, Assogba, Kerekou and Alladaye. It took courage to let young men they were, to think of leading this country and people here still appreciate the first years of their rule</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2005, a feud began between youths from “Ballinteer west” and “Ballinteer east” ballinteer is a suburb in south Dublin, Ireland, and violence has been ongoing in the area since the formation of the two gangs. Why the feud started is almost completely unknown, when asking local gang members the story usually goes like this: youths who hung around beside shell garage, at an abandoned youth club in what is known in ballinteer west as “the club” had a drunken argument outside Ballinteer’s local chipper, witch lies on the east, punches where thrown and within days a serious gang feud started between “the club” which was mainly composed of people from a public housing estate called Broadford (west), and Woodpark and Kingston(east) so serious has it become that the youth in a time frame of less than a year have completely split. It is no longer safe for somebody from the east to walk through Broadford nor is it safe for someone from Broadford to walk through the east. Although usually this danger only applies to known gang members. The two gang’s unlike American style “bloods” and “crips” do not have a colour significant to the gang, although they are developing very quickly.</p>

<p>A new breed of shoe is being developped for children by major shoe companies; the special quality that they hold is that they emit a short noise with each step. Of course there are a range of noises that are going to be programmed into the shoes, for the children with a music addiction we will be able to hear drum beats each step they take and for those who are well co-ordinated it will be possible to use them as part of instruments and play the top songs in the charts. For the jokers more risque noises will be recorded for use in practical jokes. More information about the progress in sound emitting shoes will be released in the next issue of "Shoes for Kids".</p>

<p>Carlbrook School is an alternative boarding school on the former Carlton tobacco plantation in Halifax County, Virginia, designed to be a nurturing environment for "spirited underachievers". It is a commonly stated irony that the former owners of the land were tobacco farmers without any children and now the same space is populated by teenagers who are not allowed to smoke cigarettes. Students ranging from 14 to 20 years of age attend the school and live on-campus for anywhere from 13 to over 20 months depending on when they enter the program and how well they work with it. It cannot really be fully explained to anyone who has not had the experience, but it has helped to foster the growth of many heroes who walk the streets of our great nation.</p>

<p>Koryu-Te-Jutsu is a rather new self defence art, founded in 1999 by <b>Filip Verplancke Sensei</b> (Belguim). The style is a "Back To Basics" system of self defence and counter attack, primarily based upon Shotokan Karate, Ju JItsu and Judo techniques. The idea behind Koryu-Te-Jutsu is to redescover the tru use of techniques and forms that are trained today but are hudreds and in some cases 1000 years old. By analysing the movements of known martial arts and comparing them to Ancient styles such as Tai Chi and Chi Kung plus analysing the points of impact and comparing those with the accupressure points, a very usable style was developed. Because of the integrated use of energy meridians and acupressure/acupunctureknowledge, the style is open to anyone even disabeled and physically weaker people.</p>

<p>Lars Gathenhielm, before knighthood 1715 Lars Gathe, aka Lasse i Gatan, born 1689, dead 1718, Swedish pirate.</p>
<p>Lars Gathenhielm was born on the estate Gatan in Onsala Parish in Halland. Parents were the skipper Anders Börjesson Gathe and his wife Kerstin Larsdotter, daughter of a mill owner in Hjälm, Fjärås Parish</p>
<p>To protect the Swedish navigation from pirates and to harm the enemy Karl XII's govermetn began a piracy campaign in June 1710 with Lars Gathenhielm from Onsala as front figure.</p>
<p>He gained lots of early successes with his galleon Lilla Jägaren. The hijacked ships increased in numbers and many of Onsalas sailors were quickly re-educated to pirates. Lars suffered from a hip hinjury that made him dependent on croutchs to walk and therefor he probably didnt spend much time on the sea himself. His strength was probably as shipowner while the practical stuff was handled by his serfs. Lars were at a few times accused of pure piracy (hitting Swedish ships as well) but he was protected by the king himself and therefor he was never punished for this.</p>
<p>Lars and his brother Christian were 1715 knighted as Gathenhielm for their efforts in the Swedish navigation. Lars was later appointed commandor in the West Coast Marine District.</p>
<p>Lars Gathenhielm died in 1718, only 29 years old from tubercolosis but the piracy empire he had created continued under his wife, Ingela Hammar. He and his wife are buried in Onsala Church.</p>
<p>The name Gathe was taken from Lars father to mimic the farms name. Gathenhielm was created as a mix of his grandparents homes</p>

<p>Banner Pilot is a punk band from Minneapolis, MN. Started in 2005, they initially employed the inhuman PC Drummer but have since given it the boot in favor of the non-digital Danny. After cycling through a series of names like Break September (too emo sounding), The Apollo Creed (too Creed sounding), and Skabraham Lincoln (too ska sounding), they settled on Banner Pilot, which is a reference to those guys who fly around in planes with banners behind them. Yeah.</p>
<p>What do they sound like? Well, imagine if Jawbreaker and the Lawrence Arms and Alkaline Trio all got in a knife fight and Jawbreaker won, but just barely. That's what we sound like. Does that even make sense? Probably not.</p>
<p>Nate also plays in Off With Their Heads and Pyongyang Metro, and used to play in Rivethead, Snowpants, and Supermanure. Nick used to play in Rivethead and now lip-syncs in the Hawaii Show. Danny also plays in Cave Deaths and These Riffs. Mike also plays in Pyongyang Metro.</p>

<p>Kueh lapis (layer cake) is a rich kueh consisting of thin alternating layers made of butter, eggs and sugar, piled on top of each other. Each layer is laid down and baked separately, making the creation of a kueh lapis an extremely laborious and time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Kueh Lapis has a rich buttery taste and aroma. It is a sweet desert that goes well together with other pastries and wine. It is also a perfect complement with coffee or tea. An item that high tea should always include! It is a well-liked delicacy locally. However, Kueh Lapis is seldom made in kitchens due to the tedious processes and patience needed.</p>

<p>Trimension is a framerate enhancement software by Philips for video, primarily DVD. The software utilizes both picture and stream information to render new frames between the original frames of video (tweening), thus increasing the framerate and enhancing the smoothness of motion.</p>
<p>Currently, Trimension is capable of enhancing frame rate from 24 to 48 (for 60hz displays) or 72 frames per second.</p>
<p>The motion produced by Trimension is not entirely natural, but can be pleasing in many respects. The software has been criticized for artifical look and has been said to make film seem like video, and potentially to degrade the movie-watching experience. Another, probably insurmountable, negative detail is that the software cannot distinguish between material which is to be smoothed and material which should not (for instance, a movie scene which features the characters watching television would not only have smoothed motion on the characters, but also on the TV screen). There is also a slight cropping of the video to allow for good edges of the smoothed picture.</p>
<p>Framerate enhancement can provide an interesting benefit if it is performed after upscaling. If the picture is scaled to a high-definition resolution and then tweened, the tweened frames will have motion that exists in the high-definition space even though the actual picture resolution does not. It is unclear whether available implementations of Trimension scale before or after tweening.</p>
<p>Intervideo includes Trimension as part of their WinDVD software beginning with version 6.</p>
