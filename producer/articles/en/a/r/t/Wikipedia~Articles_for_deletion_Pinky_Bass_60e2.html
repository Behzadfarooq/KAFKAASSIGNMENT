<li><b>KEEP</b> Before the article was 'torn apart by some editors and actually had parts deleted altogether instead of trying to find info it is easier just to delete it for some unscrupulous editors on here. it was much more informative before all the mess. Bass is a notable person especially in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinhole.html" title="Pinhole">Pinhole</a> camera work. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 10:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>One would have to be delusional not to note Bass vast accomplishments. I never understood why someone deleted the (id) exhibition that included only a few artists among them Robert Maplethorpe unless it was just as a slight. For Bass to even begin to deconstruct and sew and utilize photography in such a manner and then to be applauded for it is a very high honor indeed. With work in Ashville Art Museum, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Museum_of_Art_60eb.html" title="Birmingham Museum of Art">Birmingham Museum of Art</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Arts_Museum_Houston_fc72.html" title="Contemporary Arts Museum Houston">Contemporary Arts Museum Houston</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Museum_of_Art_6d8f.html" title="High Museum of Art">High Museum of Art</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, the Montgomery Museum of Art, and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art_c498.html" title="Philadelphia Museum of Art">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a> plus a couple of films with her work what else would a person need for an article on here. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 11:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hey, don't over-sauce the dinner: <i>One would have to be delusional not to note Bass vast accomplishments</i>... Whatever Bass has done, "vast accomplishments" is putting it way too strongly for your own case. Furthermore, leave out the dangling slur, <i>unscrupulous editors</i>. I don't much care one way or the other whether Pinky remains a Wikipedia article, but your tone has put me off enough that I would like to vote <i>delete</i>, especially as the article is quite wretched at the moment. Still, I'm willing to be convinced that there is some merit in a short sketch of Bass's career, assuming the quotations don't continue to outweigh the other sections in the article. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 01:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: <i>With work in Ashville Art Museum, Birmingham Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the Montgomery Museum of Art, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art plus a couple of films with her work what else would a person need for an article on here.</i> Since you ask... She has had one solo exhibition. Has it verifiably generated critical comment? Has there been a single book of her work? Despite working in a populous, affluent English-speaking nation and thus having a great advantage in the (admittedly often absurd or repellent) struggle for recognition, Bass doesn't appear in the long index of the capacious <i>Oxford Companion to the Photograph.</i> (She's also not mentioned in any other photography book in which I looked her up.) She may indeed be very significant: I'm open to persuasion. So far, I'm underwhelmed. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:37, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Still wondering</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability (people)</a> tells us that notable photographers are those who "received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". I don't see multiple independent reviews, and I see no awards other than those of two grants: no award of a kind that is, or might reasonably be, included in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Category%7EPhotography_awards_b75e.html" title="Category:Photography awards">Category:Photography awards</a> or similar. This guideline continues: "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." I wholeheartedly agree with this: without it, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Rossier_1b23.html" title="Pierre Rossier">Pierre Rossier</a> and many other articles would be wrongly deleted. However, Rossier (like many others) has obvious alternative notability, and I have trouble seeing this in Bass. She's mentioned in some books, occasional photos by her appear in some books, she teaches. The only possible plus is that her work has, we are told, been exhibited (by itself? within group shows?) in some prestigious places. However, there seems to be no evidence provided for most of these exhibitions. She verifiably (<a href="http://www.montevallo.edu/art/artgallery.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.montevallo.edu/art/artgallery.shtm" rel="nofollow">link</a>) had a solo exhibition at a university. Fine, but the university I went to had/has a little exhibition space that (perhaps unjustly) was/is largely ignored by the outside world and indeed by the huge majority of the university's own staff and students: I wouldn't take an exhibition there as proof of notability and until I see external reviews of the Montevallo show I wonder about that too. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment: Bass is also listed in the <a href="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" rel="nofollow">Women in Photography, International Archive</a> now housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>. also for those who would like to know more before weighing in on Bass work please read the article after I have updated numerous sources. It is important to realize that photographers, as a general rule, are exhibited in more group shows more than say painters or printmakers. Please consider the achievements of Bass when casting a vote. How many other photographers on WP have far fewer achievements and still have posted articles? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 16:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article is really poor. The alleged notability of Bass is all very thin and the primary author only makes it worse by repeatedly trying to puff up her qualifications. For example, the honor of being named a "Georgia Women in the Visual Arts" is a title that the Ga. legislature bestowed on at least 150 other women that year. Its great that she made the list, but we can't hardly have articles on each of those people, so it doesn't make her notable. The same holds true of these exhibits that she has been included in -- she was one of many artists so included. A second example is the <a href="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" rel="nofollow">Women in Photography, International Archive</a> listing (which we are thoughtfully told is "now housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>"). Bass has a one line reference to a 24 page catalog of an exhibit. <a href="../../../i/m/o/Imogen_Cunningham_b52f.html" title="Imogen Cunningham">Imogen Cunningham</a> has 13 listings, many of which are major books about her. This article is so full of this puffed up information that on more than one occasion I tried to edit it down to its provable, notable points to see what we have. I was harshly accused of "hacking up" the article, but my point then and now is that including a phone book's worth of information tells the reader nothing. These laundry list articles merely leads a discriminating reader to wonder why all this unnecessary information is listed. Have a look at a truly notable photographer's article -- Cartier-Bresson or Edward Weston -- and you will not find a listing for every group exhibit in which the photographer was included. Now look at this article's reference or external link list -- most of these references contain a single line for Bass out of a much larger publication. And now <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> makes his last chance argument that many other photographers listed on Wiki are less notable -- please list these articles and we can start an AfD process on them. No, this article does not demonstrate Bass's notability and should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 04:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. TheMindsEye is in places undeservedly harsh, I think: most photographers who rightly get an article in WP aren't as notable/celebrated as Cartier-Bresson or (grandpa) Weston. (Only half a dozen or so could be.) Better to compare Bass with less celebrated but yet deservedly respected north American photographers as different from each other as, say, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Polidori_b480.html" title="Robert Polidori">Robert Polidori</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Owens_%28photographer%29_2178.html" title="Bill Owens (photographer)">Bill Owens</a> (neither of whom has half as good an article as he deserves, incidentally). It's here that we see how weak Bass's claim to notability is. And I fear that TheMindsEye is right: the article on Bass has recently suffered from an infusion of ho-hum material. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weighing in</b> Seeing that I pulled this article together, how many Southern Women photographers are as notable as Bass? Maybe just a handfull. Editors please make your decision based on the relative facts as anything else here is not useful. When I was asked for more information to try to win over support for this article I felt compelled to find what I could find not necessarily weighing it against what is already there nor did I try to <i>puff it up</i>. I stated what I thought to be correct information to the best of my knowledge and I have never vandalized an article by including misrepresentation or by deleting whole areas from someone elses articles for any reason. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 08:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a tough one: being neither in nor from north America, I tend to confuse Canadians and Youessians, let alone northerners and southerners within the US. (I'm also not well up on very recent US photography, as a lot of what I've glanced at is "me" and "my friends" stuff that doesn't interest me.) <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Mann_30ef.html" title="Sally Mann">Sally Mann</a>? <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudora_Welty_46b3.html" title="Eudora Welty">Eudora Welty</a>? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
