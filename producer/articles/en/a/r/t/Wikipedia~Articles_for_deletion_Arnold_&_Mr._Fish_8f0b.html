<li>Excuse me, but those pages happen to total over 1,000 hits. This webcomic is highly anticipated, and a website is being developed. There is no reason to delete this article, for this webcomic will be released on its own domain in less than 20 days. This article is being finished tonight, complete with pictures, and will be professional. I have no idea why you would delete a professional article, when little 11-year old girls are making unprofessional character pages for their favorite shows/movies. Your deletion is a personal vendetta, and I know you're the one from the talk page. Good day. Oh yeah, and your Google search is unrealible, since you included quotes. I deleted the link for you.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/m/u/User%7EDmurawski_26f6.html" title="User:Dmurawski">Dmurawski</a> (<a href="../../../d/m/u/User_talk%7EDmurawski_fdf4.html" title="User talk:Dmurawski">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmurawski_d815.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmurawski">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You are just a lonely old man who has nothing better to do than delete articles because they aren't "fit" enough. You're causing me to have a nervous breakdown. If you try to delete my article, which revolves around a featured webcomic with 1,000 hits, I WILL report you. And if this message does not show up, I am going to go insane. Quit. Deleting. Other.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. This means it reports on subjects that have already achieved mainstream acceptance. We do not make editorial decisions on what is significant, we rely on other reliable sources to do that and report on their decisions. When your webcomic has made a significant impact that has been reported by independent sources we will be happy to include an article on it. Until then, I'm afraid Wikipedia is not going to cover it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Come back when your comic achieves notability. You can always recreate it then, with proper verifiable references about what a success it has been, and a more positive attitude towards our policies and to common civility, I hope. Good luck, but this is not the place to advertise it meantime. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 03:22, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Ugh." I swear you people don't listen. I already told you, ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE have voted on it, 75% approving it, and wanting to see more. Among webcomics, it can't get more mainstream. You are all personally attacking me, and I wish you nothing but the worst for being so very, very cruel. Please, whoever decides whether to delete my article, look at its quality and over-one-thousand-people fan base.

<li><b>Comment</b>—I just read your article; you write rather well for an early article and will make a solid editor. I'm sure it feels personal (my first deleted article felt that way too), but it is almost assuredly not—I don't yet know you &amp; I’d doubt the others who commented here do either. We did indeed understand your assertion that "ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE have voted on it, 75% approving it, and wanting to see more;" but you do not provide a link or other reference, so it is hard to verify &amp; Wikipedia policy requires verifiability. Since this is an encyclopedia, not a promotional medium, we do guard carefully against folks who use it for advertisements. Please read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and adjust the article if you can to meet the criteria there.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I realize you're close to the article's subject. But the opinions expressed of the above editors are not personal. If you really want to report people (but for what exactly?), you can open up an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. But, you need to show that they're violating policy (read <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">WP:POLICY</a>), you need to show that they have failed to see your side of the story, and you need to show that another person has done the same thing of them. And by threatening to report for deleting your article, and calling other people names, you yourself might not be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Now.
