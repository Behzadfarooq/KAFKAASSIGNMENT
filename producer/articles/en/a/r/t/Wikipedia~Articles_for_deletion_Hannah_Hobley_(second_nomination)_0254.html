<p>Previously deleted by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hannah_Hobley_4d38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hannah Hobley">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hannah Hobley</a>. Two articles: one says that Hannah Hobley is an actress who plays Chantelle Garvey, the other says that Chantelle Garvey is a character played by Hannah Hobley. And that, literally, is it. No evidence that this (very young) actress has achieved multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable independent secondary sources. These, and one-liners on a couple of other characters, are the only work of the user who created them. Previous versions have been created by the actress herself, which invites suspicion when an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> is the creator this time round. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 07:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually there is considerable evidence that this actress has achieved mulitiple coverage. As well as her IMDB entry, just do a Google search on her name and there are umpteen references to the actress and the character she plays in online TV magazines such as the Radio Times etc. The ITV and Tiger Aspect websites have both references and pictures of her also. What has her age got to do with anything?!! Also interesing to note that <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy.html" title="Guy">Guy</a> has proposed deletion of Chantelle Garvey but none of the other characters from the Benidorm TV series - why?

<li><b>Keep</b>This actress is listed as a principal cast member on both the ITV and Tiger Aspect websites, so certainly not a 'bit part' actor and Benidorm is a major ITV sitcom which has been so successful that it has been recommissioned for a second seriesFspinner 14:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wrtten by a BAFTA nominated writer and with a cast of well known British comedy actors and broadcast on the main ITV channel with peak viewing of over 5.5 million, that's how I would define 'major'Fspinner 14:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Whereas I would define major as having been described as major by reliable secondary sources. And I would also describe a significant actress as having been described as significant by reliable secondary sources. You can see where this is headed, can't you? And that's cast <i>including</i> not cast <i>of</i> well-known British comic actors (and Johnny Vegas, who must have a talent for something, I just haven't spotted what it is yet). Appearing in a show with big names does not make you a big name. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I wasn't suggesting that this actress was a 'big name' and I was actually replying to a question about Benidorm the TV series , not the actress under discussion. I would say that being a principal cast member in an ITV1 show certainly is notable under Wikipedia rules and those rules don't require you to be a 'big name' actor to be worthy of a wikipedia article. I notice you haven't replied to my questions about why the ITV website and Tiger Aspect website are not (in your opinion) good enough to be considered as reliable secondary sources. Oh and you also haven't responded to my question about you mentioning her age. I wonder, are you a frustrated performer of some kind? You can see where I'm heading with this can't you?

<li>Two things first, speedy keep is an invalid&#160;!vote here; second, who says major character? Not the reliable secondary sources (of which none are cited in the article). The <i>major</i> parts are listed in the article for the show. Who says major show? The time slot says otherwise.

<dd><b>Comment</b> "The time slot says otherwise" - Huh? <i>Benidorm</i> was on at 10pm, generally ITV's highest-rating slot after 7-8pm (which contains <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmerdale.html" title="Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a>) - and had to go out after 9pm at any case due to the UK's watershed rules. Not saying it wasn't an <i>awful</i> programme but it was certainly a major one, given that it was flavour-of-the-month Johnny Vegas's first mainstream sitcom; the only issue is whether her part in it is enough to make her notable given her lack of other experience. IMO the fact that ITV lists her as one of the main credits on their website is enough to make her so, even if the article does need a huge fleshing-out. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 22:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With the greatest of respect, I think you misunderstand the workings of the television business. She does not work for ITV. In this instance, ITV is a network that transmits a programme that she is in. Neither does she work for Tiger Aspect. Most actors are self-employed and effectively <i>sell</i> their services. What's confusing is that <i>some</i> actors are in fact salaried and <b>do</b> work for ITV. A good example of this would be the actors who are regular characters on Coronation Street and are on the ITV payroll. So when you consider this, it is totally reasonable to say that the websites I have listed <b>do</b> represent independent, verifiable and reliable sources. There are pictures of her, in character, on three of the websites and she is listed by name also. The ITV Press website has background information about her. Incidentally, it's generally accepted that 'bit part' actors can generally be identified by actors credits that list their role as 'man at bustop' or by the character just having a first name Fspinner 13:33, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>With the greatest respect, I don't. She appears in a TV show for ITV, produced by a production company. Neither ITV or the production company are independent sources, it's not difficult to work out. Even ignoring that, the sources are trivial, as evidenced by the "good deal" of information being a laughable two sentences. We're trying to create an encylopedia, not a directory of every two-bit struggling actor/actress that there's absolutely zero public interest in. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22hannah+hobley%22+-wikipedia+-myspace+-imdb&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22hannah+hobley%22+-wikipedia+-myspace+-imdb&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> ignoring IMDB, Myspace and Wikipedia returns a grand total of 39 unique hits, so there's no interest. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 13:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>two-bit struggling actor/actress</i> - well talk about you insisting on verifiable secondary sources!.... you hardly have any proof that this actress is 'two bit' or 'struggling', so there was no need to say that really was there? Anyway, good to see that you confirmed that she appears in an ITV show. Incidentally I disagree with your google search analysis. There are considerable number of hits from TV listings and <i>laughable two sentences</i>?, you obviously haven't read the ITV press release with her biog have you?

<li><b>Comment</b> If you take the time to read what I said, I did not describe Hobley as two bit or struggling, so kindly refrain from making false accusations. You disagree with my Google search analysis? What do you disagree with? The 39 unique hits? The lack of any non-trivial reliable sources in those 39 hits? The fact that all TV guides generally say is her name and that she appears in the show? I have not read the ITV press release given that the link to it is not in the article or on this page to the best of my knowledge, but that does not change the fact that the article is two sentences long. So perhaps you might like to improve the article instead of arguing over guidelines and policies which you seem rather oblivious to? <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 14:58, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>We're trying to create an encylopedia, not a directory of every two-bit struggling actor/actress that there's absolutely zero public interest in.</i> .....well, I thought that read pretty much like you were implying that this was what you considered this actress to be and it's there in black and white for others to judge but, hey, you've said you didn't describe her as such, so that's fair enough. I certainly don't want you to think I've been making false accusations about you Fspinner 15:18, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
