<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

<p>I am nominating this vanity page for deletion because I strongly suspect that it violates several Wikipedia policies, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>no original research</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</li>
</ul>
<p>A Google search for this so-called institute brings up only 501 hits.</p>
<p>The user who created this page has been attempting to link several pages (like <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_v._Arizona_0d43.html" title="Miranda v. Arizona">Miranda v. Arizona</a>) to this page when such links, if any, should link to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lilburne_f893.html" title="John Lilburne">John Lilburne</a>. Furthermore, as I have already argued at great length on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lilburne_6e19.html" title="Talk:John Lilburne">John Lilburne talk page</a>, Lilburne's impact on modern law may well be of historical importance, but in terms of how modern American criminal law is practiced at present, his impact is minimal when compared to giants like Blackstone, Story, and Ely.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity. This article was written with love and care by an insider who tried to make this non-notable group sound as though it had an actual impact in the world. I would also vote for deletion of Four Freedoms Federation and all the other links these articles contain to non-notable groups and people.

<li><b>Keep</b> unless you can show me why an organization that essentially went into decline around 1992 should have a lot of hits on Google in 2005? By this reasoning only current organizations can be mentioned. Second, this organization obviously did attract attention back in the period from 1984 to 1992, as referenced by publications and broadcasts. For some reason <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> who describes himself/herself as a "law student" has decided that it is of no consequence that Chief Justice Warren linked Lilburne to Miranda in his opinion of the 1960s, because according to some strange logic here, only cases of the present age are of merit according to this "know-it-all" law student who does not cite books but only various Internet research tools. But not everything is already on the Internet. That's one reason for having Wikipedia! Consequently Leonard W. Levy who won a Pulitzer in 1969 for his work (Origins of the Fifth Amendment) that has Lilburne at its core, is of no avail according to <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>, who actually went pretty much to the limit by virtually calling Justice Black a senile old git who could not remember the day of the week for adopting Lilburne as his hero. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> dismissed Black's biography as being "what did she know, he was too old". I have not used the Heritage Foundation and many other sources for reference because the article is quite long already. However <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> is making a POV rant by his call for deletion to get rid of something that was news to him/her that did not fit in with something that he/she already knew because on this score <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> has gone to great lengths to explain his/her superior knowledge about all matters relating to law ... without having a clue as to who he/she is attacking. Anyway, its only a historical article, so whatever. However, if this article falls for this silly reason, then just imagine how many other articles totally unrelated to this subject would be immediately struck from Wikipedia using the same criteria used by <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>. The sad fact about many Internet junkies is that they declared war on traditional libraries and it is within the books of those libraries that the jewels of education are to be found. When the Internet swept in many libraries began dumping and sometimes selling huge quantities of books and anything else that was printed in order to make space for computer screens. Fortunately many collections were rescued, but not all. But what has been created is a world where books are dispised and the computer screen is thought to hold the keys to all truth.

<div class="boilerplate metadata vfd" style="background-color: #F3F9FF; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;">This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page. The result of the debate was <b>No Consensus</b> default to <b>Keep.</b> I count 33 Keep, 28 Delete, and 3 Merge (counting "rename" as a vote to keep, since we can't delete &amp; rename), which is roughly 44% Delete, 51% Keep, 5% merge; soundly <b>No Consensus.</b> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 01:18, August 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A slight recount, as it appears the number of votes was a bit off: I see 30 Keeps and 30 Deletes. (The nominator's vote, even if the identity is in question, should be counted as a delete). Reviewing the "rename" votes appears that they are likewise split: there are 5 "Keep, but rename" (counted as Keeps), and 3 Rename <b>OR</b> Merge-- which should default to merge, rather than "keep" -- since we can't, as you say, keep &amp; merge. Plus, there are 3 clear "Merge with State Terrorism." (1 vote to delete the "troll nominator" was not counted either way). My feeling is that in this instance, Merge votes should be considered a special form of "delete"-- with a request to removing the separate article, and combine the factual info into another one. Thus, they should not be counted against "Delete" in the final tally. Thus, it's pretty much 50/50. Still a No Consensus, of course-- which is just why VfDs will continue to be problematic. --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 06:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This one was a difficult one to close. I considered leaving it alone, but it was the last one in the archive, so I decided to suck it up and close it.

<p>Pardon me for having to edit this already existant VfD page, I do not happen to know how to archive this previous VfD page. I bring this page to a VfD delete for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel it is inherently biased</li>
<li>A page of this manner already exists dealing with Israeli state terrorism and this should be merged there AT THE MOST</li>
<li>This page could easily be renamed Jewish Terrorism as that it what it deals with and such a page is inherently biased as it attacks Jews</li>
<li>This page has been heavily edited by known anti-Semitic and anti-Caucasian racists [personal attack removed] ... and despite popular concensus in the real world that accusations against Israel are laughable, these claims have been allowed to remain on Wikipedia</li>
<li>The last time it was brought to VfD vote, there was not really a true concensus met and there should be a revote. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 00:50, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Brother, I assure you my nomination is completely in good faith, I merely seek to rid the world of the sick propaganda that the Socialist Establishment espouses, namely articles such as this one. My comments about "Mustafaa" were not meant as a personal attack and I am sorry if they have been interpreted in such manner, however I do not rescind my statements one bit. I beleive it has been established time and time again on wikipedia that Mustafaa is biased against Whites and Jews and anyone who is proud of their Whiteness and adherance to Judaism. Do I even need to point further than to the Islamic-Arab allusion his username alludes to than to prove that he is a Socialist Racist? But thank you for backing me up, I wish I could state myself so eloquently as you but yes, this article is very POV and has ZERO encyclopedic content. -<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 02:53, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I agree with Slim and Jayig; I think its worht noting that perhaps this article is talking about the wrong things. You have to look at the fact that Israel in the not so didtant past sanctioned torture. Beond that, Israeli Tarrorim has a phenomenon is worht mention; that is simply because it exsists in a good portion of people's minds in our world, in needs to be adressed. I think this page addresses it in entirely the worng way. Rahter we should be looking at how and why people came to look at Israeli actions as terrorism in the first place, who those people are and why they came to their conclusions. --<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouieS_5c23.html" title="User:LouieS">LouieS</a> 14:07, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Louie, fairies exist in the minds of lots of people in the world, but that doesn't make them real. Our policies say we should cite the views of published majority- and significant-minority opinion (not tiny-minority opinion). When I last looked, not a single source was cited, so the article as it stands violates our content policies, and were it to be cleaned up to be in accordance with them, much of its current content would have to be deleted. The point is that it's unfair to single Israel out when there's no article on British terrorism, French terrorism, Italian terrorism, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:28, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not a proponent of the singling out either. I think the solution here is to extend the information relating to other examples of state terrorism. Surely, this would help put things into perspective. This can start by extending the country sections of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> article -- if a country's section becomes large, a new article should be created. I think the "don't single anyone out" argument should always be dealt with by extending the information that we represent rather than removing information. Should we not have created an article on Windows until we have Linux? The detractors can add balance by adding information rather than removing it.</li>

This account will probably be banned soon too since SlimVirgin said I can't return until I "prove I am not Alberinu". Right. Well that should be easy&#160;:-/. No worries though, I was just on a friends account reading this and decided to answer some questions, Ill probably stop editing after this. First off I am not Alberuni, I dont even know who that is, but if hes anti-Semitic then he deserves to be banned or whatever. For you nosy Commie bastards that want to know more about me, I am in my 20s originally from Tel-Aviv, now living in the United States, HAPPY? I started reading Wiki about 2 months ago and have been especially reading this page until I decided to stand up for Jews everywhere and VfD this POS. I'd just like to say all you a-holes who have accused me of racism while being blind to your own hatred of the White Race, you are truly HYPOCRITES. How come I dont see any articles about how the damn Mexicans are terrorizing the US by coming over here ILLEGALY and lowering our standard of living? How come I dont see any articles on how East Asians are increasinly taking over Slavic lands in Asia ILLEGALLY and IMMORRALY? Huh?

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable artist/writer. I know because I just came to Wikipedia specifically to find out about whoever writes Ghastly's, and to research the authors of some other web comics (although its a bit sparce here. So it seems that the page is useful. The page should follow the Wikipedia standard formatting and style more closely. Perhaps there should even be two articles, one on the Comic, and one on the author's life, particularly his comics career. This would seem more in line with other entertainment media represented on wikip.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> This article is about a music group popular in the Long Island, New York underground, not the Will Smith show. This is one of the few detailed accounts of its kind. Popularity is not grounds for validity. Information regarding this band is scant, and can only be found in a few magazines. I feel bad for the experimental music community if they are all treated in the same manner as the Fresh Princes. I have relatives of relatives who live in their hometown, and all of this information seems to be relevant and valid in regard to their history and personalities.

Multiple unsigned entries, from unregistered users, made to look like votes (except that the proper way to express <i>Don't Delete</i> is actually <i>Keep</i>) does not help your case. Only one vote can be considered. Making points outside of Wikipedia guidelines does not help your case, either. Whether we like them or not doesn't enter into it at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> Oddly enough I have run into valid forms of this band all over the wildly exciting internet. They are an ever popular and dare I say prolific band that many seem to enjoy. For the rest of you that have seemingly wasted much time on debating the inclusion or (mostly) exclusion of this entry, I pity you for trying to create such an exclusionary site for absolutely no reason. 68.117.137.4 03:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)MJK68.117.137.4 03:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, you must spend your time on a different wildly exciting internet than I do. A search for "The Fresh Princes" Pogsnatcher got me, count 'em, zero hits. A search for just "the fresh princes" got 138 hits, none that I could see referring to this group. So non-notable it is. No one here doubts the fact that your band is entertaining. But you do not have a track record. This encyclopedia stretches its arms far more broadly than any paper-based encyclopedia, but it is still an encyclopedia and it only accepts entries on those who have achieved some degree of notability. Please read the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> article to see what is required for a band article to make it here (and yes, it's not official policy yet, but it is about as close as you're going to get). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:31, 2005 August 3 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>This topic should not be deleted.</b></p>
<p>The subject matter is religion.</p>
<p>Is Humblefool? an editor of this type of topic?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a series of articles that suggest that Christianity comes from pagan origins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such articles are all over the internet and on Wikipedia as well.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The debates on this topic are widespread and involve both Christians<br />
(interdenominationally) as well as 'non'believers</p>
<p>Mr. Woodrow originally wrote a book - <b>AGREEING</b> that there are pagan roots to Christianity. It was very popular.</p>
<p>It (his book) took many of its assumptions from earlier works by <b>Alexander Hislop</b> (Wikipedia) as well as his theories regarding <b>The Two Babylons</b> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The Wikipedia articles on the above -2- subjects <b>LIST Mr. Woodrow</b> as someone who has argued <b>AGAINST</b> these points of view.</p>
<p>THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION GIVES MR WOODROWS point of view as to why he found his own earlier work, as well as the work of Alexander Hislop, <b>to be fraudulent and in error.</b></p>
<p>Any reader of this particular subject would have great interest in understanding that Christianity, while it is accused of being from pagan origions, is NOT in fact .... and that the historical facts do not support such a claim. Mr. Woodrow, and his book REFUTE these claims.</p>
<p><b>ONE OF ITS VERY PROPONENTS (Woodrow)</b> is now one of its critics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the purpose of Wikipedia if not to inform the reader to give them insight into each side of a subject and a broader understanding of the topic.<br />
Wikipedia <b>already LISTS a LINK to RALPH WOODROWS name</b>as being a critic of the Hislop - Two Babylons theory .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LEAST Wikipedia could offer its readers is what Mr Ralph Woodrows actual thoughts on the matter are!</p>

<p>Much of what is in the original articles by Alexander Hislop<br />
(Two Babylons) are unsubstantiated and are no more than his opinion.<br />
Apparently Alexander Hislops saving grace (here) is that he is long dead.</p>
<p>Mr Woodrow is a known critic (and one-time exponent)<br />
of those very same 'opinions'.</p>
<p>His POV or 'opinion' is RELEVANT for that very reason.<br />
And although some may quible with his syntax or 'phrase-ology' ...<br />
I would argue that the very VALUE of his words are because of JUST THAT<br />
because they ARE his words ...</p>
<p>When other peoples thoughts and ideas are recorded here -<br />
is it incumbent upon the gallery to edit their thoughts&#160;?</p>
<p><br />
Were there an article on Princess Dianna's criticism of the press (here)<br />
- would we correct her statements for grammer or use of analogy?</p>
<p>In an article on the Pope, (here) would we edit his remarks<br />
so as to reflect the Protestant view?</p>
<p>The views expressed are those of Mr Woodrow -<br />
any reader of such a text link would understand FROM HIS WORDS<br />
that what they were reading WAS HIS VIEW ...</p>
<p>Isn't that the point&#160;?</p>

<li>What's with all these allegations of "sock puppets"? I know there are a lot of first-timers here, but that's different than a sock puppet, as I understand it. What's happening is that word has spread in the atheist community about this attempted deletion and the attempted deletion of the Atheists of Silicon Valley entry. But these votes are, to my knowledge, all real (my email inbox is full of a similar number of responses). These comments are opinionated as heck, yes, but they're <b>real</b>. Discounting them as "sock puppets" is just inaccurate, unless you have evidence that you are not sharing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianFlemming_592b.html" title="User:BrianFlemming">BrianFlemming</a> 03:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just a note: sockpuppets or first-timers, while certainly different phenomena, have the same result on VFD, and that is uncounted votes. Certainly, "word has spread", and it seems to have been done with purpose, that being to keep this article (though seemingly on the grounds that deletion would be censorship, which is not something carried out on Wikipedia). So, accurate or otherwise, it won't really make a difference. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 03:23, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That seems to settle it, then. Despite some attempts to poison the well against anon and first-time votes, they're welcomed by the rules, even if they don't carry as much weight as regular users.

<li>Uh. I have no problems with discussion for everyone and by everyone. I got tagged as a potential sockpuppet myself the first time I voted. that having been said, this particualr situation is ridiculous. Let me point something out about my statement "Can we move all the anon and sock puppet votes" Anons. Move them. Not remove them, but move them. My precise problem with the vast majority of these votes are: They make it hard to "count votes", and more importantly, they either say very little otehr than 'keep' or they start yacking about bookburning, censorship, and other such things. This is a breach of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and can be seen as an act of bad faith editing.

<li>Okay, I'm not going to vote at this point, although I'd like to point out that the issue of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyvio.html" title="Copyvio">copyright violation</a> is one which we take <i>very</i> seriously. If the text is copied from somewhere else, then that's grounds to blank the article. We simply can't take someone's word for it that "oh, it's okay", because everything on Wikipedia is <i><b>public domain</b></i>; so rather than being copied from somewhere else, it <b>has</b> to be reworded. Maybe the copyvio allegation is valid, maybe it's false, I'm really not in the mood to do a comparison just now, so I'll leave that be. More importantly, though, for those of you who voted but are not registered users, I politely suggest that you read my <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_First-timer_2efa.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven/First-timer">my article explaining what you've done wrong</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 16:09, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

How could deleting this entire entry possibly be the right thing to do here? BrianFlemming</small>
<ul>
<li>Ah, so it does and so it is; objection withdrawn. In addition, I'm in a better mood now, and I've read through the article, and I've compared it to the press kit, etc, and I have to say, I don't see any problem with <b>keep</b>ing it. I would also like to kindly suggest to the many anonymous voters who are accusing us of being rabidly anti-atheist to please, consider that anyone can put any article up for VfD at any time (although if you do it maliciously, and repeatedly, you <b>will</b> be blocked from editing). All it takes is one person to suggest that it be deleted, and then we debate it, like we're doing now. And the process typically <i><b>works</b></i>; you'll note that the majority of the signed votes are pro-keep?

It's a separate issue, but the fact that every attempt to start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universist" rel="nofollow">an entry about the Universist Movement</a> here has met with resistance from Wikipedia editors has fueled a perception that <i>some</i> Wikipedians organize to keep freethought from being acknowledged here. I'm not saying it's true, just noting the perception. I have to admit, I'm very perplexed about the multiple kills of the Universist entry. The Universists have had entire articles written about them in publications such as the <i>New York Times</i>, and as a member of the atheist community (but not of the Universists), I know that they are a major force. The assertion that the Universists are insignificant is clearly false, and it resembles the argument of Calton here that The God Who Wasn't There is an insignificant "straight to video" film. <i>And</i> it resembles Calton's false claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists_of_Silicon_Valley" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists_of_Silicon_Valley" rel="nofollow">Atheists of Silicon Valley</a> is an insignificant group of only "local interest." There is a pattern here. All three of these claims of insignificance are false, and all three are attempts to spike Wikipedia acknowledgement of non-theist projects. Yes, there's a lot of smoke here (some of it unproductive, unwarranted and clearly casting the net of blame far too wide), but there's some fire. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianFlemming_592b.html" title="User:BrianFlemming">BrianFlemming</a> 18:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

We also addressed the possibility of the article being a copyright violation, which was resolved when the creator of the material in question pointed out that he was explicitly granting us permission.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This movie has attracted significant media attention and includes interviews from figures who also have their own articles on Wikipedia. It is notable. <a href="../../../e/b/o/User%7EEbonmuse_65e4.html" title="User:Ebonmuse">Ebonmuse</a> 02:21, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Since there seems to be no copyvio, I see no real problem with the article. Though I don't know that the movie is extremely significant, I prefer to keep articles on things that meet at least minimum criteria for significance because I think it makes Wikipedia stronger than a normal encyclopedia. As for sockpuppets, I think it's okay for someone who has been using Wikipedia but may not have had an account (or even a total newbie) to join and cast a <b>reasoned</b> vote, but there clearly has been a totally emotional campaign to keep this article by people who don't understand Wikipedia and don't participate in the community. I hope that Brian Flemming has learned from this process, as he instigated at least some of the campaign on his blog. From what he says, I think he has. For the record, I say all this as someone who would almost certainly strongly disagree with the movie itself.<a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 06:36, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am familiar with J. Palackal's earlier work on the musical study of Arnos Paathiri's <i>Puththenpaana</i> (see the references in the article which I have contributed on <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnos_Paathiri_0993.html" title="Arnos Paathiri">Arnos Paathiri</a>). I can affirm that his work in that matter carries great distinction; it is a record of certain hallowed but sadly neglected cultural traditions among the Christians of Kerala (who have a history which extends to the apostles) and, as far as I am aware, it remains the only treatise on the topic. I did not know about the recent Ph. D. thesis that is mentioned in the biographical article, but I can deduce from the title the likely content; this is again, I think, a weighty topic (very different from the previous one), and I don't think there has been any study at all of Syriac music in Kerala, in spite of its great antiquity. I have felt that he is a scholar of moment, and also that his works are important to the future of an ancient culture. I also know of some of the activities of the Christian musicological society of India, which he heads: it has continued to play a significant part in moulding the Christian community in Kerala, chiefly through the study and innovative application of music and its traditions as a cultural medium. He certainly deserves a wikipedia article. I do not think the article should be deleted even if autobiographical (which I am unable to deduce for certain); what is written as of now is not biased or inappropriate, and I think it is only a fragment of what could be written about him. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItalo_6ec4.html" title="User:Italo">Italo</a> 23:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I find this an extremely valuable topic -- so much so that I just spent my whole day creating a well-linked wikified page based on Connie Barlow's version (including a whole page on Thomas Berry), only to come back and find that someone has created a stripped down version. While I think it has been stripped down a bit too much, it is probably a good holder for now. It is hard to find anything objectionable in it. It can be expanded to be more substantive and useful later, but it is best to start small, I say. I've been writing a lot on this subject lately and, as a blogger, I love to use Wikipedia to provide links to unusual concepts that are poorly summarized elsewhere on the web. So this is a fabulous resource for me. -- <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlindeagle_6565.html" title="User:Blindeagle">Blindeagle</a> cii at igc dot org</p>

   Modifications are a good idea for it to fit as a Wiki article, but overall,

<p>This is of great importance. For the first time there is a story that can be shared across religions, cultures, international boundaries based on recent scientific discovery. It should definitely be part of Wikipedia. Frances Lorenz (lorenzmf@AOL.com)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Keep but modify The topic is valuable, but even as rewritten by Connie it does not read as a factual/review sort of encyclopedia entry but as a pretty strong advocacy essay for the concept, and with expressions that come across as fairly pronounced hype. I think that might explain some of the discomfort reactions. It may also actually put off a signficant proportion of readers rather than pulling them in. Advocacy is fine on one's own site, but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia on which people can rely for neutral and objective information. I think the article should be rewritten to remove the advocacy and hype and to appear and indeed be more or less neutral. I know that's tough for someone deeply involved in the subject, but it might help to imagine oneself as an academic - just describing this concept and its development and versions (theist and non-theist) to their students as one approach out of many. If there have been any critiques of The Great Story approach, mentioning them would also help. Paul Harrison harrison at dircon dot co dot uk</p>
<p>Keep - While there might be a better way to Wikify it the consciousness expressed is far to important to not be in the Wikipedia. Over time, that clean up will take place.</p>

KEEP The subject matter is critically important to the level of Copernicus, Davinci, Newton and Einstein as to how and why phyical science discoveries have a direct effect on the social aspect of humans and earth itself.</p>

<p>Keep The Great Story is the story of the human relationship to the Earth and the universe through time. Telling the Great Story entails tracing life back to its roots and highlighting the many miraculous occurrences along the way that make it possible for us to be having this discussion.

<p>The above readers have misunderstood the importance of the Great Story entry. The Great Story is the story of a new cosmology for all the people of planet Earth. The Great STory is the first time in human history that all human beings have the same cosmology. It is also a story that heals the rift between science and relgion. The Great Story brings together into one narrative everything science has learned about our source in the twentieth century. For the first time we know all the molecules and atoms in our bodies were created in the explosion of a star. We were all "out there" at one time. So were all the other animals and plants on this Earth. We were out there in the forms of atoms and minerals. That means we are all intimately connected - all of us every plant and every animal. This is terribly important and perfect for Wikipedia.

<b>Keep.</b> The article is not OR (as noted by Sonic Mew above) nor is it a "recounting of one book (POV) or the editor's interepretation of that book (OR)." The editor(s) of the article, Michael Dowd and Connie Barlow, are both published authors and are well known for their leading role in explaining and disseminating information from many diverse sources the various and evolving contributions to the "Great Story." Barlow is a scientist and science writer (Evolution Extended (MIT Press), The Ghosts of Evolution (Basic Books), Green Space, Green Time (Copernicus), et al. Dowd is the author of Earth Spirit: A Handbook for Nurturing an Ecological Christianity and he has written many articles and presented "The Great Story" to many faith traditions. The Great Story has inspired many others: authors, scientists, artists, musicians (even a rap artist), educators (especially Montessori teachers), economists (David Korten, e.g.) children's books (Jennifer Morgan's Born with a Bang and From Lava to Life), and many others. Regarding Day/Night or Left Brain/Right Brain thinking, see Leonard Shlain's The Alphabet vs the Goddess: the Conflict between Word and Image; or more philosophically, see Gregory Bateson's Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind. Mainstream? Not yet. The Gaia Hypothesis, first proposed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, and first published by Stewart Brand in Whole Earth Review in 1975, remains controversial 30 years later but it has stimulated a whole new field of "earth systems" and inspired "deep ecology" and "ecofeminism." The Great Story is similarly a seminal idea that is challenging our past views of the relationship, or lack thereof, between science and religion. Debate about the Great Story is welcome, but for those who are skeptical, please consider learning more about it at www.thegreatstory.org. Chuck Lynd &lt;Lynd.7@osu.edu&gt;</p>
<p>I've already expressed my support of this topic in the discussion section, but for what it's worth I will vote for it again here. The Great Story metaphors are provocative and worthy of discussion groups in education, philosophy, and theology. I have followed the writing and speaking of Great Story proponents since 1997 and have been impressed at its adaptability to the theological frameworks of religiously progressive congregations. John Brewer &lt;jbrewer@sunflower.com&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>This has certainly attracted a lot of anons. The trouble is that the article does not make it clear what "The Great Story" actually is. thegreatstory.org did make it slightly clearer to me, but the article stil does not do enough for those unfamiliar with the subject.

<p>It doesn't seem to be within Wiki policy to delete something simply because you don't understand it. ...or because it may appear to challenge your religous belief. Wiki policy states:</p>
<p>You don't have to vote on every nomination; consider not participating if:</p>
<pre>
   * a nomination involves a topic of which you are ignorant.
</pre>
<p>Presumably, that would mean that recommending a page for deletion would be included in the above policy.</p>
<p>In other words, I might suggest that Pokemon pages, for example, be deleted because I can not comprehend the appeal and find no value to humanity for them. Those pages seem like commercial advertising rather than an encyclopaedic entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>But it is the fact that this article cannot be comprehended in its present form that makes it deleteable. This is not about comprehending the appeal of "The Great Story".

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. &lt; Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</p>
<p>I vote Keep but to have it put into Wiki style, whatever that is. This is a powerful story and movement providing an inspiring integrative view of the universe, planet, human informing both science and religion globally.</p>
<p>I also vote for Wiki to develop a more intuitive easy human interface for keeping,voting, posting etc to promote this interesting concept. See Craigslist for better ideas on how to do this. Also CD Baby has gotten this concept down pretty well. 8/05 Alan Tower [edit]</p>
<p>KEEP Having read so many, many books that reference the beautiful combining of science and mysticism,and the need for a living cosmology; it is hard to believe this concept would be unfamiliar. The Great Story transcends all religions but one source would be books by Christian theologian, Matthew Fox. In Fox's The Coming of the Cosmic Christ, p. 132 he speaks of mindfulness. "It opens their minds and hearts to the universe, to what is and to where we are: citizens of a vast twenty-billion-year history that is still unfinished and which we are called to complete; citizens of a universe of one hundred billion galaxies, of which ours is a mysteriously small one." 206.162.192.39 15:51, 1 August 2005 (UTC)Susan Heitzman</p>
<p>KEEP That folks are unfamiliar with the Great Story concept is precisely why it is so important to have an article like this in Wiki. I am a university professor who uses this idea (Great Story/Evolutionary Epic/Universe Story)as the fundamental framework for a 2-semester Introduction to Natural Science course that integrates physics, chemistry, earth science, astronomy, cosmology, and biology. Given what science has taught us in the last century or so (and especially in recent decades) about the origin and evolution of the universe, Dobzhansky's famous statement that "nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution" must now be expanded to something like "nothing makes sense except in light of the Great Story". The idea that ALL of science fits together into a single seemless creation story is an extremely powerful one, with implications that we are just beginning to grasp. I don't really feel qualified to speak to how (or whether) to "Wikify" this article better, but please keep its essential ideas intact. Jim Lorman (lorman@edgewood.edu)</p>
<p>KEEP I feel it fulfills a necessary function, being the realization of a perceived need for a modern Creation Myth. It is neither Science nor Religion, per se, but points to an awareness that life includes elements of both. In our modern world, with 200 years of mechanistic reductonism in the Life Sciences and 100 years since we proved the basis for Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, we need a view to bridge the philosophical gaps in our worldview. Physics has shown that the mechanistic view is wrong, but people in the Life Sciences point to the success of reductionism, and take mechanism as a given. Mainstream Religion doesn't help us to deal with the issues like the origin of consciousness and the evolution of sentient life, and mainstream Science has few answers, which makes The Great Story a necessary pursuit for those who seek to have a satisfying account of our origins.

<p>KEEP I like Connie's re-write, but I had just completed subtantial edits to inform those new to the Great Story idea. It would be nice if someone could weave in some of my changes, as I don't want to start again from scratch. Either way, I still think the topic is essential.

<p>_________________________________</p>
<p>SUGGESTED REWRITE:</p>
<p>"The Great Story" is an umbrella term for a movement that is manifesting today in scientifically literate cultures whereby new cosmological understandings made possible by modern science are translated into story forms that can provide the same kind of foundation for leading meaningful lives, in service to larger communities, that have traditionally been provided by a people's "creation story." Thomas Berry (born 1915, USA), a Catholic priest, academician, and self-proclaimed "geologian," began in the 1970s urging western culture to integrate the new cosmology offered by modern science into its religious expressions, as a form of update needed not only for religious consistency with the world as we now know it but also for the role he envisioned it would play in evoking "ecospirituality," "Earth Literacy," and a sense of sacred relationship to the natural world that would in turn foster a mutually enhancing relationship between the human milieu and the rest of, what he calls, "the Earth Community."</p>
<p>"The Great Story," "the Story of the Universe", and "the Epic of Evolution" are all synonyms for artful renditions of the new cosmology made available through modern science. The Great Story is science rendered as meaningful, motivating, and sometimes metaphorical narrative. A foundational book in this movement is the 1992 "The Universe Story," coauthored by mathematical cosmologist Brian Swimme and cultural historian Thomas Berry. In 1980 Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" series, which aired on public television, expressed a celebratory understanding of the evolutionary story that was viewed by tens of millions of people. In a 1978 Pulitzer-Prize-winning book "On Human Nature," Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson signaled the importance of this endeavor of modern, factually based mythmaking by declaring, "The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have." Anthropologist and religious naturalist Loren Eiseley titled his first book of essays that celebrated evolution, "The Immense Journey" (1957). Around the same time, French Jesuit (and paleontologist) Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, presented the evolutionary story with a mystical and christological emphasis, in his posthumously published book “The Phenomenon of Man.” Aldo Leopold, a leader in the early conservation movement, wrote of the grand evolutionary saga as "the odyssey of evolution," in his 1948 "Sand County Almanac.” And in the early through mid 20th century, evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley wrote humanistic essays and books attesting to the power of regarding this "epic of evolution" as a form of "Religion Without Revelation."</p>
<p>"The Great Story" thus refers to any telling of a cosmic creation story grounded in the modern, mainstream sciences. Peoples throughout the world have, of course, developed cosmologies — that is, understandings of how land, water, sky, plants and animals, humans, the sun and moon and stars all came into being, what purpose each of these elements serves in the whole, and how the human is to live "in accord" (quoting mythologist Joseph Campbell) with all of reality, known and unknown. Traditional ways of transmitting these varied cosmological and ethical understandings have included creation stories, parables, epic poems, songs, dances and other manifestations of the human capacity to convey sequences of events and express relationships in meaningful ways in order to provide the fundamental context for living one's life. For peoples throughout the world who are still primarily embedded in oral traditions, these understandings and teachings are so deeply interwoven into their cultures and psyches that anthropologists refer to the amalgams as "lifeways." For cultures in which symbolic language has been translated into writing, and in which written documents are regarded as the primary (even divine and inerrant) sources for maintaining and passing on cosmological and ethical wisdom, these understandings and expressions are what is referred to by the term "religion."</p>
<p>The new cosmology that undergirds various tellings of "The Great Story" is mainstream science — that is, reality as understood by the collective scientific community that publishes in the leading scientific journals and which is taught in science courses at leading institutions of higher learning throughout the world. Because mainstream science is grounded in an evolutionary understanding of cosmos, Earth, life, and culture, "The Great Story" manifests as creation stories and parables that celebrate an evolutionary understanding of reality: galactic evolution, stellar evolution, planetary evolution, biological evolution, cultural evolution.</p>
<p>The galaxies, stars, planets, and known and possible life forms are all presented by mainstream science to have developed through time by natural processes that can be studied and tested using scientific means. For example, it is possible today to view how galaxies looked in the past simply by using our space telescopes to image galaxies billions of light-years away, which is also, necessarily, billions of light-YEARS distant in time. It is possible to observe the spectra of light radiated from stars and re-emitted by ionized atoms in their surroundings to identify matter existing vast distances outside our own star system. Scientists also employ chemical and thermodynamic calculations to understand how stars today, as well as stars of the past, are forming all the atoms of the Periodic Table of Elements heavier than helium, through processes of "stellar nucleosynthesis." Although scientists cannot similarly witness past biological beings living their lives in real time, they do examine fossils, record the position of such fossils in radiometrically dated geological strata, and study genetic relatedness of living life forms in order to piece together well-supported understandings of how Earth life has evolved. Similarly, the various sciences of physical and cultural anthropology, archeology, linguistics, cultural history, evolutionary psychology, and others allow a vast community of trained experts around the globe, and of all ethnicities and religious faiths, to piece together stories of how the human psyche and human cultures have changed through time.</p>
<p>Scientific understanding of this evolving universe is now so vast, and the scientific disciplines and expertise so fragmented, however, that nonscientists may regard this edifice of knowledge as beyond understanding. Modern peoples may well embrace the applied fruits of the scientific enterprise (traveling in jets and ingesting modern medicines), but many still fail to grasp the cosmological significance of the scientific enterprise, consciously or unconsciously holding instead to pre-modern, non-evolutionary cosmologies. Or, they may be living their lives and teaching their young wisdom and values in fragments, outside the context of any integrated creation story -- that is, outside of a self-consistent and meaningful account of how things are, how they came to be, and what is important.</p>
<p>Thomas Berry has proposed that modern cosmology meaningfully presented should not be regarded as yet another competing religion. Rather, the new cosmology fosters a "metareligious" understanding that will ultimately be expressed in a wide variety of ways in and through each of the established religions and secular worldviews. There are many published (or internet accessible) writings of Christians, Hindus, Taoists, Buddhists, Unitarian Universalists, religious naturalists, pagans, and others who express how this new cosmology can not only reconcile with their spiritual tradition but how it positively enhances it. Some have incorporated this new understanding into established holy days and rituals; some have created entirely new spiritual expressions -- e.g. "The Cosmic Walk," "The Cosmic Communion," and "Great Story Beads,” also known as "cosmic rosaries.” (All of these terms can easily be googled.) Multi-media (DVD) expressions of it are also available, notably titles that feature the work of physicist Brian Swimme, Dominican Sister Miriam Therese MacGillis, evolutionary evangelist Rev. Michael Dowd, and science writer and Unitarian Universalist Connie Barlow. Short multi-media programs are also posted on the internet.</p>
<p>There are secular and religious educational curricula available (for adults and for children) in book or web-based forms. (The website www.TheGreatStory.org is a central node for accessing web forms of these materials.) Curricula accessible through the internet include "evolutionary parables," as well as course outlines and graphics for helping children locate "Birthday Stars" and for learning that "We Are Made of Stardust." "Our Continental Story" provides playful curricula and participatory processes for both adults and kids to learn the 65 million year (post-dinosaur) story of the comings and goings of mammals in North America. "Death through Deep-Time Eyes" examines how a dozen scientific disciplines present a new "creation story" that depicts physical death (of stars and continents as well as life forms) as not only natural but essential for evolutionary development.</p>
<p>The most popular children's books in The Great Story movement are those of Jennifer Morgan and Dana Llyn Andersen: "Born with a Bang" and "From Lava to Life." "The Kids Book of Awesome Stuff," by Charlene Brotman is a popular children's book in workbook form.</p>
<p>Global Education Associates Upper Midwest had published a reader, “Amazing Universe,” that offers text and guidelines for a 6-segment self-guided or group discussion course on The Great Story.</p>
<p>In summary, The Great Story embraces and includes all other stories. It is the science-based epic of evolution that can be told in ways that validate and uplift traditional religious stories by revealing the magnitude of their central truths – truths that have fostered cultural persistence over hundreds and thousands of years. The Great Story not only provides a faithful interpretation of the past; it allows for a deepening understanding of the past, as our awareness and knowledge grow. It is thus “A Story of the Changing Story.” Various tellings of The Great Story also may offer meaningful and empowering ways of understanding the challenges of the present and for entering the future energized by realistically hopeful and inspiring visions.</p>

<li>Keep I think the rewrite addresses most of the above issues. As I understand it, "The Great Story" is a way of developing a worldview from the story of evolution. This worldview seems comprehensive and inclusive and flexible in a way that honors past and present scientific and religious thinking and looks forward to what may be next.

<li><b>COMMENT</b>. Sheesh, that anons have totally destroyed this VfD page. Anyhow, I rewrote the whole fricking thing. I removed all the POV, killed about 90% of the entry because it didn't explain what "The Great STory" was, and I somewhat wikified. The way it was before was pure propaganda. Anyway, vote away! Perhaps we can bring this back for a <b>revote</b>.<a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">Mmmbeer</a> 21:42, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Nice work. It's looking better already! If we do bring this to a revote, I suggest limiting the amount of voters, (the usual so-many-edits rule,) so that we can do this properly! <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonic_Mew_47a9.html" title="User talk:Sonic Mew">talk to me</a> 18:31, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>KEEP Connie Barlow's new version addresses the issues raised above. elisabet@sahtouris.com</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Mmmbeer's version. The long versions are not encyclopedic -- verbosity is a vice, not a virtue, in an encyclopedia. There is a legitimate kernel of an article in explaining what the term means and putting it into proper context. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:34, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, my vote is delete if the anons keep changing this to some sort of forum for proselytizing this belief system. <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">Mmmbeer</a> 00:38, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>KEEP This topic is important, but I would eliminate Mmmbeers version as it's too uninformative to provide any meaningful insight into the subject, or even a worthwhile definition of what "The Great Story" is and what purpose it attempts to fulfill. Admittedly, some of what appeared in earlier entries was 'fluff,' but a reader should come away with a clear understanding of the basic ideas behind "The Great Story". I think Connie Barlow's re-write does that fairly well. Mmmbeer's severely edited form makes the entry almost meaningless. Jonathan Dickau --67.87.247.33 03:49, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>KEEP New version with edits as of this time serves the public well to inform about TGS, but is sufficiently brief, encyclopedic, and informative. It suffers from little or no 'fluff' and tells readers what they need to know, to learn more if desired. Jonathan Dickau - jond4u@optonline.net --67.87.247.33 15:25, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It may have very little notoriety within the world of finance at large, but it is extremely relevant on the West Coast of the US. I meant this line in the context of a nationwide or worldwide scale. It isn't a nationwide lender, such as Ameriquest or Ditech.com, but it is an important regional phenonmenon. A subject does not need to have world-wide, or even nationwide significance to be a Wikipedia article. I am a newer user to editing Wikipedia, and I do not appreciate having my articles flagged while I'm still editing them! I personally feel that your comment should have been relegated to the talk page and allowed for discussion first, not summarily VFD'ed. Doc, you have a very good point. This is a company with thousands of people, so I will be removing the line from the article, and I realize my choice of words were poor for the last few lines, and might be construed as not being NPOV. Consider this my "vote" to have the article stay in its current form. --Markarian</li>

<li>I am the original author of this article. The initial text, which I wrote, consisted only of the first paragraph. I had nothing to do with the latter paragraph, which was added immediately after I created the article. What I wrote is entirely genuine. I would like to point out that I have no direct association with the subject matter of the article. This is not an advertisement; I have no vested interest here. It was my intention simply to create an entry relating to my part of the world (Wikipedia articles relating to the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_midlands.html" title="Irish midlands">Irish midlands</a> are sparse and tend to be somewhat lacking). I apologize for any transgressions of Wikipedia custom: I am new here.

<li>I wish to clarify that I do not dispute that the second paragraph is a hoax. In fact, I am positive that it <i>is</i> a hoax. But I maintain that the first paragraph is not worthy of deletion. I do not see the argument for deleting the entire article, as I do not see why there should be any incredulity regarding the existence of a local boxing club in a town in Ireland! The absence of many references to it on the internet (if, indeed, there are any at all - I haven't checked) simply reflects the fact that Ireland is not yet quite so web-savvy that a small organization, such as the one in question, might have a website of its own. I point out again that I have no association with this Boxing Club. They have no knowledge of, or association with, this article. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocument_Number_Two_b4f8.html" title="User:Document Number Two">Document Number Two</a> 23:57, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There seems to be a group expanding stub articles on transpmission masts.

They all should be in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> and if notable on their own have an article.

<p>When discussing the actual history and hits that the animation has received <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_she_is%21%21.html" title="There she is!!">There she is!!</a> offers actual numbers and awards while <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_She_Is_d384.html" title="There She Is">There She Is</a> simply says it's popular.
