<p>Personal project of an SAP consultant named <a href="http://www.davytech.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.davytech.com/" rel="nofollow">David Jacob</a>, a project whose entire existence seems to be a <a href="http://www.davytech.com/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://www.davytech.com/wiki/" rel="nofollow">wiki here</a> and a <a href="http://european.language.free.fr/" class="external text" title="http://european.language.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">web page here</a>. It appears to fit "Problems that may require deletion" in a couple of ways:</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Advertising/announcement and original research. I was almost interested in the title, though, as there <i>is</i> something unusual about the phonology of English in Europe (excluding the UK). The continental vowel schemes result in a broadened and deepened pronunciation that ought to be studied, as it appears that it is becoming standardized, but then that study needs to be summarized here and not conducted here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:18, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Looks to me like this is a legitimate project. I found a professor writing on the implications of European English for the EU and Europe in general<a href="http://www.retestresa.it/europa/europa/tecins/documenti/Language%20use%20and%20communication%20(paper).doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.retestresa.it/europa/europa/tecins/documenti/Language%20use%20and%20communication%20(paper).doc" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and a google search for "European English" and EU returns just over 2,000 results.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> I don't know how legitimate the project is (even if it is, it doesn't fulfill the criteria to be a wiki article), but the author is trying to use wikipedia to promote his research.

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: European English DOES already exists de facto. In a meeting in Paris, with French, Spanish, German and Italian speakers speaking English they will use some words and expressions that are not the same as in similar meeting in London, or New York with real native english speakers. For native English speakers is it only bad English, but for these European peersons it is European English. I admit that the European English PROJECT is pretty new, and has only little support for now compared to esperanto, but this is not an original research, this is a project to improve this existing European English. Meanwhile I understand your critics, I should not talk mainly about my project. European English should be define in Wikipedia as it is existing today. But do you mind if I mention my project to improve European English&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidjacobchemla_5427.html" title="User:Davidjacobchemla">davidjacobchemla</a> 27 may 2005</li>

<p>I've rewritten the article. I removed the original research and added three possible meanings of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_English_d130.html" title="European English">European English</a>.

It could be the start of a new section under <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> or a new article (English language in Europe&#160;?), but to call it <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_English_d130.html" title="European English">European English</a> implies it's on the same level as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> and the others, which it is not. 66.167.137.130 09:21, 31 May 2005 (UTC) (the one who submitted the original article to a vote).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is still OR. There is no European English, any more than there is one single "British English". There <i>may</i> be an American English--the language that is taught in classrooms in the United States--but it would be wrong to assume that such standardization applies meaningfully in other countries. It does not. English is too fluid a language to be pinned down. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:12, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a translator, I know perfectly well that there is such a thing as European English, although the article as it is now doesn't do it complete justice. What one has to understand is that English is used as lingua franca across a continent which shares a vast amount of legal, educational, technological etc. concepts, which differ from those in real English speaking countries. That's why there are a lot of English expressions used in Europe which aren't used in the UK or US (e.g. "external arrangement" for, roughly, "landscaping"). <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 11:25, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>neutral</b> it is much better now, but I dont know if it deserves an article. The EU style guide can be something that can be useful. But I dont think we should confuse the English used in Ireland and the UK (these people's native language and their main vehicle of expression), with the English used in mainland Europe (just a learning language). Maybe <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_English_d130.html" title="European English">European English</a> article would be just for UK/Ireland and English language in Europe for the use of English in the EU. But please include only factual information (use of data from the EU is a good source). probably, a conversation between a French with an Italian or a Spanish with a Portuguese, etc. will not be in English, but in a sort of a mixed romance language. Eastern Europeans speak Russian, it is their lingua franca. English seems very popular in Germanic and Scandinavian countries, there could be a section about that. It is not that popular in Latin countries, elder people dont like English, while younger people like it. In fact, the use of English/French/German in the EU is a declared weapon in Portugal for the supporters of the "no" in the EU constitution referendum, which the government and the president are keen to make, even after the French earthquake.-<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 11:47, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Nobbie should be commended for his/her work thus far, but there's still a very long ways to go.
