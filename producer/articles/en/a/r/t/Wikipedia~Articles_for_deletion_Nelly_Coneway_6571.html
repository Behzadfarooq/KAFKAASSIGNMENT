<p>The result of the debate was okay, this one's a very difficult case. First of all, I will be discounting the views of <i>everyone</i> who opined solely because it's a suspected autobiography. The nominator himself argued for deletion "regardless of questions of encyclopaedic merit", and that's just <i>not</i> the way we do things here. It's not appropriate to delete an article merely because of who you think the author is (caveats about banned-by-ArbCom sockpuppets notwithstanding), and there's equally no point in counting the opinions of those who said "keep because I don't like the nomination". Now, the remaining opinions hinge on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; there have been claims that she does and does not pass the notability guidelines. Does she count against "Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers"? Frankly, it's hard to tell, as evidenced by the split here. There is no clear case either way, so the final closing will have to go down as <b>no consensus</b>. Those who wish to hurl rotten tomatoes and uncouth epithets are reminded that I have a talkpage somewhere.

<li>Autobiography is difficult to prove and its discovery is not really the optimum role for editors. We are not detectives. Furthermore, the autobiography guidelines are not policy and do not mandate deletion or AfD (for evidence see our non-deleted article on the founder of this project).

<dd>I <i>have</i> reviewed all your comments on this page. It remains the fact that (1) the Sofia Echo article "about" her relegates mention to a trailing paragraph and does not actually support the claim to notability as a "popular" TV host,(2) the books are self-published with no evidence of significance or sales and (3) the subject scores around a dozen unique Google hits, half of which are adverts for her books. You have decided you want this article kept, which is your prerogative, but there is absolutely no indication that she passes <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which makes this a vanity autobiography, exactly as stated; the facts in this article originate with someone who says of herself that "Nelly Coneway is one of the most talanted and respected Bulgarian journalists in America". About half of what she posted has been removed as unverifiable puff. Of course none of those things individually necessarily make a subject non-notable - <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a> self-published his book and still has an article, not least because the book is cited as a primary source by many biographies of famous 17th and 18th Century scientists - but together they make a pretty strong case for genuine scepticism about the importance of this subject. And the union flags are there so I can find my comments in long interleaved discussions - but even if that were vanity it would be irrelevant as an argumentum ad hominem and because I have not created a Wikipedia article about myself. Your faith in the improtance of this person is touching, but in the absence of any verifiable evidence of importance, I think somewhat misplaced. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 14:34, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Don't see anything new in your comment so I can't change my opinion. Not even sure why you want to endlessly debate the same points. It's not that I have decided that "I want the article kept", it's because I believe that Ms. Coneway qualifies for inclusion and makes a nice addition to the encyclopedia. Also I think you should seriously reconsider this flag thing.

You are quite right to point out that "strongly discouraged" does not equal "totally forbidden" or "automatically deleted", but I think the guideline, if it means anything at all, must mean that there have to be unusually good reasons for allowing a self-created article to stand. I don't believe that in this instance there are unusually good reasons. This woman is not of sufficient stature as a journalist, author or "meeja" person to justify bending what is a very strong guideline. She comes in with no more than 57 Google hits, most of which are to self-promoting websites and duplicates. Ditto her publications, and her TV and journalistic ventures are significantly undistinguished. I just don't think her achievements are such as to merit bending what is quite a strong practice guideline.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 12:31, 1 February 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li>You are fully entitled to your interpretation, but try to maintain perspective. Guideline does not mean policy. This guideline mandates no action. It is a guideline for editing articles. Any article can be entirely rewritten. This is the case for many if not most of the offerings here. The "original sin" of an article's creation- in this case unproven I would point out- has no bearing. Lastly, I would assume that all guidelines are important to the people who care about them. When you repeatedly talk about a "<i>very strong guideline</i>" or "<i>quite a strong practice guideline</i>", I immediately wonder where I can find our "very weak" guidelines. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's the fact the book has no Amazon sales rank that should set off the alarm bells. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(readjust indents) Well, I am not saying she shd not be on the Bulgarian Wikipedia... But it seems from the Eng lang sites that she was not a major presenter, and does every TV presenter on every channel in the world automatically merit an article?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would hate to see a duff article scrape through simply because I have blurred the reasons for deletion (now I am turning to Ignore All Rules...). This article was definitely begun by the subject, as is clear from the caption ("Me taken by my son" or something similar) on the image of the subject that User:Nelly06 uploaded at the same time as placing the initial article (see user contributions, of which there are VERY few). That would normally count as Vanity and be off straight away. In which connection, the following is from <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>: "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them." That seems fairly clear to me.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This lady has, it is quite true, a far more verifiable public profile than most, but the other information regarding her achievements from elsewhere is difficut to evaluate and borderline; and I am still think that autobiographical article + borderline significance should = delete. IF someone else thinks she is important enough, let them start it off again. (This is pretty much what JzG is saying below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am concerned that, if this is allowed to stay, it makes a sort of back-door precedent for borderline "semi-notables" to create their own entries and then rely on the force of inertia to keep them, whereas surely the trend of thought so far has been in the other direction. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaffelde_d573.html" title="User:Staffelde">Staffelde</a> 17:57, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>And what of the fact that the actual claims to notability are unverified (TV) and false (books are self-published)?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of WP:AUTO is to discourage non-notable people from writing about themselves. From the page: <i>If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will create an article about you sooner or later.</i> So some people want to have it "sooner" rather than "later". What's the harm in that? If the article is verifiable and the person notable, we allow it to stay, regardless of who created it. So, is she notable? I'd say no, if not for the Bulgaria factor - she is likely notable in Bulgaria, so the cultural bias factor wins the article over for me. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 20:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's what she says about herself, sure. What to the reliable external sources say?

<li>The Sofia Echo article reads like the autobiographical entries. Perhaps submitted by the author herself. The Sofia Echo article refers to an award by GWB to the son. This is not notable. "Presidential" awards are routinely given to all levels of education - for example, the <a href="https://www.presidentschallenge.org/order_center/index.aspx" class="external text" title="https://www.presidentschallenge.org/order_center/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">President's Physical Fitness Award</a>. Students within all schools who achieve a certain level can receive these preprinted congratulations from the president; it is something that the schools can order. This may be the <a href="http://www.naesp.org/ContentLoad.do?contentId=1052" class="external text" title="http://www.naesp.org/ContentLoad.do?contentId=1052" rel="nofollow">President's Education Award Program</a>, which again can be ordered by schools.
