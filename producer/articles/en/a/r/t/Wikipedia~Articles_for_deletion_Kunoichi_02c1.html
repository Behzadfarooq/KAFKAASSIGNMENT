<li><b>Comment Response</b> The lack of citation is certainly disturbing, especially when the article seems to miss Chiyome Mochizuki entirely, who appears to be the basis of the Kunoichi mythology.

<dd>I don't know all the past precidents, and I'm not trying to be dense... I think that my main point is that we're talking about something that, in essence, does not exist -- who gets to decide what Kunoichi is? How can we write a verifiable article on a concept that can't be measured, can't be tested, can't be verified? Some may say <i>by incorporating only third party sources</i> -- in essence, incorporating what others say about Kunoichi. I just think that this is an unverifiable article about a ficticious idea of questionable notability. Your point regarding other fiction that obviously warrants an encyclopaedic entry (such as <i>vampires</i>) is taken, but in this instance I don't believe that is the case. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 01:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. There is a common theme to how Konoichi are portrayed, just as there are common themes to portrayals of Santa or vampires. As has been said, there is a lot missing and a bit of cruftiness, but those things can be worked out. The article as it stands sucks, but I believe the topic deserves an article. Worst case scenario, if when all is said and done there's not much left , it can be merged into "<a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">ninja</a>". --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 05:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question</b>, how do you say the naming for <b>female ninja</b> cannot be measured, tested, nor verified? There are people using it, at the very least it is a popular culture issue in Japan. I don't care if the article was kept or not (of course I am going to vote for a <b>keep</b>), but I do not want to see somebody's thinks that the term is not verifiable just because they have not heard it before. BTW, this word is found in two Japanese to Chinese <b>dictionary</b> and at least two Japanese dictionary where the meaning is literally <b>Female Ninja</b>. People have written in books saying why it is called that way, there are no exact final answer, but so do many science topics. The conclusion of actual reason for having this term is unknown, and thus the article should say that exactly, which does not mean it is not verifiable, but <i>verified to be unknown</i> by secondary sources. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 03:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm finding all these rebuttals in the name of "notability" hilarious. The subject may or may not be notable; that's irrelevant. The article is <i>original research</i> that is not based on <i>reliable sources</i> of information. It nothing but a collection of role-playing fantasies with no basis in fact and with no place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 15:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> The No OR argument would work only if the individual who created this article coined or developed the meaning of the term beyond verifiable sources. In other words, the purpose of the OR policy is primarily for sources and arguments, not topics (e.g., Kunoichi as a factual occupation might be OR, and a poll taken by the editor indicating what percentage of individuals believe they are real would definitely be OR). I certainly agree that better verification is necessary here, but the <i>topic</i> in this case is not OR, and should be kept. By the way, there are lots of entries in wikipedia involving "a collection of role-playing fantasies with no basis in fact," so if you think the article needs to be <i>rewritten</i> to reflect that this is the primary focus, fine. Otherwise, I really don't see how your point stands up. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 17:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Firm Keep</b> After reading the article, I'm seeing a lot of statements which could be sourced. The lack of inclusion regarding the origins of the term is a little strange, but that's a job for cleanup. While the <i>"Derivation of the word Kunoichi"</i> section looks to be OR, the <i>"History"</i> section is quite well written. I can see the article is being cleaned up even as this AfD takes place and see no reason for deletion at this time. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 16:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for obvious reasons. The article needs help, but deleting is not the answer. At worst it should redirect to <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">Ninja</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
