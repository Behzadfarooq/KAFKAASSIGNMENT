Theagenes of Rhegium</p>
<p>Theagenes of Rhegium, contemporary to Homer and Hesiod, in the 6th century BC (flourished around 525 BC), began what would become a leading attitude in the Western tradition by finding a codified, allegorical way of interpreting myths and understanding them as expressions of natural forces. Epic poems described the battling between dual elemental forces under the guise of gods and their stories. Fire was represented by Apollo, Helios and Hephaestus, water by Poseidon and Scamander, air by Hera, and also with abstract qualities – wisdom with Athene, desire with Aphrodite, reason with Hermes and folly, no less, with Ares. This equally mythical character represents a critical moment in the development of human perception.</p>
<p>No writing of his own remains, nor any fragments of his words.</p>
<p><br />
basically, from; Freeman, Kathleen, The Pre-Socratic Philosophers, Oxford 1946.</p>

<p>The Okaloosa Darter (scientific name: Etheostoma okaloosae) is a fish indigeonous to fresh-water streams and tributary systems in Okaloosa and walton counties in Northwest Florida. It is a small and elongated fish, less than 50 millimeters in length. Although the species specific population is currently unknown (estimated between 1,5OO to 1O,OOO), it is thought to be an endangered fish, with numbers genrally decreasing.</p>

<p><b>Booking Bangalore Hotels through the Internet</b></p>
<p>If you are looking for hotels in Bangalore then the best way to find the right one is to use the internet. It not only bypasses the travel agent which reduces the costs but it also increases the choices available. The internet has shortened distances and reduced time taken in obtaining information from anywhere in the world. Even from the remotest corner of the world with the use of internet you can be able to book any hotel in Bangalore. There is undoubtedly a good mix of hotels which are provided through the web with the option of making bookings online or even off-line. With on-line bookings the hotels have room allocation whereby you get instant confirmation from the website without any manual intervention. Off-line bookings are where the hotels do not have rooms allocated but the requirements can be forwarded by users through the website to customer service who confirm with the hotels directly and process the reservations.</p>
<p>The internet option of promoting hotel bookings has increased tremendously and some of the main advantages are listed below.</p>
<p>1. With a vast sea of information connecting various suppliers in this case hotels, one has the option of locating the exact type of hotel whether its for business or leisure travel. The internet offers various options catering to all the different type of customers coming from diverse backgrounds, there will be something to suit any individual preferences.</p>
<p>2. By reducing the distribution costs, hotels are able to pass some of the benefit through the discounted rates offered on the internet. Generally rates offered through the internet are much lower than those offered by hotels directly. With the advanced use of technology in Bangalore, hotels are also able to manage their inventory through specialized software which reduces their operating costs and this benefit is passed on to those who make bookings through the web.</p>
<p>3. Ease of use through the internet is one key feature which has promoted the growth of internet use all across the world. Its very convenient to use, just select the period you want to stay in Bangalore, select number of people and number of rooms and that's enough to give you all the various options. If there are too many options available the search can be further narrowed down by selecting your budget or even location where you would like to stay. All this can be done from the comfort of your home or office within a matter of minutes with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>4. The service of using the internet to make reservations for Bangalore hotels is absolutely free and in most cases the hotel can be paid once you have finished your stay. You need not worry about making cash transfers or other payments before you check-in but you can use your credit card just to guarantee the bookings and pay the hotel when you check-out.</p>
<p>Booking Bangalore hotels has never been so easy through the internet. For best deals, with great selection and ease of use there is not better way to book hotels online through the web. The one website which I have found to provide all these benefits is <a href="http://www.justbookit.com" class="external text" title="http://www.justbookit.com" rel="nofollow">Bangalore Hotel Directory</a></p>

<p>English rock/acid jazz group which began life in 1991 as a studio project for Acid Jazz Records, Mother Earth has a sound that is somewhere between the Small Faces and Santana but with a jazz/funk sensibility. Consisting of the core group of Matt Deighton (Guitar and vocals), Neil Corcoran (bass), Bryn Barklam (Hammond organ) and Chris White (drums), they have also included in their lineup Shauna Greene (vocals), Bunny, Xan (vocals), Jose Hadaway (drums), Kym Marsh (vocals), D.C Lee (vocals) and Meryl Kenton Forbes (vocals).</p>
<p>Their contemporaries in the UK scene are The Brand New Heavies, Corduroy, Skunkhour, Galliano, Incognito, James Taylor Quartet and Jamiroquai. They are arguably the best British band of the 1990’s to have never “made it”, however they built great support by their powerful live shows and impressive studio albums but were never able to translate this into massive record sales. After having parted ways in the late ‘90’s Mother Earth reformed for some one-off gigs in 2001 and 2004 and in 2005 were rumored to be working on a new album.</p>

<p>Austin Nagel, Born September 1982 in Wyoming, USA. Austin graduated from high school at the early age of 16 after attending eight different schools. He quickly left his family to move to France to pursue his studies at the age of 17. At 19 he spent the summer in New York working as a waiter at the restaurant Pastis, where he was quickly fired for not being able to memorize the menu properly, despite his good service reviews. He sites this as being one of the best things that happened to him. Uninterested in returning to his business studies in Paris, France he spoke to a friend about starting a real estate investment company. The friend lent him 365,000 to buy and renovate his first apartment which he would flip months later for 605,000. He quickly bought other properties and now does business under ASRN Development which had 12 Million in assets 2 years after is creation.</p>
<p>During a trip to D.C. he tumbled upon another real estate deal, which he quickly purchased and renovated in February of 2006. Unwilling to wait for furniture, and disappointed with the availability lead times for medium to high end furniture he decided to open Natrona Furniture LLC which opened its doors in September 2006, boasting 6000 sq ft of in stock and ready for immediate delivery medium to high end furniture in New York, where he currently resides.</p>
<p>During this same period he realized the need for a women's shoe boutique in where he has his real estate investments, so he created Burke Talon, an upscale women's boutique located in the heart of Cobble Hill, NY.</p>
<p>He now does business under his company Nagel Holdings, LLC of which he has 100% ownership.</p>
<p>Single parent at 23.</p>

<p>By Trudy Whitman This is a rags to real estate to retail story. Once upon a time a young man named Austin Nagel left his home in Wyoming to move to France to study business. The next stop on a peripatetic journey brought him to New York City, where he was hired as a waiter at the uber-trendy Pastis, a French-inspired bistro in the Meatpacking District. Customers loved the energetic server, but he was sacked anyway because he couldn’t memorize the menu to the satisfaction of the management.</p>
<p>Nagel thought about returning to Paris to continue his studies but decided, instead, to ask a friend to partner up in a real estate investment company. The generous friend agreed and loaned the newly hatched developer the funds to buy and renovate his first apartment. This he did in Brooklyn, and — being at the right place at the right time — flipped the property months later for twice the cost of the investment. Nagel quickly gobbled up other properties and continues his work as the principal of ASRN Development.</p>
<p>What does one do with apartments? Furnish them, of course. A true entrepreneur, Nagel noticed how disappointed the people who moved into his apartments were with the delivery lags that go hand in hand with the purchase of medium- to high-end furniture. Thus was born Natrona Furniture — named after the Wyoming county in which Nagel was raised. The furniture showroom at 145 West 20th Street in Chelsea opened in September, featuring sleek, modern designs. And, with a warehouse in Westchester, the goods are in stock and ready for immediate delivery.</p>
<p>Searching for more vacuums and niches to fill, Austin Nagel zeroed in on a Brooklyn friend’s complaints about there being very little fashionable footwear available in BoCoCa where she lives and works. Area moms, she told him, are either at home with children and find it inconvenient to travel to Manhattan to shop, or they are working moms who want to get home to their kids and would rather shop in their own neighborhood. Enter Burke Talon, an eye-catching shoe and accessory shop that opened last month on Amity Street. (Burke is Nagel’s baby daughter’s name; talon is French for heel.) Aubin Bryan, who lives in Carroll Gardens, runs the shop and is its buyer. She says that Nagel guessed right again; the neighborhood response to Burke Talon has been so terrific that it has been difficult to keep the shop stocked. The goods are global, coming from Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as from designers in New York and Los Angeles. Shoes and boots range in price from $120 to $400 or $500, Bryan notes, depending on the season. Featured labels include Bernardo, Hollywould, Bettye Muller, Frye boots, l’Autre Chose, and Charlotte Ronson. There are also elegant bags, hand-made scarves, and a case full of look-at-me jewelry.</p>
<p>As might be expected, Austin Nagel intends to expand. He envisions his shoe stores in other residential neighborhoods and believes his furniture shops would be a good fit in second-home locales across the country. He adds that being fired from Pastis was the best thing that ever happened to him. Burke Talon, 192 Amity Street (just off Court); 212 812-3994.</p>

In that position, he wrote and negotiated four of the key bilateral documents defining the Central Asian states’ enhanced relationship with the United States. After September 11, 2001, he initiated regular U.S.-Russia consultations in response to the mandate by Presidents Bush and Putin that the two governments work together to increase their collaboration and transparency in Central Asia and the Caucasus.

Subsequently, because of his Afghanistan expertise, he was U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for Afghanistan (1991-1992). During the course of his career, he has received three State Department Honor Awards (one Meritorious, two Superior), as well as several group honor awards and Presidential Performance Awards.</p>

His time at terrace has presented Iain with many achievements, such as being named in the Australian Schoolboys team for Rugby.

<p>If you are a fan of Iain's then I recommend watching the EPL dreamteam league where Iain (stormtroopers) takes on S**** in this weeks fixtures. Recent betting reveals that Iain is set to win with a bid of 0.55c to S**** coming in at $110.75. Should be a one sided match.</p>

A Process Nazi is a critical term often applied to those involved in Quality Assurance, or similar governance roles, within large organisations.</p>
<p><br />
Typically, this refers to a person who's imposes arbritrary, difficult and often pointless conditions upon processes, often to the detriment of the process's actual aims.</p>
<p><br />
Often the imposition of these conditions is a result either of that person gaining undue personal satisfaction through their authority to do so, or their uninformed or dogmatic view that the impositions add significant value - regardless of clear and obvious evidence that they either do not, or are in reality hugely counter-productive.</p>
<p><br />
This can be seen within the implementation of many project management methodologies - often within computing and / or engineering functions in particular - whereby the process of adhering to the methodology becomes more important than delivering the project itself.</p>
<p><br />
In these instances, the Process Nazi would the person or person(s) responsible for imposing this destructive following of the methodology upon the project beyond all reason, despite clear indications and warnings from others that this is, in fact, contributing to it's failure.</p>

<p>"Flying Harder" The History of 618VGS The Beginning In 1942 when Air Cadet Gliding was formally established, one of the first schools formed was No.141 Gliding School at RAF Kidbrooke in South London. On 1st December 1945, it moved to Gravesend, from where in June 1946 it went to RAF Detling on the North Downs and then to RAF West Malling for the period between September 1949 and September 1950. Following a short stay, it returned to Detling when it disbanded and later merged into 146GS and 168 GS. In 1956, this unit became 615 GS at RAF Kenley, which remains in operation today.</p>
<p>Back to Top</p>
<p><br />
Manston In 1962, No 677 Gliding School in Northern Ireland was closed for security reasons and the school equipment was used to form a new school, No 618 at RAF Manston in Kent. It was staffed by some ex—instructors of the old No 166 Gliding School, which disbanded in December 1955 at Hawkinge, Kent. Commanded by Flight Lieutenant J C “Jimmy” Farrell (later to become Wing Commander and OC of Kent Wing ATC), No 618 GS launched its first glider on the 24 March 1963. He was the former OC of 166 Gliding School. The first year was devoted to the training of staff and winch drivers on the fleet of a Sedbergh, two Kirby Cadet 3's, three Land Rovers and two “Eagle” twin drum winches.</p>
<p>On 22 March 1964, Cadet Martin became the first student on a course to solo with 618. More students were sent on their first solos during that year and the first summer course was run, in which 16 cadets soloed in a week.</p>
<p>West Malling Gliders first flew above West Malling between 1930 and 1933 when Mr. "Jimmy” C.H. Lowe-Wild designed and built his own primary gliders. He operated some from the local airfield at West Malling, which at that time was called Maidstone Airport. In 1930 the Kent Gliding Club formed. After World War II, it moved around various airfields in Kent, including a spell at West Malling, before finding their permanent site at Challock.</p>
<p>Following the U.S. Naval Facility withdrawal from RAF West Malling in late 1963, the airfield was placed on a care and maintenance status. 618 moved from Manston into West Malling in March 1965 and made its headquarters in the old dispersal spider complex near the threshold of runway 07. Its aircraft and equipment were stored into one of the large T4 Hangars where they remained until 1992.</p>
<p>1964 saw the arrival of the Short Brothers servicing section from Rochester. They had the contract for servicing RAF Chipmunk and other aircraft. The Gliding School had a very good relationship and worked side by side with Shorts as they had very few movements to hinder 618's operations. In 1968, they lost the service contract and un-powered aircraft exclusively used West Malling for some years.</p>
<p>In 1967, the fleet was increased to five Cadet Mk III’s and two Sedberghs, establishing 618 as a “three-line” school. In 1969 Squadron Leader Gerry Fuller became the "Boss”. During his eight years as OC, 618 lived up to its new motto of "We Fly Harder" in every way. Staff progress was rapid and many cadets flew at weekends, on "field days" and during six weeks of continuous courses. These courses had 22 students in two intakes and most learnt to fly solo in the week. When the Royal Air Force finally gave up use of West Malling in 1970, Kent County Council (KCC) bought it for only £475,000 to protect it from "undesirable development".</p>
<p>Expansion Around two hundred cadets a year went solo on the "Mark III” during this era. On average, the School flew 12000 launches a year. In 1977, Squadron Leader Ben Newman took command of 618. His previous post was OC 623 GS at RAF Tangmere, which had disbanded when the RAF station closed. In 1979, 618 went up in strength again to Seven Cadet MkIII’s and three Sedbergh, with three twin drum winches and five Land-Rovers.</p>
<p>Detachments The school made many annual detachments to the Air Cadet Soaring site at Halesland near Cheddar. Staff attending the courses were able to fly over the picturesque Mendip hills and the 618 songbook is full of ballads made up in the pubs of Somerset. The usual detachment was for one week per year and included 10 instructors and flight staff cadets. The aim was to improve the skills of the instructors at a site away from base. Halesland was the on the ridge and some soaring and cross county flying was possible. Back in Kent, at RAF Biggin Hill during the Battle of Britain Air displays each September, 618 detached a Sedbergh towed by a Chipmunk Tug from No.1 AEF at Manston. The Sedbergh performed an aerobatic display to please the crowds.</p>
<p>The glass fibre era In late 1982, 618VGS was chosen by HQAC to become the first school to re-equip with the new glass fibre sailplanes. The SCHLEICHER ASK 21 VANGUARD T1 was selected and 10 initial airframes were delivered. During June 1983, instructors underwent conversion training at the Air Cadet Central Gliding School (ACCGS) at RAF Syerston. Each instructor received a weeks training at ACCGS. The first three Vanguards arrived at West Malling on 18th. June when final familiarisation on site took, place. In September 1983, the last "Mark 3" flew at West Malling before being sold off. On 4th August 1983 Cadet Hazell became the first Air Cadet to be taught all through on the Vanguard, and went solo after only 29 launches.</p>
<p>From mid 1983 618 had to share the airfield once again when an aircraft completion company METAIR Ltd, later part of Hunting PLC, moved in. By November 1985, 618 increased its Vanguards to eight and became the sole user of this type. Sqn Ldr Newman was awarded the MBE for services to Air Cadet Gliding in 1982. He led the school through the first years of the GRP era and this culminated, in 1998, to the award of the Sir Arthur Marshall Trophy for the best Winch launched gliding School. Ben retired at the end of March 1988 to be succeeded by Squadron Leader Ian Aitken, who moved up from the post of Chief Flying Instructor which he held from 1984.</p>
<p>Vikings arrive To ensure standardisation throughout the fleet, 618 lost their Vanguards in February 1988 when the first of eight VIKINGS arrived at West Malling. Around this time, the property development of the large airfield site began to turn the Airfield into a business park. The first sign was building in the North of the field, which lost 618 its Grass N/S runway. To try to find an alternative site for 618, Squadron Leader Ben Newman and his team had begun a search for other greenfield sites in Kent. They were successful in finding a very large area at Grange Farm, on the North Downs near Boxley Village. This site was across the road from the old RAF gliding home of Detling. Squadron Leader Ian Aitken, with help from Headquarters Air Cadets, managed to put a convincing case for the conversion of this field from crops to a grass gliding area complete with individual storage for each Viking and conversion of some listed farm cottages to provide a headquarters and accommodation.</p>
<p>The Local Parish council was very supporting but Kent County council planning officials were distinctly hostile to the plans. Despite this, the problem of finding sufficient funding by the RAF put paid to these innovative plans.</p>
<p>The popular detachments to Halesland had ceased when the GRP fleet had entered service and Headquarters Air Cadets (HQAC) decided to find an alternative for instructor and advanced student to improve their skills.</p>
<p>The location chosen was Portmoak Airfield in Fife. The ridge and wave lift available made it a very suitable location for advanced training. Ever eager to be at the forefront, in 1992, 618VGS provided the staff and students for the very first course run by a VGS training advanced cadets on this site.</p>
<p>By that year the building had increased to such an extent that Metair were persuaded to move to Biggin Hill. They left the large hangar and the control tower vacant and when the 618HQ was demolished in December 1992 the school moved into the Tower and put the aircraft and equipment into the large Hangar. Sadly, it was relatively short lived as 618 were given notice to leave West Malling by the end of September 1994.</p>
<p>The last Continuous course took place in August 1994. During that week, 10 cadets went solo. On the last Day of the course a reunion cricket match was held on the Airfield. with a pitch mowed especially for the purpose. The match consisted of the old boys playing the current Instructors. As usual, the Old Boys won. This was followed by a party and barbeque. All the Commanding officers of the School since its inception were present.</p>
<p>The last flight of a service aircraft took place on September 25th 1994 with Flt Lt Allan Melmore and Flight Staff Cadet John Wotton making a short circuit of the airfield in ZE558.</p>
<p>Quite fittingly, the last glider launch took place three days later when the privately owned Slingsby Cadet MKIII was flown by the former supply officer, Flt Lt (retired) Derek Smith and his wife Joan. From 618’s formation, until it left West Malling over 3000 cadets flew their first glider solo and gained their wings with 618VGS.</p>
<p>Back to Top</p>
<p>Challock Due to the very good relationships with the British Gliding association (BGA) and in no small part to the work of Squadron Leader Robin Miller of ACCGS, HQAC struck an accord with the Kent Gliding Club. In its past the KGC had been resident at West Malling, before 618VGS was formed, and in 1963 they had purchased a small field at Challock near Ashford. As an experiment in operating an Air Cadet School alongside a civil club, an agreement was made for 618 to operate alongside the Ken Gliding Club. However, this was to be a very limited operation given the small size of the airfield at Challock.</p>
<p>With the limitations on space, not all the 40 or so 618VGS instructors could be accommodated. Therefore, many moved to other Gliding Schools to continue gliding with the Air Cadets although quite a few ceased Air Cadet gliding completely.</p>
<p>That same day, 28th September, most of the Schools equipment was moved to Challock. As there was a small blister hangar at Challock, only two Vikings were moved there. Challock operations began on 1st October 1994 with site familiarisation. Challock has no hard standings around the field, and when the winter weather changed for the worse, the winch began to sink into the surface. At one point, the winch was unusable for a month.</p>
<p>The first cadets attended in November and some of the best flying took place on the ridge, where, many sorties lasted over half and hour.</p>
<p>The operating difficulties increased and it became clear that a full operation to train cadets with the circuit crowded with club gliders was impossible. With great sadness, as the winter of 1995 approached, 618VGS suspended operations. It was never to resume flying at Challock. In March 1996, 618 ceased operations altogether and the staff dispersed to other gliding schools.</p>
<p>In October 1996, Flight Lieutenant Allan Melmore assumed command of the School. He and some of the staff joined 615 VGS at Kenley and were able to run courses at other airfields. The first took place in June 1996 When ACCGS at Syerston accommodated 618VGS to run its Basic Gliding course with students from Kent Wing ATC. A further two courses were held at Syerston in 1997 followed by one at Kenley in 1998. A final advanced course on the Viking was held at Portmoak in August 1998.</p>
<p>Conversion to power</p>
<p>618 worked hard for its existence over the period. In April 1999, 617VGS at Manston also ceased operating due to the closure of this base. All the staff of 617 moved to fly at Kenley with 615VGS. When the option to start up a VGS at RAF Odiham became a reality, instructors from both schools were chosen to go there. 618VGS reformed at Odiham with the Vigilant T1 motor Glider on 1st July. A new Headquarters complex of Portakabins was moved in to an area around the southern hangar.</p>
<p>Instructors converted to the Vigilant during the summer of 2000 and one and later two Vigilants were positioned at 612VGS Abingdon for the work up. On August 19th 2000 a flight of four Vigilants from 612 VGS at Abingdon delivered the first two 618 Aircraft to Odiham. The first Gliding Induction course for a cadet was flown on September 3rd. Further staff members were recruited, and the third and final Vigilant arrived from Kinloss in November.</p>
<p>New Staff were recruited during the first few months and instructor training began and continues today. After many months of operating without mains power and water, the installation of services was completed in late 2001 and staff were able to begin improving the briefing and living accommodation.</p>
<p>618VGS is now training cadets every weekend in the skies around Hampshire.</p>

<p>Группа Unsilent Phenomenon образовалась в 2003 году в России в городе Таганроге. Основной состав образовали участники группы Loksodroma, сменив стиль power-metal на melodic-death-metal. Все песни исполняются на английском языке. Лирика песен основана на мистических сюжетах и исследовании темных сторон человеческой души.</p>
<p>Группа принимала участие во многих концертах и фестивалях тяжелой музыки, где исполнялись песни собственного сочинения, а также каверы групп Helloween, Children Of Bodom, Arch Enemy и т.п.</p>
<p>Весной 2005 года участники Unsilent Phenomenon закончили запись демо-альбома "The Renoncement", для которого были отобраны 6 песен из репертуара группы. Все композиции объединены единой концептуальной линией, которая основана на мистическом сюжете.</p>
<p>На данный момент группа занимается поиском звукозаписывающего лейбла для заключения контракта и дальнейшей профессиональной музыкальной деятельности.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-08_8b37.html" title="Edit section: Unix Shell">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unix Shell</span></h2>
<p>These notes teach you how to write and run Bourne shell scripts on any UNIX computer.</p>
<p>What do you need to know to follow along? This was originally written as a second class in UNIX. The first class taught how to use the basic UNIX commands (like sed, grep and find) and this class teaches how to combine these tools to accomplish bigger tasks.</p>
<p>In addition to the material in this course you might be interested in the Korn shell (ksh) and the Bourne again shell (bash), both of which are excellent shells that enchance the original Bourne shell. These alternate shells are upwardly-compatible with the Bourne shell, meaning that a script written for sh can run in ksh or bash. However, there are additional features in bash and ksh that are not available in the Bourne shell.</p>
<p>The focus of this guide is to get you to understand and run some Bourne shell scripts. On several pages there are example scripts for you to run. On most of these pages there is a link you can click on (with the right mouse button) and download the script to your computer and run it.</p>
<p>You will learn several things:</p>
<p>Ability to automate tasks, such as Software install procedures Backups Administration tasks Periodic operations on a database via cron Any repetetive operations on files Increase your general knowledge of UNIX Use of environment Use of UNIX utilities Use of features such as pipes and I/O redirection For example, I recently wrote a script to make a backup of one of the subdirectories where I was developing a project. I quickly wrote a shell script that uses /bin/tar to create an archive of the entire subdirectory and then copy it to one of our backup systems at my computer center and store it under a subdirectory named according to today's date.</p>
<p>As another example, I have some software that runs on UNIX that I distribute and people were having trouble unpacking the software and getting it running. I designed and wrote a shell script that automated the process of unpacking the software and configuring it. Now people can get and install the software without having to contact me for help, which is good for them and good for me, too!</p>
<p>For shell script experts one of the things to consider is whether to use the Bourne shell (or ksh or bash), the C shell, or a richer scripting language like perl or python. I like all these tools and am not especially biased toward any one of them. The best thing is to use the right tool for each job. If all you need to do is run some UNIX commands over and over again, use a Bourne or C shell script. If you need a script that does a lot of arithmetic or string manipulation, then you will be better off with perl or python. If you have a Bourne shell script that runs too slowly then you might want to rewrite it in perl or python because they can be much faster.</p>
<p>Historically, people have been biased toward the Bourne shell over the C shell because in the early days the C shell was buggy. These problems are fixed in many C shell implementations these days, especially the excellent 'T' C shell (tcsh), but many still prefer the Bourne shell.</p>

<p>What do you need to know to follow along? This was originally written as a second class in UNIX. The first class taught how to use the basic UNIX commands (like sed, grep and find) and this class teaches how to combine these tools to accomplish bigger tasks.</p>
<p>In addition to the material in this course you might be interested in the Korn shell (ksh) and the Bourne again shell (bash), both of which are excellent shells that enchance the original Bourne shell. These alternate shells are upwardly-compatible with the Bourne shell, meaning that a script written for sh can run in ksh or bash. However, there are additional features in bash and ksh that are not available in the Bourne shell.</p>
<p>The focus of this guide is to get you to understand and run some Bourne shell scripts. On several pages there are example scripts for you to run. On most of these pages there is a link you can click on (with the right mouse button) and download the script to your computer and run it.</p>
<p>You will learn several things:</p>
<p>Ability to automate tasks, such as Software install procedures Backups Administration tasks Periodic operations on a database via cron Any repetetive operations on files Increase your general knowledge of UNIX Use of environment Use of UNIX utilities Use of features such as pipes and I/O redirection For example, I recently wrote a script to make a backup of one of the subdirectories where I was developing a project. I quickly wrote a shell script that uses /bin/tar to create an archive of the entire subdirectory and then copy it to one of our backup systems at my computer center and store it under a subdirectory named according to today's date.</p>
<p>As another example, I have some software that runs on UNIX that I distribute and people were having trouble unpacking the software and getting it running. I designed and wrote a shell script that automated the process of unpacking the software and configuring it. Now people can get and install the software without having to contact me for help, which is good for them and good for me, too!</p>
<p>For shell script experts one of the things to consider is whether to use the Bourne shell (or ksh or bash), the C shell, or a richer scripting language like perl or python. I like all these tools and am not especially biased toward any one of them. The best thing is to use the right tool for each job. If all you need to do is run some UNIX commands over and over again, use a Bourne or C shell script. If you need a script that does a lot of arithmetic or string manipulation, then you will be better off with perl or python. If you have a Bourne shell script that runs too slowly then you might want to rewrite it in perl or python because they can be much faster.</p>
<p>Historically, people have been biased toward the Bourne shell over the C shell because in the early days the C shell was buggy. These problems are fixed in many C shell implementations these days, especially the excellent 'T' C shell (tcsh), but many still prefer the Bourne shell.</p>

<p>A pink banana, despite it's name, is not a species of banana. It is instead a squash. Otherwise known as a 'Mexican banana' or a 'Plymouth rock' this squash takes around 100 days to mature. It has a smooth velvety skin, and a soft yellow flesh. The fibreless flesh is considered great for canning, baking and pies. Weighing on average 10lbs and being between 18<i>-24</i> in length and 7 <i>in diameter 1 pink banana offers a plenty of flesh for consumption.</i> Thought to first be popular amongst American pioneers, it's first definate reference though out history is 1591. They are native to the Western Hemisphere, thought to have originated in Argentina, most likely around the Andes</p>

<p>Theagenes of Rhegium, contemporary to Homer and Hesiod, in the 6th century BC (flourished around 525 BC), began what would become a leading attitude in the Western tradition by finding a codified, allegorical way of interpreting myths and understanding them as expressions of natural forces. Epic poems described the battling between dual elemental forces under the guise of gods and their stories. Fire was represented by Apollo, Helios and Hephaestus, water by Poseidon and Scamander, air by Hera, and also with abstract qualities – wisdom with Athene, desire with Aphrodite, reason with Hermes and folly, no less, with Ares. This equally mythical character represents a critical moment in the development of human perception.</p>

<p>Together with his twin sister Diana, Felsenheimer grew up in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spandau.html" title="Spandau">Spandau</a>. Their parents separated when he was five. He went to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realschule.html" title="Realschule">Realschule</a> and started policeman training, abandoning it soon after. Afterwards he started training at department store group <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertie.html" title="Hertie">Hertie</a> but got dismissed due to his "inappropriate" appearance. Next he started an interior designer training at a fashion shop for women over 50.</p>
<p>Felsenheimer started drumming in the cellar of his sister's boyfriend. Shortly afterwards he buyed his own drum kit, meanwhile even singing in chorus. He was supported by his parents: in the cellar he got his own rehearsal room.</p>
<p>Due to the fact he was very fascinated about <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a> actor <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_Lugosi_0b2c.html" title="Béla Lugosi">Béla Lugosi</a>, he chose his stage name "Bela B.".

That is why Bela B. Felsenheimer was called "Barney" in his youth often.</p>

<p>After a holiday in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> Felsenheimer joined the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk scene</a>. Influenced by this, he founded his first band <i>Empire</i>. Later he also played in the bands <i>Wild in the Streets</i>, <i>Kawumm</i> und from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> together with Hussein Kutlucan, Bernd van Huizen, from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> on also with Jan Vetter (better known as <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farin_Urlaub_659b.html" title="Farin Urlaub">Farin Urlaub</a>) in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> band <i><a href="../../../s/o/i/Soilent_Gr%C3%BCn_1d1c.html" title="Soilent Grün">Soilent Grün</a></i>, named after <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> movie <i><a href="../../../s/o/y/Soylent_Green_428b.html" title="Soylent Green">Soylent Green</a></i>. With Soilent Grün, Felsenheimer had his first musical success.</p>
<p>When Soilent Grün dissolved, Felsenheimer founded together with <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farin_Urlaub_659b.html" title="Farin Urlaub">Farin Urlaub</a> and Sahnie (Hans Runge) the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock</a> band <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_%C3%84rzte_b9fa.html" title="Die Ärzte">Die Ärzte</a>. After two successful albums <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bassist.html" title="Bassist">bassist</a> Sahnie was thrown out of the band. Then three albums with bassist <i>The Incredible Hagen</i> (Hagen Liebing) were released. In 1988, Die Ärzte broke up. In the same year Felsenheimer got to know Rodrigo González. They both founded the band <i>S.U.M.P.</i> in 1989, which was renamed in <i>Depp Jones</i> (after a <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Luke_458d.html" title="Lucky Luke">Lucky Luke</a> character) soon after. Among other ones, the LP <i>Get Wise, Get Ugly, Get Sump</i> was released, containing <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">cover versions</a> of famous songs such as <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe_%28band%29.html" title="Europe (band)">Europe's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Final_Countdown_%28song%29_89c2.html" title="The Final Countdown (song)">The Final Countdown</a></i> and <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Toten_Hosen_987d.html" title="Die Toten Hosen">Die Toten Hosen</a>'s <i>Opel-Gang</i>. The band was not as successful as Die Ärzte so the record company cancelled the contract after two albums. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, Farin Urlaub persuaded Felsenheimer in a long letter to reunite Die Ärzte. Gonzalez, former <i>Depp Jones</i> guitarist, became the new Die Ärzte bassist.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Felsenheimer released his first <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solo_album.html" title="Solo album">solo album</a> (like Die Ärzte guitarist Farin Urlaub five years before). On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>, 2006, his first single "Tag mit Schutzumschlag" ("Day With Dust Jacket") and on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a> the album „Bingo“ were released. Among others, he worked together with <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Hazlewood_61c8.html" title="Lee Hazlewood">Lee Hazlewood</a> and German TV hostess Charlotte Roche. Moreover, he went on touring with his band "Los Helmstedt" in summer and autumn and played festivals such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_am_Ring_7d9d.html" title="Rock am Ring">Rock am Ring</a> and <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>. According to Felsenheimer, causes of this solo album were not boredom or lack of money but a lack of musical activity which he calls his "the first love of his life".</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest electrical inventors who ever lived. His technological achievements transformed America from a nation of isolated communities to a country connected by power grids where information was available upon demand. In the 20th century, it was Tesla's technology that united the United States and eventually the world. Tesla's life was like a movie. It is the story of a brilliant and charismatic immigrant who rose to the height of celebrity with his amazing talent, and then was tragically undone by his own visionary ideas. The cast of characters includes: Thomas Edison, J. Pierpont Morgan, Guglielmo Marconi, George Westinghouse, Mark Twain and many more. A Serb by origin, his early discovery of the alternating current motor led him to America to seek a venue for his invention. Here he developed the polyphase AC system of power transmission, which drives every home and industry in the country. He invented the Tesla coil to create high-frequency electricity, and with it neon and florescent lighting, radio transmission, remote control, and hundreds of other devices that are indispensable to our daily lives. Tesla was also a visionary thinker, and in his papers and interviews he anticipated the development of radio and television broadcasting, robotics, computers, faxes, and even the Strategic Defense Initiative. He believed that anything we imagine can be accomplished. The inventor's great dream was to find the means to broadcast electrical power without wires in between. But like many geniuses, he was not a practical man. He gave his life to achieve his dream, while others made millions with his inventions. In the end, he wound up penniless and forgotten . In his later years, Tesla was regarded as an eccentric scientist. Ridiculed by his contemporaries, his ideas frequently appeared in works of science fiction. He was the inspiration for the mad scientist in Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons. At the height of World War Two, Tesla claimed he had invented a powerful "death beam" that could destroy attacking aircraft. He proposed a system of beam weapons to protect the borders of the United States and other European nations. When he died, most of Tesla's technical papers mysteriously disappeared, and some have never been found. <b>Tesla was so far ahead of his time that many of his advanced ideas are only appearing today. His legacy can been seen in everything from microwave ovens, to MX missiles, to electrical modification of the ionosphere.</b> × Many of Tesla's research papers were stolen by the F.B.I including his beam wepons research that is now being used by the U.S military (s.d.i)Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of fight left in This Old Cub… that’s the story of a new documentary feature about former All-Star third baseman, broadcaster and Chicago Cubs legend Ron Santo and his lifelong battle with diabetes. Santo was the first and only major league position player to play professional baseball with Type One Juvenile Diabetes (insulin dependent). He played most of his career without revealing his disease for fear that he would be forced to retire from baseball. At a time when much less was known about how to regulate insulin levels, Santo rarely missed a game—taking injections and chocolate bars based on how he felt from moment to moment.</p>
<p>The film was shot over a span of nine months, as Santo was recovering from having his second leg amputated due to complications from the disease he has been fighting for more than forty-five years. It documents Santo’s rehab and recovery from a devastating operation to his return to WGN Radio as broadcaster for the Cubs.</p>

<p>A noted Indian journalist and author of about 100 books is presently the editor of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_Voice_cdea.html" title="Dalit Voice">Dalit Voice</a> (the voice of the persecuted nationalities denied human rights). He was formerly the chief reporter of the Indian Express, India's leading English daily. He was dismissed from the Indian Express for taking up the cause of the Untouchables of India (Dalits). In 1986, he was arrested under the terrorist act, hand-cuffed and taken all the way from Bangalore and kept in Chandigarh jail (Punjab). He was arrested 4 times for his writings and speeches and in 1986 his passport was impounded for 20 long years for a speech he made in Libya as head of the Indian Delegation to a conference of Africans.</p>
<p>He was also the first to establish that the Jews and the Brahmins of India have the same ethnic origin. Both have the same characteristics and viewpoints. Brahmins of India have endorsed his views. This can be verified in the book 'Chitpavans,' written by a Chitpavan Brahmin of Pune, Dr Jay Dixit, a noted scientist living in the United States. The Jews are oppressing the Muslims today and the Brahmins are persecuting the original inhabitants of India.</p>
<p>VT Rajshekar calling Brahmins "The Jews of India" is widely accepted because a Jew is one who is a born Jew. There is no conversion to the Jewish religion. Similarly a Brahmin is one who is a born Brahmin. Today both have joined hands in a big way in USA, England and Europe.</p>

<p>Started in 1981, Dalit Voice is 25 years old and has become the countries oldest and the largest circulated journal of the Bahujan Samaj which means the majority population of India comprising Dalits (20%), Tribals (10%), Backward Castes (35%) and Muslims (15%) plus Christians and Sikhs (2.5% each). Together, Dalit Voice caters to over 85% of the Indian population. Dalit Voice is now published in six Indian languages.</p>

<p>This book was published by the 'Books for Change'. It recieved an international award from the London Institute for South Asia <i>(LISA)</i> for the year 2005 at a function in London. This book is hailed as a landmark as it declares the Indian "caste" as a nation within the 'nation' of India. The book recommends the strengthening of each caste (nation) which is the best, the easiest and the readily available indegionous weapon to fight Brahminism (Hinduism). The book has already gone into 3 editions in English and has been translated to Hindi and Kannada.</p>

<p>After Michael Porter's seminal work on clusters and competitiveness published around 1990 (The Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press 1990), cluster initiatives (CIs) and cluster organizations have become a central feature of microeconomic policy around the world. CIs add a new dimension to traditional policy areas such as industrial policies, regional and SME policies, investment attraction policies, and science and innovation policies. Experimentation with new types of partnerships linking industry clusters-government-academia is now going on in developed, transition and developing countries around the world. The Cluster Initiative Greenbook (Stockholm: Ivory Tower), prepared for the 6th Global TCI Conference, takes a closer look at CIs around the world, mainly in OECD countries. It is built on a unique data-set of over 250 cluster initiatives, derived from the 2003 edition of the Global Cluster Initiative Survey (GCIS) and a series of case studies. Introducing the Cluster Initiative Performance Model (CIPM), a model for describing and evaluating cluster initiatives, the Greenbook describes and analyses the setting in which CIs are formed, the objectives of the CIs, and the process by which CIs are formed and evolve over time. Further, the Greenbook highlights drivers of good performance.</p>
<p>The book reflects a shift in the policy discussion from whether a cluster initiative is useful to how it should be done. Depending on its unique context, each cluster initiative has to make a number of choices on how to organise and operate. This book presents systematic learnings that will help CI practitioners to make these choices in an informed way to become more successful.</p>

The legendary Kuthirip Mohammed, a native of Mogral, a tiny costal village near Kumbla in Kasaragod District of Kerala, India should have been born most probably in the late thirties. Age is a guessing game for most of the people born during those times since no one kept exact birthday records in those days. In spite of having a quite advanced age this person is involved in the game of football till today in the same spirit that he might have shown when he started kicking the ball made with g waste cloth during his earlier years. He has been playing the popular ball game ever since. Kuthirip, as he is popularly known, contributed more for the development of the game in Mogral than he could possibly do with his normal game skills. In Mogral football is played on the nines ground near the Government School, after school hours (normally after 5 PM). Kuthirip would be seen coming there first followed by a group of young players. While some young players walk free, Kuthirip is normally seen carrying some of their bags with shoes, socks etc. This is to give encouragement to the young brats who otherwise would not have bothered to take time and play regularly. Such effort from Kuthirip over several decades has helped in maintaining a fine team in Mogral.</p>
<p>Mogral has always been a footballers paradise in the North of Kerala. Mogral has produced legendary players like Abdul Perwad, PC Mohammed Kunhi, MP Fakruddin, Abdulla s/o Kunhammed. Some of these players especially Abdulla Perwad and PCM Kunhi had represented leading Indian football teams in the past. Most of these players are apparently senior to Kuthirip. Kuthirip helped in developing younger generation players. Accomplished players like, Abbas S/o Pokicha, K.M. Abdul Kader, Mubarak, late MP Mohammed Kunhi, Doctor Mohammed Kunhi, Saleem, K.A. Abdul Rahman, M.A. Abdul Rahiman etc are some of the name comes to mind quickly. Besides them, there are hundreds of other players who would not have kicked the ball without Kuthirip's encouragement. If a talented youngster shows reluctance to play football, Kuthirip would advise him, scold him, if need be fall on his feet, be a pest and make him agree to find time and come to the football ground. Such is the effort that this tiny person had put in over the years for the development of football in Mogral. While honoring his contributions through this site, we, the fellow mogralites pray for many more years of his illustrious presence and a very long life.</p>

A rumor is that in the state of Ohio (no one knows exactly where),a group of middle aged boys 15-18 have created a legal syndicate called the M.M.S. which stands for "Mercerville Mob Syndicate" which operates in the form of a mafia except not commiting crime but instead busting drug dealers and drug houses the founder or boss cannot be verified by anyone.</p>
<p>Rumor is that they operate like the style of a mafia.For example a capo of a real mob would command groups of soldiers but thats what they do except in a legal way by busting drug dealers and drug addicts.No more information has been heard but will be put on here if updated</p>

<p>In the world there are all kinds of cheese. I feel that you need to know them. Now for the next minute or so, you will read the many various cheese forms and names. By reading this passage you will become stupider by the minute. Shall we begin...you got your cheddar, asiago, mozzarella, provolone, brie, parmesan, camembert, feta, harvati, parmesan reggiano, gouda, wensley, colby, muenster, monterey jack, edam, gruyere, pepper jack, cream, gorgonzola, swiss, queso blanco, brick, mascarpone, blue, montrachet, roguefort, chevre, neufchatel, ricotta, cottage, american, limberger, cotswold, jarsberge, imitation, square, balls, and cubed. That is all I can think about at the moment. Thank you for completly wasteing your time on the most retarded subject ever created.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. Your article appears to be a joke. It might be a wonderful entry in <a href="http://www.uncyclopedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.uncyclopedia.org" rel="nofollow">Uncyclopedia</a>, a wiki where jokes and parodies are highly encouraged. But sadly, Wikipedia requires a stodgier, more factual tone in its articles, and your comedic efforts cannot be rewarded here. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
