<p>The result was <b>MOVE TO PROJECT SPACE</b>. Basically, the arguments that this list as it currently stands is not sourced and therefore is, or is subject to, point of view issues is pretty telling. Will Beback's comparison to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a> is interesting; it's possible in my opinion that if this list was sourced as rigorously as that list that it <i>might</i> have a place in article space. Flat-out deletion seems unnecessary to me; projects are allowed a fair amount of leeway in their material, and this list with its disclaimer is not really defamatory to the point where its a problem, I don't think. And it certainly seems useful as a navigation tool for editors doing work on the subject. I'm not sure if it should go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pseudoscience_7116.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience">Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rational_Skepticism_4cea.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism">Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism</a> or somewhere else, so I chose the former, editors may correct this as appropriate. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:04, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This unsourced list uses <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a> to tarnish various topics and people with the pejorative term "quack" by stating that some people consider these things "related to" quackery. Discussions on the talk page indicate an unwillingness to provide evidence for an article's inclusion in the list, an explanation of the reasons, or a grouping of list articles in the belief that that would indicate a POV.</li>
<li>The attribute "quack" is in essence an opinion rather than a hard fact. Opinions must be attributed to a source worth quoting. A list of opinions solely of those who support e.g. evidence based medicine over alternative medicine (no matter how worthy those opinions might be), would make an inherently POV list.</li>

<dd>The list is very careful to not express any opinion either way on any subject. No labelliing is being used for very obvious reasons. Any POV problems are in the eyes and thoughts of the beholder. This list is an attempt to avoid the problems that were involved with the now deleted quackery category, where the cat. tag was attached to articles without any comment, thus labelling the article. The editor above has misunderstood and misrepresented what is happening, and any conflicts will be because the concept is hated, and because editors will be tempted to include labeling and POV. Such labelling should not be allowed, and such editorial errors are not a legitimate reason for deleting the list. The list contains strong cautionary notes only visible in the editing mode. I suggest that anyone who investigates this matter read them before making any decision.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Strong keep</s></b> (change to blank page, but leave talk history, see below) The list is a resource for students of the subject and even a casual examination of the content <s>(something the editor above seems not to have done)</s> shows that there are subjects, organizations, and persons on all sides of the issues. None of them are labeled as to their particular affiliation with the subject. Their respective articles can do that. This list is not for labelling anyone, and the attempt to delete it is an editorial attempt (by some editors) to suppress what is seen as opposing POV, in spite of the fact that such POV is not attached to any item on the list. Let readers come to their own conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is for presenting all major POV, and significant minority POV -- without taking sides -- and the articles listed are representative of subjects of interest to debunkers as well as promoters of quackery. Editorial POV suppression is a violation of NPOV policy and should not be allowed here. The concept of quackery is very real, it exists, and it is unpopular with those who believe in it. They would love to delete the word and attempts to expose quackery. Such attempts should not be allowed to move from the real world and into Wikipedia. The list is still in its beginnings and it should be allowed to develop and strengthen as a valuable resource. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 16:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Both accusations are wrong. There is a belief that by keeping silent on the reasons for an article's inclusion in this list that POV can be avoided. This is false for two reasons:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For people and organisations to be "related to quackery" they pretty much have to be involved in quackery or a campaigner opposed to it. The reader is not given the option of "neither involved in nor campainging against quackery" (i.e. "quietly involved in mainstream medicine"). Therefore an opinion is being advanced that requires sourcing.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For treatments and practices to be "related to quackery", the logical conclusion the reader will make is that someone thinks they (wholely or partly) are considered quackery. I can't see any other conclusion, but perhaps I "misunderstand" this too? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 18:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>My apologies</b> for what is taken as a personal attack. I was indeed irritated by what still appears to be a "reading into" the list of something that is deliberately avoided, which is the idea of providing labels, which would indeed create serious NPOV issues. Even without any labelling and with very strong cautions against it in the editorial notes (invisible to readers) and talk page, there are still attacks (from many) based on what appears to be an assumption that such labelling is actually occurring, yet no one can point to evidence of such. If fact it is repeatedly discouraged. Even if it might not be outright stated (above) to be the case (and it seems to to me to be outright stated), readers who don't see the list itself will likely get the impression that POV labelling is actually occurring, which is not the case. I just want to make sure no one comes away from reading the AFD nomination above with that false impression. I will exercise good faith and assume that that was not Colin's intention, but that is the impression I got, and I know the content and cautionary messages very well! If I got that impression, how many others coming here will still get that impression, and then vote accordingly? I'm sure it wasn't Collin's intention, but maybe he could revise the wording to avoid that implication? (Unfortunately voting is already occurring based on a false impression, and even attempting to convey a false impression independently of the AFD nomination above.) -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 19:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the apology. I'm afraid I've got lost with all those intentions, impressions and implications. Can you tell me what wording you think is giving the wrong impression? I don't understand how avoiding explicit "labels" helps (see previous comments at 18:59) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 20:41, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect that much of the problem hangs on what meaning one attaches to the word "related". I didn't choose the title, but have interpreted it broadly, since a narrow definition would immediately justify deletion. I want this list to be a resource for all parties, so "relation" refers to any concept, method, profession, organization, or person who has ever (including historical) been associated with the concept of quackery, whether on the "receiving end" of accusations, or on the accusing end, or on the study end (hence the inclusion of various terms related to psychology, logic, law, etc.). Thus it becomes a broad NPOV resource that is totally lacking here. (The articles themselves can do the labelling and have the NPOV problems!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the category was deleted, it was then suggested that a list would be better, but the list is still not acceptable to those opposed to the existence of the word. They won't be content until the word quackery is removed from the face of the earth. Without the category or a list, how can students of the subject be enabled to study what Wikipedia has to say on each topic?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The long and bitter controversies that surrounded the Category:Quackery led to the deletion of the category. Why? Because of NPOV issues that can be dealt with in articles, but not in categories:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Categories appear without annotations, so be careful of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> when creating or filling categories.

<dd>A list is "a better option," and that's what we're doing here.

<dd>I think can see where you are coming from now and the problem is perhaps few people take your broad <i>no offence intended</i> view of "related to quackery". Try replacing the word with "fraud" or "dishonesty" and you should see why people don't want to be associated in the slightest with those words. A well sourced and informative list can be so so much better than a category. You're just not allowed deliberately bare unsourced lists in article namespace. I sympathise with your desire to find a way to collect related articles for researchers. A solution in this hotly contested subject won't be easy. Clicking "What links here" on the Quackery article is a poor-man's solution. Perhaps shorter, more focused and well sourced lists (not necessarily stand-alone) are the way to go. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Um</b> tricky. Thing is, criticisms of the article are definitely valid, but so is support. A move to project space has definite merit, and it would be better to have more prose and less of a laundry list (which tends by its nature to imply equal weight for all entries, which is not properly the case). The idea is sound, but possibly not as a mainspace article. Probably <b>move to project space</b> maybe as the foundation of a WikiProject.

<dd>That's a false charge. No one has used the term about anything or anyone on that list. It's a mixed bag and if readers supply the term in their own head, that is their own doing. In real life one can with impunity (in the USA) call anyone a quack without any legal consequences. That has been decided in court. I'm not recommending one do so without evidence, but that's the case. Free speech allows pejoratives, and since the concept is a serious issue that costs people their lives and money, it is far more than a mere pejorative, but a term describing a serious problem that should not be disparaged and ignored. The government (especially the FDA and FTC) certainly recognizes it as a problem, and deals with it within certain limits. It is in that sense (not as a pejorative) that it is used here at Wikipedia, and whenever I rarely use the term about anyone. It is then a descriptive term for actual behavior that can be documented, and not a careless pejorative. (There are a select few scammers for whom I reserve the term.) When others perceive the use as being a pejorative, it is often because they feel hit, which reveals their own self-described position on the subject. I can't say if that's the case here, but that's often how it is with many objectors, and that is not my fault, or the fault of the list, or of the term. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 20:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is a valuable tool and resource for reading, investigating, and understanding many different topics on the subject of related in some way to quackery. It does not mean the subject is quackery. Just a relation to it. Both sides of the issues are present in the main articles. The list is the only way for students to resource so many different articles. Without this list it would be impossible to find and research the subject. I hope Wikipedians understand this list is an educational tool for readers of the subject. Perhaps, any misunderstanding are now cleared up. Additionally, there is a strong disclamer paragraph at the top explaining about the list does not define the article or subject as a quack, just a relation to it in some way. The reader can read any article and can easily come to their own conlusions. Again, the list is an extremely helpful educational tool. Possibly, expanding the first paragraph will avoid any more misunderstandings in the future. On that note. This is an article listing. Nothing more. Lists on Wikipedia is encouraged.

As a science writer I have found this list, despite its short existence, a great mine of information. I do not see any problem in deciding whether or not an article should be included in the list - if the 'mother' article indicates that the issue is contentious and that there are debates about the evidence related to the efficiacy of the treatment/drug etc, then it should be included. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 22:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Greetings Colin. I think you are misunderstanding the title of "The list of articles related to quackery". The title which I carefully named and created actually has a double meaning. Related to quackery has a broad meaning. For example, a person who is opposed to quackery. Lots of people are gladly and willing to be associated with quackery. Skeptics are associated with quackery. The FDA is associated with quackery. Consumer advocates are associated with quackery. I, the QuackGuru, is related to quackery. We need to give the reader a little credit and allow them to come to their own conclusions. In conclusion, there needs to be a resource for people to learn and educate themselves on this topic. This is only possible by creating a broad list. Thank you. --QuackGuru 01:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I don't get this "article" at all. I think it is a reaction to the recent deletion of the pejorative category "Quackery". Anyhow, there is nothing encyclopedic about this article. It just lists a couple editors opinions. What qualifies something to be on this list? A subject merely being related to quackery? Who says the subject is related? How closely related does it have to be? The wording at the top is pretty weasel-ly and in the end says nothing. This is a lot of POV pushing and WP:OR. I can't imagine this being any help to anyone other than the person who needs to fullfill some inner desire to see these subjects and quackery existing somewhere together in Wikispace. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 02:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(It also gives POV warriors in the pro Alt Medicine camp a tool to make a mockery of the list and destroy it by including everything under the sun: US Senate, Ronald Reagan, senator Kerry, Coca Cola Company, Monsanto, Prozac, Prilosec, Zoloft, Paracetamol, Merck, Wyeth, CNN, Nature, Financial Times, NY Times, JAMA, European Commission, Spain, US army, FBI, Truman Capote, Kevin Costner, Sharon Stone, Snoop Dog, Rolling Stones, organic chemistry, all amino acids, genocide, carbon, zinc, selenium, lead, magnesium, the Hubble Telescope, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.)</dd>

Now they want to reintroduce a way of indirectly labeling everything outside conventional medicine as “related to quackery”.</dd>

<p><b>Riddle</b> Here is a riddle for us: According to the article on Quackery, A "quack" is "a fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill. A person who pretends, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, or qualifications he or she does not possess; a charlatan." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery" rel="nofollow">Quackery</a></p>
<p>Now for some bizarre reason, Linus Pauling, the only winner of two unshared Nobel Prizes makes this list either as a quack or is related to quackery, but ex-psychiatrist Stephen Barrett, who failed his boards yet has represented himself in courts of law as an expert witness in psychiatry, is considered by his disciples to be the expert/guru/clearinghouse of who is and isn't a quack. Shouldn't he be considered a quack, too?</p>
<p>Links to Stephen Barrett Enterprises sites(Donations gladly accepted!) are liberally sprinkled here and around WP by his followers. Shouldn't his sites logically be purged from Wikipedia as unreliable? Just some thoughts that strengthen my reasons as to why this list should be removed. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteth_a418.html" title="User:Steth">Steth</a> 13:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Though an attempt to find a way to present the concept of quackery without naming names is not without merit, this method is an example of why avoiding NPOV doesn't work. It confuses the reader and leaves the wrong impression about most of the articles listed, creating a feeling of nonsensical disbelief. If this has some value to Quackbusters, so be it.. put it in a work space and use it for whatever purposes it might have value for, but I would think it will only take up space because they already know what they want on the list. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 15:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> &amp; <b>Relocate</b> - the list contains many topics that I personnally indeed do view as more of a New-Age religious belief system than real verifiable scientific clinical therapeutic systems. As such some form of collection of articles on twaddle (for want of a better term) seems useful.
<ul>
<li>1) However the term "quackery" is problematic - it presumes a deliberate intent to mislead or defraud customers, and whilst much of alternative medicine I would perceive as mis-guided or wishful thinking, I am sure that most practitioners of homeopathy, accupuncture or herbal medicine do not have criminal intent to lie. Whereas any claims from someone practising <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_healing.html" title="Crystal healing">Crystal healing</a> as curing cancer I might so view. I think items in the list that contains this term must, as far as an encyclopaedia trying to protect itself from any libel liability, be only practices for which <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sourced</a> third parties have made the claim.</li>
<li>2) The second problem with the list is "related". I appreciate that this allows inclusion of both for and against articles, but its usage in the article is so wide as to make the list less useful. As an example <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">Confirmation bias</a> is a straight forward piece on psychology of interpreting results and data, but is it useful to so include it in the list between <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complication_%28medicine%29.html" title="Complication (medicine)">Complication (medicine)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness_causes_collapse.html" title="Consciousness causes collapse">Consciousness causes collapse</a> (that concious thought has quantum effects thus linking meditation with hard science)?</li>
<li>3) As MaxPont mentioned above, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</a> seems a better constructed list, i.e. has more clearly defined purpose and inclusion criteria. The maintanece of the two lists seems duplication, and whilst I would vote to keep a modified form of List of articles related to quackery if it were the ony list, for now I vote for relocating the information; but I welcome opinions as to why these are different or separately worthwhile.</li>
<li>Should not therefore this list be dissipated - some items already included in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</a>, others might be moved there (and that might include the articles dealing with underlying concepts needed in understanding the scope of pseudocience such as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">Confirmation bias</a> article). Other topics perhaps should be incorporated into <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">Quackery</a>, or the concepts that distinguish conventional from alternative scientific opinion might be mentioned under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> (or if specific to a particular scientific discipline, then under that subject e.g. <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">Medicine</a>).</li>

In essence it is really just an attempt to ensure that NPOV guidence is maitained across scientific/medical topics, namely that minority opinions whilst needing to be mentioned do not need to be given equal space in the encyclopaedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm leaving my vote as 'Delete' (already registered above). This is just a comment on moving the list to project space. The latter space is not a Wild West for defamatory material. If you do move the list, I advise you shouldn't call it 'List of articles related to quackery'. Instead it should be the work list of some project (formal or informal) whose mission could be explained. For example, a 'List of articles in topic areas where bad medicine is sometimes alleged'. I.e. explain how the list relates to a project, formal or informal, and then show how the project's activities are using the list to develop better articles. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a></li>

A third project I think is likely to be triplication, so might I suggest merging the list into various aspects of the pseudoscience project (claimed quackery to WikiProject Pseudoscience watchlist, surrounding concept and statistical articles to a WikiProject Pseudoscience sub-page)&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 00:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That sounds like a good idea. I support first moving it to project space (WikiProject Pseudoscience sounds good) and using another name without the Q word. Then blank this list ASAP so it doesn't continue to detract from our other tasks here. In the project space it can get pared down and some parts merged into the existing articles and lists. (Merging takes time, and this list shouldn't exist here while it's going on.) There they will fit in better, and with good sourcing. The current approach isn't working, so let's blank this list ASAP!!</dd>

<dd>The difference between a pseudoscience (science, including medicine) list and a quackery (only medicine) list is simple -- they overlap alot, but are not identical. Not all pseudoscience ends up as quackery, and not all quackery is based in pseudoscience. Some quackery (a minority of cases) is just plain criminal fraud, while most of it involves no deliberate fraud, but is based in pseudoscience, ignorance, faulty education, well-meant attempts by true believers, etc.. "Quackery's paramount characteristic is promotion ("Quacks quack!") rather than fraud, greed, or misinformation. Most people think of quackery as promoted by charlatans who deliberately exploit their victims. Actually, most promoters are unwitting victims who share misinformation and personal experiences with others." While quackery and quacks deserve criticism, it's the actual frauds and scammers that deserve most attention, exposure, and often prosecution. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 09:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst it is true that I don't edit hereall too often, you can rest assured that I am nobody's puppet (meat, sock or any material with which one might bludgeon a loved one). If you are curious how I arrived here, I was invited here by the <i>cause</i> (as you call it)... I call it "like-minded Wikipedians who share in the belief that this website should be kept as fair as possible and not dominated by Western, ethnocentric opinions". I suppose <i>cause</i> is more succinct. As for my edit count being under 300 edits, well on first glance at user contributions, the same can be said for the QuackGuru (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuackGuru_872f.html" title="User talk:QuackGuru">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuackGuru_3717.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuackGuru">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShot_info_3025.html" title="User talk:Shot info">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shot_info_da6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shot info">contribs</a>).

<dd>CuTop, it was your complete lack of activity prior to your appearance on this AfD that made me wonder, I probably should have made that more clear. I was just thinking aloud. As for <i>shot info</i>, s/he has been editing in related areas recently so was less of an anomaly. I had not thought to look at QuackGuru since he had a blue linked name (rather than red). But you're right, his first edit was on this page so I should have included that user in my musings too.

Have you edited on Wikipedia before under a different name or IP address? Or did you study Wikipedia editing policy a lot before making this first edit.

<li><b>Comment</b> Currently the consensus is approx even between Delete and Move to Project. My own view is that it should not be moved verbatim (as has been done here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Rational_Skepticism_List_of_articles_related_to_quackery_c503.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/List of articles related to quackery">Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/List of articles related to quackery</a>) and this view is shared by many of the Move and probably more of the Delete editors. The word "quack" is interpreted differenty by editors, with some taking great offense. Many editors feel there is value in a wikiproject maintaining a list of medical articles that are controversial and may benefit from improvement or watching in order to achieve NPOV, V, etc. Can this be done in a non-confrontational manner? Could the moved article be simply Wikipedia:Wikiproject Rational Skepticism/Medicine? The list can be broken into sections that would help with navigation. The word "quack" needn't appear as an entry criterion. The list also needs trimmed to remove the every-day words. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 14:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The name you have suggested does not match the list. Another name I was thinking of was &gt; the <b>List of articles related to skepticism</b>. Note the "Q-word" is gone but still has a similar meaning. I still prefer the original title though. I would like to know what you think of this title. The list could be categorized better and improved as you stated to help with navigation. <i>Everday words</i> could be put into there own special category. My concern is I do not want to lose any valuable info which is important as a navigational tool for the general public &amp; students in the field of research on a variety of topics. I want this list to be complete. That was my idea from the start. --QuackGuru 17:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But this is a medical/health list, not just all skepticism. A long name isn't required and the prefix of "Wikiproject Rational Skepticism" tells you most of what it is about. Maybe "Health" rather than "Medicine"? I really don't see what "everyday words" have to do with the project – why should project members be interested in the article on <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honesty.html" title="Honesty">honesty</a>? Ultimately, the organisation of "articles of interest" is a matter for the Wikiproject so perhaps you should take the discussion to their talk page. However, if you want to collate info for the "general public &amp; students", a Wikiproject is not the place. If the purpose of your collation is to further a campaign against quackery, then Wikipedia is not the place either since it is not a <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapbox</a> – there's the whole rest of the Web for that. Several editors (including myself above) have made suggestions on different approaches you might take to collate the info in "articlespace": more focussed, neutral and well-sourced. Look at how other controvesial topics have been handled, ask for help on the Wikiprojects. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 18:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Suggestion: Well, the list should have a genuine title. What title will describe the inclusion of the list? The project is to develop the list to bring back to mainspace. Once everything is focused it will be back where it belongs. A navigational tool for Wikipedia readers is very good I would think. Here is another title for the resource list. ----&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p><i>List of articles related to skeptical health topics.</i> BTW, Wkipedia is for readers of the general public for knowledge. Or what is the purpose of Wikipedia? Schools around the world are telling students about Wiki. That is how I found this place. I hope you welcome students here on Wikipedia to benefit other students. --QuackGuru 18:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: For the WikiProject it will be used only as a watch list. Is that it? I'm afraid it really will be sent to Wiki-Outer-Space. --QuackGuru 21:01, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That title isn't grammatical. I think you misunderstand my point about "general public &amp; students": I said a <b>Wikiproject</b> isn't for them. Wikiprojects are pages and teams internal to Wikipedia for editors only. Of course Wikipedia welcomes students. As someone new to Wikipedia, you might find it helpful to get a mentor (<a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User</a>) and to read some more about our guidelines and policies before embarking on too much. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 21:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as is, either here or in project-space. I'm beginning to think that project-space would be better, but <i>Delete</i> is unacceptable. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Even the basic title is PoV, its tainting the whole article and basis. So on the basis of WP:NPOV I say delete. Quackery? I mean come on. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Inherently original research attack article. We don't get to decide what is "quackery" for inclusion in something like this. Not one thing is sourced <i>ON</i> the article. Delete, salt. Also, including all of those people? WP:BLP anyone? <a href="../../../f/2E/f/User%7EF.F.McGurk_e625.html" title="User:F.F.McGurk">F.F.McGurk</a> 20:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the title and inclusion criteria are weaselly, the list is indiscriminate and OR. I wouldn't support a move to project space unless the article is changed to elaborate how this helps wikipedia and the inclusion criteria are rewritten. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>The logical end-run fails the smell test. The weaselly logic tries to evade <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> by saying a list of names including living persons are "related" to quackery, but some are quacks and some are anti-quacks. This fails, because it is as if someone made a list of persons "related to pedophilia" then as you look at each name, the articles for A, B, and C say they are staunchly anti-pedophile, whilce the article for D just says he likes to invite kids to his home to eat candy and play video games. The inference is made clear to the reader. If the articles about living persons were deleted from and kept off the list, that would reduce the libel exposure of the Wikipedia project. If that is unacceptable, then the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
