<p>He was the son of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Capel%2C_1st_Baron_Capel_c3e9.html" title="Arthur Capel, 1st Baron Capel">Arthur Capel, 1st Baron Capel</a> (who was executed in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>) and of Elizabeth Morrison, daughter and heir of Sir <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Morrison_f749.html" title="Charles Morrison">Charles Morrison</a> of Cassiobury in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, and was baptized on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">2 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/3/1632.html" title="1632">1632</a>.</p>
<p>In June <a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>, then a sickly boy of sixteen, he was taken by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fairfax%2C_3rd_Baron_Fairfax_of_Cameron_002e.html" title="Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron">Lord Fairfax</a>'s soldiers from Hadham to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester%2C_England_1fc3.html" title="Colchester, England">Colchester</a>, which his father was defending, and carried every day around the works with the hope of inducing Lord Capel to surrender the place.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> he was created <b>Viscount Malden</b> and <b>Earl of Essex</b> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/6/1661.html" title="1661">1661</a>), the latter title having previously died out with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Devereux%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Essex_42e1.html" title="Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex">Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex</a>. It was granted with special remainder to the male issue of his father, and Capel was made <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lieutenant_8bba.html" title="Lord Lieutenant">lord-lieutenant</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> and a few years later <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Wiltshire_432d.html" title="Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire">Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire</a>.</p>
<p>Early on, he showed himself antagonistic to the court, to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, and to the extension of the royal prerogative, and was coupled by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denzil_Holles_b43c.html" title="Denzil Holles">Denzil Holles</a> as "stiff and sullen men," who would not yield against their convictions to his solicitations. In <a href="../../../1/6/6/1669.html" title="1669">1669</a> he was sent as ambassador to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_V_of_Denmark_6040.html" title="Christian V of Denmark">King Christian V of Denmark</a>, in which capacity he gained credit by refusing to strike his flag to the governor of <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronborg.html" title="Kronborg">Kronborg</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/7/1672.html" title="1672">1672</a> he was made a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">privy councillor</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland_23f7.html" title="Lord Lieutenant of Ireland">lord-lieutenant of Ireland</a>. He remained in office till <a href="../../../1/6/7/1677.html" title="1677">1677</a>, and his administration was greatly commended by Burnet and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Butler%2C_1st_Duke_of_Ormonde_cab0.html" title="James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde">Ormonde</a>, the former describing it "as a pattern to all that come after him." He identified himself with <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> interests, and took immense pains to understand the constitution and the political necessities of the country, appointing men of real merit to office, and maintaining an exceptional independence from solicitation and influence.</p>
<p>The purity and patriotism of his administration were in strong contrast to the hopeless corruption prevalent in that at home and naturally aroused bitter opposition, as an obstacle to the unscrupulous employment of Irish revenues for the satisfaction of the court and the king's expenses. In particular he came into conflict with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Jones%2C_1st_Earl_of_Ranelagh_afbb.html" title="Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh">Lord Ranelagh</a>, to whom had been assigned the Irish revenues on condition of his supplying the requirements of the crown, and whose accounts Essex refused to pass. He opposed strongly the lavish gifts of forfeited estates to court favourites and mistresses, prevented the grant of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Park_92d6.html" title="Phoenix Park">Phoenix Park</a> to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Villiers%2C_1st_Duchess_of_Cleveland_e5b3.html" title="Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland">duchess of Cleveland</a>, and refused to encumber the administration by granting reversions. Finally the intrigues of his enemies at home, and Charles's continual demands for money, which Ranelagh undertook to satisfy, brought about his recall in April <a href="../../../1/6/7/1677.html" title="1677">1677</a>.</p>
<p>He immediately joined the country party and the opposition to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Osborne%2C_1st_Duke_of_Leeds_d9ad.html" title="Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds">Lord Danby's</a> government, and on the latter's fall in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1679.html" title="1679">1679</a> was appointed a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Treasury_1d1b.html" title="Lord of the Treasury">commissioner of the treasury</a>, and the same year a member of Sir <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Temple_%28British_politician%29_e7ea.html" title="William Temple (British politician)">William Temple</a>'s new-modelled <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">council</a>. He followed the lead of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Montagu%2C_1st_Earl_of_Halifax_2728.html" title="Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax">Lord Halifax</a>, who advocated not the exclusion of James, but the limitation of his sovereign powers, and looked to the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">Prince of Orange</a> rather than to the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Scott%2C_1st_Duke_of_Monmouth_f2b0.html" title="James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth">Duke of Monmouth</a> as the leader of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, incurring thereby the hostility of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Ashley_Cooper%2C_1st_Earl_of_Shaftesbury_b565.html" title="Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury">Lord Shaftesbury</a>, but at the same time gaining the confidence of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles</a>.</p>
<p>He was appointed by Charles together with Halifax to hear the charges against the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Maitland%2C_1st_Duke_of_Lauderdale_c2b1.html" title="John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale">Duke of Lauderdale</a>. In July he wrote a wise and statesmanlike letter to the king, advising him to renounce his project of raising a new company of guards. Together with Halifax he urged Charles to summon the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Parliaments_of_England_2385.html" title="List of Parliaments of England">parliament</a>, and after his refusal resigned the <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Treasury_81f1.html" title="HM Treasury">treasury</a> in November, the real cause being, according to one account, a demand upon the treasury by the duchess of Cleveland for £25,000, according to another "the niceness of touching French money," "that makes my Lord Essex's squeasy stomach that it can no longer digest his employment."</p>
<p>Subsequently his political attitude underwent a change, the exact cause of which is not clear—probably a growing conviction of the dangers threatened by a Roman Catholic sovereign of the character of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James</a>. He now, in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1680.html" title="1680">1680</a>, joined Shaftesbury's party and supported the <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclusion_Bill_97f9.html" title="Exclusion Bill">Exclusion Bill</a>, and on its rejection by the Lords carried a motion for an association to execute the scheme of expedients promoted by Halifax. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a> at the head of fifteen <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peers</a> he presented a petition to the king, couched in exaggerated language, requesting the abandonment of the session of parliament at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. He was a jealous prosecutor of the Roman Catholics in the popish plot, and voted for <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard%2C_1st_Viscount_Stafford_660a.html" title="William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford">Lord Stafford's</a> attainder, on the other hand interceding for Archbishop <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Plunkett_4fab.html" title="Oliver Plunkett">Plunkett</a>, implicated in the pretended Irish plot. He, however, refused to follow Shaftesbury in his extreme courses, declined participation in the latter's design to seize the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1682.html" title="1682">1682</a>, and on Shaftesbury's consequent departure from England became the leader of Monmouth's faction, in which were now included <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_William_Russell_c677.html" title="Lord William Russell">Lord Russell</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Sidney_5c36.html" title="Algernon Sidney">Algernon Sidney</a>, and Lord Howard of Escrick.</p>
<p>Essex took no part in the wilder schemes of the party, but after the discovery of the <a href="../../../r/y/e/Rye_House_Plot_231b.html" title="Rye House Plot">Rye House Plot</a> in June <a href="../../../1/6/8/1683.html" title="1683">1683</a>, and the capture of the leaders, he was arrested at <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassiobury.html" title="Cassiobury">Cassiobury</a> and imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

<p>His spirits and fortitude appear immediately to have abandoned him, and on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a> he was discovered in his chamber with his throat cut. His death was attributed, quite groundlessly, to Charles and James, and the evidence points clearly if not conclusively to suicide, his motive being possibly to prevent an attainder and preserve his estate for his family. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bruce%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Elgin_1664.html" title="Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin">Lord Ailesbury</a> wrote: "The Earl asked very coldly for a razor to cut his nails, and being accustomed so to do gave no manner of suspicion. He went into a small closet," where his servant afterward found him "dead and wallowing in blood"... the assumption being that the reason he "cutt his own throat with a knife" was because of his knowledge of the Rye House Plot. If not killed by them, he was, however, undoubtedly a victim of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Stuart_ff20.html" title="House of Stuart">Stuart</a> administration, and the antagonism and tragic end of men like Essex, deserving men, naturally devoted to the throne, constitutes a severe indictment of the Stuart rule.</p>

<p>He was known as a statesman of strong and sincere patriotism, just and unselfish, conscientious and laborious in the fulfilment of public duties, blameless in his official and private life. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Evelyn_7c90.html" title="John Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> describes him as "a sober, wise, judicious and pondering person, not illiterate beyond the rule of most noblemen in this age, very well versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical and every way accomplished"; and declares he was much deplored, few believing he had ever harboured any seditious designs. He married Lady Elizabeth Percy, daughter of <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Percy%2C_10th_Earl_of_Northumberland_06ef.html" title="Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland">Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland</a>, by whom, besides a daughter, he had an only son <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Capell%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Essex_a1d9.html" title="Algernon Capell, 2nd Earl of Essex">Algernon</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/7/1670.html" title="1670">1670</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/1/1710.html" title="1710">1710</a>), who succeeded him as the 2nd <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Essex_9dad.html" title="Earl of Essex">Earl of Essex</a>.</p>
