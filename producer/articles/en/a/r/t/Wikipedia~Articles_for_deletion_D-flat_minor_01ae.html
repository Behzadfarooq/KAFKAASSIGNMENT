<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Having played both pieces, I'm quite certain that Chopin's Schzero Op. 31 is in B-flat minor (alternatively, in D-flat major, the key in which it ends), and his Prelude Op. 28 No. 15 in D-flat major, and I've never seen anything suggest otherwise. The Prelude has a <i>section</i> in C-sharp minor, which would be equivalent to the supposed D-flat minor. I've never seen this section written in flats, however, and I don't think the fact that there's one section of the Prelude that goes into a key, that, if written in flats, would constitute D-flat minor, is enough of a reason for saying that the Prelude is in D-flat minor. Furthermore, I can't see any place where the Scherzo goes into anything remotely approaching D-flat minor. The closest thing one can find is a section in E major, equivalent to F-flat minor, the relative key to D-flat minor. Unless there's an actual manuscript edition somewhere that suggests that these pieces were originally written in an eight-flat key signature, I'm inclined to dismiss this as a hoax. (I can't speak for the Rachmaninoff or Schubert pieces.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 22:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Here, let me explain. In music, major keys start from C major and either add sharps or add flats, up to a maximum of seven (there are seven named white keys in an octave with which to make sharp or flat). Minor keys are related to major keys in a one-to-one correspondence and are arrived at by taking the major key, going down three steps (not three letters) on a keyboard, and changing the "major" to "minor.</li>
<li>Starting from C major and adding sharps and going up a fifth every time one adds another sharp, one arrives at the key of <a href="../../../g/_/m/G_major.html" title="G major">G major</a>, which has one sharp (F sharp), then the key of <a href="../../../d/_/m/D_major.html" title="D major">D major</a>, which has two (F and C sharps), then <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_major.html" title="A major">A major</a> (FCG), <a href="../../../e/_/m/E_major.html" title="E major">E major</a> (FCGD), <a href="../../../b/_/m/B_major.html" title="B major">B major</a> (FCGDA), <a href="../../../f/-/s/F-sharp_major.html" title="F-sharp major">F-sharp major</a> (FCGDAE), and <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-sharp_major.html" title="C-sharp major">C-sharp major</a> (FCGDABB). After this, there are no more keys going up, as all named white keys ABCDEFG have already had a sharp applied to them. Therefore, there is no key that is a fifth above C-sharp major, which would technically be G-sharp major.</li>
<li>The minor key corresponding to C major is <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_minor.html" title="A minor">A minor</a>, and the minor keys corresponding to the major keys I've just listed by adding sharps are <a href="../../../e/_/m/E_minor.html" title="E minor">E minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/_/m/B_minor.html" title="B minor">B minor</a>, <a href="../../../f/-/s/F-sharp_minor.html" title="F-sharp minor">F-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-sharp_minor.html" title="C-sharp minor">C-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../g/-/s/G-sharp_minor.html" title="G-sharp minor">G-sharp minor</a>, <a href="../../../d/-/s/D-sharp_minor.html" title="D-sharp minor">D-sharp minor</a>, and <a href="../../../a/-/s/A-sharp_minor.html" title="A-sharp minor">A-sharp minor</a>. Again, there is no minor key that is a fifth above A-sharp minor, as this would involve an eighth sharp, and there are only seven notes to sharp.</li>
<li>Adding flats brings a key <i>down</i> by a fifth every time another flat is added. Starting from C major and going down, one arrives at the key of <a href="../../../f/_/m/F_major.html" title="F major">F major</a>, which has one flat (B flat), then the key of <a href="../../../b/-/f/B-flat_major.html" title="B-flat major">B-flat major</a> (B and E flats), <a href="../../../e/-/f/E-flat_major.html" title="E-flat major">E-flat major</a> (BEA), <a href="../../../a/-/f/A-flat_major.html" title="A-flat major">A-flat major</a> (BEAD), <a href="../../../d/-/f/D-flat_major.html" title="D-flat major">D-flat major</a> (BEADG), <a href="../../../g/-/f/G-flat_major.html" title="G-flat major">G-flat major</a> (BEADGC), and <a href="../../../c/-/f/C-flat_major.html" title="C-flat major">C-flat major</a> (BEADGCF). Again, after this, all named white keys ABCDEFG have already had a flat applied to them. Therefore, there is no key with an eighth flat that is a fifth below C-flat major (which would be F-flat major).</li>
<li>The minor keys corresponding to these keys are, respectively, <a href="../../../d/_/m/D_minor.html" title="D minor">D minor</a>, <a href="../../../g/_/m/G_minor.html" title="G minor">G minor</a>, <a href="../../../c/_/m/C_minor.html" title="C minor">C minor</a>, <a href="../../../f/_/m/F_minor.html" title="F minor">F minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/-/f/B-flat_minor.html" title="B-flat minor">B-flat minor</a>, <a href="../../../e/-/f/E-flat_minor.html" title="E-flat minor">E-flat minor</a>, and <a href="../../../a/-/f/A-flat_minor.html" title="A-flat minor">A-flat minor</a>. The key that would theoretically follow next is a fifth down from A-flat minor, which is D-flat minor -- the subject of the article in question. The issue is that D-flat minor would involve an eighth flat.</li>
<li>Basically, the imaginary keys that have eighth or more flats -- in this case D-flat minor -- are nothing more than that: imaginary. Hence why this key is not the same as the other keys listed by Lambiam. Hope that all made sense. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 23:19, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was a music minor in college. I'm aware of how the typical scale structure works, and I'm still not at all bothered by this article. My puzzlement is why people are looking to delete this, as it's otherwise legitimate, albeit obscure and little-used, as well as not entirely technically sound. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, you looked a bit confused.&#160;:-) I still don't see the basis of your opposition. It's not a legitimate key. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 23:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TheProject, my understanding is that what you are saying is only true for equal-temperament scales. In other temperaments, you can sharp or flat anything as many times as you want. B-double-flat is not exactly the same as A. D-flat minor has to exist, because, for example, you might want to modulate up a fourth from A-flat minor. If you announced that you were then in C-sharp minor, you'd be theoretically wrong, and in a non-equal-temperament scale, you'd be tonally wrong as well. I'm not a music major, so I admit I could be missing something, but I can't figure out what it is. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 04:44, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Very true -- it does apply strictly to equal-temperament, and I hadn't quite thought about that. But unless there's a notable work written before equal temperament in D-flat minor, I think this should be a non-issue. If we included D-flat minor based on equal temperament alone, we'd also have to include A-sharp major, which seems absurd to me. Also, as I've said already, I can't find any works in this supposed key, probably because equal-temperament occurred soon after notation was developed.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 06:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Did some more research on the four pieces supposedly in D-flat minor listed in the article. The two Chopin works I've covered in my comment already, and looking through Amazon's collections of recordings of either work should verify that the Scherzo is in B-flat minor/D-flat major and the Prelude is in D-flat major. The Rachmaninoff work doesn't exist -- his Op. 8 is a trio elegante, and the work on the CD in the link I believe refers to Scriabin's Op. 8 No. 10, which is in D-flat major, according to B&amp;N<a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?z=y&amp;PWB=1&amp;EAN=89408058226" class="external autonumber" title="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?z=y&amp;PWB=1&amp;EAN=89408058226" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006419G/sr=8-2/qid=1150241747/ref=sr_1_2/104-6948942-8137522?%5Fencoding=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006419G/sr=8-2/qid=1150241747/ref=sr_1_2/104-6948942-8137522?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and I suspect it's similar to the two Chopin works with modulation in key. As for the Schubert quartet, look at the cover image carefully: the title card says "String Quartets in E flat and D minor".

<dd><b>Comment</b> I appreciate the level of research and knowledge being brought to bear here. I should stress that I have no technical knowledge of music, I'm merely looking for examples of D-flat minor music referenced out on the web. If there are none and the experts here concur that this key is a minor technical oddity then I'm happy for the article to be deleted.</dd>
<dd>However I am still able to find several pieces of music that claim to be in D-flat minor. Could someone with the appropriate technical knowledge take a look at the following and render an opinion?</dd>

<ul>
<li>Not having heard or seen the score for this piece, I can't really speak for it, but the article mentions that the key is modulated into (i.e. the piece moves to the key temporarily) for a two bar-phrase. This isn't really writing in the key -- for example, moving to a key a fifth above the key that the piece is written for, temporarily, is standard in classical pieces, and sometimes, if a piece is written in C-sharp major, the music will move temporarily into the imaginary key of G-sharp major. However, the piece won't actually change keys to G-sharp major; the temporary key change is simulated, rather than written in. Also, given that the key of the piece is B minor (two sharps), I'm wondering if perhaps it's simulated in C-sharp minor (four sharps), rather than D-flat major (eight flats), as it would be very unusual to simulate a key written in flats (and especially with so many flats) using a base key written in sharps. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 22:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From quick searches going in the other direction (find the work and the keys normally used):
<ul>
<li>Chopin Op 9/1: B flat minor</li>
<li>Rachmaninov Op 33/5 E flat minor</li>
<li>Scriabin Op 8/12 D sharp minor</li>
<li>Shostakovich Prelude and Fugue no. 15, D flat major</li>
<li>Dvorák waltz, Op 54/2 (B 105/2) D flat major</li>
<li>The Elger article is not really talking about a scale there. Also, I don't trust that write-up as a whole, because it lists the title as "Quartet for Strings in B minor, Op. 83" but the recording itself is <b>E</b> minor.<a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1183038&amp;style=music&amp;cart=352793663&amp;BAB=E" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1183038&amp;style=music&amp;cart=352793663&amp;BAB=E" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Productinformation/British_String_Quartets_Vol_2__6082395" class="external autonumber" title="http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Productinformation/British_String_Quartets_Vol_2__6082395" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>--<a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Meow</a> 22:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe the wisest thing to do here is to <b>Redirect</b> to C# minor, and add a note about the non-existence or rarity of Db minor. Perhaps in some methods or other pieces of music Db is seen as a learning exercise? Also in Jazz keys change often, and a tonal center may conveniently be writte as Db minor, as opposed to C# minor--This is done becuase the key signature need not be changed and no confusion occurs. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 00:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Redirect and Merge</b> as a music student, I can appreciate this article. It may not be the most popular key, but it isn't far enough from reality to warrant deletion. It is a legit key, but can probably be safely deprecated as a variety of C#minor, so long as some mention is made of D-flat as an enharmonic spelling. At least in the world of even-temperment, this should be sufficient. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodwhacker_2cea.html" title="User:Godwhacker">Godwhacker</a> 05:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - With the vast number of possible DNA combinations, it's just about plausible that talking wolves with purple feathers could exist. Still, we don't have an article on such a species because that combination hasn't actually occurred. A good example of why an article on nonexistent beasts (other than those labeled as fiction) aren't good article subjects appears right in this thread: the article currently contains copied erroneous examples of the key's usage. --<a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Meow</a> 16:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
