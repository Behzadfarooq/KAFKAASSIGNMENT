<p>Non-notable internet term. Been prodded, deprodded by one of the authors with no reason given. An annon user gave reason that it "has become widely used and referenced on the interent as a method for moderating online discourse". Never mentioned in context in print.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although its origin is problematic, the article itself is useful in providing an explanation for a term people are likely to encounter online, and resources (via the external links) for moderators who may consider adopting the technique. The first time I encountered the article was when I looked up the term myself, having seen it used, but having had no idea of the history of it or how it's done. Notable writers <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Scalzi_1451.html" title="John Scalzi">John Scalzi</a><a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003724.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003724.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_David_3258.html" title="Peter David">Peter David</a><a href="http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/003682.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/003682.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> have both mentioned the term in their blogs, and there is some evidence that the term is spreading into other, less precise usage<a href="http://www.thehawkeye.com/columns/Saar/Saar_1218.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehawkeye.com/columns/Saar/Saar_1218.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. There are numerous references to disemvoweling online, and sourcing is a problem solely because of strict application of no blogs, no applets, etc. provisos. Since changes to this policy are under consideration, it is probably better to wait for resolution of that issue than to delete this prematurely. The other problems with this article have more to do with interpersonal issues than anything inherent in the article inself. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 19:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The change in the status of blogs as sources is still being drafted, and hasn't even been proposed yet. At this rate it may be months before it comes to a vote, and when it does I'm sure it will be controversial. Until such time as blogs are allowed the existing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy is active. Maybe we should delete the article now, and resurect it if and when blogs become reliable sources, or when a non-blog source is found. For a mere definition of "disemvoweling", Wiktionary would be the proper location. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I suspect if we delete it now it'll eventually have to be resurrected, so we might as well keep it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's great that the first thing you came to for research was Wikipedia, but the term still doesn't have any <i>veryifyable sources</i>. Blogs are <i>not</i> concidered to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Why? Because anyone can have a blog. The term is used in the fourming community only, so we can't say it's a well known term. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 21:33, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Anyone can have a blog, but not all blogs and items found on them are equally unreliable. If a notable NASA scientist, for example, reveals on his blog that the rings of Saturn have newly-discovered properties, the fact that the info is on a blog does not invalidate the news. That is why blogs by notable people are being considered for inclusion in verifiability. In this case, several of the blogs one might cite fall into this category. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 22:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A neologism used by very few people is still a neologism used by very few people, even if a few of the users are notable. Just because a person is notable doesn't mean every word they produce is. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:42, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In that case I would say that even though the guys at NASA, we can't believe <i>anything</i> to do with science until it is A. verified by several notable scientists AND B. published in a well known scientific journal/paper/RELIABLE newscast. All things in science are considered THEORYS until they are verified by other scientists. Doesn't matter the nobility of the person/scientists. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 22:46, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm happy to tell you that you are wrong. One dividing line between reliable sources and the abyss is the presence of an editing staff. Many internet sources are considered reliable, such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.html" title="Salon">Salon</a>. Neither being in print, nor killing trees, nor sweating ink, nor paying postage are necessary. It isn't about paper; it's about editorial review. One person writing a blog and one person issuing a thesis in a self published book are equally unreliable. World-wide, there are millions of bloggers. Even a thousand references are insignificant in the blogosphere - three plugins and a few hundred mentions are barely small blips on the blogosphere's radar screen. Maybe we need a Glossary of blog terms? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Just a thought here: Would disemvoweling be better coupled with a list of moderation techniques used on blogs, guestbooks, message boards, listservs and the like? Moderation techniques are not simply used on people who refuse to remain civil; they're applied to spammers and kids who think it's funny to leave "you're stupid"-type comments everywhere. I have other thoughts on this, but this may not be the place since the topic is disemvoweling. <a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> 14:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article discusses a useful technique. Just because the technique is new and hasn't been widely discussed isn't a good reason to avoid discussing it. Trying to define the article as being about a neologism is, IMHO, wrongheaded: it isn't about the word, but about the actions that caused the word to be invented. There should be at least one reliable source here: the article currently mentions that Arthur Hlavaty mentioned the technique in some print publication.

<li><b>Comment</b> "very little of the wording from early edits exists." As we say where I come from in Maine, "Pushaw." In fact most of it is exactly as it was written in the first place. We added a context section that is now gone even though some still want it. The real question is this: can an "inventor" of a term in an online only community write her own article of significance? is it significant and encyclopdedic because she says so and has fans to back her up? That's not NPOV. Moreover, this is the first version:</li>

A lot of what we associate with her text is actually an edit or addition to it. Even the first paragraph has been greatly changed, and the spelling bit is not at all what she wrote originally. As for my own small contribution, what survives is basically the "For example" bit. As <a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> says, a lot of people have written and rewritten this. What's more significant is that the article is getting better, less TNH-centric and more accurate, partly because of this AfD. It would be a shame to delete it, now that it's so much improved, and so much of the problematic material (vanity as well as subjective) is gone.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article discusses a useful technique, one that I have used myself to moderate various weblogs and that many other weblog moderators use as well. It should be noted that one of the major opponents to keeping this article has himself been the subject of disemvowelling, which may explain his antipathy towards it and his attempts to get it deleted from Wikipedia. All his modifications to this article come directly after this technique was applied to him. Documentation is available on this point. While the impulse to prevent people from hearing about disagreeable things that happened to them in the hope of wiping out the disagreeable thing is understandable, that's no reason for attempting to delete it from a reference work. --72.79.1.138 17:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The claim "They all know each other" is incorrect, however. Aside from my being familiar with TNH's online writing, and one personal friend, there is no one in all this with whom I had any prior contact whatsoever, aside from occasionally reading online comments.

I am an infrequent reader of THN's blog, but since I rarely comment there, and rarely read other peoples'comments, I wouldn't be able to recognize anyone from there, unless they were well known to me for other reasons.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I said that part of what you said was correct, and part was incorrect. Continually stating that everyone who wants to keep the article is in cahoots with each other does not make it so, or invalidate the article itself. Whether the article stays or goes should depend on whether it is accurate and useful, not on who said what or who knows whom. A number of people have found it to be useful, and the accuracy (or at least verifiability, despite disagreements on this point) seems to be improving. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 02:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Marky48, I would say that your allegations border on personal attacks, and you should perhaps tone them down." Well, that's a very subjective claim. You make my point nicely. You read her blog and now come to support the owner. Case closed. I would caution you not to make accusations and give quasi-orders to others. It further seals your personal bias. I've never said no one should come comment. You should dial back your rhetoric pardner. One thing is certain: if the outcome rides on votes hordes will come to support it from knowledge of the blog community in question. The word is out. That's vanity too.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> 23:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In other words, this is a very good example of the perrils of not assuming good faith. Oh, and if you are not aware of it, "giving quasi-orders" as you call it, is part of what we do as editors - don't you ever leave vandal or spam templates at other peoples' talk pages?

Yeah, I know someone has shot it down, but I still believe it has some significance since it is an MSM use of the word.<a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> 02:41, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Obviously Karen. That's why I responded in kind, otherwise there would be no need would there?So only the last week counts? The 66 thread alone is enough with you caterwalling all over the place over these two articles for months about me. And the other AW thread as well so the history is clear and more attempts at bifurcating the issue won't work. The word has been out and will remain so until a victory for the forum and supporters is in hand. Or not.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Disemvoweling" is, of course, a gerund of the verb to "disemvowel." The older usage, which still involves removing vowels from words but often for different purposes, would make a great addition to the article, with juicy non-blog citations to boot. If we fix this thing up properly, it will be more comprehensive and interesting, and not at all a dictionary definition or how-to manual, neither of which adequately describe the text as it stands. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 05:21, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> on the idea of rewriting the article only to refer to "splat out" self-censorship/"TXT SPK": I don't think these ideas are really notable enough to deserve a wikipedia article, at least not to themselves. What more can you say about either than a single sentence? They should perhaps be mentioned at wiktionary, but I don't think it would be a good idea to have a whole encyclopedia entry on them. Wikipedia, as somebody kindly pointed out above, is not a dictionary, so we shouldn't be aiming at a dictionary definition. Which is why I feel that ultimately, cataloguing uses of the word that don't refer to the same technique the article is talking about is a pointless activity. Yes, they should probably be mentioned. But it isn't really relevant to the core of what the article is about, which is a forum moderation technique. Likewise, I'm not certain it's critical that we include the information that Arthur Hlavaty was the first person to use the term in print (presumably that's in reference to the technique being discussed... the print edition of the Jargon File probably contained the "splat out" definition and was published a few years previously). Although I'd <i>still</i> like to know where it was printed and what he said about it... this is almost certainly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that so far we haven't followed up.</dd>
<dd>As to the idea that wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information, and that therefore this topic (as a little-known technique practiced only by a small proportion of forum moderators, a group which isn't particularly numerous to start with) shouldn't be covered, I'm still far from convinced. The topic isn't an instruction manual. It provides information about why the technique is used, and discussion of the merits of different approaches to performing it. It used to include, and hopefully will again some day when we can find suitable sources, a discussion of the merits of the technique.</dd>
<dd>If there were another article that it could be merged into, I'd support that, but I don't see one that's appropriate. The technique is useful. Knowledge about it is spreading, and more and more people are going to come across mentions of it and are therefore wondering what it's about. We've seen a few comment on this thread here. Therefore it is useful for wikipedia to contain an article on the subject. That the article presently lacks sources is a problem, yes. It's one that can be fixed, I'm sure: I mentioned one possible source in the last paragraph that we need to follow up and cite. There may well be others. Others will almost undoubtedly come along in the future.</dd>

And there's still no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for <i>this</i> definition. If you can find one while the AfD is open, go ahead.

<dd>The Guardian supports its use in referring to TXT SPK; the others are just intentional typos, rather than having a meaning. (Would disemvoweling HAL change it to HL?) No reference to its use in moderating boards. comp.risks suggests use (with splats) for self-moderating; but it still only talks about single, objectionable (to someone) words, rather than phrased. There's no source for the definition in the article, so a <b>delete</b> is still in order. A rewrite, leaving nothing of the existing article, seems a possible alternative. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That was me that mentioned the Straight Dope and the Jargon File above. Based on <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/" rel="nofollow">the Straight Dope site</a>, I believe that that column was included in the book <i>Return of the Straight Dope</i> (Ballantine Books, 1994, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0345381114</a>), but I don't have access to a copy to be sure about that. Similarly, if it's in the Jargon File, it's probably in <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i> (MIT Press, 1996, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0262680920</a>). If either of those books include the word, then they ought to qualify as RS (along with comp.risks, where I'm happy to see someone finally agree that that counts as a RS). <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 23:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It was likely a word that fell out of use until the practice was reborn only modernized. As a potentially historical term the article could be rewritten both to reflect the past usage and to reflect the modern usage of the term.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still not sure why the history of use of the word is even relevant. The article isn't about the word, but about the technique that is described. If we want an article about history of the word's usage, I suspect wiktionary is a more appropriate place.
