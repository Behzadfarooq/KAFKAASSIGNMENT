<li><b>Keep</b> -&#160;:<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew.hartington_fe7f.html" title="User:Matthew.hartington">User: Matthew.hartington</a>I don't accept your definition of Clouds not being 'notable'. If you read the sources I left at the foot of the page, you'd find all the sources and verification you need. A cursory glance at Amazon. com, both in the Uk and the Usa, will show you who Clouds were. If you checked the Clouds website (www.cloudsmusic.com) as I originally suggested, you'd find yet more articles and references, including the 4 page MOJO Magazine article about Clouds/1-2-3 which credited them with 'The Birth of Prog', and in which, David Bowie describles Billy Ritchie as 'an unrecognised genius'. 'The History of Scottish Rock &amp; Pop' is a BBC book (Guinness Publishing) - there seems ample source confirmation of everything said in the article. Unless the criteria is something completely different than I understand it to be, I don't see how the band can be dismissed as 'not notable'. Thanks to tgies for providing info leading to WP: MUSIC info - Clouds pass on sections 1;4;5;6;12 11:55 7 December 2006

<li>My "herculean comment" wasn't entirely in jest. Even if this band were notable, which you've done nothing to convince anyone of, the article is not written in a form suitable for inclusion in this encyclopedia, either in terms of the selection of content, the tone, or even the basic formatting which every other article has. — <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamingspinach_395e.html" title="User:Flamingspinach">flamingspinach</a> | <a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamingspinach_8436.html" title="User talk:Flamingspinach">(talk)</a> 12:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're probably right on suitable form etc - I only joined an hour ago, and I haven't taken in enough information to be able to satisfy the criteria you mention, definitely fair comment; but your early assertion about not convincing anyone is a bit more debatable - all the articles and facts are in the public domain, and can be easily verified, especially at the website address I've given. Then again, it could well be that I'm falling down on that part of the formatting too.........sorry for the (hopefully temporary!) mess.."<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew.hartington_fe7f.html" title="User:Matthew.hartington">Matthew.hartington</a> 12:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)"</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sure, it <i>exists</i>, but so does my band and the "band" formed by the kids down the street who make their music by scraping putty knives on fretboards.

</li>
<li>yes, but the band formed down the street didn't play at the Albert Hall or the Fillmore, nor did they make albums for 3 major labels. Clouds did. And their peers saw them as notable - Bowie, Dire Straits etc."86.136.14.186 15:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)"</li>

<li><b>Deletion nomination withdrawn -- keep, cleanup, &amp; rename</b>. Okay, this appears notable (albeit barely), and I was perhaps less than diligent in my investigation prior to this nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's true what Debaser said earlier - I basically took the extract straight from the Clouds website, to be honest, I hadn't realised the significance of the encyclopedia. I had been browsing something entirely different, when I ran into two entries for bands called 'Clouds', none of which were the 60's band. The exclusion seemed unfair to me, the two included groups did not have the same impact on music history. I knew about the website because it's run by a friend of mine, and I thought I'd help - chaotically! I could write another article, but you all seem to be doing that very well without my interference! Many thanks - and despite any bias, I DO think the group is well worthy of inclusion - in fact, a properly-factual entry in Wikipedia ensures a better account of REAL history than music tabloid does. I agree about the article name too, but how best to change it? 'CLOUDS' on its own seems not distinctive enough for the particular subject. 'CLOUDS 60's'? Something to differentiate from the other (later) groups who used the same name.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Of course, I'd be glad to. And thank you for all your help, and what you've done so far. I was just waiting for advice as to how to proceed.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks Debaser23, you did the spadework! I did expand on what you did, unfortunately, I forgot to properly sign in when I did it, hence confusion over who did the editing - still a novice! But I hope it's going along the right lines for all the editors. Still not sure what to do about the title - any suggestions? What kind of info on the albums are you thinking of?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Yes, yes I realised that it was you who edited the page. What you have written is good and professionally done. If you have any information about the critical response of the albums and put in a mention of them in their biography like, for example, when the albums were released. Because this is a page is the articles for deletion page continue this discussion in the CLOUDS talk page.
