<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Speculation and a timeline of bloggers' posts. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 03:22, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Though I believe Wikipedia should definitely try to include as much info as possible. This really appears to be nothing more than information taken from very unreliable sources. This article also fails in the sense that it uses unreliable sources to make very unsubstantiable and very inflammatory remarks. The likely motivation for the quotes that were made were likely racist in nature (not the contributor who posted this article, but the quotes used in the statements). An article that is heavily dependant on quotes like these from unreliable sources which are heavily POV generally fails to meet the NPOV requirement, even if the article itself is not giving any credibility to these quotes. This is because posting these quotes gives inherent credibility, and no attempt has been made to counteract the statements. I feel the article should deleted due it s inherent inflammatory nature, and the fact almost no real facts are presented as support. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 04:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If we delete this, we must delete the page on 9/11 conspiracy theories. If anything, there seems to be more evidence supporting the Qana CTs than the 9/11 CTs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I haven't seen any media sources the place I live carry stories about Qana being a conspiracy.

<li><b>Delete</b> While elements of the article are not OR and the matter has been mentioned in at least two <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/d/Yedioth_Ahronoth_65e5.html" title="Yedioth Ahronoth">Yedioth Ahronoth</a> and the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem_Post_ac05.html" title="Jerusalem Post">Jerusalem Post</a>, Bluerain is correct in that conspiracy theories about everything exist. Since the vast majority of the article currently cites blogs which don't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and is largely original research, we would not lose much by deleting this version of the article and making a new article later if such conspiracy theories become more prominent.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am having trouble finding any part of this article that is not in volation of NOR. Instead of merging it (subtracting all OR, that would leave us with nothing to merge) with good articles let´s just keep improving good articles. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As Slrubenstein says, I think this article is basically unrecoverable. It's just a compilation of blogospheric speculation and violates all of the fundamental Wikipedia policies (WP:V, WP:NOR etc). The random rantings of bloggers who possess an inflated sense of self-importance are patently not a fit subject for an encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:06, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As before: Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia; not a source that controversial bloggers should want to point to to 'justify' conspiracy theories. The fact that media report on theories in blogs does not make them true. Let bloggers stick to blogging, let encyclopaedia's stick to <b>proven truths</b>. PP, 3 sept. 06</li>
