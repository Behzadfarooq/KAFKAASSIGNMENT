<p>It has been over five months since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bose_Headphone_Family_f44a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bose Headphone Family">original AFD</a>. Despite the promises by a number of editors to clean up the advertising language in the article and provide sources, the article today still reads like an advertisement. With the exception of a single product review in a newspaper, all of the sources cited by the article are either published by Bose or by business partners of Bose.</p>
<p>The encyclopedic information here boils down to two sentences: "The Bose corporation produces a line of audio headphones. They are known for their use of active noise cancellation." These statements are already included in the article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>Please be sure to expand the "show/hide" boxes in the article, which reveal long lists of consumercruft and links to product pages at the Best Buy web site.</p>
<p>This article has had long enough to demonstrate encyclopedic potential. Time's up, and as the cybermen say, <b>delete.</b> <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 23:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> so the deletion nomination is to be removed. Proof of this is listed below. here are the requirements as of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a></p>
<p>A product or service is notable if it meets <i>any</i> of the following criteria:<br />
1) The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations <i>except</i> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about its products or services, and advertising for the product or service. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as simple price listings in product catalogues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are many references (refer to the article and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Talk%7EBose_headphones_0343.html#sources_.28from_Afd.29" title="Talk:Bose headphones">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:13, 10 January 2007 (UTC))</li>

</ul>
<p>2) The product or service is so well-known that its trademark has suffered from <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genericized_trademark.html" title="Genericized trademark">genericization</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have found no evidence of this.</li>

<dd>Please do not paste huge chunks of text verbatim from the previous AFD into this discussion. I have already linked it above. Let's try to have an orderly discussion this time.</dd>
<dd>The problems with the article are clear and fundamental. It reads like a shopping catalog, with lists of specifications and subjective claims supported only by Bose's own marketing material. Reposting a five-month old dump of external links into this AFD is not an appropriate solution to the lack of non-trivial, independent reference sources in the article.</dd>

<dd>Please <b>stop</b> reposting text that is easily accessed in the previous discussion. Please do not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupt Wikipedia to make a point</a>. It is important that you resist the urge to flood this page with comments. Ensure that you are adding something substantial to the discussion before saving your changes. (Hint: if you feel that you are repeating yourself, it is probably not something substantial.)</dd>
<dd>As I noted before, a stale dump of external links in an AFD does not fix the problems in the article. I enumerated clearly the fundamental deficiencies in the article. It lacks independent non-trivial sources. It reads like a shopping catalog, eschewing discussion of the history and impact of the product in favor of an unencyclopedic litany of product features and specifications. It brazenly includes external links to product pages at the Best Buy web site.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The lists of unremarkable information (for example, "magnetically shielded ear cup", "3.5mm stereo plug", MSRP's in three different currencies, minute variations in the rotational angles of product parts) are exactly what is meant by "indiscriminate collection of information" and should be removed. The unfalsifiable and subjective assertions (for example, "better treble performance", "much more effective at attenuating noise") scattered throughout the article serve no purpose except to promote the products of a company. Wikipedia is not a platform for free marketing.</dd>
<dd>I've already indicated that, as far as I can tell, there are two kernels of encyclopedic information in this page. Bose sells a range of headphones. They are noted for their use of active noise cancellation. The rest is cruft that could not possibly interest anyone unless he's shopping for electronics.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, there was no consensus to keep the article. The previous AFD, as you'll note, was closed with a decision of <b>no consensus</b>, with a recommendation that the page needed substantial cleanup. The only viable cleanup strategy I can conceive of for this page is #REDIRECT [[Bose Corporation]], so please excuse my reluctance to be instantly reverted rather than bring it here for discussion first. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 06:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only reason the price was mentioned is in an effort to be thorough. It was not plastered all over the place it doesn't seem to be that unusual inside of wikipedia. Here is an example, I'm going to quickly list Apple Computer articles that have prices included (and some even have Multiple different prices listed) <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">IPod</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_mini_1d38.html" title="IPod mini">IPod mini</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">IPod photo</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">IPod shuffle</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_nano_a018.html" title="IPod nano">IPod nano</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_Hi-Fi_7cc2.html" title="IPod Hi-Fi">IPod Hi-Fi</a> <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Mighty_Mouse_c253.html" title="Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a> <a href="../../../x/s/e/Xserve_RAID_2bec.html" title="Xserve RAID">Xserve RAID</a> <a href="../../../i/s/i/ISight_1268.html" title="ISight">ISight</a> <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Mac_G5_d854.html" title="Power Mac G5">Power Mac G5</a> <a href="../../../x/s/e/Xserve.html" title="Xserve">Xserve</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_Pro_0184.html" title="MacBook Pro">MacBook Pro</a> <a href="../../../i/m/a/IMac_c0da.html" title="IMac">IMac</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_mini.html" title="Mac mini">Mac mini</a> <a href="../../../i/b/o/IBook_e557.html" title="IBook">IBook</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_b11e.html" title="MacBook">MacBook</a>.

And you will notice that the specs of these products are clearly listed also. These are standards for an encyclopedia to list facts and these are facts. Now saying "better treble performance" is listed as items that Bose claims to have improved from the previous version and should be cited as such. But such things as "magnetically shielded" is something that is listed as one of its features... Just check out other product pages that I have listed Each one has technical specifications heck just check out <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> an article that I have not even mentioned yet and you will see that this is exactly the same. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 07:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I am sure there is other junk in the encyclopedia, and it does not surprise me that it has appeared in Apple and Nintendo articles. That is not relevant here, because it is not those articles under discussion.</dd>
<dd>My point with "magnetically shielded", "3.5mm stereo plug" and so forth is that those bits of information don't even add anything to <i>shopping</i> research on the product. We've already said they're consumer headphones; it follows quite obviously that they will be magnetically shielded and have the standard plug. As Zunald notes below, if we remove the advert material we're left with little more than the first few sentences. Those bits are easily merged into <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 14:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My point with showing you all of these Apple pages with prices was the fact that I showed you only one company and they all had the cost listed. If you were to search through wikipedia you will find that almost every single one out there lists the MSRP. Like it or not it is the standard. Heck I showed you this last time and you had the same answer that its their problem. Well as you see 5 months later it was conclusive that the price should stay and not only that we should list the prices for the entire wold for some systems.... I don't see any nominations that the iPod page is an Ad I don't see the XBox 360 listed similarly...</dd>
<dd>Also if you are talking about headphones it is important to list how it connects since there are two main types out there 1/8th inch (aka 3.5mm) and 1/4 inch stereo connections. It is like saying how the Wii connects to the TV using composite, s-video or component. When one talks about technology you need specifics when connecting to another technology. The magnetically shielded is specifically listed because it is a difference between a previous model and a reason why some accessories (for the cell phone) will not work with the previous model. Actually if you remove the "adverts" as you claim you are left with simple facts including citations, R&amp;D (cited thanks to Dpbsmith), the timeline, A long list of facts for the quiet comforts that will take up a page, Simple facts about the non noise canceling headphones (i.e. triports) that will take up another page, The Aviation headphones that fact wise is very complete and again takes up a lot of space, Blurbs about the Combat Vehicle Crewman Headset, the entire American Airlines section, and the Criticisms section that I personally think needs some expansion. This would still be a separate article since there is so much plain and simple facts about the products out there. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 02:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, add maintenance tags and improve. As far as I can see, this is an abuse of Afd, as an article for this topic is clearly warranted, and the current article goes a long way to filling that need. The previous outcome stated "Those issues can and should be addressed by editing." I'm not a fan of direct links to BestBuy, and I'm sure I can find other faults, but those can be fixed by editing. Stop whining that certain people haven't done this within the time-frames you expect: be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and help. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I resent this kind of criticism, as I have tried to help. The section headed "research" is essentially my work and is one of the few portions of the article not sourced to Bose. I have tried to trim the worst excesses in terms of promotional language. I have pushed and helped to find pictures that simply show the headphones, rather than earlier attractive young women dancing with headphones or handsome middle-aged men in expensive suits registering dignified satisfaction while wearing headphones. In the time since I've last worked on the article, fresh advertising-copy-like material has been added on more Bose headphones. There is absolutely no indication that anyone is seriously working on an encyclopedia article about Bose headphones or that the article is improving over time. Since the last AfD, it has gotten worse in every respect criticized in the previous AfD. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How has it gotten worse? Those images are no longer there, much of the offending informations specifically stated was removed and as you said you went through the article and did a great job in helping... btw you were one of the few to stick around and help so thanks... Nothing so blatant as has <i>advertising-copy-like material</i> has been added the article since the last AfD. The only drastic change was inclusions of the On-ears and In-ears and they are very terse sections stating that they exist. They were added when they premiered and not much has been changed in those sections. I would have done more editing but I had a long wikibreak after the last AfD and personal life got in the way. Much like it still is&#160;:-( -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 11:42, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I am not whining that specific people have not fixed the article. I am asserting that in five months, even the most dedicated Bose editors have not been able to turn this into much more than a litany of consumercruft, and that this effectively demonstrates that there is no propensity for Wikipedia to produce an encyclopedic article on Bose headphones at the present time. I have already indicated my proposed cleanup of the article; it consists of the two sentences' worth of encyclopedic information I was able to find. Once one is forced to reduce an article to that length, AfD follows not only appropriately but as a matter of course. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 14:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Poor quality of a notable and verifiable article is <i>never</i> an argument to delete. There is always the option to be exceptionally bold, reduce the article to a stub, and rebuild. That said, I am far from convinced that there is sufficient notability of the product to create a free-standing article separate from the parent company. This may be a reaction to the poor state of the article, and I can't honestly advocate any particular action. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 18:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>"There is always the option to be exceptionally bold, reduce the article to a stub, and rebuild." I just tried that. It was immediately reverted to its previous state, just as promotional as before. If the article is not to be deleted, it should be a redirect to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>, which could contain a section on the headphone products. There, at least, the editors of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a> could help keep an eye on it. As it is, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_headphones.html" title="Bose headphones">Bose headphones</a> is practically a point-of-view fork of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>, the point of view being uncritical adoration. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:26, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Dont be ridiculous. The reason your stub was reverted is because the article is actively being worked on by many editors, and your stub was not a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html#Ideal_stub_article" title="Wikipedia:Stub">good stub</a>.

A section in the article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a> is surely warranted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't even use them, but I know that the individual products are notable. An objective description can be given, and it should have been done, and I am about to do a little of it. Deletion of the article is not the remedy for excessive commercial content. Reporting price in such articles is a dilemma. It is normally material for a catalog page or a website, not WP, but in some cases the pricing is itself notable. In this case, that the headphones are such a success despite being priced above competitive projects is relevant. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:22, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>I have now made a first pass at copyediting , mainly at the first portions. I have, undoubtedly more controversially, boldly removed the hidden product specifications. This is much better done with external links &amp; I assume the existing external links lead to them.</dd>
<dd>It rather startles me that outside sources could not be found for documenting the various features, considering the very large number of product reviews that have appeared. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad that you agree on the articles worth and ecstatic that you decided to help improve the page. Though I do think the specifications are a necessity and if you check any well documented article dedicated to a product you will see that they list them also, with notable examples including <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox_360</a> &amp; <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_8051.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a>. So I do think that we should list specifications. The reason that they were using hidden text was to save space and to focus on the article itself allowing the reader the choice of reading the info or not. As one user said, these are just facts and a any good article should use the facts as the basis of everything else that appears. Do you know of any solution to including this? I wont revert back for a while to see if a solution presents itself&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 02:37, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is much better without the specifications. The Bose Corporation has a perfectly good website where anyone interested can find this sort of details.

<dd>It actually does not list all the specifications... Go to the Bose website and try to find the decibel rating, driver size, operating temperature, impedance or the Magnet type. Bose does not list such information and it was through a lot of digging that such information was found. But like stated before is it not a common practice on wikipedia to list such tings?
