<p>Over it's 36 years in operation, Teen Missions has grown into an International mission organization, running mission programs for teens around the world. Teen Missions has also expanded to operating Bible schools and orphanages. Teen Missions has a staff of aproximately 50-100 individuals who raise support and serve in the many different Teen Missions's properties around the world.</p>
<p>Annually Teen Missions has a touring troup of international young adults called the Missionaries to America. They tour the United States with a song and dance presentation that highlights the different nationalities represented along with a promotion of the Christian faith and Teen Missions's work.</p>
<p>Teen Missions has recently constructed a life size replica of the Old Testament tabernacle, which can be toured by the general public. The display was originally housed on the Teen Missions's property in Florida and later displayed in Ohio and has now returned to their headquarters in Merritt Island, Fl.</p>

<p><b>3AC</b> ,formerely threesacroud, are a melodic pop/rock quartet from the conwy area in North wales. The band consists of guitarist/vocalist Craig Pheasey, lead guitarist David Podbury, bassist/vocalist Craig Hughes, and drummer Geraint Roberts. Taking their influences from bands such as <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink_182.html" title="Blink 182">blink 182</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_found_glory.html" title="New found glory">new found glory</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcard.html" title="Yellowcard">yellowcard</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-flag.html" title="Anti-flag">anti-flag</a>. As the band have stated on numerous occasions the name has nothing to do with the amount of members.</p>
<p>3AC started in september 2004, with geraint filling in temporarily before eventually agreeing to join full time, as four friends from local secondary school Ysgol Aberconwy joined together to create something different. From 2004/2005 the band travelled 15 miles every sunday evening to practise in the hills of llanrwst where sessions would last up to seven hours, in drummer geraint's garage. However These days the band claim their only practise is their sound check.</p>
<p>Having played numerous gigs around the conwy county such as The Dwygyfylchi legend Inn, MASE and the now annual penfest, with a performance earning them the front cover on local news paper the north wales pioneer. The bands live performance has been described as a combination of energy, melody, and noise with catchy choruses.</p>
<p>Originally releasing a rough 3-track demo including songs hot rox, ripped words, and the live favourite bunk bed, 3AC have since gone into the studio to start preparing to record their, as yet untitled E.P laying down new tracks such as finding emo, batting for the other team and S.M.B.</p>

<p>In 1945, General Sir Thomas Blamey directed the Australian Army to established a School of Civil Affairs to train officers for the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU), which was responsible for civil administration in Papua New Guinea during World War 2. The School was located in the grounds of Duntroon Military College in Canberra.</p>
<p>In March 1946, the School became a civil institution renamed the Australian School of Pacific Administration (ASOPA) and was transferred first to Mosman and later to Middle Head in Sydney.</p>
<p>ASOPA was given statutory recognition under the Papua New Guinea Act in 1949 and continued to function as a responsibility of the Minister for External Territories until 1 December 1973. Over these 27 years it trained hundreds of people, mainly patrol officers and education officers, for service in Australia's territories.</p>
<p>In 1973 the Australian Government integrated ASOPA into the structure of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) under the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the International Training Institute (ITI) came into existence. ITI provided management training for people from countries in the Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>A final shift – and change in name to Centre for Pacific Development and Training - saw the former ASOPA used as a base for consultants operating in the South Pacific until this role was disestablished in 2001.</p>
<p>The old Army huts on Middle Head are now empty and desolate. Heritage listed, they await refurbishment and regeneration into another role.</p>

<p>Bishop Paul Moore (born November 15, 1919. died May 1, 2003) was an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church, a part of the larger Anglican communion. He was ordained in 1949 after attending General Theological Seminary in New York City. He was ordained as Bishop of the Diocese of New York where he served in that position from 1972-1989. Bishop Moore was known for his liberal activism and his outspokenness against homelessness, racism, and the rights of all people regardless of class, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. He was the first Episcopal Bishop to ordain an openly homosexual woman as a priest in the church. His liberal political views were coupled with traditionalism when it came to the liturgy. Bishop Moore took on a number of social issues in very liberal and progressive ways.</p>

This is somewhat ironic, considering Samir's own physical traits, standing approximately 6'3" and barely weighing 150 pounds.</p>
<p>Samir has a degree in Finance from New York University and is currently working at JP Morgan Chase in Manhattan. Among his interests are making people feel terrible about themselves and basketball.</p>

<p>The emergence of leasing golf equipment, from drivers to putters, began in may of 2003 by Top Swing Leasing. Once a ridiculous idea is now an industry with 20,000 plus leases annually. The appeal for the avid golfer is a payment stream that is less than buying outright while sampling the latest and greatest. The increasing trends of shorter product cycle, new beneficial technology, and high cost in golf clubs are making leasing an attractive option. The overall trend in golf club manufacturing is to shorten product life cycles and push higher priced clubs. The shelf life for new drivers proves this trend. Titanium drivers unveiled in 1999, 2000, and 2001 averaged 17 months at their original retail price. Drivers introduced in 2002 and 2003 lasted an average of only 10 months at full retail, which is a significant decrease from the previous three years. This is a direct result of the improvement technology has on golfers’ performance. On average, Professional Golfers' Association tour players hit the ball one foot farther per year from 1968 to 1995. After titanium drivers came on the market in 1995, however, that rate jumped to 7.5 feet per year. Once again, this proves the dramatic affect of technology on golfer’s performance. Additionally, the cost of equipment is at an all time high. Prices are forecasted to drop due to strong competition for market share in a very mature market, but it could still cost in excess of $3,000 to get the best clubs available on the market.</p>

<p>William Rodgers a.k.a. Avalon was one of 6 environmental activists arrested December 7 as part of the FBI's <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Backfire_da8b.html" title="Operation Backfire">Operation Backfire</a>. He was charged with one count of arson for a June, 1998 fire set by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Liberation_Front_25d0.html" title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a> (ELF) at the National Wildlife Research Center in Olympia, Washington. He was found dead in his jail cell on December 21. Police claim he committed suicide with a plastic bag. Bill founded the Catalyst <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.html" title="Infoshop">Infoshop</a> in Prescott, Arizona in mid-2003.<a href="http://slingshot.tao.ca/89/bill.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://slingshot.tao.ca/89/bill.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The FBI has claimed that Rodgers was a criminal "mastermind" and the anonymous author of "Setting Fire with Electrical Timers, an Earth Liberation Front Guide" <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002752813_ecoindictments21m.html?syndication=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002752813_ecoindictments21m.html?syndication=rss" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which explained in detail how to create an incendiary device known as the cats cradle. The devices were meant to be used by people interested in destroying property in order to further a radical environmentalist cause. Authorities said that once the guide was published they no longer were able to tell with certainty when the ELF cell connected to Rodger's was responsible for an arson.</p>
<p>Since his death Rodgers has come to be seen as a martyr among the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> and radical earth and animal liberation movements. A number of actions including the rescue of 28 beagle puppies from the the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Independent University of Madrid and the burning of a partially constructed development in Guelph, Ontario, Canada were dedicated to his memory.</p>

<p>Fanny Duberly, was an adventurous soldier’s wife from the Crimean War and Sepoy Mutiny. Her husband, Captain Henry Duberly, was the paymaster to the 8th Royal Irish Hussars, part of the famed Light Brigade of Balaclava. The published journal of her time in the Crimea (“Journal Kept During the Russian War”) not only includes splendid accounts of what she saw, but also is a good record of all the rumors and gossip of the army.</p>
<p>Born Frances Isabella Locke in 1829, the daughter of a Wiltshire banker, she has been described as “a splendid rider, witty, ambitious, daring, lively, loquacious and gregarious.” She certainly possessed the physical requirements and tough attitude required of her surroundings: “was awoke by the reveille at half-past two; rose, packed our bedding and tent, got a stale egg and a mouthful of brandy, and was in my saddle by half-past five.”</p>
<p>She traveled with her husband to the Crimea in 1854 and stayed with him throughout his time there, despite the protests of commanders such as Lord Lucan. As the only women at the front-lines, she was of course the center of much attention. She was told of planned attacks ahead of time, giving her the opportunity to be in a good position to witness them. Such was the case at the Battle of Balaclava, where her journey from camp to meet up with Henry and watch the battle took her quite close to the enemy. Though her husband survived the day (being away on Staff duties), many of her friends did not, “Even my closed eyelids were filled with the ruddy glare of blood.” Being so close to the frontline in one of the first ‘modern’ wars, Mrs. Duberly differed from many of her compatriots back home in realizing the reality of it all; when her husband asked if she wanted to view the aftermath of the battle of Inkermann she told him she could not, “The thought of it made me shutter and turn sick.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Duberly’s adventurous actions did not always sit well with society. She was pointedly snubbed at the Royal review of her Husband’s regiment after the war. The journal she published after the war originally had been intended with a dedication to Queen Victoria, but this was refused, much to her dismay. Nonetheless she was popular with the troops (who nicknamed her ‘Mrs. Jubilee’) and many of the people back in England. Her published journal met with some success, and prints of a photo of her taken by Roger Fenton sold quite well.</p>
<p>Mrs. Duberly again accompanied her husband when the 8th Hussars were sent to India in 1856. There she stayed with him throughout his time campaigning during the final months of the Sepoy Mutiny. She was adamant about going along with the troops, she told her sister that she would “stain my face and hands and adopt the Hindoo caftan and turban…I ain’t going to stay behind.” At Gwalior in 1858, while watching the start of a cavalry charge her horse sprung off with the rest and, instead of holding back, she told her husband “I must go!” and so she did.</p>
<p>She was undoubtedly a great friend of and supporter of her husband, who never seemed to be jealous of his wife as the center of attention in the all-male environment of the Victorian Army in the field. Indeed, she saw Henry as “a friend I am obliged to support.” Henry was suffering from heavy illness when the time came to go ashore in the Crimea, she told her sister that “Lord Cardigan intends him to land with the troops, but I don’t intend him to do so.” Of course, the two had their differences of opinion on the nature of military service, when orders came from Lord Lucan for her to be put ashore in Constantinople she wrote that Henry “looks upon the order as a soldier; I as a woman, and laugh at it.”</p>
<p>She and her husband returned to England in 1864. The images she had seen on her campaigns stuck with her, and when asked to reminisce about what she had witnessed, she replied “those days are best forgotten.” Nevertheless, her adventurous spirit remained; she complained to a nephew in 1896, “I cannot stand dullness for long, and life gets duller and duller as one gets older.” Seven years later she died, having reached the grand old age of 73.</p>

Benjamin Wilbanks was born in the early morning hours of May 12, 1977 in Cleburne, Texas. His parents are David Wilbanks, and Judith Comer Wilbanks. He has one younger sister, Sarah Wilbanks.</p>
<p>Benjamin's first taste of theater came at age seven when he played a native in the chorus of Cleburne's local theater company production of South Pacific. The next few years his mother encouraged his theatrical aspirations by enrolling him in Casa Mana's acting school in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>While spending a week with his grandparents in Dallas, Benjamin and his sister Sarah spent a few days as extras in the Steve Marting / Liam Neeson film Leap Of Faith. This was Benjamin's first taste of film production, which encouraged him to take film acting lessons the following summer in Dallas.</p>
<p>In his junior year in high school, Benjamin lied about his age to make himself eligeable as an extra on Walker, Texas Ranger starring Chuck Norris. More than once Benjamin skipped classes to go to the set and spent more time watching the crew than mugging for the camera.</p>
<p>Throughout high school Benjamin shot videos with his friends, editing them between VCRs, and showing them at Chapel at Chisholm Trail Academy in Keene, Texas.</p>
<p>In 1994 Benjamin auditioned for and was cast in The Promise - an epic musical drama based on the life of Jesus - produced in Glen Rose, Texas. This job with the outdoor theater company was Benjamin's first paying job. An actor. In the first rehearsal, he was terrified that he was going to be told that his casting was a mistake and that he was going to be asked to leave by the director, Mike Meece.</p>
<p>Instead, he was chosen to play the part of Malchus, the servant whose ear is cut off by the Apostle Peter in the garden when Jesus is arrested. Benjamin played this part for two seasons in Glen Rose, and two seasons at The Promise in Branson, Missouri when The Promise opened there, as well as a weekend performance in Atlanta, Georgia, and a tour to the Kremlin State Palace theater in Moscow, Russia.</p>
<p>In 1996 Benjamin left The Promise in Branson, and moved back to Texas to work in film and television. Again he found himself on the set of Walker, Texas Ranger as an extra. Frustrating to him, Benjamin decided it was time to make a change. He packed up his car and took off to Nashville, Tennessee to live with his uncle and aunt, Tim and Sharon Comer.</p>
<p>While in Nashville, Benjamin found production work fairly easily. He worked regularly with Stephen Yake Productions, and was the Assistant Art Director for the A/V Squad's production of the Bob Carlisle music video Father's Love. In 1998, Benjamin worked with producer Michael B. Seligman on the A Taste of Lexus tour in Dallas and in Washington D.C. where Seligman then moved him to his production office at the Kennedy Center.</p>
<p>After about a month in Washington, Benjamin left Washington and returned to Texas via Nashville. Returning to Texas, he slowly stepped out of production work and found himself working at the Kimbell Art Museum as the manager of the audio tours, and at the Sundance Square Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstore.</p>
<p>In April of 2002, Benjamin heard about a turnover in the staff of his old first-love, The Promise in Glen Rose, and felt that there may be an opportunity for him to offer his services and passion to the production that he'd started at. He got a job with the company as the marketing manager, a job that turned into more responsability than he'd expected. Soon Benjamin found that he was the only full time employee of the entire theater company and unofficially filled the job of general manager, producer and operations manager.</p>
<p>After a stressful two and a half seasons attempting to keep the production together without his old mentor and director, Mike Meece, and facing the difficulties of keeping a tourist attraction outdoor theater open after 9/11, Benjamin felt that his time had come to get out of the outdoor theater company.</p>
<p>Benjamin left The Promise, and worked in television for shows such as It's A Miracle, Biker Buildoff, Rennovate My Family, Design Invasion and more. In the fall of 2004 Benjamin worked on the independent horror film Bit Parts directed by artist and filmmaker Michael McWillie. It was on that set that Benjamin formed a friendship with producer Max Steward, and actress Eryn Brooke. This also was the first major colaboration with friend and colaborator Ron Gonzalez.</p>
<p>After working on bit parts, Ron, Max and Benjamin decided to shoot their own digital horror film, and Benjamin presented his script, The Night Crawlers, to them. In the spring of 2005, Benjamin and Max were working together on developing the fundraising and production company to make the film when the opportunity came for Benjamin to go to Iraq with his uncle, Tim Comer.</p>
<p>In April of 2005, Benjamin and Tim left for the Middle East to shoot create what would eventually become the documentary A Journey To Iraq. The eleven day trip turned into a twenty-one day trip, and nothing on the journey took place according to the schedule or to Benjamin's liking.</p>
<p>Editing the project took over a year.</p>
<p>A Journey To Iraq is scheduled for release by Benjamin's company, Malchus Media, late summer or early fall 2006.</p>
<p>Benjamin currently lives in Cleburne, Texas.</p>

<p>Rhythm X believes in the quote “Don’t say that sky is the limit because there are foot prints on the moon”.</p>
<p>Rhythm and X is not only a word and an alphabet, its the relation between extraordinary measures, Revival to an Xtent , Remedy brought from melodic Xtractions, Rejuvenation Xcitement, Revolution after Xtinction and finally Rhythm that sets a new Xample.

<p>This band is made up from a trilogy of people an isosceles that connects and forms a perfect shape, but we believe nothing is perfect but indeed this is what the world demands “Perfection” humans only try to get close to that but no one ever could so we can only try to get our listeners closer and no more then that hoping our best not to get unshaped in this process because we think what we are is more than we deserved and we should consider it as perfection for us.</p>
<p>The band inclues three people as I have mentioned earlier. A lead vocalist named Irfan Khalid ,an english vocalist named Naveed Khan and a Dj named Asim.let me take you through there profiles.</p>
<p>Naveed khan aka Mc Clay: The English vocalist of Rhythm X who has command on singing and rapping, was born in Lahore on 03/30/1980 .primarily lived in Saudia Arabia and attained his primary education from there then came to Pakistan for higher studies, he took admission in a university and remained their for about four straight years and at the end came out with the award of distinction since he was the only English vocalist and performer at the campus. During his days at university he joined an underground band called “Seth” which was among the best underground bands in Lahore ,after achieving popularity from Seth he set off for comercial work and seeking that he came across Irfan who on the other hand was looking for an English vocalist ,Irfan the lead and urdu vocalist of the band 'RX' knew Naveed from university they used to performe on the same stage but due to much diversity in their singing and music they never played together for the university at that time, but as the time went by the search began for Naveed and Irfan and they ended up with each other in that search,</p>

<p>Kino Polska television is a thematic TV channel based exclusively on Polish films. Broadcast the complete range of Polish cinema, all genres and subject matters, from the pre-war films to the newest works of young independent directors. Kino Polska television offers a unique form of broadcasting films – “TV showing”. Every feature film is broadcasted within a specific framework consisting of carefully selected archive materials – documentary films, newsreels, cartoons and film-school exercises. They are chosen either to complement the subject matter of a given movie or to shed a new light on the hero of the showing. An addition of documents and memories helps us to present films in their historical and cultural context. This manner of presenting the works of Polish cinema allows us to create a very special panorama of the past century. Kino Polska television cooperates with such famous personalities as Jacek Fedorowicz, film historian Stanisław Janicki, satirist Michał Ogórek and historians Prof. Paweł Wieczorkiewicz and Prof. Jerzy Eisler.</p>

<p>Western Resistance is a website dedicated to preserving western values. This is in view of the increasing numbers of muslim immigrants and the threatening islamic ideology. The website itself lists current events and act committed by muslims around the world, very much like www.jihadwatch.org and www.religionofpeace.net The Western Resistance website has members pledge to sacrifice everything to defend values such as free speech, allowing women to wear what they wish, freedom of association and freedom of thought in face of violent outbursts of the islamic community towards these freedoms. The violet muhammed comics outburst, the stonings in iran and other evil acts shows the ever-growing menace islam has become - much to the dismay of westerners.

<p>Man Armed With Knife Kills Hungry Bear Mon Nov 17, 4:25 PM ET</p>
<p>WILLIAMS LAKE, British Columbia - John Hirsch went toe-to-claw with a black bear — and won.</p>
<p>Hirsch had only a 3 1/2-inch knife blade when he came across the bear in his backyard in Williams Lake, about 190 miles northeast of Vancouver.</p>
<p>"He came out of nowhere," said Hirsch, 61, an avid hunter and outdoorsman.</p>
<p>"I can remember thinking that he's not stopping — he's coming," said Hirsch. "I just didn't feel I had any place to go."</p>
<p>He was attacked Oct. 29 while checking on the 15 turkeys he and his wife, Sharon, raise on their spread.</p>
<p>As the bear began to circle him, Hirsch faced it like a wrestler in a ring.</p>
<p>"It was like a knife fight that you'd see in an old-time Western," he said. The bear swatted out at him, but each time it lunged, he managed to stab it.</p>
<p>"I couldn't tell you if the fight lasted three seconds or three minutes," Hirsch said.</p>
<p>Three stabs to the bear's chest and one to its neck finally did the bruin in.</p>
<p>It stood about 5 foot 7 inches to Hirsch's 5 feet 9 inches and weighed 200 pounds, according to conservation officers who inspected it.</p>
<p>"I can say it sure looked smaller the next morning than it did during the fight," said Hirsch.</p>
<p>The bear was in poor shape, suffering from a severed tongue and broken jaw, the conservation officer said. Its stomach was empty and the bear had little fat on it.</p>
<p>Hirsch, a retired electrical foreman at B.C. Hydro, suffered a scratch to the top of his head and scratches to his back — and a shredded T-shirt.</p>
<p>As for the battle itself, Hirsch said it never occurred to him that he would lose to the bear.</p>
<p>"I just felt that however long this took, I was going to come out OK," he said. "I always felt that I was at least his equal."</p>

<p>Robert Douglas was born in Glasgow in 1939. He lived in a tenement in the Maryhill area of the city until he was fifteen at which point he joined the boys service. After completing his national service he worked in a variety of jobs including working in a coal mine, hotels, the prison service and the electricity board.</p>
<p>He published his first book at the age of 66. 'Night Song of the Last Tram' is a wonderfully colourful and deeply poignant memoir of growing up in a ‘single end’ - one room in a Glasgow tenement - during and immediately after the Second World War. Although young Robert Douglas’s life was blighted by the cruel if sporadic presence of his father, it was equally blessed by the love of his mother, Janet. While the story of their life together is in some ways very sad, it is also filled with humorous and happy memories of a Glasgow of trams and tenements that has long since disappeared.</p>
<p>"If my father had been killed in North Africa or Italy during the Second World War, I know that for the rest of my life I would have looked at the few photographs of him and mourned our lost relationship. Unfortunately, he survived and came home"</p>

<p>Co-written by Bob Marley and N.G. Williams, aka King Sporty. The song recounted the true story of four post-Civil War regiments of the U.S. Army - the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry. These units were composed of black privates under the command of white brass, who fought for a quarter century against the Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Ute and Sioux. In the end, fourteen key black campaigners, whom the Indians had dubbed "buffalo soldiers," were awarded the Medal of Honor as part of a public relations move to justify and glorify the genocide of Native Americans, underlining the U.S. government's policy of manifest destiny. Such were the ploys that, then as now, comprised the politics of neutralization.</p>

<p>The <b>Super Expander 64</b> was a cartridge-based extension to the built in <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASIC_e4ac.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a> V2 interpreter of the then hugely popular <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a>: Since the 64 was developed in a hurry, Commodore simply adapted the BASIC V2 from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_PET_38f2.html" title="Commodore PET">PET</a> line of computers and the <a href="../../../v/i/c/VIC_20_98de.html" title="VIC 20">VIC 20</a> for their new machine, with no support for the advanced sound and graphics capabilities of the 64. To make use of the advanced hardware, BASIC programmers needed to memorize hardware addresses and "POKE" commands directly to the memory-mapped devices. Later 8-bit systems from Commodore had BASIC interpreters enhanced to support the special hardware, and with the Super Expander 64 cartridge, Commodore 64 users could "retrofit" their machine with a BASIC to match the hardware capabillities.</p>
<p>The extra code was mapped into the "lower cartidge" 8 kilobytes area at $8000-$9FFF, thus reducing the 38911 bytes for user programs by said 8K.</p>

<p>After initializing the screen for "high-resolution" (320 x 200 monochrome pixels) or multicolor (160 wide x 200 pixels in four colors) graphics with the GRAPHIC command, one could draw lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, boxes and more using the DRAW, CIRCLE, and BOX commands. PAINT would "flood-fill" an area enclosed by lines, e.g. the interior of a CIRCLE or BOX. A CHAR command was used to "print" characters from the character generator ROM onto the bitmap graphics screen. SSHAPE and GSHAPE would store the contents of a rectangular area of the high-res graphics into a string variable, and GSHAPE would "stamp" it back onto the screen at arbitrary locations. Such "graphics-in-a-string" could also be used to transfer something drawn on the hi-res screen into one of the eight sprite patterns.</p>

<p>Besides a range of commands to initialize, position and move sprites (or Movable Object Blocks as Commodore called them; hardware-supported graphic elements that could move freely on the screen independently of other graphics and text on the screen), Super Expander had a built in tool to edit the pattern of 8 sprites (called upon with the SPRDEF command), either in high-res (24 x 21 pixels) or multicolor (12 wide x 21 pixels) mode.</p>
<p>There was even a way of implementing "interrupts" in the BASIC program if two sprites collided, if a sprite collided with other graphics and/or text on the screen, or if an attached light pen was activated. A COLINT command set up the interrupt, pointing to the beginning BASIC line number of the "interrupt handler", which had to end in a RETURN statement (part of standard, unexpanded BASIC) in order to transfer control back to the interrupted, "mainline" part of the program.</p>

<p>Playing a sequence of musical notes was hooked onto the standard BASIC "PRINT" command by the use of a special "control character", much like the cursor control, color changes and other control characters. E.g. PRINT CHR$(6);"CDEFGAB" would play a rising scale. Commands like TIME and TUNE was used to set the playback tempo and the timbre of the note sequence.</p>
<p>A "quirk" of this feature is that by typing the special control character (by pressing CTRL + F) along with a quote mark, then deleting the quote mark, the machine would "play" whatever was typed while editing the program; hit the G key, and the machine would play a "Pling!" with the pich of a G note...!</p>

<p>Functions like RJOY, RPEN and RPOT would read the state of a connected joystick, light pen, or analog "paddle". In combination with the sprite-motion-related commands, it only took a single line of BASIC code to make a sprite move in the direction indicated by a connected joystick.</p>

<p>A KEY command was available, which would set up the four function keys on the 64's keyboard to "enter" an arbitrary string. By default, these keys were set up to type commands like RUN, LIST, SPRDEF, GRAPHICS and others, but the user could change this using the KEY command in either direct mode or under program control.</p>

<p>All the versions of BASIC on Commodore's 8-bit machines used a scheme of replacing BASIC keywords with single-byte code -- e.g. the word "PRINT" would be substituted by a single byte value, or <i>token</i>, rather than the five ASCII-codes for the five letters in the word. Super Expander added more commands than this system could acommodate, so a system of two-byte tokens for the new commands was implementet.</p>
<p>Because of a quirk in the BASIC interpreter (the handling of the "THEN-part" of an IF/THEN construct didn't jump through a vector in RAM but instead took a direct JuMP to the standard, unexpanded BASIC command decoding routine), IF/THEN statements needed to have an extra colon (:) inserted right after the THEN keyword, if the following command was one of Super Expander's non-standard BASIC keywords. For instance, IF (condition) THEN DRAW ... would yield a ?SYNTAX ERROR message — one had to write it like IF (condition) THEN<b>:</b>DRAW ... — note the colon between THEN and the Super Expander-added command DRAW.</p>

<p>Two years ago, a green-eyed brunette named Josette put her foot down and implored her parents to get her an agent because she wanted to do a commercial.</p>
<p>Within two auditions she was on her way to a busy career in front of the camera. Soon, this 9-year-old was seen by millions of people worldwide promoting everything from toys &amp; foods to Mortgage and Oil companies. She loved hard work and was determined to do things in the first take.</p>
<p>After two years of modeling and commercial shoots and voice work, Josette wanted to step up to film, so her mother signed her up with Film &amp; TV Kids Talent Agent, Rocky Stone of Rocky's Kidz. Soon after signing with Rocky Stone, Josette booked a Disney Movie. She is currently filming in Toronto. She has the lead Tap dancer role of Alison in 'Molly: An American Girl Doll' a TV movie for Warner Bros. (2006) (TV). You might say that Josette has tap danced her way to this role but she also excels in jazz, ballet and lyrical/theatre dance. Until acting became a focus, dance had been Josette's passion.</p>
<p>Of course, Josette was ready for her busy life before the camera. She has many awards in public speaking and dance. As well, Josette is a junior level figure skater. But, she's also pretty terrific at swimming, singing and modeling.</p>
<p>This young actress is ambidextrous which has always been a bonus on set as she is very coordinated. Josette can do most tasks equally well with both hands as well as most dance/skating tricks leading with either side.</p>
<p>When she's not working on set she is studying hard at school to maintain her 'A' average.</p>

<p>Two years ago, a green-eyed brunette named Josette put her foot down and implored her parents to get her an agent because she wanted to do a commercial.</p>
<p>Within two auditions she was on her way to a busy career in front of the camera. Soon, this 9-year-old was seen by millions of people worldwide promoting everything from toys &amp; foods to Mortgage and Oil companies. She loved hard work and was determined to do things in the first take.</p>
<p>After two years of modeling and commercial shoots and voice work, Josette wanted to step up to film, so her mother signed her up with Film &amp; TV Kids Talent Agent, Rocky Stone of Rocky's Kidz. Soon after signing with Rocky Stone, Josette booked a Disney Movie. She is currently filming in Toronto. She has the lead Tap dancer role of Alison in 'Molly: An American Girl Doll' a TV movie for Warner Bros. (2006) (TV). You might say that Josette has tap danced her way to this role but she also excels in jazz, ballet and lyrical/theatre dance. Until acting became a focus, dance had been Josette's passion.</p>
<p>Of course, Josette was ready for her busy life before the camera. She has many awards in public speaking and dance. As well, Josette is a junior level figure skater. But, she's also pretty terrific at swimming, singing and modeling.</p>
<p>This young actress is ambidextrous which has always been a bonus on set as she is very coordinated. Josette can do most tasks equally well with both hands as well as most dance/skating tricks leading with either side.</p>

<p><b>Starting out</b></p>
<p>zmarzian.com was just another creation in the crazy mind of Jacek Zmarz around April 2006. Just like much of his other work, it quite random, or in his words 'zmarzified'. It features content, such as flash animations and games, made by himself, and his friends. Jacek's two frinds, and fellow flash authors, chaz and fuzz, whom he met on the <a href="http://newgrounds.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://newgrounds.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> forums.</p>
<p><b>Zmarzian now</b></p>
<p>even though its still a new site, zmarzian continues gathering content. Inspirations from sites that sterted off small, such as <a href="http://newgrounds.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://newgrounds.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and <a href="http://afro-ninja.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://afro-ninja.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> it will keep coming up with the goods for years to come.</p>

The San Bernardino Railroad Historical Society (SBRHS) was formed in 1981 to restore former Santa Fe steam locomotive 3751, and is composed of hundreds of individuals interested in the heritage and preservation of “The Steam Era”. Accountants, artists, small business owners, dentists, designers, engineers, railroaders, retired railroaders, pharmacists, painters, truck drivers, mechanics, welders, politicians, and lawyers all work side by side with the same goals in mind.</p>
<p>The original primary focus of the SBRHS was the complete restoration and operation of 3751, with a secondary focus of collecting historically relevant pieces of Santa Fe heritage for preservation. With the primary task of restoration completed in December 1991, the organization has now turned its focus to two tasks; 1) To locate and construct a museum to house the locomotive and support cars and present the collected artifacts of railroad history, and 2) promote railroad safety and education through a new Educational Outreach Program, which began in 2004.</p>

<p>The <b>ClanGnome</b> is a bot on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.net.html" title="Battle.net">Battle.net</a> that is designed to collect data on Clan Channels. The ClanGnome was created in May of 2004 by Spht. At first, the project roamed Battle.net, collecting statistics on various Clan Channels, and organizing the data into raw data tables. Soon, however, many players on Battle.net began to wonder what the ClanGnome was. In response, Spht made anouncements, telling the curious players what the ClanGnome was designed to do and presented the raw data tables the ClanGnome had collected. A Two years after the creation of the ClanGnome, Spht release a new and improved version of the ClanGnome onto Battle.net. Spht Also created a Website for the ClanGnome so the public could view the data it collected. The ClanGnome operates on the Battle.net <a href="../../../w/a/r/WarCraft_III_fea4.html" title="WarCraft III">WarCraft III</a> Realms Azeroth, Lordaeron, and Northrend, and is a member of Clan Spht. The bot is able to locate new WarCraft III Clans, and thus, new Clan Channels, by located members of those Clans in other Clan Channels or in The Void. The ClanGnome takes statistics on the number of people in a Clan Channel, the number of WarCraft III members in a Clan Channel, the level of WarCraft III members in a Clan Channel, the number of Non-WarCraft III people in a Clan Channel, and other, similar items. Spht is also the creator of WebBot, SphtBotv3, and EternalChat.</p>

<p>Karl Jäger was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland on September 20th, 1888. He joined the National Socialist Party in 1923 and then later joined the SS in 1932. He was assigned to Ludwigsburg and then Ravensburg, Germany in 1935, and to Münster in 1938, where he was named head of the local office of the Internal Security Services (SD). During the invasion of the Netherlands on May 10th, 1940, Jäger was named commander of Einsatzkommando 3, a unit of Einsatzgruppe A.</p>
<p>From July 1941 until September 1943 he was assigned commander of the Internal Security Services (SD) Einsatzkommando 3 in Kaunas, Lithuania. During this time, reports detailing calculated acts of mass murder where routinely submitted to his superiors. Some of these reports survived the war and are collectively referred to as the “Jäger Report”.</p>
<p>Re-assigned back to Germany near the end of 1943, he was assigned commander of the Internal Security Services (SD) in Reichenberg in the region of the Sudetenland.</p>
<p>Jäger scaped capture by the Allies when the war ended, assumed a false identity, and was able to assimilate back into society as an agriculturist until his report was discovered in March 1959. Arrested and charged with his crimes, Karl Jäger committed suicide in prison while he was awaiting trial in June 1959.</p>
<p>Among all Nazi documents detailing calculated acts of mass murder and other atrocities, the "Jäger Report" is one of the most horrifying. Written by SS-Standartenführer (Colonel) Karl Jäger, commander of one of the "Einsatzkommandos" (EK 3), it provides a very detailed account of the murderous rampage of this "special squad" in Nazi-occupied Lithuania. Jäger was instrumental in the brutal and systematic destruction of the Jewish Community of Lithuania.</p>

<p>Jim Rage was a character from the hit 90's cartoon "The Tick".</p>
<p>Jim Rage was a government special agent tasked with destroying The mustache, but after 15 years of failure his funding was cut. He didn't bother to tell his team, Project Shave, that they were no longer a legitimate government operation, and so Holly, Kitty, and Crystal continued to hunt the mustache with Jim.</p>

<p>The Avalon Ballroom was founded by Chet Helms and The Family Dog in 1966. It was at the corner of Sutter and Van Ness, about a block from Bush Street in San Francisco. Chet Helms and the hippie business group known as the Family Dog with offices down Van Ness elsewhere served as impresarios for the ballroom. The Avalon usually had two bands performing during the evening beginning about 9:00 PM and closing when things wound down. Many of the local San Francisco bands, such as Quicksilver Messenger Service and The Steve Miller Band served as the back up bands, as did the early Moby Grape, to Headliners such as The Thirteenth Floor Elevators, the Butterfield Blues Band, and especially the band Helms himself organized in and around the phenomenally talented singer and performer Janis Joplin, in Spring of 1966, Big Brother and the Holding Company. Janis performed in June, 1967, with Big Brother on several weekends.</p>
<p>Bands were frequently booked to perform at the Avalon Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Extraordinary posters were produced by the famed psychedelic artists, such as Mouse, advertising each event. Among the very first bands were The Thirteenth Floor Elevators with the incomparable lead guitar and singer Roky Erickson, famous for his head shaking yells ending a stanza or musical phrase. Tommy Hall and Roky wrote much of the lyrics and Roky and the whole band developed the music in live jam and during local Austin and out of town appearances in Houston at Ma Maison during summer and fall 1965. Tommy, and occasionally his wife Clementine both, sang, and Tommy played the electric jug to the rhythms of Stacy Sutherland's base and several drummers, among them Danny Galindo on their first album.</p>
<p>The Avalon was the first two floors of a multi-story building and had a balcony 2d floor surrounding the lower floor dance area in front of the elevated stage where musicians performed. The doors were in a corner foyer which opened directly on both sides of the corner Sutter &amp; Van Ness. The address of the Avalon was 1268 Sutter Street. The Family Dog also maintained a hippie residential house about 1812 Bush, just in the first block across Van Ness where Chet and his friends visited frequently and put up guests from Austin and other places. Except for the about 8-10 feet surrounding 2d floor balcony on all sides except that of the stage, the Avalon was open from the dance floor to about 25-30 feet, corresponding to the top of the stage area. The size was not so large as the Winterland or Fillmore ballrooms, which Helms had used before Bill Graham violated their partnership agreements, but was the size that could hold 400 to 500 and approximately 80-100 feet wide and 160 to 180 feet long inside including the stage which was perhaps 40-50 feet wide with non-stage walls of 25 to 20 feet on each side. The dance floor was usually filled with several hundred dancers, mostly in pairs but a few singles. The light show, always present and generally delightful in artistry and movement, was created by several different light companies locally retained and varying from time to time. Those who wanted to listen to the music and watch the light show and musicians only stood around the lower floor walls and in the balcony jutting out from the second floor.</p>
<p>The Avalon was a quite popular tribal, hippie gathering place of celebration and music involvement, lasting until about November of 1968, when the lease was lost and Chet Helms moved on to other genres.--Jack Futch209.184.108.111 20:39, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

DC SECTION</p>
<p>The scenic and popular Rock Creek Trail winds 25 miles from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. to Lake Needwood Park in Montgomery County, Md.</p>
<p>On weekends and holidays, the National Park Service closes Beach Drive to through motor vehicle traffic from Broad Branch Road to the Maryland line (a few stretches remain open to shared use with cars).</p>
<p>The Algonquin Indians, the area's original settlers, fished from Rock Creek, hunted bison and deer, raised crops and quarried quartzite for weapons and tools in what is now Rock Creek Park. Later, European settlers built grist mills and a saw mill on the creek, where farmers brought corn, wheat, buckwheat and rye to be ground into flour or meal. Today the park and trail provide a refreshing escape to a more natural setting without leaving the city.</p>

<p>Japanese author, Fujisawa Shuhei (1927-1997) has published over fifty books, including both full-length novels and short story anthologies through the course of his lifetime. The focus of his writing is historical fiction. Over 23 million of his paperbacks have been printed. Before he was an author, he was a journalist. His work has been adapted for both television and film. Two recent full-length films that have been based on his work are The Twilight Samurai (2002) and The Hidden Blade (2004). The Twilight Samurai (2002) swept the 2003 Japanese Academy Awards and won an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, was in part based on the title story, The Bamboo Sword. In 1973, Shuhei received the acclaimed Naoki Award for Ansatsu No Nenrin (Annals of Assassination), establishing himself as a leading author of period stories. He would go on to win six further prestigious literary awards.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Sword and Other Samurai Tales, a collection of eight short stories, is a work of historical fiction. The stories are set in Edo-period Japan (1603-1867) and depict the lives of people from all walks of life, but revolve mainly around samurai characters. The Edo Period (1603-1867) was a period of over 200 years of lasting peace in Japanese history. This historical period was full of political upheaval and intrigue, rivalry and betrayals. During this period, the samurai struggled to retain their sense of pride and meaning in life as they attempt to settle into mundane jobs and family life. This struggle can be seen throughout The Bamboo Sword and Other Samurai Tales and other works by Fujisawa Shuhei.</p>
<p>Shuhei focused on the humanity of his characters in his stories. Through his stories, the reader comes to understand Japanese history and culture in a more real sense.</p>

<p>"Apple-pie bed" is a prank, known by this name in the UK. It requires a bed that is made so that the person intending to sleep in it would have to get between two layers of sheets (as opposed to just lie on the sheet and pull a blanket over himself or herself). The bed becomes an apple-pie bed when the prankster folds the sheets so that the victim is unable to climb between the sheets, or at least unable to stretch his or her legs because the space between the two sheets is too short.</p>
<p>The name may be a corruption of the French <i>nappe pliée</i> ("folded sheet").</p>
<p>The same prank is known as "short sheeting" in the US.</p>

<p>Kambiz Fathollahzadeh Aghdam, or usually known as Kambiz Aghdam is a 15 year old half english half iranian footballer currently playing for Culdrose FC in cornwall and is hoping of making a move to Plymouth Atgyle, but many clubs are said to be chasing the 15 year old. and after been seen playing in a tournament in holland has been touted by Marco van basten to be the next Ruud van Nistelrooy but he has said to be more of a complete player, these include his imense passing ability and his dribbling skills adding to his clinical finishing. This is proven because in the 2005-06 season whilst playing for culdrose FC in cornwall he scored 28 goals overall in 14 games this coming to a staggering 2 goals a game, this the reason for Plymouth trying to snap him up quickly. He is set to be playing for culdrose in a tournament in Holland again and is wanting to show the people what he can do, a quote from one of his interviews with Plymouth, 'i know i can do it, i know i can be the best, but ive just got to prove it'. overall in 5 seasons with culdorse he has managed to score an amazing 153 goals, this coming to and average of 30 goals a season (each season being 14 games long.) His goalscoring record was proven once again this season, scoring 18 goals in 7 games for Truro School. His coach at Culdrose has quoted Kambiz as being like a ballet dancer when he's on the ball because he is so light footed. Kambiz Aghdam is hoping to show the world what he can do in the future, and just watch out... just remember that name, Kambiz Aghdam</p>

<p>Alcalde Fray Antonio</p>
<p>Fecha de Nacimiento(Defunción): España (1701-1792)</p>
<p>Nombre: Alcalde Fray Antonio Disciplina: Humanismo y religión Lugar y Fecha de Nacimiento: Cigales, España 1701-1792) Distinción: Varias Sinópsis Biográfica: Fray Antonio Alcalde y Barriga (1701-1792)Humanismo y religión El día 15 de marzo de 1701 nació el ilustrísimo señor don Fray Antonio Alcalde y Barriga en la villa de Cigales, del obispado de Valladolid, en la Provincia de Castilla la Vieja. Sus padres fueron el señor don José Alcalde y la señora doña Isabel Barriga, ambos de humilde cuna y de muy escasos recursos pecuniarios, aunque dotados de mucha virtudes, honradez e ingenuidad.Muy joven, aún sintiéndose con inquebrantable vocación para la vida monástica se decidió a entrar en la Orden del Canónigo de Osma. En 1717 cuando sólo contaba con dieciseis años, tomó el hábito dominicano en el insigne convento de San Pablo, donde profesó después de haber hecho los estudios correspondientes a la carrera que abrazaba. Fue enseguida lector de artes, maestro de estudiantes y lector de sagrada teología en varios conventos de su orden, por espacio de veintiseis años ininterrumpidos. El 12 de diciembre de 1771 llegó a Guadalajara como el XXII Obispo de la Diócesis Novogalaica a darle el impulso definitivo a la fundación de la Real y Literaria Universidad de Guadalajara después de un siglo de gestiones para lograr su establecimiento. Interpuso su influencia ante el rey de España para que se aplicase al patrimonio universitario los bienes de las temporalidades de la extinguida Compañía de Jesús, incluido el templo y el edificio del antiguo Colegio de Santo Tomás.Donó 60, 000 pesos para cumplir su promesa de dotación de las cátedras y estimuló al cabildo catedralicio para que aportara los 10, 000 pesos restantes necesarios para la fundación. El patrimonio universitario original e indispensable para lograr la fundación fue de 95, 298 pesos. El señor Alcalde aportó casi las dos terceras partes del importe total.Tras vencer las últimas dificultades, el 18 de noviembre de 1791, en el Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial, el rey Carlos IV otorgó la cédula real de la fundación de la Universidad de Guadalajara; con gran júbilo de sus habitantes y en especial de fray Antonio Alcalde, quien de común acuerdo con el presidente de la Real Audiencia, Jacobo Ugarte y Loyola, designaron como primer rector de la Universidad, al doctor José María Gómez y Villaseñor.A pesar de la celeridad de los preparativos para la apertura de la Universidad, el 7 de agosto de 1792 sobrevino el fallecimiento de su fundador, fray Antonio Alcalde, lo que provocó gran consternación en la incipiente comunidad universitaria.En 1786 fundador ya de numerosas iniciativas de carácter humanitario se encargó de impulsar el proyecto del Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (Ahora Viejo Hospital Civil).El 26 de febrero de 1787 el ayuntamiento cedió gratuitamente el terreno para tan importante obra y el 6 de marzo se puso en marcha su construcción.En 1792, un poco antes de su fallecimiento, fray Antonio Alcalde, consagró el Nuevo Hospital "A la Humanidad Doliente", practicando él personalmente, una curación y que para constancia se labraron unas piedras que removidas de su sitio original, ahora se encuentran a un lado del corredor de ingreso del hospital.La muerte de fray Antonio Alcalde impidió que viera su obra terminada, siendo hasta abril de 1794 cuando ésta se culminó.</p>

<p>In so many words, "El Jefe" can be described as the man. He rolls with a legit crew consisting of the mouselike nitro, the noble juice, Ivan, leet, and mucho more. They go to smokey bones and mad ish like that. But to fully understand the real El Jefe, you must first understand his past man. Jefe born in South Dakota on November 8th and bread to fight for the red, white, and blue. His mother was a prizefighter and his dad delivered mail. An odd combination if i do say so myself. They spawned El Jefe and hes been legit ever since. As a young boy he would walk around aimlessly all day playing wiffle ball and rolling with mad heads. He grew up to become a roller disco champion of the tri-county and now lives in a small shanti brewing his own ale and doin whatever he pleases. Thus the everliving legend of the El Jefe.</p>
