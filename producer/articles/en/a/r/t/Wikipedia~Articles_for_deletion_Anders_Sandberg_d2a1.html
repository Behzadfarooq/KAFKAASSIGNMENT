<li><b>Keep</b> Sandberg is a fairly significant name in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>--as mentioned in the entry, he was chairman of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Transhumanist_Association_755a.html" title="World Transhumanist Association">World Transhumanist Association</a>, and <a href="http://jetpress.org/volume14/bostrom.html" class="external text" title="http://jetpress.org/volume14/bostrom.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> on the history of transhumanist thought says (in section 4) that he was also a major contributer to one of the organizations's founding documents, which laid out the ideas behind a more "academically respectable" form of transhumanism. Sandberg is also quoted a number of times in the book <i>The Spike</i> by <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Broderick_6785.html" title="Damien Broderick">Damien Broderick</a>, and in <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Cyborg_8adf.html" title="Citizen Cyborg">Citizen Cyborg</a></i> by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hughes_9136.html" title="James Hughes">James Hughes</a> (Hughes' book also has a long section on the World Transhumanist Association and its founding documents, and the WTA is the main group for those who support his philosophy of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_transhumanism.html" title="Democratic transhumanism">Democratic transhumanism</a>). <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 17:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> He is clearly not yet notable as a scientist--5 peer reviewed papers in specialized journals , and still a postdoc. <s>He is not mentioned in the WP transhumanism article</s>--and they list quite a number of people over several centuries as their founders. Nor is he listed as one of the two founders in the article on the Society. It might be enlightening to look at his web site. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In response to DGG's comment above, Sandberg is in fact mentioned in the "History" section of the wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">transhumanism</a> article, which says "A number of similar definitions have been collected by Anders Sandberg, an academic and prominent transhumanist." Looking back, it appears this sentence has been there since May 5 2006. He is also mentioned on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_transhumanists.html" title="List of transhumanists">list of transhumanists</a> article, one of only 54 entries. While I agree he is not notable as a scientist, I think most people with a significant level of familiarity with transhumanism would agree he is a notable transhumanist. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 03:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC) You are quite correct that he is mentioned, right in the middle.

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable within the Transhumanist movement, and despite his relative youth he has been well known for a while in those circles. I first heard about him when he and other transhumanists were interviewed in an issue of the excellent but sadly defuct <a href="http://hackvan.com/brain/msg00070.html|" class="external text" title="http://hackvan.com/brain/msg00070.html|" rel="nofollow"><i>21*C</i> magazine</a> quite a few years back.

<dd>Yes, try the Google Scholar search and you'll see that his few papers are rarely cited. Not notable. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 05:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But no one is claiming he is notable for his academic career! He is notable because of his position in the transhumanist movement, the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Anders+Sandberg%22+transhumanist&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Anders+Sandberg%22+transhumanist&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">Google book search</a> shows he is quoted or discussed in a significant number of books about transhumanism, including <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Kurzweil_7f6c.html" title="Ray Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s influential book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Singularity_is_Near_b6e3.html" title="The Singularity is Near">The Singularity is Near</a></i>.

<dd>I am very familiar with the Transhumanist movement, both with its movers and with its mover-wannabes. Anders is a wannabe. He has not done anything notable as yet that merits a Wikipedia page. Maybe some day he will do or write something significant, but he hasn't yet. Anyone who researches the matter sufficiently will very likely concur. I'm still waiting for anyone to show me anything he's done that's notable. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 06:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What do you define as "notable", exactly? There are a number of prominent transhumanists who haven't written books on the subject (Nick Bostrom, Robin Hanson, Max More, etc.)...do you have any criteria for notability besides writing books or founding transhumanist groups? I'd say he's notable as a thinker and commentator, someone whose thoughts and opinions are valued by other prominent transhumanists, as evidenced for example by how frequently he's quoted in books by others such as Kurzweil and Hughes, and by the fact that he is often invited to speak at transhumanist events or collaborate on group efforts such as the founding documents of the WTA mentioned above. The opinion of his peers should count for more than the opinions of us wiki editors, I think. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 07:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like I stated at the top of this page, Anders Sandberg is not notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" rel="nofollow">What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 08:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The central criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is that "the person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person", and "This criterion includes published works in all forms". Sandberg has certainly been the subject of a number of published interviews, such as <a href="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/2006/11/interview_with_1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/2006/11/interview_with_1.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> from German television, or <a href="http://www.bmezine.com/news/people/A10101/anders.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bmezine.com/news/people/A10101/anders.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> from the <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_%28website%29_cf0b.html" title="BME (website)">BME ezine</a>. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 18:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Why</i> do you say it's not notable? Do you disagree that Sandberg has been the primary subject of non-trivial published works?

<dd>What I was asking was <i>why</i> you think the interviews I linked to above don't qualify according to the stated criteria. For example, isn't the <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_%28website%29_cf0b.html" title="BME (website)">BME ezine</a> a reliable source on the topic of mody modification? I'd also add <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19125666.000-human-enhancement-beyond-evolution.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19125666.000-human-enhancement-beyond-evolution.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from the magazine <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>--it's an interview with both Sandberg and Nick Bostrom, but it seems to me that when there are only two subjects they could both reasonably be called a "primary subject" of the interview. And <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/media.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/media.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> from the Future of Humanity Institute mentions in its "interviews and reports section" an "Interview for the Swedish youth radio program "Stjärnstopp" about life extension, cryonics and identity, Anders Sandberg" (more info <a href="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/2006/09/eudoxa_om_kryon.html" class="external text" title="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/2006/09/eudoxa_om_kryon.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), along with a few others. <a href="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html" rel="nofollow">This page</a> from Eudoxa links to several more (see highlighted version <a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:7zrTYSU-mO4J:www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html+%22Anders+Sandberg%22+site:http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" class="external text" title="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:7zrTYSU-mO4J:www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html+%22Anders+Sandberg%22+site:http://www.eudoxa.se/content/archives/news/topic_interviews/index.html&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">here</a> to find the ones involving Sandberg), although in most cases the language is not english so it's hard to tell to what degree he was the primary interview subject. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 23:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>(un-indenting) The criterion stated in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is reliability, not "respectability" at the level of peer-reviewed journals like Nature or Science. (and as I mentioned before, no one is claiming Sandberg is notable as a scientist, so if that's what you're suggesting it's a strawman--what would <i>you</i> consider a reliable source on the subject of transhumanism?) TV news programs and magazines like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a> would in my understanding be considered reliable, see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, and I think a notable ezine like <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_%28website%29_cf0b.html" title="BME (website)">BME</a> would also be considered reliable in its specific subject area of body modification, although this one might be more of a gray area. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 00:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Significant ideological contributions to the Transhumanist movement internationally. Very significant for the Swedish Transhumanist movement. Numerus publications in Swedish newspapers and magazines. Several apperances in Swedish television on Transhumanist subjects. Not a notable Scientist but then his research is very narrow, not many other who write papers with in that field at all. Also longtime Science editor in the Youth Scientist radio in Stockholm. <a href="http://www.radioungaforskare.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.radioungaforskare.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> High impact within the transhumanist movement, and a significant contributor to the visibility of transhumanist ideas. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiexile_5265.html" title="User:Michiexile">Michiexile</a> 22:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Beside the arguments above we have the fact that Anders Sandberg is very often in TV, like scientific programs national Swedish channel SVT and the channel Kunskapskanalen. Fabben 05:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete - Sock-puppets and meat-puppets notwithstanding, Sandberg is completely non-notable as a neuroscientist</b>, which is what his Wikipedia page seems to focus on. If he has some role in Swedish Transhumanism, then his bio should be just over that, though this does not seem notable either. Seriously, if my uncle played a role in Uganda's Transhumanism scene, would that merit a Wikipedia bio? Hardly.</li>
