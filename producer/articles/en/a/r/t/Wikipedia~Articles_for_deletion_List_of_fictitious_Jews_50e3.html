<li><b>keep</b> although it should be a category probably, this is the kind of thing that people would actually want to look up on some occasions. in my mind the "cruft" excuse NEVER outweighs the need for wikipedia to be a reference. All the "cruft" types were created as guidelines for things that are random collections of facts (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). this list can help a researcher narrow down potential subjects. if for no other reason keep under <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a>.</li>
<li>Oy vey. It's hard to know where to draw the notability line on ethnicity lists. Some are obviously notable. But this one... I guess I'll give it a weak <b>keep</b>.&#160;:-) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 16:16, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and remove any speculative content. The war on cruft has its place, but the rule should not be that any article that starts with "List" is removed as cruft. A list of this sort can be an extremely useful reference for a broad group of people concerned with comparing various depictions of Jews in fiction. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 17:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above, we don't need to delete every list on Wikipedia, and this one certainly has encyclopedic value. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 18:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all lists are cruft. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as completely idiosyncratic non-topic. We have no article on Fictitious Jews... because fictitious Jewishness is not an encyclopedic concept. If you don't agree, then try writing an article on Fictitious Jews. In general, there shouldn't be a "list of X" unless there is an article on X, and the article should be written first, the list begin as a part of the article, and only be broken out when it becomes too big. As is, alas, usual for so many lists, <b>none of the entries are sourced</b> and the article therefore completely fails to meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. Is this a vacuous criticism? No. Picking one at random, the entry for Leopold Bloom has no citation. It's linked to a Wikipedia article, but, of course, Wikipedia articles are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">considered reliable sources</a>. And if we look at the article for <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_Bloom_cc29.html" title="Leopold Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a>, not only does it not cite a source for Bloom's being Jewish, it <b>does not even say that he is Jewish.</b> What it does say is that he is "the only son of Rudolf Virag (a Hungarian Jew from Szombathely who had converted to Protestantism and later committed suicide) and Ellen, an Irish Catholic." That might make him Jewish according to the definition used by... oops, never mind, I don't want to trigger Godwin's law... but not by most definitions. So, the list is unreliable, and due to failure to cite sources there's no quick or easy way to sort out the valid entries from the invalid ones. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. We have an article on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>. This list is a sublist of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Jews_93a3.html" title="Lists of Jews">Lists of Jews</a>. It would appear your argument fails on the absence of related article theory. It seems to me the rest of the argument made here is that the article needs a lot of attention. I imagine that may be true. That's what the cleanup or cleanup-verify template is for. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 00:41, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists of people based on their real or alleged ethnicity or religion are bad enough, as they serve no other purpose than to boost the confidence of people identifying with that ethnicity or religion, but to maintain a list of fictitious persons, where the "proof" in most cases is only their last name (which, in the case of Jews, is often a very dubious proof), is totally meaningless. The fact that there are already equally stupid lists for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_Catholics_f181.html" title="List of fictional Catholics">fictional Catholics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hispanic_superheroes_dfde.html" title="List of Hispanic superheroes">Hispanic superheroes</a> doesn't justify this list. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 16:36, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Since when does Wikipedia delete articles and lists that are fun and useful to people, especially pertaining to a certain ethnic group, just because others don't like the list or the ethnic group? If you don't like the list, don't read it. If you don't think it's useful, don't use it. If you think such lists pertaining to different nationalities and ethnic groups are "silly" -- then don't read them. A lot of people enjoy them and find them useful. I was sorry to lose my separate list of Jewish SuperHeroes, which was merged with this list. But this list is just fine.Myst3 19:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
