<p>Appears to be an article about a non-notable person. Google doesn't show much on the individual either, and it almost seems like an attempt to legitimize the individuals work/business. Locke Cole 17:32, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is it verifiable that he has not spoken with God? You keep speaking of notability and your basing this on a Google search?! A google search for Daniel R. Jennings gives 2,040,000 results, but I'm sure you checked them all to verify that this Daniel R. Jennings was not one of 2,040,000. How would a Google search justify notability for ordinary people with common names such as us? Perhaps if we were thieves from Final fantasy 6 our namesakes alone would justify notability. --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.8.html" title="User:64.12.116.8">64.12.116.8</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.8.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.8">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.8_ece3.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.8">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not understand why people keep saying that Daniel Jennings is not notable. He has preached in three countries and is currently working to organize a crusade in Torreon, Mexico with the Protestant Allianza. In three weeks his newest book will be advertised in Charisma Magazine which has an estimated readership of over 500,000. What does it take to be notable? I believe that there are some ulterior motives at work here. Locke Cole for some reason seems to be on a personal crusade against this wikipedia entry. So, let’s look at Locke Cole. Locke Cole takes his name from a Final Fantasy VI video game character. Anyone who has studied Final Fantasy knows that it is all based upon witchcraft and magic and very anti-Christian. That’s just the truth of the matter. Could it be that Locke Cole has targeted this website simply because its subject was a born-again Christian? The website hadn’t been up for five hours before Locke Cole began his attack. He didn’t even give me time to finish it to where I was satisfied with it before he was trying to have it deleted. I would like to know why he was so quick to try and stop this website from going up. And secondly, I would also like to know why a 25 year old man (Locke Cole according to a link from his user page) would put so much energy into this. He even went to the extent of setting up a special section at his user page against this entry. Why so much trouble? It’s just a dictionary entry. It’s not the end of the world if an international lecturer and author gets his name in wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevdanj_86bd.html" title="User:Revdanj">Revdanj</a> 20:00, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, I didn't have anything to do with the vandalism and I am disappointed that someone would jump to the conclusion that I did that and even go to the point of saying that I was not a true Christian. I don't know who 164.106.51.174 is but it is not me. At any rate I have lost all respect for Wikipedia. The whole concept of Wikipedia turns it into nothing more than a site that allows gossip to be published as fact and popularity to be the determining factor in what is important and what is not. It is a sad commentary when a video game character is given more value than a human being who has achieved something that most have not. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevdanj_86bd.html" title="User:Revdanj">Revdanj</a> 16:48, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't appreciate being accused of being the same person that this article is about or of being a vandal from Danville, VA. I am not in Danville so that proves that I didn't do it but since the person the article is about comes from Danville it would only make sense that he has supporters there. Secondly, it now seems obvious to me that you have been trying to get this article deleted without even reading it because the article clearly states <b>IN THE FIRST LINE</b> that this person is living in Oklahoma City.

As for the Oklahoma bit, the article says his <i>business</i> is in Oklahoma, it doesn't say <i>he</i> is in Oklahoma. The article ends with him returning to Danville, VA.

<li><b>Comment</b> What people don't seem to understand is that Locke Cole or any of the other users who voted to delete this article doesn't have a personal vendetta against Daniel R. Jennings.
