<li><b>Keep</b> What is this all about? Who's to say that the LPO doesn't exist? I hate every single one of them, but they're definitely real. What does Yggdrasil know anyways?? What kind of name is that? I was in Calgary a few weeks ago where I understand they've just opened up a new chapter and believe me, I wish I had never found out about them. I am a fairly religious person, so one Sunday after church I'm waiting to cross the street, and this little old nun was having some trouble. Being the nice guy that I am, I decided to help her accross the street. There were a few other people crossing the street as well as it was a busy service. I'll never forget the guy walking next to me. He was wearing a blue jersey with I think "Chang" or something written on it. (I later found out it was an Everton Football Club jersey (the scouse accent was unmistakenable thinking about it now) which makes me wonder where the last line of the description came from..... Yggdrasil probably added it if he really is a member of a rival crew) Anyways, we get across the street and the man (I'd guess 6'3, brown hair, fairly big guy in general)grabbed the little old lady and ran. I tried chasing after him, but believe me, I'm not much of a physical specimen. I keep looking for them when I hear screams from behind a building. Awful screams that I'll never forget. It took me another few minutes to find where they came from, and when I got there, all I saw was the nun's black robe. I never saw the little old lady again, or the guy dressed in blue, but if I had..... well I don't know what I would have done, he was huge. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed off about the days happenings. I got back to my friends' place where I was staying and told him about the events of the day. To my surprise, he just shrugged it off and explained everything to me. He knew about the LPO and apparently that was the 5th nun that month to just "disappear". Apparently they have connections inside multi-national organizations and are next to impossible to track down. I'll never forget that day, but reading these BS posts about how it's not real has got me pretty riled up. Are any of you even from Calgary??--Concerned Calgary visitor</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> LPO is real, if you dont know ya betta ask somebody from TOXTETH.Yggdrasil is a member of a rival crew hell bent on disrespecting the LPO. Fuck you, you cock sucking twats......LPO will have its revenge.--London Philharmonic Orchestra</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I personally know someone who was robbed by Yggdrasil... I don't think he should be considered credible in this matter being a memeber of a rival group. -LPO Forever-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not sure why some people think this is a hoax but LPO is no laughing matter. There have been rumours flying around that members of the gang are appearing in London Ont. Canada. Law enforcement officials are attributing the apparent relocation of these gang members to the record number of homicides in London this year. -Scared In London</li>
