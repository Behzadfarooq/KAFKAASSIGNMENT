<p>When scanning the newly created articles, I saw this sharp-<i>looking</i> article, but something didn't seem right. I polled a few opinions at the reference desk/miscellaneous and it appears there's consensus that it's nn. I initially stamped it with a Prod (reason: appears to be a non-notable porn starlet, article sure looks pretty though); however a "mysterious" anon user went in and removed the prod tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Noir&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53624877" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Noir&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53624877" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Needless to say, this appears to be a <b>vanity page</b> (or possibly even an attack page) but it boils down to one simple thing: Non-Notablity. If an article looks sharp, it doesn't get a free pass. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 16:08, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN and vanity, no verification of claims or notability. The creator of the article admits to being her husband in the comment on the image creation. There's a bar for adult performers to reach, and I can't see that this gal approaches it. So she's a groupie at industry cons who lets the horny fanboys grope her, but that doesn't confer notability. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Wait</b> - Are we sure this is vanity? Why don't we ask people who are involved with this article to provide verifiable links that show that this is not just self promotion?

And when it comes to notability, it is subjective and purely POV. I've never heard of her. However, maybe she has a large fan base. I notice there is absolutely nothing on this articles talk page. Why not start discussions there, post a warning that there may be issues, prod if nothing is done, then go to AfD. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 16:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Herein lies is the problem... everyone thinks it is "extra effort by nominator to inform prior to prodding or afd" when it is a courtesy that should be done on <i>every</i> AfD that isn't a Speedy of blatent vandalism (and it takes all of 3-5 minutes to post something on the article talk page or creator talk page). <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#Before_nominating_an_AfD</a> doesn't mandate it, but it does suggest it. The "Common Sense basis" is that it avoids <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting</a> new users who may not be aware of guidelines like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> &amp; <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:02, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a pretty broad brush. I wrote that nothing in <i>this article...</i> which quickly became "everyone thinks." The implication of that language was that other articles may be appropriate for pre-notice while this one is not. I approach awarding for deletion on a case-by-case basis. As for biting, you're suggesting that the act of nominating an article for deletion is itself a form of biting in the absence of pre-notice and always shows a lack of courtesy. We'll just have to disagree on that score. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 22:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the implication is that <i>every</i> article brought to AfD/PROD should start with a good faith attempt to contact the creator (or in the case of articles with a large number of editors, comment on the Talk page) and this article is no exception. This should not be seen as extra effort; this should be seen a common courtesy and an extention of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. You are correct; I am of the opinion that AfD/PROD of an article that has existed for less than 1 day and was created by an editor who has been around for 2 days without an attempt to contact him/her and explain the issues with the article does show a distinct lack of courtesy and runs counter to the spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> (unless of course the article is an obvious and blatent case of vandalism/hoax).

<li><b>Wait</b> - For me this does not read like a vanity page, but your milage may vary. Also, when I Google her name I turned up about 800 references many of which appear unconnected to her site, so while she appears to be a lesser known porn actress, I'm not sure she qualifies as not-notable. I agree about placing <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-spam_1b4c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-spam">Template:Cleanup-spam</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitations_missing_cf8b.html" title="Template:Citations missing">Template:Citations_missing</a> to address community concerns before deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>Try doing a search for a few of the names at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_porn_stars" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_porn_stars" rel="nofollow">Category:American porn stars</a>. The first name there, Paizley Adams, whose article is barely a stub, draws almost 80,000 GHits. The second name, Sunrise Adams, draws over a million. For porn, which involves huge number of sites promoting each other and linkspam distributed all over the place, 800 is a very low number. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:04, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough - I searched on Brutus Black and found about 17,000, and then Googled "Rose Agree" who has an entry and found only about 600, so I'm not sure what to say - not nearly a million either, but also not 800. So, while your point is well taken, but I'm still on the fence about deleting out of hand before placing <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitations_missing_cf8b.html" title="Template:Citations missing">Template:Citations_missing</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Might not be the best example. I was about to suggest that maybe <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Agree_6e46.html" title="Rose Agree">Rose Agree</a> doesn't belong either, but then I looked at her article. If you look it, you'll see that her work would appeal to somewhat, uh, specialized tastes, with a rather limited viwership. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You don't look at the number of search results found through google, you look at the number of <i>unique hits</i>, by scrolling to the end of the pages. Christina Noir in quotes returns exactly 76 <i>unique</i> pages <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Christina+Noir%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Christina+Noir%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This means that of the 799 listed in the intitial search (the amount listed as total found before scrolling to the end), 723 were mirrors, internal pages of the same sites, etc. Not that google is the ultimate authority. Some subjects do not lend themselves to lots of webpage listings while still being notable. Porn actress notability on the other hand, appears to me to be a perfect subject for a "google notability test."--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 21:05, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Then by this method the Paizley Adams example above would return only 423 entries than the 80,000 cited above? I guess the problem I'm having with this is she seems about as notable as several of the other entries on the list - not that that's a justification for inclusion. I agree that Google is not and should not be the ultimate authority however. PetePrkr 23:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Someone (don't remember who) pointed out in another AfD that the "unique" hits only looks at the first 1000 total returned, so in this case, with only 800 total, it's valid, but once the totals go over 1000 the unique hits aren't really meaningful. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
