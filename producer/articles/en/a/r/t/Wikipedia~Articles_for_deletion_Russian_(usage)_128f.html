<p>This article, and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28spelling%29.html" title="Russian (spelling)">Russian (spelling)</a>, were created by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> because he felt some links to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28language%29.html" title="Russian (language)">Russian (language)</a> were "clutter". Apparently it was inconvenient for him to have so many articles linking to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28language%29.html" title="Russian (language)">Russian (language)</a> merely because a person happened to speak Russian, or a word was spelled in Russian. However, this change matches no policy I am aware of, was carried out unilaterally, and is certainly inconvenient for the <b>reader</b> of the article, who in my view is more important in this case. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 21:25, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. See <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussian_%28spelling%29_2ea6.html" title="Talk:Russian (spelling)">Talk:Russian (spelling)</a> for the reasons and further discussion. Also, I'd like to point at a hostile attitude ot Jayig, who started chasing me all over my edits without talking. Only on a brink of vioulating 3-revert rule he/she/it started using normal procedures of resolving disagreements. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:36, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I first put it on the Village Pump (policy) page for comment, and when others agreed that it was a bad idea, then I reverted the changes. And it was only after you actually violated the 3RR on a couple of articles defending your unilateral change that I brought it here for VfD. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 21:47, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter that you talked to some buddies. The point is you reverted <b>my</b> changes without talking to <b>me</b>. I find this arrogant and disrespoectful. And I didn't violate 3-revert rule. Learn to count (or English language), buddy. There were 4 edits, 3 of which were reverts of yours. The first one was good old plain honest edit. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>What pissed me off most that you lurked there silently, counting "One, Two, Three, BANG! GOTCHA!" This berhavior is simply disgusting. Anyone can check I never reverted twice in a row, not to say 3 times. I am a pretty reasonable guy. But this demonstration of blatant disrespect made me break my own rule.Sorry. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no policy that forbids me to do what I did. You are probably confusing tthe Soviet and Western notions of freedom. It is in totalitarian <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> only things listed in the Law were allowed, and the rest was forbidden. What is more, there are precedents of pages that serve purely technical convenience: disambig pages. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:36, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This page doesn't disambig anything, it just removes "clutter" for your convenience. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 22:01, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I agree with Mikkalai that there is a problem with too many links to the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> article, I do not see how creating <i>technical pages</i> is an acceptable resolution.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus europeaus)</a> 22:07, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect both</b>. Will cause nothing but confusion for anyone following a link to these from anywhere but here of the pump. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 22:32, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with a re-direct is that it will create double re-directs in all those articles Mikkalai has changed to point to his pages. Double re-directs don't work, causing even more problems for the user. At least if they're deleted, then we can finally change the articles he has re-directed to point back to where they are supposed to, since he apparently won't allow anyone to do that now. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 22:50, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not entirely sure how it would if you set the redirect to go to the final destination page and not another redirect. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:33, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> bad idea. How is it detrimental to have lots of pages linking to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 22:33, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because I simply cannot find pages that discuss <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> <i>per se</i>. All what I see are pages that say how, e.g., <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar_Bomba_8e1f.html" title="Tsar Bomba">Tsar Bomba</a> is written with Russian letters. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's wrong with using categories? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:59, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categories will not help me to find discussion of Russan language in, e.g., <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a> (what the <b>heck</b> is this!!! Wow! Never heard!) Backlinks is an extremely powerful feature that distinguishes wikipedia among many other online reference tools. I hated to see its usability effectively killed in this particular case. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:12, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Shetsen</a> 22:52, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC) If it doesn't work for technical reasons (see above), rewrite. Mikkalai's idea has some merit. Perhaps <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> should be replaced with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">Russian</a> to help the user disambiguate. <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._Shetsen_6733.html" title="User:A.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I see the problem but this doesn't make the situation any better.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>, as explained on the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussian_%28spelling%29_2ea6.html" title="Talk:Russian (spelling)">talk page</a>. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 23:23, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Forget about <b>redirect</b>. If (actually, when&#160;:-) I will be outvoted, I will clean up all links to this page back to where they were. I am well aware that many geniuses are recognized only postmortem.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:30, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My question is why to you need to know every page linking to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>? <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> → <small><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Talk</a> 23:42, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>I donn't need every pages that link to Ru Lang <b>now</b>. I want to see all pages that <b>discuss the language</b>, rather than say how <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minsk.html" title="Minsk">Minsk</a> is written with Russian letters. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:47, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then add them as links in the main article, surely? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:56, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How would I find them in the first place? Ever heard about e.g., <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a>? Also, there is a pretty fat chance that some smartjay will decide that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a> has only cursory relation to the article and delete the link. (Such cases did occur.) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:17, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How come? Perfectly functional, and very practical. In your spare time, please look at the article and at its talk page, and think about the problem it tries to solve.

<li>So far it was personal defense and explanation why I went into a distress. Nice turning of the tables. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:39, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, because the page itself is content-free and meaningless. It's intended to be editor-friendly, but at the expense of being reader-hostile (no reader clicking on a "Russian" link wants to go to this page). Mikkalai does raise a valid point about how some pages have so many backlinks that the feature becomes unusable, but this is a general problem (not just for language pages) that needs some other solution. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:09, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also note Greek (spelling), which is the same thing (listing added below, if a separate vote is warranted).</p>

<dd>Relax. I'll kill it quietly. It is also mine. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I still don't understand the point. What's wrong with links to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiacc_5519.html" title="User:Wikiacc">Wikiacc</a> 20:50, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Suggestion:</b> When the links are changed back; maybe some of them shouldn't be links in the first place. I mean maybe instead of putting in "[[Russian]]" you should just put in "Russian" . That would probably help solve the original problem (where someone thought that there were too many links). I do agree tht there is a tendency to put in too many links in some articles. <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMpearl_818f.html" title="User:Mpearl">Morris</a> 04:53, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I understand and recognize the problem that Mikkalai is pointing out but the present implementation is not the right solution. Discussion on this general problem should not be limited to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussian_%28spelling%29_2ea6.html" title="Talk:Russian (spelling)">Talk:Russian (spelling)</a>; this matter should be brought up for discussion on broader platforms. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Languages_a9a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages">Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages</a> might be such a place (however, as Curps points out, the problem is not limited to language pages.) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 19:27, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
