<li><b>Strong Keep</b> in original version. Click on the links to the Google Groups featured in the section titled Sci.Psychology.Psychotherapy in Usenet Environment of Gangs. You will quickly discover that this article in its original form is as factual as any written in Wikipedia. And if the article appears odd, it is only because the article is an accurate reflection of an oddity. The following statement, by contrast, is not a fact but merely an educated opinion: the haste with which "editors" are converging on this article to delete its original form in its entirety, without qualification, discussion, or verification suggests the work of Usenet gangbangers based in none other than (drum roll please) ... sci.psychology.psychotherapy. I am screen capturing all this work, including the date-time stamps, for inclusion in a report to be reviewed by more civilized and educated communities outside Wikipedia.
<p>Also, the acceptable practice is to keep an original article intact pending the outcome of a review such as that prompted by a recommendation for deletion. But James James, and other fly-by-night aliases posing as editors, are engaging in the practice of treating a replacement "stub" as the main page and any effort to restore the original page as "vandalism." This is turning reality on its head. Restore the original page, conduct your research, weigh in on the discussion, and then make any changes (which may include wholesale deletion) based on the outcome of the review.

<li>Significant? How in the name of John Hinckley is alt.usenet.kooks significant?! Because some Usenetters who founded it 12 years ago (not 20) use spam advertising to recruit aggressors from other news groups? In this way, alt.usenet.kooks is a phenomenon. I give you that. But no editor would ever allow me or anyone else to tack on a criticism or consequences section (without sidelining it within 2 seconds to the Discussion page). This is not an article written out of journalistic objectivity or integrity. It's propaganda.
<p>No one in the civilized world knows Alt.usenet.kooks. It's endemic to Usenet, that is, until this Wikipedia article started showing up in Google searches of the victim's names. That's the whole point of the article.</p>
<p>This is not an attack piece on Alt.usenet.kooks. It is stand alone content, and shares the same verifiability and "significance" as your beloved Alt.usenet.kooks. Interesting how no one is discussing verifiability anymore. Suddenly, verifiability is not a criterion. You must have followed the links and examined the evidence. That being said, I know one thing that is never a criterion in science or journalism: popularity. How well known subject matter is is utterly beside the point.</p>

<li>Good point Cyde, only you are forgetting something. The creator of the original article is not the vandal. There would be no article if it were not for the author. I suggest you treat this article similar to Alt.usenet.kooks. Have a discussion page and a page on which people can permanently challenge the neutrality, but otherwise leave the article intact. Hell -- you can even add qualifying sections to the main page. There are many options besides deletion redirection (AKA deletion by proxy).
<p>A true editor would defer to policy here. Leave original article. Let this mechanism run its course and let's see where the chips fall. I think you are concerned that by the time the dust settles, enough people will have voiced support for the original version to prevent deletion or redirection. Still, I suspect Wiki editors will violate their own policy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) 2005-12-27 16:49:31 UTC.</small></p>

<li>No, Usenet newsgroups <i>do not</i> deserve articles purely on that basis alone.

<li>The choice is between <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and an unexpandable directory entry. The article content as it stands is 100% original research, and is, moreover, the spillover from a long-standing conflict on Usenet. The rewritten stub article is a simple "N is a Usenet newsgroup" directory entry. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, be it of people, companies, web sites, or Usenet newsgroups. For this article to be worthwhile, there needs to be scope for expansion of the article to be <i>more</i> than a simple directory entry. There needs to be secondary source material available that is <i>more substantial</i> than simple directory listings and excerpts from "active" files. Usenet newsgroups that have had non-trivial works published <i>about</i> them (such as FAQs on <a href="http://faqs.org./" class="external text" title="http://faqs.org./" rel="nofollow">faqs.org.</a> for example) qualify for articles on this basis.

<li>True, but then originality should not be penalized if the facts derive from an observation or arithmetic so simple as to be almost assured of a .90 inter-rater reliability coefficient. There's not much interpretation or construction here.
<p>A good encyclopedia does not merely mime or mirror other pre-packaged encyclopedias (e.g. the FAQ list), but transcends it. However, I agree that if one had to choose between a stub-based article and no article at all, I'd choose no article at all. There's nothing good anyone can say about this news group except that it boasts some of the highest traffic and is often listed (lazily I might add) as a "resource" on department of psychology web sites. It is also "captured" (i.e. indexed to the Web) by a number of news readers (more news readers than alt.usenet.kooks). Of course, it's only after I ask news reader admins and psych dept web site admins to examine this news group do they realize they made a mistake listing it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>) 19:46, 27 December 2005.</small></p>

<li>I don't see how that's obvious. You're contributing to an article, and arguing for the importance of a subject, about a website you created. OK--I will amend "vanity" to "self-promotion", which is what I should have said. Apologies for the misstatement.

<ul>
<li>What I'm saying is that it's not self-promotion because I neither wrote the article or run the site now. Someone else wrote the wikipedia article and contacted me to work on the article since I knew more about it than them. If this was self-promotion, I would have done an article on XoA Online, because that is my site. My only link to the site is that I host it and I helped create it, I have very little to do with it now. If I wasn't the driving force behind the creation of the wikipedia article or the site itself, how could this be self-promotion? If you guys don't feel the article is worth keeping, that's fine, but just don't say that this is self-promotion. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a> 9:52 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>,This is not a notable paintball website. Notable paintball websites would include <a href="http://www.pbnation.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pbnation.com" rel="nofollow">PBnation</a> or <a href="http://www.forceofnature" class="external text" title="http://www.forceofnature" rel="nofollow">Force of Nature</a> or <a href="http://www.warpig.com" class="external text" title="http://www.warpig.com" rel="nofollow">Warpig</a> (started in 1987). These sites have stood the test of time and are the ones getting the lion's share of visits by paintball players. Do you really want a site that has minimal information, weak design, and makes questionable claims to represent the paintball community? On their front page they have this statement "Die Hard paintball also sales new and used guns, vistit our pro shop at <a href="http://www.pevs.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.pevs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pevs.com/</a>" - I doubt that Mike Peverill (founder of Pev's Paintball) would saction such a statement or affiliation. The issue is whether or not this site is notable. According to the guidelines, this site doesn't qualify as <i>notable</i>. 1. it hasn't been the subject of national or international media attention, 2. it isn't a forum with more than 5,000 members that has made a verifiable impact beyond its own user community (www.pbnation.com has over 200,000 members), and 3. it doesn't have an Alexa rating above 10,000 (the site has a rating of 1,607,664). The other three sites I mention above all have higher Alexa ratings (pbnation has a rating of 16,057 for example). As for the self-promotion argument - Alexa's entry for the site states "This website is a home to cross-platform clan called XoA Online".65.28.204.25 01:08, 30 December 2005 (UTC)Steve (Photographer for Paintball 2Xtremes Magazine)

<li>User's second edit. Please give proof that you are affiliated with the magazine before making the claim. Thank you. - <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a>
<ul>
<li>PS: Keep in mind that Alexa will usually only display information for the main site. Go to xmission.com on Alexa and it will pull up a webhosting site despite the fact that 75% of the traffic comes from the infamous "<a href="http://maddox.xmission.com" class="external text" title="http://maddox.xmission.com" rel="nofollow">Best Page in the Universe</a>". Keep that in mind, Alexa, while great for overall traffic statistics, isn't always the strongest source on determining what content is held under the name of the domain. Also, check the site again. Die Hard Paintball links over to Pev's Paintball, saying it's a "fantastic" site, why would Mike Peverill be against that? No reason at all. No where on the homepage does it make the statement you claim. Also, you said Warpig was started on 1987. While it may have started then, I doubt it had a website at that point. According to your notability standards, PBNation (which I would agree is notable) has an Alexa ranking that is not notable, despite the fact that is has made such an impact. If you like your other sites so much, take the time to write the articles on them and let other people write the articles on the sites they feel are notable.
<ul>
<li>PPS: Before saying this site is not notable, let's take another look around the internet shall we? Look at the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=forceofnature.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=forceofnature.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa ranking for Force of Nature</a> (which I would also agree with you, that site is notable, I'm just pointing out these statistics to show you that the site in question is as well). It's ranking is 502,806 (which is below your standard of 10,000, and, since we both agree your site is notable, means we should probably look at this with a different standard), with no daily or weekly ranking, which, since you may or may not know how Alexa works, means absolutely no one with Alexa technology has gone to that site in a week. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=xoaonline.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=xoaonline.com" rel="nofollow">This site's daily and weekly Alexa rankings</a>, however, are existant and fairly high. So, according to your standards, if one is notable, and this site has had more traffic than it in the recent past, you should probably acknowledge that either both are notable or both are not. Saying that A = Notable and even though B &gt; A, B =/= notable does not make sense. - <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a></li>

<p>PhantomStrider: Yes I can see that its disliked. I didn't, however write it up on an ego matter. I wrote it up to give the game some officialness for the users so they could read it in select articles. Delete it if you want. You can delete everything under my name as the author since its all based on this article. I don't need the work humiliated. I just expected it to be filed away so that the users who do look at it could. As a matter of fact, I'll delete it now.</p>

LGBT activist in Toronto who's done a few workshops at some conferenes and had a bio-piece done on some tv show. Judging from the edit history, the article seems to be some hybrid of an attack-page and a vanity-page made by his friends and aquantences there. Don't think this would be of interest to anyone other than perhaps a few dozen people in the LGBT Toronto scene, so hard to see how this could merit a Wikipedia article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 05:27, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting - I hadn't noticed such a reticence. I find the media loves sensational stuff about gays and lesbians (i.e. all the hooplah about the marriages last year in the states and in the uk now with elton john and all). And transexuality can be even more sensational for the media - particuarly female-&gt;male, which is less common. If media coverage of such things was really so unusual, then wouldn't LGBT websites around the world be talking about Ayden Scheim and how extraordinary it was that he got such media coverage? And wouldn't this result in hudreds if not thousands of google hits?... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm a "unique local activist" too, and I've been interviewed by local print and broadcast media on a number of occasions over the past ten years or so - even had a personality profile done in a local paper. And I know a number of local activists here and in other towns who can say the same. But I don't think all that adds up to notability on the Wikipedia level. In a wiki about my town I probably would be deserving of at least brief mention (as would some of my friends), as would Ayden in a Toronto wiki. But neither of us are notable enough to have a Wikipedia bio. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The <i>one</i> TV show that I see she was featured on is <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_Cuts_d1af.html" title="Rough Cuts">Rough Cuts</a> - a reletively minor CBC weekly program which doesn't yet have a Wikipedia article, and which gets a little over 10,000 Google hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B1n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22rough+cuts%22+cbc&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B1n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22rough+cuts%22+cbc&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Now the show is certainly certainly notable enough that it would deserve a Wikipedia article, but it's certainly a much less well known show than say <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dateline_NBC_0e7d.html" title="Dateline NBC">Dateline NBC</a>, which gets almost two million Google hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dateline+NBC%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dateline+NBC%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> My point is that the show is not notable to the point where someone appearing on that show one week (in Scheim's case with two others) automatically becomes notable. I'm not even sure that someone who was featured one week on Dateline NBC as an example of some phenomenon they were discussion would automatically become notable, but they'd have a stronger case. Also, I don't see any good reason why the Google-test shouldn't apply here, as this person is not historic and is not from outside the Western World. It's really hard to see how a young Canadian activist would have less than 200 non-Wikipedia Google hits if he were notable. Another test I would apply is would anyone who had not met Ayden Scheim in person and did not live in his area be likely to be motivated to start a Wikipedia article on him? And I have yet to see any evidence that they would. And judging from the edit summaries at the article, it's pretty clear to me that it was written by people who know Ayden. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:02, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I <i>know</i> that I am not important enough to warrant a Wikipedia entry, so one of my benchmarks for inclusion is someoen who's had more media exposure than I have, it's as simple as that. You can't verify my media appearances for the same reason I can't easily verify the media appearances of the subject: they are transient. Andy Warhol said that everyone is famous for 15 minutes - does that mean everybody should be in WP? The problem here is continuing verifiability, notability is just shorthand for describing someone who is likely to remain in the media spotlight for long enough to ensure that something other than a single current event is verifiable (like candidates for political office, most of whom lose, and many of those are never heard of again). Once the media lose interest (assuming they haven't already) then everything subsequent becomes <i>completely</i> unverifiable instead of only unverifiable by anyone not in the area. As far as I'm concerned we should wait at least a year before adding an article related to any single current event, to see what the perspective of history might be. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:40, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I reiterate: Have you been featured in two nationally televised documentaries? If not, I expect you will stop distorting Mr. Scheim's record and withdraw your comments above. I would also appreciate it if you stopped talking about your supposed media appearances. Your claims about google hits are not relevant unless you provide a link. If the hits relate to some blog you maintain then they will be discounted. Mr. Scheim is not a current event, he is an activist. There are newspaper references on him dating back four years. Futhermore, I do not judge any bio by the media's interest or lack thereof. If I did, we could immediately trash most of our bios on historical subjects as well as numerous academics etc. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Appeared in a CBC newsmagazine" might perhaps not cut it as a claim of notability, but as far as I'm concerned, the fact that it was one of the most <i>controversial pieces</i> to air on the show in at least the past few years <i>does</i> cut it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't understand why it is a problem keeping articles like these. I take "non-notable" to mean "not notable AT ALL". Certainly this person is notable. I think people should be saying "Not notable enough". Otherwise, it can sound like the things of note that a person does are not important. I will assume good faith here and assume that this is not the intent of the people saying "non-notable". Personally, I think Wikipedia should have many thousand small articles about the mildly notable people of the world. Some of these people will become more notable, in which case we can say it was in Wikipedia first. Others will drift off into obscurity. In future decades a small handful of people digging for information about obscure mildly notable people will find a paragraph or two about them here on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> per JJay. I created the album's page when I found the entry about the D&amp;D sketch/video (which contained exactly the info I was looking for) and saw a redlink to the album title. The album page is an almost line-by-line recreation of one of the many many MANY other album listings which are also included in Wikipedia, containing approximately as much information as many others (and more than some) which are not being challenged, so please don't blame me for ugliness. I was just going by what appeared to be an acceptable template. I would however have no problem with seeing this/these develop into a fuller article on the Dead Alewives themselves. They certainly deserve one. -- Arvedui 18:26, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are certainly a lot of album "info and track listing" articles, and the Dungeons and Dragons skit is popular in the older pen-and-paper RPG crowd. Heck, just mention the word "Cheetos" with older RPG gamers is good for a chuckle. Problem is, it's a "niche" article ... but Wikipedia has plenty of those, and this particular skit has at least some mainstream (non-RPG) following. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 20:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's nice that people find silliness in things. I just don't think it's encyclopedia material. At first glance, not being familiar with dance jargon, one might think "silly" could be a term of art in dance, and that the article's author didn't define that well, but after reading the talk page, I do not think this is the case. Here's my test for encyclopedic here: can the article stand on it's own if you remove all opinion and leave just facts: answer = NO, entire article is subjective opining; <b>D E L E T E--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 07:00, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</b></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - 320 is not as relevant to dotsoft.gr as 165.000 is, and 165.000 isn't 'the number' per se. In the 320 case the search takes into account only the number of times the term 'dotsoft.gr' comes up and not the term 'dotsoft' which is the main descriptive name of the company. A further justification of why 320 is not characteristic is that in under no circumstances dotsoft.gr could top the google search for the term dotsoft(as it currently does) with only 320 unique hits for the term dotsoft.gr, while the total hits for the term dotsoft is 165.000. In the second case(165.000) the search takes into account the term 'dotsoft' which does not belong only to 'dotsoft.gr'. A more balanced search should be taking into account the number of results returned by google with the term 'dotsoft' and filter the results for pages written only in Greek, a fairly big number that reaches <b>65,100</b>, a number big enough which still does not take into account the number of foreign text pages mentioning the company. Finally, by looking for all pages hosted in Greece(written in english or greek or anything else) and mention the term 'dotsoft' the number reaches <b>136,000</b>. Google URL is <a href="http://www.google.com.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=dotsoft&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryGR" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=dotsoft&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryGR" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=dotsoft&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryGR</a>Dotsoft 06:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply to Comment:</b> I think it all comes to the meaning and purpose of the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_companies_in_Greece_8e50.html" title="List of companies in Greece">List of companies in Greece</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_companies.html" title="List of companies">List of companies</a> which concerns companies worldwide. If the entries in these listings are notable(which to a large degree are not), what sets them apart from the other potentialy more notable companies apart from the fact that the other companies have not edited the wiki page in order to be listed? Is a fishing company in Djibuti notable? No, but this does not stop it from being listed under it's country's catalogue. Moreover as an official registrar of the gr domain dotsoft has been included in press releases on top gr sites such as <a href="http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=526981&amp;lngDtrID=252" class="external free" title="http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=526981&amp;lngDtrID=252" rel="nofollow">http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=526981&amp;lngDtrID=252</a> and <a href="http://www.marketing-net.gr/online/article.asp?returnPage=GROUP&amp;group=6&amp;articleid=1458" class="external free" title="http://www.marketing-net.gr/online/article.asp?returnPage=GROUP&amp;group=6&amp;articleid=1458" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketing-net.gr/online/article.asp?returnPage=GROUP&amp;group=6&amp;articleid=1458</a> (both in gr only).

<dd>Was that directed at me or at Dotsoft? For myself, I can't see much indication on google that Dotsoft-the-hosting-company is notable (though Dotsoft-the-AutoCAD-plugin-company might be notable). I don't see any mentions in greek news sites, not even press releases. Dotsoft's services don't strike me as notable (though admittedly I don't read Greek so there may be material in the text that's not apparent in their services grid. In short, DOTSOFT appears to be little more than Yet Another Hosting Provider.

<dd>there is a book titled "Digital Culture" by Charles Gere</dd>
</dl>
<p>- I posted the original (top part) of this definition. 'Digital Culture' does need defining as an independant conjunctive signifier. As for redirection, re.information age etc.? - I think references &amp; links might be more helpful.</p>
<p>- Also, there are several "digital culture" programs at established universities. Perhaps is would be better to edit it rather than delete it.</p>
<p><b>Please leave it in</b></p>
<p>There are plenty of people who are starting to debate the coining of this term in contrast of meaning of that of "information age" and "digital revolution".</p>
<p>"Everyone uses the term digital culture, but no one defines it. It is one of those key terms that in its simplest usage merely designates a society saturated by telecommunications and information networks, electronic products, and computational systems based on binary data using electronic or electromagnetic signals. ... Whatever the intention of its meaning, the ubiquitous usage of the term digital culture has two important underlying assumptions: (1) community revolves around distributed communication; and (2) efforts to increase community take the form of new devices, systems, and technologies for abetting telecommunications."

<dd>Normal process is that attack pages (and those not claiming any sort of notability) can be speedied. My fault for not leaving a reason when I deleted it. The terms get zero (yes, that's right, zero as in zip, zilch, none, nil, etc.) Google hits. A word that doesn't get a single Google hit isn't even a neologism.

<li>We should probably <i><b>discuss</b></i> the problem at hand rather than having everyone simply vote to merge or delete, because that will ignore what I was trying to do in creating this page. Does anyone have an actual solution to my original problem, which was that I couldn't directly find 'per nom', a common slang with no definition. A simple entry or redirect of some kind will actually help people. So if we just delete this page, we will be causing people some unnecessary searching of common information. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 07:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. I created this article because it's a useful aphorism, and despite Duffy's probable belief that he's right about AK, it humbles one to apply this to oneself. To my knowledge, Duffy did not self-promote any of his stuff to wikipedia, and as far as I'm concerned, deletion based on whether Duffy is working in a discredited field is a better argument for keeping it than for deleting it in this particular case, if only to show Duffy in his own words that he could be wrong, too. As a point of process, there was no discussion of problems with the article on its talk page before its nomination on AfD. Those problems may be fixable, if someone would say what they are? -- <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVansig_9bf6.html" title="User:Vansig">Vansig</a> 05:55, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, you're right that AK is not that relevant here. But it remains that the phrase is a non-notable recent neologism. Google search shows 71 unique hits. First hit is his own website, which has no alexa data (in terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that reaks of non-notability). The first hit not from that website or its guestbook is some user comment on IMDb about an unrelated fictional character named Duffy, the rest are equally unrelated or Wikipedia mirrors. It is not a problem with the article, it is a problem with the subject of the article (i.e. notability) -- which can't be fixed in the article. If it were this easy to create a "law" and then have an article on Wikipedia describing it, everyone would be creating "Quarl's Law" just to get free advertisement. As for process, most articles that are non-notable don't get Talk discussion before being brought here. I still vote Delete. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 08:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Copied from Talk:Duffy's law</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article was nominated for deletion on 27 Dec 2005. As of 3 Jan 2006 there is no clear consensus; while the question of notability is problematic for biographies, comix, music and eponymous laws, this article is exemplary of the problems with blindly applying Google/Alexa stats to the AfD process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Suspiciously, the first three votes for deletion occured within minutes of this page's listing on AfD, all making no additional argument beyond the allegations of non-notability and self promotion. Have deletionists been running a xmas holiday deletion campaign?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>User:Quarl astutely pointed out that unless notability is a question here, anyone could make up an eponymous law and promote it. I would agree, usually. But looking deeper into the implications of going ahead with deletion, it could spur increasing conflict between deletionists and inclusionists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It could turn out to be staggeringly pivotal: inclusionists could do very well to allow the vote to sway against them for this article, and then both: offer the deletion as proof of Duffy's law itself, and at the same time make the claim that deletionists are purging the wikipedia of important but obscure knowledge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So clearly, this article is not WP:VAIN, not WP:BIO and is NPOV; the article is of interest to multiple people, so it is totally noteworthy, just not very popular because most people don't like to apply it to themselves. -- 70.29.131.204 05:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I created the page because the list was too long to be on the actors main article. However, I saw that only afew actors have this type of article, notably Bogart and Stewart whom have far more films and are far more notable. I don't want to create something where we see a filmography for every actor and actress! I replaced the main article link with an external link to an IMDB page, with basically thet same content.

<li>Most articles have not a complete filmography, but a "selected filmography" section, where important films/whatever are shown. If an actor's filmography gets too long, consider trimming unimportant appearances instead — there are few actors who have too many important appearances for them all to appear on his bio. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:31, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

This gang is real, they're from my suburb, i see them around all the time causing trouble and stuff. the part about their battle with DB, the other gang in my suburb is completely true, everyone always talks about it around here.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 211.31.17.164 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.31.17.164_7267.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.31.17.164">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Don't delete. Although parts of this article are clearly exaggerated, 'FDC' does indeed exist. They are well-known in Sydney's inner west. That said, the '1000's of memberships' and 'macking' bits, and probably the weapons import bit are obvious urban legend and/or self-aggrandisement rather than fact. I would suggest modification of these sections.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.239.41.67 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.239.41.67.html" title="User talk:220.239.41.67">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.239.41.67_9d2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.239.41.67">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>I have personally been a victim of FDC's various crimes. i have had death threats from their various members which probably stemmed from my affiliation with a rival gang. i cannot walk down the streets of Drummoyne now without constantly looking over my shoulder, and by deleting this article, i belive wikipedia would be ignoring an important social dynamic of sydney that invariably affects many of it's youths and adults alike.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 60.229.148.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_60.229.148.77_81b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/60.229.148.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To the above anons; could any of you provide a source or citation for this gang?

<li>The gang is not in the thousands, hundreds definately but not the thousands. I also cannot find them on the internet though there in various blogs. Im a 36 year old male from the five dock region and i know they exist and this article is fairly accurate as i was forced to pay protection money to them two years ago. I own a restuarant on Great North Rd, Five Dock. "Tommo" and "Catenaccio" are quite famous characters throughout the inner-west of sydney, known as "gentlemanly gangsters".</li>

<p>I don't feel especially strong about this, but I'm a bit surprised that there's an article on David Sperling, who is pretty much a non-entity on the board he has created. He collects ad money and adds a notice to the top of the board once or twice a year, so I don't find him to be particularly notable.

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b> per <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a>. A preamble is needed to help put it all in context (for example, what is a "minor album" and why is it in this article instead of the Snoop Dog discography?). I would prefer summaries of mixtapes and bootlegs instead of a track-by-track listing as this listing will soon become unwieldy. The bigger acts will always have more bootleg titles than "official" releases (e.g., <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Brown_5d07.html" title="James Brown">James Brown</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>), and the mixtapes in rap magnify this. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 20:42, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><del><b>Weak keep</b></del> (Changing vote, see below). First, I'd like the article deleted because it's a lightning rod for vandals (mr. Godwin would probably rest his case if he saw the vandalism going on here) - and I for one am tired of reverting that shit. Furthermore, it's a small game, long-standing stub, and I guess no one's expanding it reasonably - only vandals seem to be interested of it, and apparently some reasonable users lately. <i>However,</i> I must object to the nomination's points - I really don't think <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> should be used as the notability criteria of online games, especially ones that aren't played in web browsers! The cases where total amount of active players can't be assessed are really annoying too (and the other deletion debate's figure of 300 players is probably way off, as the site seems to claim support for 400 <i>concurrent</i> players <a href="http://www.endless-online.com/faq.html#faq1-03" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.endless-online.com/faq.html#faq1-03" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> - and the vandals say the server is swamped with too many trying to log on all the time =). I've looked at their web site. Looks like an active project that seems to have pretty hefty following (if, as the vandals seem to claim, the server is really used up to its capacity and over - 300 users would be good for any MUD!) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Changed to <b>Strong Keep</b>, on the grounds that the game <i>seems</i> to be popular enough as far as some games go, this is not the case of reposting previously speedily deleted content (The article used to be a stub for a long time and appears to be rewritten lately), and because of the frigging vandal sockpuppetry that seems to spring up in this AfD. And, since the vandals seem to think this game seems to be so popular that it gets vandalised more than G.W. Bush article =) it obviously proves the topic is significant. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And as a further comment, the article does assert notability: it claims the game has player community of about 10,000, which seems high enough to me to be notable. <i>And</i> it's been around for years, and is maintained actively (as asserted by the trolls, again, who wax poetic when comparing the efficiency of the maintenance to the war machine of WW2 Germany). Not many MUDs got to that many players either!

<li><b>Why it should be deleted</b> I will state the real reason on why this article should be deleted. The game, should NOT be advertised in any way, anywhere. What are the reasons for this?<br />
It is being advertised as a kids game, but is clearly not, seeing as the racial comments, the continuous flaming and the huge despite from a large ammount of players. It is known that if you don´t have a strong knowledge in the English language through the computer, you will most likely be insulted through that, where it is known that most kids type in ´Netspeak´ otherwise known as a quick way. For example. HAI HW R U PPLZ I HAV 2 GO SONO PLX. You are in deep shit otherwise. Another reason, goes on towards the admins. 3 admins on the admin team are rascist and perverted, one of which is known to have been in prison at least once for drug abuse, currently under the name of Sakura. Most of the players in the game rebelled to the teams creation because of the lack of moderation, and has labelled it as ´Nazi Over-rule´. A G Rated game indeed. If you see a person by the name of Cruise, qawzer (Qwerty, Qwertie), Popdog(Numbers here), Terrysan (Terrytard), Dog55, Izlude, Aramax (By far), Sapphire Fate, Mansur, you have FULL right to insult them, as they are very rascist. Oh, and are idiots. LOZL. I therefore conclude my case on how this page should be deleted. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 80.58.51.106 (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.58.51.106.html" title="User talk:80.58.51.106">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.58.51.106_af82.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.58.51.106">contribs</a>)</small>

As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia has to cover all of the bad and nasty things in the world too, and I assure you there are even worse things than Endless Online that we have covered so far! --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So my opinion doesn't matter if I'm not an active Wikipedian? What you view as vandalism I view as truth... your article as it is (and has been in the past) blatantly brown-noses their game and their admins. Cemz 08:37, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>In summary, AfD isn't just a vote, it's a method for gauging Wikipedia community's opinions, and anonymous contributors people with few contributions aren't generally "part of the community". Would you set your house to fire just because every stranger who happens to pass by would tell you to do that, or demolish the house because your friends built you a new one and the people from your street think the old building is an eyesore? =) Plus, "lightning rod for vandals" isn't part of speedy deletion criteria, otherwise two well-known individuals in Washington DC and Vatican would suddenly find themselves without articles =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:29, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wwwwolf, so far it's you talking to meat/sock puppets&#160;:) I agree that if there is notable controversy then it should be kept. However, the number of meat/sock puppets' contributions doesn't convince me that the controversy is notable. Many AFDs here have this volume of meat/sock puppets. I think the lack of contribution by non puppets is more telling. Is there some documentation of legal consequences, media attention, etc. regarding this controversy? Because every online game (esp MMORPGs) has interpersonal issues like addiction, role play, sexual deviance, etc. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 06:43, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. That was just a random idea I thought of, just to annoy the puppets - for the record, I think none of their rambling makes sense, the problems they list are just typical to all net games. =) However, the article nowadays seems to have some sort of a claim of notability, specifically, some numbers on the size of the userbase - 10,000 players is notable in my book. Verifiability is another issue, especially considering most of the MMORPGs don't have an easy and reliable way to find out the size of the user community AND as said we don't even have notability criteria for that, even in draft form (correct me if I'm wrong). And music has charts - what "charts" do we follow, especially when most existing ones are based on sales figures, which remain kind of weak for <i>free</i> games? So we're deep in the uncharted waters of the notability guidelines, and it'd be silly to delete this just because it's "unverifiable". And as said, WP:WEB isn't really applicable. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:29, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." Therefore, being "not quite notable" is not a significant reason to delete the article. There are plenty of artist articles on WP that are less visible and less notable than this one.

The band's web site has in the past shown national tour dates (verifiable via archive.org's wayback machine) and a Google search for "cecilia veltz" will show countless articles from publications nationwide on the story of this band.

<p>Here we have the problem: Shall an author be notified or not&#160;? What is an adnotable author. Who shall decide&#160;? On Wikipedia we find definitions of elementary words like sports, professor etc. The answer is perhaps: What is the author writing about and who read the books&#160;? We know, you do not have to be a scientific author to be famous. Only ordinary stories can be a ground to become famous.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - almost all occurrences of the phrase refer to the title of a famous song by <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Simone_5158.html" title="Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a>. It's mentioned in her article and a few others on WP. Her article is well-done and has 150 edits, so I'm not suggesting the song deserves its own article, but a redirect is worth considering. One curiosity: A search for the phrase as an artist on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">All Music</a> redirects to an older blues musician, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_John_Hurt_db36.html" title="Mississippi John Hurt">Mississippi John Hurt</a>. I can't figure-out why this is though - Google finds no significant coincidences of "John Hurt" and "Mississippi goddamn" that don't mention "Nina Simone", nor does his All Music or WP page mention the phrase. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 04:40, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please put more effort into your nominations. Here, you do not make the case for deletion in any way. Writing a decent nomination is a good habit (adding a vote at the end is not). It is especially important in cases like this, where the article's authors (or sometimes, subjects) are confused by the deletion process, and want to know precisely <i>why</i> we think their article does not belong in an encyclopaedia.

<p>Consensus should not trump NPOV (or any other official policy). A group of editors advocating a viewpoint do not, in theory, overcome the policy expressed in Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not concerning advocacy and propaganda. However, a group of editors may be able to shut out certain facts and points of view through persistence, numbers, and organization. This group of editors should not agree to an article version that violates NPOV, but on occasion will do so anyway. This is generally agreed to be a bad thing.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted by others above, this delete request is part of a rampage to delete Jewish-related articles. If it is a stub, then expand it. Perhaps there could also be a merge with other pages on Jewish summer camps into a general article on Jewish summer camps and how they are different from "run-of-the-mill" US summer camps (i.e., their role in ethnic identify of Jews, history re: Jews being not welcome and/or proselytized by Christians in other summer camps, use of Hebrew and Yiddish languages at these camps, etc.) But simply deleting all Jewish summer camps as "not notable" smacks of a hidden agenda against Jews. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll vote <b>keep</b> due to the camp's venerability but I disagree with the suggestions that the nominator was on some sort of anti-Semitic rampage. A) he's part Jewish b) it seems he was starting out cleaning out stubs and happened to be doing so in one of the Jewish subcats. He may have overreacted to IZAK's taking him to task and nominated some articles that do not merit deletion but this is quite different from being anti-Semitic.Homey 23:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Tagged as speedy, but this isn't speedyable as the article includes an assertion of notability ("underground smash") so I've brought this here. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 23:48, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as I originally tagged it for that, nn music group with 0 google hits that have anything to do with them when searching for "Crippled crack babies" or "CCB crew" and no amg entry. I don't think an underground smash hit can exist, since a smash hit wouldn't stay underground for very long.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, since that's what I originally tagged it for.
