</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was: after three AfDs, it's time for our <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">first pillar</a> of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> to assert itself. The external references (both those in this AfD, and the previous ones) make it very clear what this is: that now and then, someone points out that Newton was born on 25th December in a non-standard calendar, and makes an appropriate pun on 'Christmas'. But <i>nowhere</i> has it been <i>remotely</i> verified that significant numbers of people actually celebrate this as an organised holiday. I'm sure Pharos' science teacher was a damn good teacher, but he's not a reliable source.</p>
<p>To head off protest that the majority for deletion isn't enough - AfD is not a vote, and the discussion here, as well as the previous ones, have served their purpose by showing that while lots of people like the idea (particularly the young scientifically-oriented ex-Christian Westerners that make up much of our systemic bias), it hasn't caught on enough to be worth including in an encyclopaedia. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:27, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Usually nominated at or about Christmas, for reasons which evaporate as soon as you check Newton's birth date, this is a festival apparently proposed by Gordon Worley which has never really caught on. Unusually, I'd say the Google Test says it all: Newtonmas: 845 ghits. "Pi day" (quoted): 357,000 ghits. Michaelmas: ~1m ghits. Lammas: ~1.6m ghits. Christmas: &gt;350,000,000 ghits. So: this is, according to the Google test, approximately 0.0002% as significant as the mainstream festival which would fall on the same date if it weren't for the fact that the calendar changed in 1582. This appears to be a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conceit" class="extiw" title="wikt:conceit">conceit</a> (in the second sense) with no substantive evidence of significance or currency. Disclaimer: I am a great fan of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hooke_6579.html" title="Robert Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> and if it were Hookemas... I'd still have AfD'd it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> of the four external reference links in the article - one is some guys homepage where he admits that that not many people are celebrating newtonmas but asks us to "trust him" that its going to be "a big hit" (and also please click on some of his ad links); the second link is to an obscure, bare webpage on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> which lists brief mentions of a few holidays including Newtonmas as well as "Speck Day" which is to celebrate the 1996 event of a speck of dust "inspiring" a wannabefamous transhumanist, Darren Reynolds (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22darren+reynolds%22+speck&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22darren+reynolds%22+speck&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Googling "Darren Reynolds" and speck give a grand total of 3 (three) google hits</a>); the third links is to an article which uses the coincidence of Newton's birthday and Christmas to make a pun in its title but does not mention Newtonmas as a festival; the fourth link is to a excerpt from an obscure science fiction story where "Gravmas" is celebrated in China (Europe has suffered some kind of apocalyptic decline) some time around the <i><b>38th century</b></i> (I'd mention that wikipedia is not a crystal ball, but this is just ridiculous). And finally the 1984 radio broadcast by Michael E. Marotta mentioned in the article is totally unreferenced and, in any case, is not evidence of an actual festival. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. My main concern with marginally-notable holidays is that by WP endorsing it, WP becomes a promoter (Google scrapes WP in no time, it seems, and puts the WP entry at the top of the list) and hence WP becomes a holiday-maker. That is an active role that is unacceptable for a <i>neutral observer</i>, which WP must remain. However, in this case I found <a href="http://agnosticism.tribe.net/thread/2ba9a16c-0499-4142-a504-f5933eeaff54" class="external text" title="http://agnosticism.tribe.net/thread/2ba9a16c-0499-4142-a504-f5933eeaff54" rel="nofollow">this</a>, on a fairly popular site, which shows me that we won't be first to embrace this new holiday. Another criterion I have is whether any commercial or money making enterprise is banking on its promotion - in this case I don't see it. Add the 'WP is not paper' policy to it, and it becomes a keeper.</s> <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:11, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. After some more Googling, I think we are too late on this one, it looks like an old version of the article on WP <i>did</i> act as a promoter, and now the cat's out of the bag.

<li>Well I am neutral on this, but 'atheist' is POV - if enough people of any persuasion celebrate something it becomes notable. Also, XMas to the best of my knowledge started out as a pagan holiday long BC.

<dd>I'm very aware that XMas (sic) started out as a pagan holiday, I celebrate Yule, not Christmas.

<dd>I will try to make it as clear as I can. <i>Every</i> single holiday or tradition is 'made up'. The only issue for us here in 'admitting' is whether it is <i>notable</i> enough or not. We don't judge notability by our <i>opinion</i> of it or by whether we like the name, or whether we like the people that celebrate it. We base notability <i>solely</i> on reliable and verifiable sources that tell us whether it is 'widely celebrated', at least among some communities. Note that I withdrew from voting on this particular topic, so my point is generic. You can have the last word. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
