<p>Non-notable game. "Small fanbase", "in testing phase", "will not be released for a long while". Contested prod. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 09:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Small Fanbase" isnt really that small, there are over 500 people on the forums alone. It is in a testing phase much like Dark Throne, in that it is still playable in the testing phase. FP has been running for over 2 years and it is constantly being upgraded.--<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerlob_f959.html" title="User:Terlob">Terlob</a> 09:40, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even though the game may be small in comparison to games like runescape and darkthrone, forgotten planets player base is strong. Most of the people that play forgotten planets would state it's a great game. I personally do not think that forgotten planets is in testing phase anymore as the DEVS have said they will always continue to release new features to the game. --Lowrie 10:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Does this game not get the same rights as others who have articles in Wikipedia already? There is nothing wrong with starting a new article about an ongoing game that has reached a lot of people. There is no advertisement for FP, its just like any other game article. If anybody deletes the Forgotten Planets Wiki page, I will rebuild it every time and protest that every other game in Wikipedia be deleted also.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This game has made astounding achievements and been given incredibly high reviews. G4tv came close to showing it on national television even. The player involvement in the game is legendary and Forgotten Planets just keeps reaching new heights. Delete this article and in the future you'll find yourself wishing you hadn't. It's a success story, a story of what a game should be like, clean, fun, with players influencing how it is made, astounding graphics, and so much more.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>Though there are not millions of people playing FP, the community is quite unique, The relationship between Developers and players is quite unique and they work hard to keep the game running well, and they listen to suggestions placed on the forums. The gameplay is also quite different that any other mmorpg that i have played. Beta testing ended almost 8 months ago. If you consider this phase of the game development the testing phase, then forgotten planets will never leave the testing phase, the developers are always working on new ways to make the game better and funner to play. I have been playing this game since almost the beginning of beta testing, and the developers keep adding stuff to keep the game interesting. I think that this game has been out long enough, and has a dedicated enough fanbase to be allowed a page on wikipedia. If other games get to have pages without anyone complaining, then why cant Forgotten Planets, ask any player and they will say that it deserves it.A crazy cranium 07:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b> You're more than welcome to nominate, within reason, any article you feel qualifies for deletion. When that page is nominated, a vote will occur just like this one, and if a consensus is reached, the page will remain or be deleted, depending on the outcome. This vote, however, is only for Forgotten Planets. Pointing to other articles does not increase the notability of this article. If your crusade uncovers other unnotable articles, I appreciate your help, as they too should be deleted if they're similar to this one. My vote on this article, however, remains delete. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 21:11, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the original creator of the game. I agree, we are "small" and could probably be considered as in testing. Though, as has been pointed out we'll probably always be in a testing phase since our community is always offering suggestions as to what to add -- basically, there's no foreseeable end to the programming and development of ForgottenPlanets. If our entire "existence" is based on forever development, then what's wrong with being "in testing" that should eliminate our entry to the Wiki? In fact, that alone makes us a unique entry. In addition, many other games have been in Beta/Testing and still had articles on Wiki - those games are classified the same as us and yet they are still here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do believe that the existence of this page in of itself shows the loyalty of the fan-base. I was unaware of the page's existence until recently. I do believe it should be pointed out that all opinions expressed here are not endorsed by Moon Lit Software and should not be taken advertisements, but simply the fans' excitement about the game.</p>
<p><b>In either case, for all fans of the game who want to post here, please keep things civil. Threats of other deletions won't help anyone's cause and only ruins what Wiki is.</b></p>
