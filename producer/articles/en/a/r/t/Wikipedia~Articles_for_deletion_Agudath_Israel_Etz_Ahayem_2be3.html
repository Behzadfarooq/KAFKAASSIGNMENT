<li><b>Keep</b> all of these for now. Please <b>renominate a few separately, but only after considering other and better options.</b> This is not a good group-nomination. There are a few possibly "deletes" here, another few which I'd like to see kept, and a few which could possibly be merged. A few appear recent and architecturally undistinguished (<a href="../../../b/27/n/B%27nai_Avraham_Synagogue_c53c.html" title="B'nai Avraham Synagogue">B'nai Avraham Synagogue</a>, building purchased 1995) or focus on seemingly non-notable minor congregations (<a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavneh_Minyan_95b2.html" title="Yavneh Minyan">Yavneh Minyan</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harford_Jewish_Center_b109.html" title="Harford Jewish Center">Harford Jewish Center</a>), and these should be nominated separately. Several of the others appear to be about synagogues or congregations from the mid-19th century and the oldest or one of the oldest in various American cities, such as <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baith_Israel-Anshei_Emeth_Synagogue_382d.html" title="Baith Israel-Anshei Emeth Synagogue">Baith Israel-Anshei Emeth Synagogue</a> (Brooklyn, congregation from 1856, synagogue from 1855 but originally a church and acquired in 1905; family synagogue of <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Copland_c134.html" title="Aaron Copland">Aaron Copland</a>). At the very least, the better-written of these articles should be merged into articles on more general topics such as the History of the Jews in San Francisco. I am sure such articles could be written. <a href="../../../b/n/e/Bnei_Yisrael_%28Karaite_synagogue%29_453d.html" title="Bnei Yisrael (Karaite synagogue)">Bnei Yisrael (Karaite synagogue)</a> is a rather pointless stub but claims that it is "the only Karaite synagogue in the United States" - that suggests just redirecting to the general article on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaite_Judaism_18eb.html" title="Karaite Judaism">Karaite Judaism</a>, where this synagogue is mentioned, would be the best option.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, per Uppland. With all due respect to the nominator it looks as if this might need more eyes. How about an RfC or a Wikiproject discussion for a group view on which should be nominated, which merged to their local community and which kept?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sure there are verifiable sources related to them, but they simply are not notable. Tons of articles on topics and places with over 50 years of history have been deleted from Wikipedia because they weren't notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> all.

But honestly, look at those articles - the oldest continuously operated synagogue in Brooklyn (over 150 years) is not notable?

<li><b>keep all</b> renominate each individually.

<li><b>Keep all</b> First of all I am really aversed to mass-nominations, if you are not sure of the notability of a topic you go by a case by case basis, you don't nominate every single article in the subject for deletion. Second of all, I really do not understand the nominator's reasoning, most of these synagogues seem notable enough for a wikipedia article. This entire episode really reminds me of the hundred or so nominations by <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">User:PZFUN</a>.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 19:30, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jayjg and others. I want to add that these synagogues are not just *well, for almost all( notable in and of themselves / these pages cumulatively document a historical geography of the Jewish people. My suggestion is instead of deleting these articles - or even articles on Churches or lighthouses - we rethink them. I used to be opposed to all "lists" because I thought what is the point of just a list? But now I realize, as Wikipedia has grown and as our coverage has grown both in scale and complexity, that series of articles like these can fulfil a very valuable function. A list of lighthouses, for example, is not just a series of articles on tourist sites or points of possible architectural interest. They can provide a historical geography of maritime history, illustrating how the organization of regional and global shipping has changed over the years with new technologies, new forms of consumer demand, etc. Similarly, I do not think a series of articles on "churches" should just be about buildings - these buildings illustrate important moments in the history of a geographically dispersed phenomena, it is a whole other way of writing about religion. Now, there happens to be a fair amount of research in historical geography so I am not making this up, and I bet there are very good secondary sources one could draw on in using those articles to map out the historical geography of different religious movements. I see this request for deletion as an opportunity to take stock of just what Wikipedia can do. I urge not only that these articles be kept but that editors working on them coordinate their efforts to ensure that the articles (synagogues) on this list not only talk about buildings, but use these buildings to talk about where and when Jewish communities have waxed and waned. The result of this kind of work on these articles (and similar series) can really push wikipedia further as a scholarly resource. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:07, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>To refine my perspective...I went with "keep all" in agreement with Uppland's recommendation, but I think Jossi actually offers a better proposal... While those synagogue articles that deal with congregations that aren't particularly noteworthy on their own, from an encyclopedic standpoint, specifically, they <i>are</i> noteworthy from the perspective of the history of Judaism in the US [or whereëver else, for that matter]... If a synagogue isn't noteworthy on its own, specifically <i>sufficiently</i> noteworthy to warrant its own article, it is, more likely than not, sufficiently noteworthy to warrant mention and some coverage in a more wide-ranging article such as Synagogues in San Francisco, or...and here's what's swaying my perspective, Synagogues in Wisconsin... Three <i>defunct</i> synagogues, and that's only the ones that come immediately to mind, in Wisconsin (in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison%2C_Wisconsin_c802.html" title="Madison, Wisconsin">Madison</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevens_Point%2C_Wisconsin_0d5e.html" title="Stevens Point, Wisconsin">Stevens Point</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleton%2C_Wisconsin_37b2.html" title="Appleton, Wisconsin">Appleton</a> are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, yet <i>none</i> of them, in my view, are sufficiently noteworthy to warrant independent articles. I know there are 3 defunct synagogues in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superior%2C_Wisconsin_215f.html" title="Superior, Wisconsin">Superior</a>, 2 in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheboygan%2C_Wisconsin_44e5.html" title="Sheboygan, Wisconsin">Sheboygan</a>, and one in <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashland%2C_Wisconsin_218f.html" title="Ashland, Wisconsin">Ashland</a>, as well... All of which probably wouldn't warrant mention in Encyclopedia Brittanica, but <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. I think a failure to understand that concept is probably what prompted this nomination, especially where that concept butts heads with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. And so, I'm going to refine my opinion to <b>keep all, merging into appropriately-named articles where warranted</b>. To clarify, I'm strongly opposed to this group nomination, but I think it has been a beneficial exercise nonetheless. If my view holds sway, the aftermath would probably be most productively pursued at <a href="../../../j/e/w/WP%7EJEW_276f.html" title="WP:JEW">WikiProject Judaism</a>... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
