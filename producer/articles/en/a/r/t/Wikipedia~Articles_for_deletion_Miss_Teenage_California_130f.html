<p>The Miss California Teen USA Pageant is a BEAUTY CONTEST. Miss Teenage California is an extablished scholarship competition for young women, and attractiveness of the contestant's is only a part of the overall young woman the pageant attracts. Candidates are for the most part involved in school and community and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. The pageant is notable because each year the winner is NOT the only contestant who wins significant awards. The runners up in the 2007 Miss Teenage California Pageant will win college scholarships of $5,000, $4,000, $3,000, and $2,000 respectively. I believe their are no significant scholarships awarded at Miss California USA, and the winner of the California's OUtstanding Teen Pageant last year won a $1,500 college scholarship.

<p>Esperanza, Apologies. So new to wikipedia.com Learning as I'm going here.24.23.51.248laceydog</p>
<p>Esperanza, please note that the Miss Teenage California Scholarship Pageant is nothing like Miss California Teen USA or California's Outstanding Teen Pageant. There is no swimsuit or talent competition at Miss Teenage California. The competitive categories are Achievements &amp; Activities, Personality, Poise &amp; Appearance in Formal Wear. Miss Teenage California was founded in 1980, Miss California Teen USA in 1983, and California Outstanding Teen in 2005. 24.23.51.248 08:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)laceydog</p>
<p>If truth be known the Miss Teenage California Scholarship Pageant existed long before either the Miss California Teen USA and California Outstanding Teen Pageant which is relatively new. These are established facts. The rpize package for Miss Teenage California stands alone as being among the top prize packages in the nation for a state pageant. This is the 28th consecutive year for Miss Teenage California. (See list of winners)</p>
<p>There is nothing of an "ad nature" in the article. The address of the production company, phone number are not even mentioned. Everything contained in the article is FACTUAL. "Esperanza" seems to think that simply because one girl goes to a nationally televised pageant it suddenly adds credence to the system. I beg to differ. Look at the website, study the prizes being awarded, the history of the event as the facts do indeed speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Non-notable state pageant? Miss Teenage California annually has over 200 contestants from every corner of the state. By comparison Miss California Teen USA has between 45-75. You also may wish to check out the prize differences. Our program has existed since 1980 and is the largest teen scholarship pageant in the nation.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_Teen_USA_c066.html" title="Miss California Teen USA">Miss California Teen USA</a> pageant has dozens of local feeder pageants. Those 45-75 entrants were all winners of local or county pageants, which totalled many thousands of entrants. The winner of that pageant will go on to the nationally televised <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Teen_USA_1b59.html" title="Miss Teen USA">Miss Teen USA</a> pageant. Your contestants will go where? There is no comparison between the two. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>You need to check your facts. The Miss California USA Pageant and teen division NOW have very, very few local preliminary pageants. It is almost entirely at-large. If one is to make verbost statements, please back up with fact. Years ago the pageant had several local pageants. The pageant is now almost entirely at-large with few exceptions.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The remaining difficulty is notability. There are no references on this article. Forget google count - there are some google hits that seem to describe this pageant - but these all seem to be blogs and the like. What would help is providing multiple non trivial <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, such as an LA Times article on this pageant or something similar.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 23:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Esperanza had mentioned in response earlier, that their are other " far more important pageants", and she gave reference to both Miss California Teen USA and California's Outstanding Teenager. While I'm willing to update and change information for suitablity I take som offense to these remarks simply because they are not based in fact. Here are the facts. The Miss Teenage California Pageant was founded in 1980. Miss California Teen USA some years thereafter and the California's Outstanding Teen Pageant is only two years old. These are facts. More facts? The winner of the California's Outstanding Teen Pageant won a $1,500 college scholarship. Our winner receives a $10,000 college scholarship and $5,000 cash. The Miss California Teen USA winner receives very little in comparison to our state winner. Both of the other mentioned pageants that Esperanza notes, do not offer substantial college scholarships to their runners-up. It is a fact our 4th runner up at Miss Teenage California receives more than the winner of the Ca. Outstanding Teen Pageant. I would further go on to state that someone who wishes for me to provide "reliable sources" does not even know how to spell the word "pageant" correctly.</p>
<p>I wish for someone to be exact in the criticism of input, as EVERYTHING mentioned is factual.

<p>The definition of "notability" is vague at best, and doesn't constitute basic facts that exist in the text. Wikipedia needs to do a better job in explaining this. It's rather "wordy" diatribe hardly makes it easier for the layman to contribute.</p>

<dd>This may help to clarify <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notability</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Of these, one is from Pageant News Bureau, which covers all pageants, even squitty little ones, so that doesn't prove much. The first one is good, although its more about the locals than the state pageant, the rest are just lists of scholarships and I can't see that establishing notability. Others might disagree, but that's just my opinion. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> â€¢ <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 01:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> the issue is that the winners didn't go to Miss USA or whatever <i>because</i> they were Miss Teenage California, but because they later won other titles. Quite a few of the other titles you noted are notable, but things like "Miss Teen of the Nation Pageant", "Miss North American Teen ", "Miss U.S. Teen Pageant ", "Miss Intercontinental", "America's Perfect Teen " are not. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> â€¢ <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 18:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Miss Teen of the Nation is an extablished national pageant of over 20 years duration. Miss North American Teen, Miss U.S. Teen and America's Perfect Teen Pageants are no longer, however I seriously doubt those title holders, and their families would deem them not noteworthy.</li>

<p>Further, it is important to mention that Miss Teenage California is a scholarship program which offers their winner the OPTION of competing at a national pageant. It is an independent, as participation in a national pageant is just one prize that can be accepted or declined by the winner of the state pageant. I believe the winners of Miss Teenage California might be more interested in the $10,000 college scholarship and $5,000 cash, rather than competing in a winner take all nationally televised event, where the runners up receive very little. All of that data can easily be verified.
