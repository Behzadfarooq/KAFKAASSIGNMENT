<p>I am nominating this article for deletion second time. First time according to my count <i>27 votes were for deletion and 19 for keeping</i>. The deletion votes were coming more regularly in the end but it was closed. If the admin had extended it closing deadline then we might had reach on a consensus. The reasons of deleting it are many. <b>(1)</b> The sources used for making other sites as third holiest sites are not reliable. Mostly the criterion of number of people visiting a site is used to make it holiest for Muslims then our third holy site <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>. <b>(2)</b> A very vast majority of Muslim agree that third holiest site is <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> article could have a section for small minority not agree with it. Creating a new separate article looks like a effort to make our claim of majority disputed and a conspiracy against Muslims. <b>(3)</b> The references that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is indeed third holiest site (nothing else) are very strong. We have many hadiths from Sahih Bukahri and others. Furthermore, also it was place towards where Muslim used to offer their Prayer instead of Kaba in Mecca. It is our Kabla-Awal (first Kaba). How could something be holiest than our Kabla-awal? Please do not use CNN/Fox as a source to tell Muslim that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is no more third holiest to us. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 09:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not really subjective but some people are trying to make it subjective in this article. For example: a hadith from Sahih Bukhari: <i>"the Prophet of Allah Muhammad said a prayer in the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca) is worth 100,000 prayers; a prayer in my mosque (in Medina) is worth 1,000 prayers; and a prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is worth 500 prayers more than in an any other mosque</i>. Also another hadith says: <i>... Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques: Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem).</i>[Sahih Bukhari: Volume 3, Book 29, Number 87]. This article try to conspire against our Kabla-awal. Muslims have ever offer prayer towards only two places Kaba in Mecca and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>. But they are telling us other sites are more holiest to us. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 10:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(2) there is an ongoing dispute over the status of the noble sanctuary because it is also the temple mount, the holiest site of judaism (3) it is quite obvious where amoruso stands in that particular debate.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_f296.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Third holiest site in Islam">previous AfD</a> was closed (by me) a couple of days ago as "no consensus". This should really be an issue for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, and in hindsight maybe I should have relisted the AfD to attain a better consensus. Anyway, this is an article that seems to deal with an issue that is somewhat potentially inflammatory (weasel wording intended). I do not know the fundamental details of this issue, but I can see that there are differing views on the matter. From what I can see, there is some substance to the claims made in the article. Perhaps an acceptable compromise can be reached if an article named Holy sites in Islam or Muslim Holy Sites, in which the holy sites were not ranked, was created.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 11:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">User:ALM scientist</a> lists the reasons for deletoing as follows:
<ol>
<li>The sources used for making other sites as third holiest sites are not reliable. Mostly the criterion of number of people visiting a site is used to make it holiest for Muslims then our third holy site Al-Aqsa Mosque.
<ul>
<li>How can you clarify this? I read that The Imam Ali mosque received more pilgrims? Besides, all along it has been argued that this has nothing to do with it, but rather it is the 3rd holiest b/c of Koran, hadith etc!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A very vast majority of Muslim agree that third holiest site is Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Aqsa Mosque article could have a section for small minority not agree with it. Creating a new separate article looks like a effort to make our claim of majority disputed and a conspiracy against Muslims.
<ul>
<li>This was originally included in a section in Al Aqsa mosques, but was removed after complaints and a new article was created to conform with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">W:NPOV</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The references that Al-Aqsa Mosque is indeed third holiest site (nothing else) are very strong. We have many hadiths from Sahih Bukahri and others. Furthermore, also it was place towards where Muslim used to offer their Prayer instead of Kaba in Mecca. It is our Kabla-Awal (first Kaba). How could something be holiest than our Kabla-awal? Please do not use CNN/Fox as a source to tell Muslim that Al-Aqsa Mosque is no more third holiest to us.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There have been thorough arguments against this notion discussed in the previous deletion attempt. CNN/Fox are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">reliable sources</a> whether you like it or not! <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Like I've said before, this article is an indiscriminate collection of links with no regard to <i>factual accuracy</i> or reliability. <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of Information</i>. Several of the sources are not reliable sources and are <i>not in accordance with WP:Verifiability, WP:Reliable Sources</i> (Several self published sources and no 3rd party analysis to back the sources) and <i>Undue Weight</i> is given to self published sources. While one can try to assume good faith, the creator(s)/major contributors themselves have expressed the political/religious inclinations they wish to satisfy by creating this article. It's unreasonable to assume good faith on part of users who openly declare that they are acting in bad faith. Therefore I feel this article was written in <i>Bad faith</i>, and on top of that <i>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</i>. Also, most of the article is just a collection of obscure external links which just say "site is third holiest" without any theological reason. So, that's a <b>lot</b> of policies violated. There were attempts to improve the article, but the long edit wars prove that this <i>cannot be done</i>. Finally, any credible information in this article has already been added to the respective articles of any site, so this article can be safely deleted without any loss of information. I also humbly request certain users that are in favour of keeping this article to refrain from resorting to insulting/flaming the users that want it deleted - and discuss the article itself. Also, I request some users that want it deleted to keep their cool. Any fears of "Only Muslims controlling what is said about Islam on wikipedia" are completely unfounded and keeping such an article is not the proper way to address such fears. If people readily accept whatever is written on the internet and everything was factually correct, wikipedia would not be required, Google would suffice. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">thestick</a> 14:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG SPEEDY DELETE</b>: Per my input at the previous AFD request. The article misinterprets the various weak citations given and jump to conclude that for example Eyup Mosque is the "Third Holiest site in Islam". I wonder which Islam is this? Turkish Islam? or Turkish Cypriot Islam or what? How many Islams are there?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem's status is recognised in the authentic Islamic sources of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a> that has been agreed upon by all Muslims since 14 centuries.

<dd>Much of the sites listed here may be enlisted, and some have been already been enlisted, at this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and should not be listed under a controversial title like "Third Holiest site in Islam" if rigor and scholarship is to be maintained. Certainly the title "Third Holiest site in Islam" implies that this is a status given in the religion of Islam and relates to all Muslims regardless of being in Turkey or Pakistan or Tunisia. This title is to the common 3 cities notable to all muslims regardless of where they happen to be. Again to the Turkish example, it does not seem that Muslims give this recognition and embark on a journey to visit the mosques in Turkey and the Turkish Northern Cyprus Republic. Similar thing can be said to al-Juwanah mosque and so forth.</dd>

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b> - the article and topic are sourced and encyclopaedic. Reopening a previous discussion that was obviously never going to come to a conclusion (although it's clear anyone acting in good faith will conclude this article is a keep). AfD is not a vote, and exactly zero rational has been advanced for deletion that can be claimed to hold any water at all.

The same news sites on which some sites were mentioned as third holiest write the Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest in other articles (which is why some believe they shouldn't be used as sources for theological subjects and especially given more importance than the scriptures of the religion).

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. It is an interesting article. I never knew that so many places have been considered the third holiest in the islam. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">Gidonb</a> 19:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and merge salvageable parts in the relevant article on the Mosque. The reason is that this article is merely a list of mostly non-notable utterances by non-scholarly media sources, and as such, does not warrant an entry into an encyclopedia except (and forgive me for saying this) for malicious intentions. It would be one thing if this article documents actual scholarly references to various sites that are regarded as the 'third holiest', but this article actually is a compilation of quotes by various individuals or media organisations - that mostly have no scholarly knowledge of the subject and would probably stand corrected if confronted - that <i>passingly referred</i> to some site or another as the "third holiest" for Muslims. "Passive reference" from sources such as a reporter or a member of a non-relevant organisation is not grounds to creating an encyclopedic article. If this article was quoting people who actually know what they are talking about, e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Armstrong_ba0b.html" title="Karen Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a>, it would be a different story. But as it stands now, it makes a mockery out of the Wikipedia project. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, at least she <b>is</b> a writer on religion, which these sources are not. <i>And that's the point:</i> The vast majority of the sources used in this article are NOT sources that are discussing the "level of holiness" of the Aqsa Mosque. These are just random utterances in passing by people who were not saying what they said to make an argument about what is or is not the third holiest site in Islam. If this article stays, it would need to be encyclopedic - meaning that it would have to include sources that are making an argument about the holiness of the Mosque and not just news clippings of quotations being uttered <i>in passing</i> by people who are actually emphasizing a different matter entirely. That is why this article is just disingenuous and horribly misleading and un-encyclopedic. I personally (or impersonally) don't really care about categorizing physical structures in terms of holiness to a particular religion - but what I do care about is good editing and sound articles.

Thus, having separate articles for both amounts to having two separate articles for the exact same thing. Merge whatever material is here that isn't on the Mosque's page, delete this article and have it redirect to the third holiest site in Islam.

<b>Here is my 2 cents worth</b>: I would like to ask why there is no article called "First Holy City in Islam" or "Second holy City in Islam"? I think there is enough junky material on the Web that can support such a WikiPedia article if the same standards for creating the third holiest article are followed. For example, only one hour of so-called research I spent on the Web was enough for me to collect to citations that disupte that Madina is the second Holiest city in Islam. Here are these citations</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the new arguments for "keep," where they seem sincere, elevate procedure over policy. Where the arguments for "keep" sincerely concern content questions, I repeat again that any actual "controversy" here could and should be discussed on pages devoted to articles on respective sites, using authoritative sources. I myself harbor no illusions regarding the nature of this piece, and I assume its more vigorous defenders don't either, so I will be frank: WP is not a soapbox, nor a battleground. The authors of this piece seem to me to want to use WP to bait Muslims with a made-up "controversy" regarding their sacred sites, and they have done so. I am sure that anyone here who has previously encountered long-term, complex editing abuse in other subject areas recognizes the systematic and sustained pattern of exploitation of policy for mischievous purposes that we see here. We have also seen before how WP procedures for addressing the problems caused by partisan posters are defeated when more than a few gather to prevent corrective action based on "a consensus." While it is clear, given the nature of this dispute, that a "consensus" cannot be achieved realistically, it is also clear that, given the references this article lines up, "the controversy" this article seeks to establish does not exist in any substantial form anyway. Those of you in the US may be aware of a particular Fox News commentator who uses the network to flog sales of a sensationalist book he wrote on a "liberal conspiracy against Christmas." This is exactly that kind of shallow, partisan scholarship, entirely intended to cause a ridiculous dispute, that I am seeing the WP mainspace, procedures and policy being exploited to perpetuate here. As some of the comments in this AfD and the last one show, there are people in the real world and on WP who are gullible enough to believe "any" reference, or "any" article, even on WP, substantiates "anything." --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 02:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment:</b> As written above, I'd like to point people to the history of the article. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque&amp;diff=74315812&amp;oldid=74298467" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque&amp;diff=74315812&amp;oldid=74298467" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>. <b>This information was moved into a different article because of MUSLIM CONCERNS of UNDUE WEIGHT ON <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Al Aqsa Mosque</a> article</b>.

<li><b>Keep if thoroughly improved</b> This my-site-is-holier-than-yours-business has been around forever. Sectarian dispute, aided by scholarly opinion even led to minor warfare around this issue. (<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alevites.html" title="Alevites">Alevites</a> can tell you...) There still isn't consensus (not even about the 2nd holiest site, btw.), only a strong majority opinion. If, and only if, somebody would morph the article into a disinterested overview of the history of "holy-site ranking" disputes, the article has merit. As it is, it's just sectarian mud-slinging. Also, the name "Third holiest site in Islam" is obviously awkward, to say the least. But the concept has merit. <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzate_9435.html" title="User:Azate">Azate</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article cannot be maintained in a NPOV state. The reason for that is the fact that the article was created to settle scores in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The fact that you could in principle have a bona fide article on this subject doesn't mean that we should keep this article. Similarly, if Neo-Nazis were to create an article about genocides with the intent of diminishing the Jewish Holocaust, you would have little chance that the usual wiki procedures would be effective in producing a NPOV article on that subject. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 14:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
