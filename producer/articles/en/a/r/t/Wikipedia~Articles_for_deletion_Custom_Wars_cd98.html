<dd>WP:NOT a soapbox for launching your video game project. It goes the other way around, my friend: you have to be well-known to have a page here. You can't make the article and hope that the article will bring you enough links to make your project well-known. That just doesn't make sense. And this wiki has nothing to do with prediction. That's quite correct, and means that we can't predict anything about this video game. If you are a developer and are putting information about your work, this is original research and needs to be verified for inclusion anyway. --<a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontom</a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_Esperanza_41c3.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">rs2k4</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../m/1/s/User_talk%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_b66e.html" title="User talk:M1ss1ontomars2k4">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_M1ss1ontomars2k4_ef71.html" title="Special:Contributions/M1ss1ontomars2k4">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_M1ss1ontomars2k4_0011.html" title="Special:Emailuser/M1ss1ontomars2k4">@</a>)</sup> 19:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see no reason why this is up for deletion. Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia. Therefore, it should contain articles on everything. Custom Wars is something. So it deserves an article.

<p>The Wikipedia subtitle is "The Free Encyclopedia". One, it doesn't cost money, and two...it's supposed to be free, meaning that as long as an article is not illegal, flaming, or incorrect, it deserves a place on wikipedia. This article is not an advertisment, we are a legitimate movement, and alot of work has been done on Custom Wars. As I said above, it deserves some recognition, not just people deleting it because "it doesn't have signifigant press coverage" This is supposed to be a free (meaing freedom) encyclopedia. Therefore, things that don't have much press coverage should be able to get in. Deleting something because it isn't well known is against the spirit, in my opinion, of wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Davidhowland14 (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidhowland14_66f8.html" title="User talk:Davidhowland14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davidhowland14_a51c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davidhowland14">contribs</a>) 19:08, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I can't agree more with VGN...Wikipedia is supposed to be community built. Custom Wars is a large effort 180+ members, over 20,000 posts...why doesn't it deserve recognition?

<li>Hello, I'm fox. I'm in charge of CW, and I'd like to explain something to you who vote for delete. Advance Wars, the game that this is based off of, is a popular game. It has a fairly large community of websites and forums, most of which contain thousands of members. This, Custom Wars, is going to be the biggest thing in the AW community that has ever happened. It will be mentioned everywhere, and I see no reason why you shouldn't consider that noteworthy. If we fail to gain the attention I expect, I will personally delete or have deleted, the article. However, if you wish to delete it before then, then being the next couple of days, I would think of it as prejudice against a whole gaming community.</li>

If you guys can extend the deletion warning for 2 days I'll keep my word. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeLance_FoX_d736.html" title="User:FreeLance FoX">FreeLance FoX</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreeLance_FoX_42d4.html" title="User talk:FreeLance FoX">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FreeLance_FoX_2ba6.html" title="Special:Contributions/FreeLance FoX">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>In that case, you could always userify the page (move it to User:FreeLance FoX/Custom Wars) until the release occurs. That would avoid the potential deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 19:17, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm new here, so, could you explain how to do that, or do it if you could? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeLance_FoX_d736.html" title="User:FreeLance FoX">FreeLance FoX</a> 02:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
