<li><b>Delete</b> This seems to be an advertisement for an otherwise non-notable acting school. The author has been inserting links to this acting school in all the method-acting related websites, apperently to increase his Google hits <a href="http://bbs.backstage.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=22883&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1&amp;vc=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://bbs.backstage.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=22883&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1&amp;vc=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. What is claimed as "published works" are articles about acting posted on his own website or as paid advertisments in other websites. Google searches only bring up WP mirrors, or commercial listings to his acting schoool but no third-party sources that speak to his notability. He does have an occasional column in a popular casting website, but I don't think this counts as notable enough. See article's talk page for discussion about this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 15:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> For all the reasons you listed here. Mr. Bennett is not an important acting teacher in the New York acting scene. His school has existed just a little over a year. He is well know on acting message boards and websites for his aggressive, and sometimes disruptive, Internet marketing style but for little else. Perhaps he will someday be a notable in the New York acting scene but he has not earned that distinction yet. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 17:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I've stated elsewhere, Tree Trimer joined Wikipedia to try and stop Jason Bennett's work from being included in any page about acting. He is currently removing any reference to Jason Bennett, over and over again, calling it "advertising," even though comments about Jason Bennett and/or his school are often found among lists of many schools on Wikipedia pages, or among lists of many teachers whose work is being discussed in those pages. Tree Trimer is also urging other Wikipedia users to "vote for deletion," for example, Tree Trimer wrote on someone's user page: "Hello, I am a New York actor...Jason Bennett does not belong in the lists with famous actors and acting teachers.... Would you please go to his page (Jason Bennett) and vote for deletion? Thank you. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 07:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)" Tree Trimer is not interested in Wikipedia. He is interested only in trying to stop a colleague or former teacher of his: Jason Bennett. Think the book 1984. Remove the content you don't like, and hope the person goes away. If you doubt that Jason Bennett is well known in the professional acting community, all you have to is look at the testimonials on his web site of Broadway actors and Tony-nominated directors. Even Tree Trimer admits he knows who Jason Bennett is, that's the whole reason he came on Wikipedia. His whole campaign is an acknowledgement of the importance of Jason Bennett, he just doesn't like him. Sgactorny 13:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is not appropriate for you to put Jason Bennett's name among acting greats, and I am removing your ads. Both are true yet they are not evidence that you should be on Wikipedia. Even if the website testimonials that Jason Bennett is a great guy are true, that does not put Bennett up in the ranks of Konstantin Stanislavski, Lee Strasberg, Uta Hagen, Stella Adler, Eric Morris, Michael Chekhov, and Sanford Meisner. People seeking information about acting should not be deceived. I left a message for Whatcape because he commented on the inapproprateness of your insertions before I did. Check Whatcape's talk page. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 14:27, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> He isn't deleting "ads." He's deleting objective statements about Bennett's work. Calling them "ads" is just double-speak. Anything that mentions Bennett is an "ad" to him. The accusation that I'm Jason Bennett shows everyone just how personal this person's campaign is. Also, Whatcape inserted "Laura Esterman" and "Susan Batson" into pages. Are you on a campaign against them? How about Eric Morris? How about the Atlantic Theater School? Any others? Or is your campaign only limited to Jason Bennett? My point is rhetorical, there are many schools, books, articles and teachers listed on all the pages you keep singularly deleting Bennett from. It's like Orwell's "1984." Sgactorny 14:32, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The bottom line is that it is inappropriate for Jason Bennett's ads to appear in great acting teacher's bios. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 14:50, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The reasons listed here are incorrect or personal attacks by Tree Trimer communicated to Marcuse in talk pages. Tree Trimer does not want Bennett's views about acting seen by Wikipedia readers. Tree Trimer signed up on Wikipedia just to try and get rid of Jason Bennett's page, look at his history. He is perhaps a former student or a competing acting teacher. Bennett's school has existed for many years, not one, and Bennett himself has been teaching for over 12 years. Tree Trimer himself created the controversy on that other web site, then came on here and pretended a controversy existed that actually doesn't. If you click the above link, put there by Marcuse to reference that conflict originally created by Tree Trimer, you will see that Backstage (the nation's largest acting industry weekly), which supports Bennett's work and has profiled his school, has removed the libelous posts from their web site. I am the person who made the page for Bennett, because I am a working actor in New York. Most everyone I work with and know knows and respects his work in the professional acting community in New York. If you look on his testimonials page, you will see endorsements from Tony-nominated directors, psychologists from around the world, and all kinds of professional actrs. Just reading his biography is a powerful testament of the work he does. The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, one of the schools he went, is the best musical theater school in the country. Eric Morris is a Master Acting Teacher who trained Jason Bennett. Bennett's extends his legacy with his work, as well as the legacies of the other Master teachers whose pages he was linked to in the "see also" and "External links" section. That's why I put his work there, to educate the readers because it's perfectly appropriate and correct. Nothing I wrote ever said Jason Bennett was the best around, or anything like that. I wrote facts about him. Readers deserve to read the facts about Bennett. Bennett has had articles on Playbill.com, a major web site for performers across the country; in "The Soul of the American Actor," a national newspaper devoted to actors; on NYCastings.com, a web site that distrubutes his articles to 15,000 actors and performers every two weeks. Backstage.com has profiled his school and faculty numerous times. Bennett's faculty is composed of five famous teachers, one of which is a professor at New York University, one of which is on the board of one of the most famous dance companies in the world, one of whom has been teaching actors in Los Angeles for over 30 years, one of whom has been trained by many well-known New York acting teachers, and the other is a well-respected Master Voice teacher. Bennett's web site is listed on web sites of prominent acting schools all over the country. A school devoted to former Master teachers Lee Strasberg and Michael Chekhov both point to Bennett's work and his school. It is a personal mission of Tree Trimer to censor Bennett's page. That's all he came on here to do, and that's what he's doing. We shouldn't go along with it. Sgactorny 20:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is by the original author of the Bennett article. As far as I can tell he is the only one who attests to Bennett's notability but has not been able to provide external references. I cannot judge his claims since I am not an actor, however I have not found any third-part material about Bennett, that was not written by Bennett himself. I have also not found any material by Bennett that is not a paid advertisment except for the column in the castings website. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 22:30, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it looks like advertising to me. I can't see any difference between his acting school and any others that we might, but should not, advertise here. Furthermore there is a huge copyright violation with the entire "Professional experience" section being cut and pasted from <a href="http://www.jbactors.com/actingcoachesnewyork/jasonbennett.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jbactors.com/actingcoachesnewyork/jasonbennett.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which states at the bottom of the page that "all content is C. of the Jason Bennett Actor's Workshop".

<li><b>Delete</b>, for now, because perhaps this is an article whose time has just not yet come. The test of time will establish verifiability of the claims that Bennett and his faculty are revolutionizing actor training. For now, unless the author of the article or interested others are able and willing to cite specific references within the article, other than Mr. Bennett's website or advertising, to back up the statements in the article, it has to be considered a vanity piece. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELiniShu_c7be.html" title="User:LiniShu">Lini</a> 19:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable vanity, combined with aggressive editing to add puffery to other articles, like "[Adler's] legacy continues with the work of modern teachers like <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Bennett_ba0f.html" title="Jason Bennett">Jason Bennett</a>". The bio avoids clearly specifying whether Bennett actually studied with Adler or only studied her techniques from someone else. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 22:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
