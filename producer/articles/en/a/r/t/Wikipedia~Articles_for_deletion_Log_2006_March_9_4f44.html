<p>This article was speedied as "recreation of deleted content" but it isn't the case. The previous, speedily deleted version was:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Kaczism-a term connected with Lech Kaczynski who is a Polish politician and the president of the city of Warsaw,Poland; strongly Catholic and homofobic,didn`t let to organise a gay&amp;lesbian parade in Warsaw saying it`d be a parade of perverts and saying that if his part takes control it`ll be a "dark night for gay people".</dd>
<dd>So the word Kaczism describes the typically Catholic Polish attitude towards gay people.</dd>
</dl>
<p>which doesn't have much in common with the current version. The slogan is really used in Poland.</p>

<dd>Well, the <i>bushism</i> is IMHO quite questionable (will anyone remember it in 10 years?). If this approach is taken to extreme articles about <i>-isms</i> for every current president/prime minister/controversial politician would mushroom here, with associated wars and other fun. Instead of sopaboxing time should be spent on article improvement, e.g. <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaros%C5%82aw_Kaczy%C5%84ski_35af.html" title="Jarosław Kaczyński">Jarosław Kaczyński</a> is low quality stub. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 13:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DELETE Zophiel page is a disambig page I created this page to link from their to a page to contain Zophiel the angel/demon. I then found that he is listed under Jophiel hence this page isn't needed anymore as Zophiel links directly to Jophiel now. Someone removed prod without checking who created the page etc so can only delete this way now. Sorry for my cock up, contact me on my talk page for more info cheers!

<li>It isn't intended as an advertisment. The <b>next</b> public release (for a major milemark 2.0) is friday, we just wanted to get the page up here while we were thinking about it. This chat system has been around for years and is hardly 'non-notable'. Our main page has a Google page rank of 4 or 5 depending on the month we have well over 1000 registered members and have been releasing free tools on the internet since 2000. If there is something wrong with the way the page is worded, feel free to edit it. I honestly don't have the extra time to play cat and mouse over it. Thanks. Gipper 01:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not that anyone has anything against you or Stargate, and its a shame that this is your first article. Wikipedia is sort of a peer-reviewed encyclopedia, with guidelines for inclusion that are broader than a paper encyclopedia but narrower than '{the whole internet}'.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:12, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If I can throw in my two cents, basically what it comes down to is that fan fiction is generally not notable, and we don't want to include it, largely because there's so damn much of it. Seems that half the internet is people making up their own Trek or Jedi or Stargate stories, or, in this case, making an RPG out of it. We could clutter up half of Wikipedia with various forms of fanac, and we really don't want to do that. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I created the article to activate red links in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantinflas.html" title="Cantinflas">Cantinflas</a> article as part of the ongoing effort to raise to FA status. I don't think Moreno Ivanova's drug problem or corruption are particularly notable, but I do think Everyking has a point. That said, I think merging this "daughter" into its "parent" would unnecessarily lengthen the article. However, the result of this vote will help to determine what else <i>not</i> to link, because if his son isn't notable, then <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_Moreno_Laparade_63db.html" title="Eduardo Moreno Laparade">his nephew</a> (and the other links that are of equal note) sure isn't.--<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 08:03, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>To me, reading the article, it seems like the guy is the subject of at least occasional media attention, that he is a public figure in some sense (a minor celebrity, perhaps), and there's stuff published that deals with him in a substantial way (namely a tell-all autobiography by his ex-wife—apparently he's significant enough that scandalous information of that sort matters to some people).

<dd>There's nothing to merge, <i>everything</i> has been copy-pasted from the Armenian National Institute's website. I might as well have speedied it, perhaps I should have, but I wanted a [single] reference; I wanted complete transperency (for nonadmins, who can't read deleted text). And it isn't like the ANI is likely to sue in the next few days (though I invite admins to speedy it immediately/early), or that they would have sued at all. The fact remains that it is outright plagiarism (that is, the real author/s are not credited — the author of the article is effectively claiming their work as his or her own; unless s/he is the author, in which case, now's the time to say so). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I won't vote because I refuse to vote when I somehow feel involved, it is a copyvio, the language is unencyclopedic, we don't need a dozen of chronological articles one is enought and probably should be written, but it should be worked, discussed before being submited. The main article still has issues to work on, a lot of issues, starting to work on multiple chronological pages, ane even one is still much too soon. Also, even if it was to be rewritten according to ANI website, I can source many timelines that somehow disagree with eachothers, a chronological article will require a lot, a lot of work even if it is not apparent at first, it will require to read various chronological tables and select those dates that correspond with eachothers. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is a copyvio, it should be marked at such. In any case, requiring it to be "discussed before being submited" is hardly fair -- we don't require that of any other articles; we edit them as we go and improve them. It may be a lot of work, but it is most certainly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 03:19, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When it is a chronology pages meant to be an expantion of the main article on the subject, I think at least asking those involved in the main page is very welcome when the main page itself is controversial and prone to edit wars... starting a couple of timelines regardless if it is a copyvio is just not an OK thing to do, that they are copyvios make it even worst. Was it a documented encylopedic text prepared by the editor with a lot of sources, merging them would have been the solution, in this cases even when merging there still is the copyvio issue. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:42, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article was merged to the student unions article as many editors deemed McVeigh to only be notable in the context of the MUSU liquidation and it allowed the removal of rampant POV.

<li>I see. However, when an AfD results in no consensus, it usually is not renominated right away. Instead, there is a discussion of what is to be done or the issue is allowed to rest for a while. Also, if content has been merged to another article, it cannot be deleted, it must remain as a redirect to the article to preserve attribution for the GFDL. The edits of the contributors to the article must be visible in the history to non-admins. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>B&amp;B: it's not a bad list, but could just as well be a category (although we'd lose detail).

The Simpsons list is even more valuable, particularly the "Parody songs" part -- I mean, I had no idea that ""The Children are our Future" is a parody of an Ike and Tina Turner song, and my life is marginally enriched. <b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I can actually vouch for this article as it is my blog. The article itself was constructed by two University freinds turned hysterical fans/foes of the blog and while written in a rather ecentric way reflects the history and purpose of the blog quite well. Also scatalogically when looked up in the dictionary is a fancy way of saying that something is poo which isn't very nice for something that two people have put rather (too much) effort into. Also something which seems to be mocking the subject dosen't bring to mind vanity. We will have to agree to disagree on that one. <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudduh_d504.html" title="User:Pudduh">Pudduh</a> 14:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mostly little myspace pages and blogs and, after a few hundred, they only appear as individual words on giant keyword search lists - far from reliable sources. This already exists <a href="http://www.wikipb.com/wiki/Agg" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipb.com/wiki/Agg" rel="nofollow">here</a> and that's a good place for it (that link agrees with my original argument that it's simply an abbreviation of aggressive). At best, this is to be deleted and moved to wiktionary but I doubt it belongs there either. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:54, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The little myspace pages using it is the point- it means it's in widespread use. Also, I'm sure plenty of other people use it, but didn't also say "paintball" on that page, so it didn't show up in the Google search. As for it being on WikiPB (whatever that is, some little non-notable wiki shouldn't really count as having the information, especially when it isn't even a Wikimedia or even Wikicities wiki), that doesn't mean it's on Wikipedia- which is supposed to be the Internet's most expansive encyclopedia. The site is correct that it is a bit like the word "aggro," a term surfers have been using for about 20 years, but it's not exactly the same. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 04:51, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This topic is hopelessly non-NPOV. "Samurang" seems to be a neologism coined by the Kumdo school mentioned in the article, and I can find no mention of this theory outside the context of discussion of that school. This article seems to exist solely as an attack on that school and Kumdo in general. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> 03:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.In response to Krash, HOLE doesn't really apply here. He's won a legit award from Movies.com and a major indie award from Microcinema. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Microbefox (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMicrobefox_b84d.html" title="User talk:Microbefox">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Microbefox_f6a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Microbefox">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.So I took at these points into considerations. I just made it a simple page for Jesse and made a new Wiki page for Shades of Gray and removed a lot of the recalled information from what I know about the movie. --Microbefox 19:44, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.If this article needs a rewrite, then I guess many sub-headings will need to be cut. --Microbefox 18:43, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> any information relevant to <i>Shades of Gray</i> and <b>redirect</b> to <i>Shades of Gray</i> (film). The article as it currently stands looks far more reasonable than it did yesterday, but since his biggest claim to notability lies with <i>Shades of Gray</i>, and his awards are related to that, I'd say that the relevant infomation should be go there for now. The film itself, having won some awards and been reviewed on several independent sites, has, in my opinion, a stronger claim for inclusion. —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 02:51, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not really verifiable, almost everything out there seems to be what he's put up himself in an effort to establish some kind of online presence. At best I can confirm that he has one book, published through what looks like a vanity press, available from amazon.com, with a suspiciously high number of five-star reviews.

<li>I still think this nomination was appropriate because the article did not assert the word's history or provide sources; it presented the word as a neologism.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think that every editor of every magazine is notable enough for an encyclopedia article. These magazines that he lists do not even have articles on Wikipedia. I think that some demonstration of further contribution is necessary to demonstrate notability. Not to mention, autobiography generally seems to be a sign of a lack of notability. If you have to write an article about yourself, how notable can you be?

<li><b>Keep</b> the gallery was part of the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose.html" title="Rose">Rose</a> page. It got so big that it was decided that it should be split.

<li><b>Keep or listify</b>, useful and encyclopedic collection of pictures.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an important function of an encyclopedia. Please note that photos that are on Commons are not "here"; all that's here are links to them. As a result, the article Rose gallery is 18 kilobytes long.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> This page is useful, but however, if majorly these photos are from commons, the page should be move to the apporiate page in commons, and also create a link using {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECommons_44b0.html" title="Template:Commons">commons</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECommonspar_adad.html" title="Template:Commonspar">commonspar</a>}} to link between the article page and commons page. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinjiman_be11.html" title="User:Shinjiman">Shinjiman</a> ⇔ <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinjiman_bf0a.html" title="User talk:Shinjiman">♨</a> 04:20, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Most readers probably don't know what the commons even is until they have been editing for a while.

<p><b>Comment to enthusiasts</b> Sci-fi books have zillions of "not krank" concepts. Anything beyond the author's papers would be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, unless this concept was discussed elsewhere and you are summarizing it. Basing solely on the original works is still <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>.

Eric Drexler</a>'s idea and electrolaunchers are 80 year old idea now, if not older. Finally, it doesn't seem to be published in peer-reviewed journals.

<li><b>Merge to the Forrest Bishop rants, keep there.</b> Even a page about a minor nerd like Forrest Bishop belongs to WP, and optimally it should surely contain the list of his favorite meals as well as the ideas he trumpeted, including this one. But a mere combination of the rail gun with few nano cliches, fairly obvious to anyone who is not a technological analphabet, should not count for a hypothetical spacecraft, even though it may be one of zillions of valid design combinations.

<li>Yes, but that's not the point. People are nominating stuff for AfD on grounds that don't stand up to thirty seconds of Google research. If I can falisfy the claimed AfD justification with less than a minute's work... AfD <i>is not a substitute for cleanup tags</i> and improving articles. This needs to be added to the article, yes, but to get an article improved you stick a cleanup tag on it. Articles should be deleted if they aren't notable, aren't sourced at all, are truly original research, or are otherwise abusive. Needing cleanup and references are improvements not deletion criteria. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Few people graduate from a communications program without learning this concept. Try not to focus on the anecdotal example currently at the core of the article, but on the long recognized concept. Maybe it doesn't make sense to some people that others would accuse the left of policing their ranks with gatekeepers, but the article should not be about an anectode -- it should be about the concept. Every communications system has some kind of gatekeeper. This AfD process is a gatekeeper for Wikipedia. Here's a reliable source on the social science of gatekeeping: <a href="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoSaid__8085.html" title="User:WhoSaid?">WhoSaid?</a> 21:19, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Comment</i>: You might want to take a second look at the article.

<dd>Even though the article suffers from all the points I mentioned above, and probably more besides, HK is right about his statement above (i.e. it explains why some of the left media allegedly suppresses scandals:it's been bought off by the right). I don't know if this makes "plenty of sense," but it doesn't seem totally impossible, except that if it were true you'd expect the left media that hadn't been bought off to go over it, and seemingly it hasn't, only a handful of fringe websites. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. I think I came to the wrong conclusion because each is the article is verbose and the true idea (I don't like to call it a theory, as people confuse everyday "theories" with scientific theories) is nearly as improbable as the other. As Шизомби mentioned, some of the left media would not have gone along with it, especially those outlets that are controlled by an independent owner or a wealthy person who operates at a loss to spread his or her agenda. Also, we should be hearing from mainstream journalists that their stories have been suppressed by editors or owners, as journalists tend to be highly principled and often quit rather than violate those principles. The idea depends on the gatekeepers having an extreme amount of control over what is published and broadcast, and the silence of journalists, newscasters and editors, who the article characterizes as "left" (an assumption that the article gives no evidence for). Chip Berlet is given as an example of a gatekeeper, but he does not have the power to suppress media stories, even for the organizations he has worked for because he is simply a writer. Noam Chomsky does not either and he is actually known for his criticism of the U.S. government, according to his Wikipedia article. Norman Solomon is also a writer and his affiliation with a watchdog group and the institute he founded do not give him the power to suppress news. Writers can write stories that are supportive of the government or against its detractors, but that does not stop other writers from writing stories critical of the government. Also, gatekeeping writers' work is subject to change or suppression by the alleged "left" editors and owners. A gatekeeper would have to be in a position of great power within an organization and could not control multiple organizations without having someone powerful in on it at each one or using memorandums about which stories are inappropriate, which could be easily leaked. Even if a person is in a position to suppress articles, in a large organization almost any individual can be bypassed by going to someone in an equivalent position or at a higher one. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:56, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> This article appears to be well substantiated: <i>Self-described socialist Noam Chomsky has described the Pentagon as "the most vile institution on the face of the earth" and lashed out against tax havens and trusts that benefit only the rich. But Chomsky has been paid millions of dollars by the Pentagon over the last 40 years, and he used a venerable law firm to set up his irrevocable trust to shield his assets from the IRS</i> as an example.

<dd>Once again, a closer look at the article should answer your questions. "Gatekeeper" is not synonymous with "censor;" the version of the article that presently appears defines a gatekeeper as one who acts "to manage, constrain and co-opt the movement," or to "ostracize particular voices." I suppose that this could be done by "suppressing media stories," as you suggest, but it might also take the form of organizing campaigns of defamation against other, more uncooperative journalists. I also find your assertion that "journalists tend to be highly principled" to be a rather broad statement; consider, for example, the case of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29_9edf.html" title="Judith Miller (journalist)">Judith Miller</a>, merely the first one that comes to mind (in fact, she might be an appropriate example of a <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatekeeper_%28politics%29.html" title="Gatekeeper (politics)">gatekeeper</a>.) --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky"><font color="darkred"><font face="georgia">HK</font></font></a> 01:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you mean you or those sites will attack WP as a gatekeeper, or me? I hope that isn't what that means (WP has plenty of scandalous stuff about Bush, anyway). The Gatekeepers article is simply not neutral from the first part of the first sentence: "In political parlance, a gatekeeper or left gatekeeper" - right there: "political parlance"? Broad use by politicians or political scientists? 'Fraid not. One of the other problems I failed to mention was the lengthy list of alleged gatekeepers. I don't know if there's a specific policy on allegations on WP (there's no lists of alleged homosexuals or people alleged by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> to be reptilian humanoids for example, though some pages do mention allegations), but List of people described as neoconservatives got <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_described_as_neoconservatives_30cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people described as neoconservatives">deleted (see AfD)</a> for similar reasons. The Gatekeepers article simply uncritically reproduces a list of allegations from a nn site <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">WP is not a mirror</a> (in its original conception it collated allegations from several nn sites). The article's primary author (<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>) invited criticism to be added, but this theory seems to be so nn that apparently none of the major right, center, or left media has commented on it in the US or abroad. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Of course, POV alone is not a sufficient reason to vote delete. I do not see the article as a whole as an attack on Berlet, as only one paragraph mentions him by name.

<p>Keep-- I don't think foundation-subsidized folks should be able to censor material on the wikipedia website that reflects grassroots anti-war left awareness of the special influence that foundations play in U.S. left political and media life. Political Research Associates has published a journal, Public Eye, in recent years. In 1999, the Public Welfare Foundation gave a $50,000 grant to PRA, the San Francisco Foundation gave $120,000 to PRA, the Tides Foundation gave $57,550 to PRA, the Cummings Foundation gave $55,000 to PRA, the List Foundation gave $25,000 to PRA and the Ms. Foundation for Women (which was given over $1.2 million in grants from the Ford Foundation between 2000 and 2002) gave $150,000 to PRA. In 2002, the Ford Foundation gave $176,663 in grant money directly to the PRA. These are facts. And it is also a fact that a Political Research Associates writer acted as a leading conspiracy researcher-baiter within the alternative media subculture after 9/11/01 and attempted to stifle left subculture discussion of 9/11 conspiracy evidence, as well as discussion of the role that the Ford Foundation plays in U.S. political left life today. Wikipedia's credibility as an alternative independent information source for internet readers will suffer if it capitulates to the pressure of foundation-subsidized folks and deletes an article, like this gatekeeper one,--that apparently contains information that the foundations and their stable of journalists/gatekeepers do not wish to see shared with Wikipedia readers.(bf)</p>

<p>Comment--Your argument is sophistry. Are any foundation-sponsored editors/writers presently helping to determine what "violates WP policy"? Have the majority of WP readers ever been allowed to determine WP policy with regard to which articles to censor? Are the WP gatekeepers willing to also start deleting all the articles that are little more than repostings of corporate-sponsored, historically inaccurate and politically-biased corporate websites?</p>
<p>If foundation-sponsored gatekeepers have conflict-of-interest issues which lead them to censor wikipedia articles that are critical of their foundation-sponsors, then they are not really capable of editing the wikipedia website in an ethical way, from an alternative journalistic point of view. Perhaps it's more appropriate for such folks to act as gatekeepers for more middle-class academic-biased/establishment-oriented encyclopedias, like the World Book or the Encyclopedia Britannica?--bf</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would help if you indented your response underneath the post you are responding to with either an asterisk or a colon (or more than one as necessary). It would be nice if you signed with four tildes ~~~~ too. Anyway, I'm not sure I entirely follow you. (1) <i>Are any foundation-sponsored editors/writers presently helping to determine what "violates WP policy"?</i> I don't know. Going through the history for each article and corresponding talk page for each policy page would take an awfully long time, and I don't know that there'd be any way to prove which editors were "foundation-sponsored" or not, since in most cases there wouldn't be any way to prove who any of the editors' identities are. (2) <i>Have the majority of WP readers ever been allowed to determine WP policy with regard to which articles to censor?</i> Do you mean have the majority of WP readers been allowed to edit the policy pages? As far as I know everyone can edit those pages, but AFAIK most don't chose to make edits to those pages. Or do you mean are the majority of WP readers involved in the AfD process? I would guess most aren't, that most WP users simply read articles, followed by creating new articles or editing articles. I think it's probably a smaller percentage that bother with AfD, which seems to be a necessary process unless you really want every article posted on WP to stay (e.g. Dogballs). (3) <i>Are the WP gatekeepers willing to also start deleting all the articles that are little more than repostings of corporate-sponsored, historically inaccurate and politically-biased corporate websites?</i> Who are WP gatekeepers, all the people involved in the AfD process? Also, it would help if you identified what sort of articles you had in mind. It seems to me editors do try to address issues of "corporate-sponsor[ship]" "historically inaccura[cy]" and "political[]-bias[]" in articles, but whether they can keep up with such problems, or address them as well as is necessary are open questions. (4) <i>If foundation-sponsored gatekeepers have conflict-of-interest issues which lead them to censor wikipedia articles that are critical of their foundation-sponsors, then they are not really capable of editing the wikipedia website in an ethical way, from an alternative journalistic point of view.</i> I'm not sure if you're referring to prior editing of this article (and the AfD), and/or editing of articles about foundations. Certainly, I would agree that if somebody is taking money from e.g. the Ford Foundation, and they make edits to that article, then they potentially have a conflict of interest and an ethical problem. There might be some ethical people who could work past those problems, but for the most part it would be unwise. My "sponsor" at present moment could be said to be my late grandmother (thanks Oma), and I'm afraid she would not satisfy <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html#Deceased_people" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Deceased people</a> so there's never been and probably never will be an article on her here. With regard to pages for foundations and media, I'd advise you to do what I indicated at the bottom of the Gatekeepers talk page, what HK agreed with; I'd support such edits and help revert edits removing such information if I came across it. I see no <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophistry.html" title="Sophistry">sophistry</a> in that. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 07:55, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

We are interested in whether this article meets the standards of wikipedia pure and simple. Surveillance of others with the intention to discredit those individuals is not only bad manners, it is in violation of wikipedia harassment standards. Conduct a civil discourse without name-calling or harassment is all I ask. Is this article, well cited? Is this article relevant? Does this term get use outside of wikipedia? Etc. are what is under discussion. Not whether any one editor tries to inform people that a vote is taking place and then calling it VOTE STACKING, that is harassment and a personal attack and I removed it as such. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 05:13, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The "attack" wasn't a personal one if it was merely pointing out likely or potential vote-stacking. If there is evidence that a certain group of people is vote-stacking in similar Afds, it's actually more relevant to this discussion, not less. Asking someone to vote in an Afd is, as far as I know, not against Wikipedia policy, even if you know how they will vote beforehand. It is, however, a relevant consideration for a sysop that is attempting to determine consensus in an Afd vote, consensus being a muddy concept (as it should be, imo). Please remember to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and interact <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">civilly</a>- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 05:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment'</b> The good faith/civility comment was meant to be a reminder for everyone here. Regarding whether the information about potential vote stacking violates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, well, "This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary." I.e., if there is evidence of potential vote stacking, an editor can and should point out the evidence. Here, there is at least some evidence of vote stacking (though the nature and weight of the evidence will be for the sysop who goes through this Afd to determine), thus it was appropriate, in my judgment, for Jersey to point to the evidence despite AGF. I hope this makes sense, forgive me for being somewhat long-winded.

<p><b>Comment</b> Posting the vote stacking links concerns this article and getting into a revert war to try and hide it is a serious offense. You aren't suppose to delete other people's comments on an afd. I have also deleted the part of my comment which could be interpreted as a personal attack already. Needless to say, if you see the user's talk page and the bottom of his user page he has been accused of being a POV Larouchite editor in the past. He also just broke the three revert rule. I have already informed an administrator about it.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 05:11, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> You have broken the three revert rule actually well before your above post. Second, to revert personal attacks is not in violation of that rule. Third, I ask that you refrain from your continued personal attacks on myself and other users. Fourth, I ask that you remove your words 'vote stacking' as a personal attack on the creator of this article. Fifth, I ask that you make an official apology to that said user for your harassment and surveillance of his postings. Sixth, I ask a personal apology to myself. See above for reasons to edit out your personal attacks and harassment.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>a) Hopelessly POV. It assumes that the media in the United States is left-wing, which laughable statement seems to actually be <i>believed</i> in some quarters, but should still not be reported as "fact".</dd>
<dd>b) It's a LaRouchite fantasy. Actually, let's scratch out "fantasy": when we're dealing with LaRouche, one doesn't need to specify the disconnection with reality, since it's basically inherent.</dd>
<dd>c) Undue weight. The term is <i>not</i> used in political parlance; it's used by a handful of lunatics and conspiracy theorists when writing lunacy on conspiracy theories.</dd>
<dd>d) It's a LaRouchite hit list. I suspect, as a general policy issue, we should profit most mightily from refusing to host LaRouchite hit lists.</dd>
<dd><b>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia</b>. It is not a forum for conspiracy nuts and Lyndon LaRouche fanboys to piss all over the sum of human knowledge. Whatever happened to that ArbCom ruling that this sort of crap had to die, anyway?

<li>I have figured out why we liberals never win any elections. It's because we have a group of people who expend enormous effort and energy trying to prove that other leftists aren't ideologically pure enough or far-left enough.

<li><b>Keep</b> Cursing, as seen above in this discussion, is not argument. Attacks and counterattacks directed at political factions are not arguments relevant to the article under consideration. The term is widely used in political analysis by analysts at several stations along the political spectrum. Its history dates back at least 50 years, as documented by legitimate academic source. The article is badly slanted against perceived left gatekeepers, but that can be fixed. The pervasiveness of the term in political anaylysis is reflected by the choice of the National Communications Association to name their Mass Communication Division Newsletter "The Gatekeeper". Try looking at some legitemite etymology before typing a tirade against a poorly written article. The word has a long, documented history, available even from easily found reputable on-line sources such as <a href="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" class="external text" title="http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Media,%20Culture%20and%20Society/gatekeeping.doc/" rel="nofollow">the University of Twente</a>. According to this, it might better be subtitled (communication) rather than (politics). <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoSaid__8085.html" title="User:WhoSaid?">WhoSaid?</a> 21:04, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've done a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> rewrite stub focusing on the general concept of a communications gatekeeper, instead of one particular conspiracy theory. <b>Keep</b> as rewritten and move to Gatekeeper (journalism). <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 22:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I am not sure you can re-write something in the middle of a vote. But, that aside. I like what you wrote, as it is NPOV. However, it is quite limited and Gatekeeper refers to more than what you wrote about. There needs to be the entire idea of Gatekeeper included, as was originally presented in the article. I propose we start with your re-writing, and those interested work together to get a balanced, accurate, NPOV article done. I propose this to you and to the original creator as well. What do you say? Let's end the vote and work on this together in sandbox or whatnot. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 23:56, 13 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Anyone can edit any article at any time, provided it is not otherwise protected from editing. I certainly think the concept described in the previous article deserves discussion as an example of an alleged "gatekeeping" abuse, but I'm not sure it needs the level of detail. We certainly shouldn't be attempting to comprehensively list any alleged "gatekeepers," because a List of alleged gatekeepers would theoretically include everyone from the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McNamara_73fb.html" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Rooney_148c.html" title="Andy Rooney">Andy Rooney</a> to, as we saw, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 00:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> True. I am interested in what the original creator of the article thinks here.

<li>Of <i>course</i> he can re-write in the middle of an AfD (which is, incidentally, <i>not a vote</i>). What purpose would be served by preventing people from doing so? Travis's rewrite looks good; I'm <i>very</i> curious as to how the article's original author feels about it, however, and whether he'll try to re-introduce illegitimate content ... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:14, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've already been reverted once, and I reverted back. I believe we should start with an NPOV stub and build from there, rather than try to rework a clearly-POV pile of mush. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 01:56, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The concept of a "gatekeeper" in journalism is much better defined, and was discussed even in my basic Mass Communications/Journalism 130 survey course. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten by <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a>, but might belong better at Gatekeeper (publishing), since the concept (which is a notable one, especially in the era of blogging, user-written sites like Wikinews, self-published book, etc.) is not limited to journalism, but is common to the publishing industry, including books as well as magazines and newspapers. I don't feel strongly about the name, though. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:58, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have <b>moved</b> the article per the nascent consensus here, and I suggest that we close the AfD and proceed with the stub as-is. Should it be communication, or communications? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:00, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why <b>not</b> be in a rush? Who cares about "normal closure"? The article is not about politics, so it shouldn't be at politics. I don't need to have a process tell me that it's OK to do that.

<li>Au contraire, <b>keep</b>. Sure, the article is slipshod and systemless, lacking any sort of criteria or attribution. But the concept is just possibly workable (as it is for <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">films</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_video_games_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of video games considered the worst ever">video games</a>), if we take it to mean either books that have been said to have had a baleful effect on society or those that have been described as spectacularly unsuccessful as literature. This will take a lot more sourcing than the list of worst films, though, not least because of the number of books ever published, and this is what might make it unworkable. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 23:16, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

As webmaster at NCAAbbs, I could throw up an Alexa button on every page and inflate our rank in Alexa greatly. Shame on you for trusting Alexa for anything beyond the top few hundred. It's really this simple... MemphisTigers.org... which is a part of NCAAbbs that has been given the name "memphistigers.org" due to its high activity...

<li>I happen to disagree. NCAAbbs IS a notable forum. However it would be for someone not in the U.S. Over 13,000 fans..recently received an offer for xxx,xxx. The Memphis and UAB forums are recognized in the Memphis and Birmingham newspapers, and the UAB fans were even seen on ESPN(largest sports cable network in the U.S.) holding a sign that had NCAAbbs.com on it.

<li>Keep it. It is a valuable site for trading sports and non-sports information. MySpace has a Wikipedia listing and is not marked for deletion. I feel that NCAABBS has similar-type content for the 20-45 year old sports enthusiast. The site has also been mentioned in numerous sports radio broadcasts. I thought that Wikipedia was a place to share information and not a popularity contest. Removing this entry while keeping entries of "popular" sites would be a disservice to those who use Wikipedia. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 198.202.162.100 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.202.162.100_96cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.202.162.100">contribs</a>) 20:59, 9 March 2006.</small>

<li>Deizio - I'm not sure what kind of problem you have with NCAAbbs, but to say that MemphisTigers.org, BlazerTalk.com, and NCAAbbs.com have not had an impact on the college sports world, especially in Memphis and Birmingham, then you do not need to be judging it. The point on UAB fans is that they were not only seen, but mentioned and also on the UAB radio station. Was your cousin mentioned? --Techfan</li>

<ul>
<li>I have made no comment about the "impact" of anything, the only problem I have is that this topic does not meet any part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or any other notability criteria and is invalid for inclusion in this particular <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. The appearance of people holding signs in crowds or unsolicited mentions on radio shows is not noteworthy. If you are going to argue that your site has received sufficient "media coverage" to make it noteworthy you should be thinking about verifiable and in-depth coverage in major national newspapers, nationally syndicated radio and / or popular national publications such as Time Magazine. I'm unfamiliar with "the UAB radio station", can you clarify what it's sphere of influence might be? By all means keep up the banter here but without an understanding of what makes a topic suitable for inclusion on WP, and the procedure by which pages get deleted, you aren't getting anywhere. If I do have a <i>slight</i> problem with anything it's the unsightly deluge of unsigned opinions from newcomers which are endemic to AfD debates on web forums. The encouragement of forum participants who have not previously edited on Wikipedia to make submissions here has the opposite of the desired effect - there is no surer way to ensure your site sticks in the minds of many WP editors for all the wrong reasons. Please check the links for new editors I've placed on your <a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETechfan_cdac.html" title="User talk:Techfan">user talk page</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 03:30, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was referring to you saying "Did you mean '...not quite enough...'?" in reference to the influence on college sports and communities of fans. Think of it this way: <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicianforums.html" title="Musicianforums">Musicianforums</a> is ONE OF MANY homes for musicians. NCAAbbs is THE home for fans of Memphis, UAB, Cinncinnati, NIU, etc. Now why is <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicianforums.html" title="Musicianforums">Musicianforums</a> fine, and NCAAbbs not? I think that there are many problems other than our page to be worried about. The result of many "unsigned" users are here because they saw the big notice on the NCAAbbs page when viewing the page. It HAS made an impact. It HAS been mentioned in newspapers, radio, and TV. What do you want more of? What will get it "passed through"? If you could be more specific, I am sure we can provide what you want. Techfan 03:48, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"...not quite enough..." related to the point <i>"I think that having one of the component sites selected as third best Memphis related sites is <u>quite enough</u> to meet the bar"</i> by Capitalistroadster, as I believe he may have accidentally omitted the word "not". To answer your other points, each AfD is judged on its own merits and one should resist the equation: "If topic A is ok, why not topic B?"

<li>Fair enough, but you still have not answered my questions. What do you want more of? What will get it "passed through"? However, I think that it would be unfair to delete the NCAAbbs page, but let another that serves its purpose just as we do, but I would argue that NCAAbbs has made a bigger impact. Ediquette or not, I think you SHOULD compare situations to what others have considered o.k., rather than your own assumptions. Also..it DOES meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, even if you do not consider the Memphis award enough. See "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Techfan 04:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is: the users would like to see this on here, and questions have NOT been answered or responded to. If you are going to say "delete", then answer our questions as to what more we would need on our page, because I am sure we can provide. NCAAbbs has never had an advertisement, only word of mouth, and since 2002 we have grown to 13,000+ users and have MADE AN IMPACT on the college sports world. The users that have posted here are not new to Wikipedia, they just do not contribute or monitor pages. We don't expect to get 1,000 new users from this, but we do want it to serve as a page for newcomers and others interested in the history of NCAAbbs. Our page is fine on the terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. See related links for reference. Techfan 05:39, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think the term Blachi is more of a slang, and it has some meaning to it. For educational purposes it is rather interesting and the research can be verified on other skin related websites.</p>

<li><b>Headdesk</b>. Lookit, AfDs are traditionally kicked off by someone <i>nominating</i> it, explaining <i>why</i> he's nominated it, why the article needs to do, etc. References to deletion policy, page history, What links here, and, of course, Google are common, all making up the rich tapestry that is an argument for the deletion of one of our precious articles. This is a Good Thing; if nothing else, it means that if an article's deleted then someone can look at AfD and understand why (none of this idiotic "nn d" crap). Pointing out that the nominator automatically votes delete is not merely nonsense, but evidence of a terrifying misunderstanding of what *fD is about here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Retort</b> the nominator makes a perfectly valid point, I assumed you were giving him a hard time about process. He states, "Non notable." Thats all the reason, if the pub actually is NN, that he should need to give. I think that, while my understanding of AfD may be flawed, your understanding of WP:Notability is equally so. Just because he didn't google the bloody thing, or dig around LexisNexis (as two of the voters have done), it doesn't make his deletion listing any less valid. I still refrain from voting as I have no opinion on this article.
<ul>
<li>I disagree. Out of simple respect for the editors who have worked hard in good faith on the material in question, a nom needs to do more than type two letters. Even you modify your statement by saying: "<i>if the pub actually is</i>"...How do we know anything about what the pub "actually is" or the reasons why it does not deserve a place here if the nom is too intellectually lazy to address the question? If that's the best noms can do, they should do something else with their time. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:58, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> - yes I (Icehardkiller) wrote the article being discussed. Is the above Note implying that I am not entitled to argue for the article's permanent inclusion? Apologies if I am grasping the wrong end of the stick... and, yes again, all of my Edits are to do with The Monkey Bar article - but whats wrong with that? Finally in response to the original complaint, all the pubs in England are not listed in Wikipedia - but some are, see 'Category:Public houses in the United Kingdom' - if Swatjester's argument was applied to every entry, Wikipedia would be, for the large part, empty.

<li><b>Response</b> - no I dont have a complete grasp of how WP works, though what bearing this has on whether the article should be kept or deleted I fail to see - the ony thing I've done is put up (and am subsequently trying to defend) a bit of information about one of the oldest pubs in Newcastle - I am still learning about syntax and how to sign and timestamp edits etc Icehardkiller 09:53, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find that what's really important or relevant for an entry isn't what we vaguely define as inspiration, fact or even what it is we do/want to say, recall, regret, or rebel against. No, what's important is the way we say it. Art is all about craftsmanship. Others can interpret craftsmanship as style if they wish. Style and importance is what unites memory or recollection, ideology, sentiment, nostalgia, presentiment, to the way we express all that. It's not what we say but how we say it that matters and how that affects those that read and understand our art. In the end, who are we to judge what anyone else finds relevant unless we have been in their shoes!

<li><b>Keep</b> (or at least I assume thats what the dude who used the talkpage was voting due to his comment) I agree with the previous view. Who are we to say what's worthy and what's not. If the pub means a lot to enough people, keep it here. Those who say "just a pub" don't know what they're talking about.

<li><b>Delete</b> in lieu of the last set of votes, and due to the fact that, however interesting they may be, historical places are not inherently notable. If we had an article for every building not "having had its name changed," which appears to this pubs saving grace according to keep votes, then we'd have tons of articles about every trivial building in most every major eurpean city and a few American ones. It only yields 11 results when searching for "The Monkey Bar Market Lane" and when searching Monkey Bar newcastle, the first page is entirely composed of the pub's page, a few pub-centric travel guides, and the wikipedia page. This bar is not notable, thus I reiterate, <b>Delete</b> per nom. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragoonmac_a999.html" title="User:Dragoonmac">Dragoonmac</a> - <sup><small><a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDragoonmac_c0f3.html" title="User talk:Dragoonmac">If there was a problem</a> <b>yo</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dragoonmac_72de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dragoonmac">I'll solve it</a></small></sup> 23:22, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>other!</b> as Cool3 points out, it would be a bit improper to delete the albums if the band itself is still included. Especially as the nomination for the band has been withdrawn, this AfD is a bit too irregular to be used as any kind of measure of consensus. If re-nominated, the band should be included in that nomination, or it should be stated from the start that the AfD is <i>only</i> about the albums/singles. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>,my thing is, is that Austin is known as the live music capital, many bands local, mational, and international come to play here, to very huge and famous music fectivals happen here (Austin City Limits and SxSW) therefore when the local paper writes about a band, they know what they are talking about. Same for the Houston paper, Houston and a major city in america and has a major newspaper, local but decently well known. Also, you say that they do not play other places, they just embarked on a major tour of the northeast, playing at some very well known pubs in New York and Boston. Instead of writing them off, why don't you get to know them and listen to some of their music, maybe see a live show (if you can). I believe if you see them live, you would be hooked. Just ask the over 5000 myspace friends from all over the world that have never seen them live but are hooked because of the CD.</li>

<p>No sources have been produced to indicate that this is a recognized genre. So far the article just seems to be based on the fact that some bands have dressed pirate-style at times, or otherwise used pirate themes. See talk page discussion, we have established no way of knowing who is or isn't in this "genre". Adam and the Ants are included since they dressed as pirates during one period, but the sources I've found describe them as "new wave" or "post punk", nothing says "pirate rock" or (worse yet) "piratecore". This may be an attempt to define a new genre rather than document a recognized one. <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Wilbury_5dcd.html" title="User:Ned Wilbury">Ned Wilbury</a> 15:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That looks like a blog by a guy involved in some of the bands. I guess the question isn't whether some bands have called themselves "pirate rock" or a similiar name, but whether this is a genre recognized by independant sources. Bands may call themselves many things, but that doesn't make a genre, neccessarily.

<li>Hey, it's a self recognized genre that a number of notable bands consider themselves to be a part of (e.g., this isn't the 1-band genre that "Stout Irish Rock" is). If notable bands call themselves "pirate-rock", but no one <i>you</i> would consider an "independent source" does, it doesn't mean that the genre doesn't exist or lacks notability.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 16:52, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> neologism for a non-existent sub-genre. If no "independent source" has labeled these bands as <i>Pirate Rock</i> then what they choose to consider and call themselves is irrelevant. If my band and 5 other bands decide to call our version of Zappa-inspired experimental/noise rock "Christian Inspirational Mood Music", that doesn't create a genre of that name referring to our style of music. When the music press picks up on it and starts classifying bands of a certain style with a certain name, that is when it becomes a genre.

<li>I never said there were not band dressing as pirates, singing about pirating. It doesn't matter how notable they are... The issue here is that there is no evidence that the term "Pirate rock" has any general usage in relationship to a genre of music. I found a handful of uses of this term in relation to this style of music &amp; many uses was self-referential. Most were printed in local college or entertainment newspapers. There is just no evidence provided at this time that this term has any general usage as a genre. Don't get me wrong... the world needs more pirates to <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">stop global warming</a>, I'm just not convinced of this genre.

<li>The bands listed don't all <i>claim</i> to play "pirate rock". Some of them don't even use the word "pirate" in describing themselves, from what I can see. Also, I don't see that they have anything in common musically, so I don't see it as a genre. I don't think we can turn a few references to pirates or "pirate rock" into a <i>genre</i> called "pirate rock" unless we can find references to it as a genre in reputable music press.

Neither one of them have AMG bios, so they don't appear to be major bands. Again, I still don't think we have enough to go on to assume this is a genre.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is unacceptable. I'm in a Pirate-Core band, and a pretty darn fine one, too. I know this makes me EXTREMELY unbiased about this, But we've been written up in Metal Rules magazing and CMJ, both articles citing we play Pirate-Core. I'll scan the articles and post them for verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been keeping tracks on the genre since all other bands in it are my peers. As long as there has been punk bands there have been punk bands dressing up as Pirates. The Hard-Core scene is literally littered with Pirate Acts. Then there are pub-rock pirate bands and more kid friendly/Ren Faire pirate acts. There are scenes going on In Washington, Baltimore, Alabama, New York and Texas. You cannot delete this entry. As someone else stated, it will just need to be put back up once one of these bands breaks big.I understand Isotope23's statement that a self given genre lable lacks the legitimacy of the title being bestowed by the press, however if this is such a problem then the article simply needs to be re-named, not deleted.Unkiedev 7:39 EST March 11, 2006</p>

<li><b>Leave</b> Markviii 20:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC) It's a commonly used term among a group of people I work with, and it's amusing how you can quantify it as a 'protologism', which barely outranks it with a paltry 549 hits. Seems to me that word is of the same ilk, yet it's OK for Wiki to allow their own fabricated words, but not anyone else. I guess the old saying is true, "Rules are for everyone...else".

<p><b>Answer</b> (from the apparently less-than-credible initiator of the article in question): I apologise for not catching on immediately that you had created a separate discussion page on this issue. Anyway: Your objection is not a sound one. Boghossian is one of the leading contemporary philosophers in his fields of interest, and has a natural place in any serious catalogue of contemporary philosophers. I hope that you will consult a member of the philosophy project, before you consider similar action against philosophy-related articles and stubs in the future. While the maintenance work of "recent changes patrollers" are important, they should not interrupt the work of the projects concerned with making wikipedia a leading source of knowledge. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsen_cef3.html" title="User:Thorsen">Thorsen</a> 16:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is not advertising, boricuapixels.com is the first and currently only pixel page dedicated to the future of Puerto Rico. Four non-profit organizations get funded with proceeds from the site and it has been published about it constantly during its pre-launch only 10 days ago. Several Puerto Rican celebrities support the case of the project and tens of thousands of users have already visited the site and keep on coming back.</p>

<p>Hello, the site is ten days old... read the local press here. <a href="../../../n/y/1/User%7ENy1109_7a0e.html" title="User:Ny1109">Ny1109</a> 17:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the Wikipedia guidelines: advertisements masquerading as articles, and wide-scale external link spamming. Articles considered advertisements include those that are solicitations for a business, product or service, or are public relations pieces designed to promote a company or individual. The article does not use any sales oriented language and is not linking to a commercial site. The site supports non-profits with their work in Puerto Rico. And the article is meant to document that. As the current coverage in the press in Puerto Rico shows, this is already part of history, which then has a right to be shown in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Or, as the guideline says, "A differentiation should be made between spam articles and legitimate articles about commercial entities, however." The site is only commercial in the sense of that something can be paid for on the site (the pixels), but the proceeds are used for non-profit organizations. <a href="../../../n/y/1/User%7ENy1109_7a0e.html" title="User:Ny1109">Ny1109</a> 17:09, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>both not guidelines. Who has the right and authority to say if an article is important? This is not a valid basis for evaluation. Importance is not an easy to measure criteria. Similar for notability. The media in Puerto Rico, where the site is based and from where people will want to look something up about it, is covering it, showing both importance and notability. In addition to that, the quality of celebrities supporting the project (being published in the coming days), adds to the fact that it is purely writing internet history for the island. Never has something like this be done before, it is the largest private (non-governmental) fund-raising initiative ever. <a href="../../../n/y/1/User%7ENy1109_7a0e.html" title="User:Ny1109">Ny1109</a> 17:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. Not guidelines. But both generally reflect the way editors think when it comes to deciding what should be kept or what should be deleted. If you wish to continue this discussion with me, <i>please provide some references</i> (preferably plural, however at this point even a single source would give your argument some weight) that support your statement that "the media...is covering it".

<p>This page should be deleted because Kristi Yamaoka is non-notable except for her accident, which has basically given her 15 minutes (or maybe 3 days) of fame. To expand on that, the result of this accident (which seems to be the barometer of notability) was a ban or certain routines for <i>one</i> women's tournament in <i>one</i> division (which was over the same day of the accident or a few days later once the Salukis won the title to go to the NCAA tournament (from <a href="http://www.mvc-sports.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mvc-sports.com/" rel="nofollow">the MVC website</a>). Furthermore, the ban recommendation already looks like it will not pass, even according to the articles that stated the recommendation in the first place. Lastly, the only things we know biographically about Kristi Yamaoka are her height, weight, and high school she graduated from. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:04, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Plenty of people with considerably less fame have articles on them in Wikipedia.

Try searching for "Kristi Yamaoka" at <a href="http://news.google.com/" class="external free" title="http://news.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://news.google.com/</a>. This generates more than 500 news article hits. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> specifically states as a test for inclusion in Wikipedia, "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events".

<dd>OK, then: Would you have created an article on her prior to March 7, 2006? I also recreated your news search, and it occurs to me that in a few weeks, there will likely be nothing available for news on her. You're basing your claim of notability on a current event, and once the event is over, said individual(s) involved are no longer notable. More importantly, what do you see being added to this article that will make Kristi notable as a person, and how is this any different from John Smith who fell off his roof and hurt himself? Because there was a camera around? I think I'm more than justified, and at this point, it's no longer up to you or me, as we've already voted. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider eventualism. A vast, vast majority of the people on whom we have biographies are not going to be anything more than obscure footnotes in history 100 years from now. Yet, we have biographies on them. For example, a substantial number of <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> players are completely unremarkable except for the fact that they are NFL players. They've barely even made it into the spotlight, most haven't had any news articles focusing on them, and certainly many of them have never appeared as the subject of a major media story. In applying your criteria, it's useful as a check to apply such criteria against other articles of similar type. Your criteria does not work; we'd have to delete a very broad range of articles if your justification is valid. The subject of the article is <i>already</i> notable for having been in major news media all over the country. It's unlikely she'll be famous for any other reason, but that does not disqualify the article. This is dramatically different than John Smith having fallen off the roof because of the news media attention that it drew. The news media thought it was important enough to warrant attention. The Today Show thought it was important enough to fly her, a friend, and her doctor to New York City to appear on the show. The president thought she was important enough to spend time calling her. Lastly, AfD is <i><b>NOT</b></i> about voting. It's a concensus building mechanism. Discussion is certainly relevant and useful. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 18:24, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The same arguments would apply. You've still not cited a deletion criteria that shows that an article can be deleted if the person will be forgotten in a month.

<dd>Well, how about this: try your search on Google News again, and take note of the fact that there hasn't been an article on her in three days. That means that from March 6-8, there were a ton of articles with mostly the same information, and from March 8-10, nobody cared anymore. What I am trying to illustrate is that this is only newsworthy because it is sensational, not because it is notable. We know <i>nothing</i> about Kristi aside from the accident (which is what 90% of her "biographical" article is about, BTW, which makes it not a bio stub at all), which shows that she is only notable because of the accident, not in addition to it. The only reason it's a big thing is because somebody had a camera on her at the time and sold the footage. The benchmark for notability has to be more than a week. Also, think about this: if she's so injured, how did she get on five networks in three days, and how is she going to try out for the squad again in six weeks? So, in the grand scheme of things, is she really notable? As far as i can tell, she's had three days of coverage, and now no one cares, so she's not notable. This is why, also, WP doesn't tend to do current events - there is far too much bias wrt five minutes of media exposure. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 16:35, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

Id like to know why you fell this need to get this given up - is it so you can win a little victory for now, even though it can simply be re-AfDed in a week when it is <i>absolutely clear</i> (as if it wasn't now) that she isn't notable?

<li><b>Delete</b>, this seems like an advertisement, there are already over 132326382326 more bands that are listed in Wikipedia that have a much more richer history and past.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is self-publicity. The band have had some regional success, but are not worthy of this kind of article. The Top 40 single is an irrelevance.

<li><b>Keep</b>They are a significant, ever-more popular band, central to one of the most vibrant scenes in the UK at the moment, and a major concern across the whole country. i honestly can't imagine why they shouldn't be on Wikipedia. i would suggest that anyone so desperate to have it removed must have personal illwill towards the band.Alcxxk</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, They are popular enough to be listed.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, They have been widely covered in the media by numerous popular publications including q magazine and nme and drownedinsound. they are at the heart of the explosion of new music coming from leeds and are embarking on an nme tour aswell as major festivals.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Mediawhizz appears to have a worrying lack of knowledge regarding current music trends.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, As has been mentioned, this page could benefit from extensive editing (removing the block quoting of reviews and bringing it in line with other entries for bands) but deleting the entry entirely is uncalled for. The band has a considerable and growing fanbase, and some unique artistic quirks which are worthy of attention. This page is very far from being the most frivolous or unnecessary on Wikipedia.</li>

<li>With over 300 distributions out there, some reason why this distribution is notable is needed to justify the article.

<li>Leather Colin is a north east legend, although he is thought not to be real and only told to small children, with out as much detail OFCOURSE! He is well known around the area. He is so well known i have heard 'LEATHER' shouted by teenagers at numerous people whilsts wearing anything from a large leather jacket to a pair of leather gloves, and i remember doing it myself one day i must admit.</li>

<li>I also do recall being told of the leather colin story. Although some pictures may not truely posess the real story, it is a urban myth which deserves a place on this website. My grandmother was first told this story in 1938 and recalls the moment she thought she saw him as a child. Someone looked in the house early in the morning at her bedroom. There was an article featuring pictures was also posted in the local free paper - "News of Sunderland" in 1945 which ended after losses of money. Leather Colin, or Colin of the leather, is a great myth which keeps children of all ages in line and with a little fear at bedtime. And I believe that there is to be a FLASH movie produced to show real events and reports about it soon. Hope this helps.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The phrase "little girl" can be <i>slightly</i> idiomatic, in that it doesn't always reflect the precise expected meaning. Actually, "young girl" is more idiomatic in this respect, generally referring to a teen rather (than as might be expected) a female in early childhood. "Little child" is used in this manner in the title of a Beatles song. The Union Gap's <s>"Go Away Little Girl"</s> "Young Girl" is certainly not about about a young child, and a non-native-speaker could be perplexed by this if he merely referenced the words "little" and "girl" and tried to combine them. A decent (very short) article <i>could</i> be written on this, but probably not under this title, and anyway this article isn't it. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:48, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Considering what i have heard about maynard hating file sharing, this doesnt really surprise me. Its all very strange with no baselines and someone singing way too close to the mic and speaking over an acoustic guitar for most of it. the file has a tag of "Jack Maksuta - 4 Score And 20" on it, which at the present time of 19:00 (PST) march 13 2006, does not have any results in google. i am not a user of this site and only here to gather information. i refuse to believe a tool album would sound this bad. i was curious to hear it but this album gets deleted straight away. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.83.88.174 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.83.88.174_1a53.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.83.88.174">contribs</a>) 22:04, 13 March 2006.</small></li>

<li><s><b>Weak keep as stub</b></s> (changed vote, see below) The title was confirmed on the band's official webpage: <a href="http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html" class="external text" title="http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html" rel="nofollow">toolband.com</a>, see news for 03 Mar 06.

<li><b>Definitely keep</b> It has been confirmed by reputable magazines and the band's web sites. It may be false, but it is official for the moment and it's all we have to go on right now.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Even though Tool likes to pull pranks and spread disinformation, all of the information is verifiable from a decent source (Tool's website). As of right now, this is the latest information that has been released, and setting aside Tool's past shenanigans, there's no reason to suspect that <i>this</i> information <i>right now</i> is faulty. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 03:18, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The official site now gives a tracklist for the album <i>10,000 Days</i>, which includes the song "10,000 Days."

<li><b>Keep</b>. I really don't believe the album will actually be called 10,000 Days or that those will be the track names, but the album <i>does</i> exist and <i>will</i> be released (if not on May 2nd, then soon after) so the article is legitimate. 10,000 Days will have to do as the title for now, unless anybody wants it to be named "Fourth Album (Tool)" until the week the album comes out. The article may need to be moved to a new title later, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. -<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDividedByNegativeZero_aca4.html" title="User:DividedByNegativeZero">VJ</a> 09:31, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unnverifiable pov fork. The topic is certainly borderline unencyclopedic, especially existing as its own article. If the content could be verified with reliable sources, I would suggest merging. This sets a very bad precedent for allowing every crackpot conspiracy bullshit to be treated with credulity.
