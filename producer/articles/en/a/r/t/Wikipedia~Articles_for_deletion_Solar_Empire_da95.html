<p><b>Comment:</b> What does the Alexa rating have to do with anything? Solare Empire is hosted on who knows how many servers.

<p><b>Keep:</b> solar-empire.net just hosts the homepage portal, the majority of users visit the SourceForge project page and Quantum Star, the most popular distribution. Traffic Rank for quantum-star.com: 378,378 (up4,007). In January Solar Empire was ranked #6 on SourceForge in the category turn-based strategy games. --<a href="../../../m/j/a/User%7EMjac_aebb.html" title="User:Mjac">Mjac</a> 18:14, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> Most probably mentioned at some point:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Solar Empire is one of the oldest PHP Games still in existence as a "living" project, with multiple forks and support (continual) from multiple developers. The front website is an informal developer meeting place. Of the official websites, <a href="http://www.quantum-star.com" class="external text" title="http://www.quantum-star.com" rel="nofollow">Quantum Star Solar Empire</a> has an Alexa ranking of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.quantum-star.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.quantum-star.com" rel="nofollow">378,378</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The project (both SE and QS) have consistently been among the top 5 PHP Turn Based and Real Time Strategy Games on the Sourceforge.net site - the standard lookup point for open source projects in all programming languages. Activity has likewise consistently remained above 90%. These two points are a matter of public record. Statistics for all SF projects are available at their respective project listings. With QS (the most popular distribution since 2003), ranking on SF has never fallen below 15,000. Highest point was in May/June 2005 ranked 767. This is the ranking out of all projects on SF irrespective of language, genre, license, etc. The ranking is based on page views, downloads, development stats. It is a seasonal measure but the trend has improved consistently year on year. It's worth noting two SE games are listed - both with similar stats as separate projects. We jointly occupy 2 of the top-ten slots in our category genre most of the time...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Article was originally added by an otherwise unknown player. It was subsequently edited with the support of almost all the current developers and only after consultation with the original authors (none of which are developers). It has since been openly edited by numerous others, none of which have made major edits (our consultation paid off with no disputes evident).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The subsequent contributor did not make things up, if that's a concern. The facts in the article were checked (twice), the writer is a reputable source (a professional PHP and Web Application Security analyst with a Big 4 Chartered Accounting firm; on the role-call at Zend.com as an Article contributor for Devzone; web administrator for upstart <a href="http://www.patternsforphp.com" class="external text" title="http://www.patternsforphp.com" rel="nofollow">Patterns For PHP</a>). Author is also ranked as Guru on the PHP Developer Network forums as a daily contributor to the net's largest PHP Forums. Currently in the process of writing a book on PHP with several others - in fact he's an Administrator for that book project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The QS blog which covers SE and QS in detail, along with PHP Game Development and PHP Security as topics has frequently been reported on by Zend's Devzone (the company behind the PHP language), Planet-PHP and PHPDeveloper.org - these are the primary PHP related news/blog/article reporting sites for PHP on the web. It's relatively difficult to get listed on these without proof of some professionalism in PHP and a flair for writing relevant, informed and interesting content.</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> I'll just Copy + paste my comments from the talk page:</p>
<ul>
<li>As stated in the artcile this game is now 7 years old. It's not something that only popped up a couple of days ago. It's likely amoung the oldest still-active PHP games out there.</li>
<li>It's had THOUSANDS (probably ten's of thousands) of unique users play it. Is that notable enough?</li>
<li>It's a fully formed article. If you want to delete something, may I suggest one of the many thousands of stubs that are lying around this place?</li>
<li>This article wasn't created by any of the developers (that I'm aware of). Look at the history. It was created by one "The King of Hearts". When we (the devs) found out about the article, we proceeded to update it and correct many the errors. These devs are specifically listed in the SE history as Maugrimtr, DJCapelis, mjac and Moriarty</li>
<li>Run a google for "Solar Empire". The top 8 results are all for this game, preceding even a TV series's IMDB entry of the same-name as well as the soon to be released "Sins of a Solar Empire" which comes in at ninth entry in the search.---22:09 UTC - 4-Aug-2006 <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriarty_7c81.html" title="User:Moriarty">User:Moriarty</a></li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Someone mentioned a possible WP:V violation due to the fact that it hasn't been reviewed in one of the gaming rags. While this may or may not be accurate it seems a bit silly, CVS logs are _much_ more verifiable than anything out of a new rag, or am I missing something?</p>
<dl>
<dd>CVS logs, near as I can tell (I am not a SourceForge junkie and therefore only have a vague understanding of what CVS logs even are), are either primary sources (e.g. statements made by the developers) or unreliable secondary sources (e.g. forum-esque posts). <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and its cohort <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> explicitly want reliable secondary sources, which do not appear to exist. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 02:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Have you guys changed the rules (WP editors)? The last header said this was a "notability" deletion thing and if you disagreed you could delete the header giving reasons (which is what I did). Now it's been changed and points here and says not to delete the header. I wish you folks would be consistant. This particlar debate is very one-sided as I don't see anyone giving any reasons FOR deletion (now that the notability thing has disappeared). -- 22:09 UTC - 4-Aug-2006 <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriarty_7c81.html" title="User:Moriarty">User:Moriarty</a></p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. We have a metric ton of articles on various SourceForge game projects; Solar Empire is the 49th most downloaded in the "Turn-based games" category, right between <a href="../../../l/o/r/Attal%7E_Lords_of_Doom_7c61.html" title="Attal: Lords of Doom">Attal: Lords of Doom</a> and <a href="../../../v/g/a/VGA_Planets_92c3.html" title="VGA Planets">VGA Planets</a>, surrounded by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freelords.html" title="Freelords">Freelords</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Xenocide_833b.html" title="Project Xenocide">Project Xenocide</a>, and Promisance. The 'Pedia is markedly inclusive towards commercial games, particularly since pretty much all console releases are guaranteed reviews in major media; OSS games, however, get virtually no press, and therefore are not nearly as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Since WP:V is hard policy, I'm going to lean in that direction unless 1up or Kotaku or somebody has an article and/or review on it. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 07:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
