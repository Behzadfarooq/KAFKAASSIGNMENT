	    <p>- All you guys, except my boy Peter, are just straight up haters. I suggest you get a life besides editing wikepedia articles. Just because musicians actually get girls doesn't mean you have to vent your sexual frustration on us. Keep it real. Jacob Fox</p>
<p>- The very fact that all of you actually responded only further establishes the fact that you are the biggest losers on the planet. I am honestly just sitting here laughing at how seriously your are taking this. You should take a good hard look at what you are doing with your lives - Fox</p>

<p>- Hey at least we have friends that aren't our computers. -DTF</p>
<p>- You jackasses are the perfect example of skinny little computer nerds who feel tough on the Internet because nobody can track them down and beat them down like their mom does to them when she catches them shoving her vibrator up their asses. What the fuck do you care if there's a section on DTF on this stupid ass website anyways? If anybody can just write shit on it, then how fucking official can it be? You idiots should learn what's really important in life, i.e. having friends and living a life that's worth living, or being in a kick ass rock band making money for playing shows and making music. - B.R.</p>

<dd>I always sort of thought that family was important in life. And career. But hey, when some kid who's got his nose out of joint because he can't get his unsigned band a vanity article on an encyclopedia page tells me different, I believe him. I mean, looking in the mirror, I don't really feel like a "skinny little computer nerd", but hey, if you say so, "Mr. Unsigned", I believe you. How much of your "life worth living" involves arguing on a deletion subpage on a "stupid ass website"? Because with the importance you're giving to this argument, I would guess a lot. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 14:48, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-I LOVE DTF!!! and everyone who is saying bad shit about them, you are fucking retarded and you are actuallly quite pathetic</p>
<p>-First of all, every single DTF lover give yourself a huge pat on the back. I've heard these boys play at every one of their shows, and each time, they stepped it up and produced an incredible show. Not only have they played 3 sold out shows having only formed in late September, but they won a prestigious Battle of the Bands with a $500 cash prize. For a "high-school garage band" they've done pretty damn well for themselves. Obviously none of you haters have ever been to one of their shows --- needless to say that you probably never will get the privelege, because there seems to be a trend of the shows selling out --- but IF somehow you manage to get to see them work their magic, I have a good feeling you'll change your opinion. Boys, keep up the good work. You have a unique sound and a broad fanbase, which will undoubtedly keep on growing with your success. Catastrophunkadelic was AMAZING!!! -LC</p>

<dd>It isn't opinion. Quite frankly, it's notability. Have you been signed to a deal? No. Has allmusic.com even heard of you? No. If you guys are as awesome as you like to boast, maybe you should get to work talking to people who will <i>get you heard</i>. Until that point in time, however, you will remain irrelevant to the larger world, and your article will join the dustbin of other irrelevant, deleted garbage.</dd>
<dd>Oh, wait- they won 500$? 500 whole dollars?!? I've never even seen that much! You can tell you've hit the big time when you win 500$!</dd>

<p><b>Here's</b> a question: If we're all such a bunch of unsexed loser computer nerds with no social lives, why do you care if an article on your band stays here or not? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . . . . . . <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 15:17, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Hmmmm let me take a careful look at this. Maybe we are just messing with you, you fucking moron. So why are you taking this so seriously? If you don't care so much then why are you even responding? I just hope you all have fun editing websites. - Fox</p>
<p>-Now, Halfway is a band that should be on this site, not your shitty garage band. -Davis Kelo (the man)</p>
<p>-DTF, despite their modest origins and relative novelty, have evolved rapidly into a force to be reckoned with on the local circuit.. if any of you moderators find yourselves in the Greater Toronto Area in the coming weeks, it is strongly recommended you attend a DTF concert in order to lend credence to your as-of-yet unfounded jibes at DTF's musical worthiness, and therefore their collective worth in this online tome to which you most obviously devote a quite unsettling amount if time. DTF has managed to blend elements of the traditional folk musical styles of Bali and Uzbekistan, with the hardcore, fast-paced delivery style of old-skool rap luminaries NWA (Niggaz With Attitude), and an ethereal, divine vocal style evocative of musicians such as Enya, Bjork, or Dmitri Cherniak. The band's guitarist is also a devoted student of Ayurvedic Buddhism and a scholar of Jewish Delicatessen techniques. So before you moderators presume DTF is nothing more than a shitty garage band, take the time neccesary to adequately explore their hidden depth, which, I assure you, is substantial. - Josh Wood</p>

<dd>This isn't about their musical talent, it's about their significance on a world scale. We have hundreds of garage bands submitting articles about themselves every week, so we were forced to come up with a standard for inclusion. This band doesn't meet it. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">âœŽ</a> 18:47, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- For the record, British label Delerium Records has expressed interest in releasing their EP.</p>
<p>- Why has nobody posted a translation link to Hebrew yet?</p>
<p>-All this band does is play shitty music then go to houses and take innocent people's bowls</p>
