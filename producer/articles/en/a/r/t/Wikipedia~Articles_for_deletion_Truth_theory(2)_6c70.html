<li>theory of truth (1935)</li>
<li>Semantic concept formalized by the Polish-American mathematician and logician Alfred Tarski (1902-1983), although other thinkers had previously discussed the idea.</li>
<li>Truth theory concerns the truth-values of sentence structures in various formal logical languages. Tarski suggested a table by which these values could be determined (although he was less sure about whether the same rules could be applied to natural languages).</li>
<li>Also see: <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.html" title="Correspondence theory of truth">correspondence theory of truth</a></li>

<li>In addition, the primary contributor <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> is apparently an actual academic with some expertise in the study of education, and I presume has real knowledge in this area. This does <i>not</i> seem to be original research:

<li>yep, aware of all of that. The Truth theory you find on the Internet and in books bears no resemblance to this article, which is the one-man-essay by Jon Awbrey, who promised everyone he was leaving (via a very long email chain to the en wiki mailing list) but has failed to keep that promise. Pity, but we're stuck with him; must we also be stuck with his essay? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 23:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and fix, if in error. "Truth theory" certainly exists, though I am only familiar with the term from linguistics, to which the author makes a nod and no more. The answer to an article that's in error is correction, not deletion. "Truth theory" isn't a neologism.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/s/User_talk%7EBustter_63d9.html" title="User talk:Bustter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bustter_52e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bustter">contribs</a>) 01:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless the OR can be overcome by the close of this AfD. Failing a delete, the article would need to be massively rewritten as it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Note to BCorr -- Google is nice and all that (although I think this over-reliance on Google hits is utterly ridiculous), but hardly a factor when it comes to determining the disposition of an OR essay. That the topic exists is not doubted, but what is at issue here is its presentation on Wiki. The fact that the <s>article</s> essay was allegedly linked in AM is of little importance as well. That AM failed to see that it was an essay is their problem, not ours.
<ul>
<li>One other point: the fact of something being a neologism (refering to the anon who forgot to sign) is of little importance as well, as <i>all</i> words in every language in the world were neologism at one time. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 10:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, you need to narrow your search a bit: while the words truth and theory show up on the same page, they are not adjacent for a majority of the hits you noted. If we try "intitle:"truth+theory"" we get 48 hits, including four about a rock band named, you guessed it, <i>Truth Theory</i>. See my above point about over-reliance on Google hits. Unless you appropriately limit your search, and unless you are willing to go through them all to separate the wheat from the chaff, the numbers are often meaningless (as in the case of the 30K hits). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 10:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Move the material at <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> to this article - a minimal gain for a great deal of work.</li>
<li>Re-write the present article so that it reproduces the material at <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> - but what would be the point?</li>

<dd>Jon Awbrey makes some fair points below. Besides, this is Wikipedia. It must have somwhere close to 65,535 articles on Pokemon alone. What's the big brouhaha?? I now suspect this may be a personal vendetta (not to say something larger) against the relatively sophisticated style of writing of Mr. Awbrey. I have experienced similar persecution in this forum on many occasions. I change my vote.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 12:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>if this article ought to contain anything, it ought to be a brief description of the various theories of truth - roughly, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#_Major_theories_of_truth" title="Truth">truth# Major theories of truth</a>. But that section already exists; therefore the material at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theories_of_truth.html" title="Theories of truth">theories of truth</a> is redundant.</li>
<li>Not sure if it is more accurate to describe Jon's writing as "sophisticated" or just "sophist". For example, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_theory.html#Elements_of_theory" title="Truth theory">Truth theory#Elements of theory</a> reveals an eccentric map of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthbearer.html" title="Truthbearer">truthbearers</a>, with an implicit bias towards Peirce's analyse of language and the whole unsupported by citations.

<dd>You have some good points. Still, I say the article just needs to be cut down a bit and better-referenced. But this is no reason for deletion. We have 65,535 articles and a whole Wikiproject on <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>. Wiki can handle another one on truth. I was absoltely not accusing <i>you</i> of "vendetta". And "vendetta" was probbly the wrong word anyway. "Crusaders for a minimalist use of English", may be more appropriate. As someone else put it, "business style sheet pushers." Sentences should be no more complex than: "SEE SPOT RUN." The nominator seems to be part of this cabal.

<dd>Did you note the discussion of the references on the article talk page? Are you saying it is a worthwhile article simply because it contains a long list of philosophical publications?

<dd>I note that we have a number of "... theory of truth" articles; so the term deserves either an article or merging with in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 21:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But why "Keep or merge" rather than "delete or merge"? As explained above, the topic is dealt with at <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. What is worth keeping <i>under the heading <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_theory.html" title="Truth theory">truth theory</a></i>?

<dd>Because the topic actually deserves a separate article, and now clutters the Truth article, though there it's currently dealt with in a more encyclopedic style.

<p>JA: Other reasons, as I think of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>JA: Editors familiar with the situation know perfectly well that the article <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></i> is large already (58 kb), and that it's likely to keep on growing with the inclusion of more and more subsections on individual philosophers. Thus it would not gracefully absorb the material here, a large portion of which was in fact massively deleted once before by a particular editor (and his probable meta-puppets) on the grounds that it was too "advanced", "technical", and so on. These were his/their words. He/they further objected to standard scholarly and I daresay <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFIABILITY_792c.html" title="WP:VERIFIABILITY">WP:VERIFIABILITY</a> practice of quoting original sources, especially if they were Classical or even just pre-20th century.

<li>JA: A cursory scan of the first page of the Google report — as if we needed that Guess for leaven — shows that there are more kinds of Truth in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the current Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. So I can't see why this town ain't big enough for all of us. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 12:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: With regard to the evident imperfections in the current state of the article — what can I say that isn't better writ in the Shade on the Porch beneath the <a href="../../../f/i/v/WP%7EFive_Pillars_8a2b.html" title="WP:Five Pillars">WP:Five Pillars</a>? The Joy of Wiki writing is that you can start from where you are and work toward something better. That is what Wikipedia is about. That is what I am about. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 16:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: As I have said, this article came into its current state as a salvage operation, populated at first by the orphans of dis-content that were being tossed out of the bathwater and into the streets in the neighborhood of the ostensible <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. Since nobody else has taken a <i>positive</i> interest in it, and since I have had many other pressing matters, it has not matured as quickly or as healthily as it otherwise might have done if any of us had given it a lttle more constructive time and thought. To be continued ... or not? ... that is the question, isn't it? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 12:54, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: A few words with regard to the Citations, References, Bibliography (or Further Reading), and their relationship to each other. I have had many occasions to explain my way of working to Banno, Kenosis, Lacatosias, and the other editors with whom I have actually collaborated on many articles over the past year, but since it does not seem to have been the most memorable of occasions for them, and again for the sake of those who were lucky enough to miss all that, I will try to gistify my methods more briefly here. I have followed pretty much the same practices since first being instructed in them by my junior high school teachers, when we first started writing sourced research papers, way back when. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 15:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: Woodman! Spare that tree! (To be continued, Monday, maybe …) <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 15:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: Monday, <i>already</i>? Anyway, I've explained all this to the usual suspects many times before, but I was taught that it's best to gather your notes and references together beforehand, and get all that picky stuff out of the way first. So I normally type in the references that I'm planning to use first, then I type in the primary source quotations and triple-check all that mindless verbatim fussiness before I start writing the transitions, as it takes two different cognitive sets altogether to do these two different tasks. So that is why the References section tends to look "bloated" at the start. I used to put the meantime uncited references in the Bib (or Further Reading), as it never hurts the reader to know about major works in the topic area, and then move them up to Refs as I cited them. But that got to be a pain as it made it hard to edit in sections, so more lately I have taken to combining the Refs and the Bib. The reason why the Refs stay so uncited for so long is — of course — because of all the fights that constantly break out over every little bit of text that one adds to the article, up to and including all the time that we waste on a process like the present litigation. And then, of course, by the time you can get your neck out of hot water long enough to do more work on the article, somebody has gone and been so <b>deleteriously bold</b> as to delete all the references that you busted your <a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Poetica_b7af.html" title="Ars Poetica">Ars</a> to look up. But some people just seem to prefer that exciting sort of hue and cry to the duller work of writing articles, so we are forced to let them have their fun, even though it's hardly fun for everyone. And so it goes — mostly nowhere. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 13:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: On to the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> question. This is not original research. It is simply unfamiliar material to a few of the generally unfamiliar readers who have taken over the local lordship of anything they regard as the exclusive domain of the Wikipedia philosophy project. One tries to be polite, but people force you to the point of having to speak some harsh <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truths</a>. I wish they would just quit doing being so obstructive, and adopt an attitude that permits the learning of others, and maybe even their own. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 14:00, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep with massive rewrite/merge</b>-There should certainly be a page on Truth Theory, though it shouldn't be this one. My recommendation would be to take pretty much all of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#Philosophy_of_truth" title="Truth">Philosophy of Truth</a> section of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> page and put it here. The essay that currently resides here should be pretty much deleted, with just some basic info retained for the section on classical philosophers. The <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> page is already too big as it is. I think, conceptually, the truth page should just include the basic info in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#Truth_in_specialized_contexts" title="Truth">section 3</a> plus a paragraph or two on the Philosophy of Truth (linked here, of course). Beyond that that, I think it would work better to retitle this page "Philosophy of Truth" with "truth theory" redirecting to it. Just a suggestion. <a href="../../../t/r/n/User%7ETrnj2000_c033.html" title="User:Trnj2000">Trnj2000</a> 22:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>JA: We seem to be wandering into issues that are certainly interesting to discuss but that may be more generic than the specific issue to be decided here, so I've added another subhead for that. Plus it helps to edit in smaller sections. Still, I don't really have the sort of full time to spend here that I used to, so I hope that this proceeding will still be around as an open issue next week. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 16:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>JA: Hey! Don't knock La Buffarina! (She might knock you back.) But serially, folks, I would not call it a cabal or a vendetta — yet — but some of the plaintiffs of this action are known to have a distinctive POV that amounts to a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Categorical_imperative.html" title="Categorical imperative">categorical imperative</a> about how <i>all</i> WP articles should be written, with regard to their level and style, and I guess "Business Object Style Sheet" (BOSS) is a pretty good name for it. I have betimes made the observation that <a href="../../../p/%26/g/WP%7EP%26G_c3f3.html" title="WP:P&amp;G">WP:P&amp;G</a> does not dictate any so restricted a theory about such things as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intended_reader.html" title="Intended reader">intended reader</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reader_model.html" title="Reader model">reader model</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_audience.html" title="Target audience">target audience</a>, and so on. Of course we all strive to make information as widely comprehensible as humanly possible on both sides of the human equation, but it is simply not possible to deny the practical limits on the side of the reader and the writer alike. And there are many, many topic areas in WP where the writers do not feel obligated to omit from treatment what they cannot make immediately grokkable by the so-called "generally unfamiliar reader". <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 21:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>JA: The really amusing thing about this reader model issue to someone who knows the full range of my work on WP — for instance, yours truly — is that some of my earliest and most persistent efforts have been dedicated to that elusive butterfly of love's labors lost, the aim of "making technical articles more accessible". For instance, at the article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_theory.html" title="Information theory">information theory</a> and the complex of articles relating to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_algebra.html" title="Relational algebra">relational algebra</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_databases.html" title="Relational databases">relational databases</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_model.html" title="Relational model">relational model</a>. If you do not see any evidence of my labors there, it is because the techno-purists on the scene at the time and making their entrances later were having none of that dilutionary mass appeal, not even in the introductions. A little more of my efforts do survive in the complex of articles concerned with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_tables.html" title="Truth tables">truth tables</a>. Still, I find that it is just as thankless a task making tech arts accessible as it is making pop arts like WP <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></i> more technically challenging than what was standard fare in the 1850's, if not in fact the 1250's, though under a host of other names, of course. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 00:46, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
