<p>Wireless facilities is the largest Radio Frequency engineering company in the world. The company operates in through three operating segments: Wireless Network Services, Enterprise Network Services, and Government Network Services. The company had $375.3 Million in sales last year but recent margins have been hurt by an unsuccessful venture into Mexico, indiscriminate hiring, and laxed management.</p>
<p>Still, the company is well positioned to benefit from the continued rolling out of WiMax, defense department technology spending, and security/monitoring digitalization.</p>
<p>The company recently announced the spin-off of the underperforming foreign operations. The assets of those operations were sold at a loss.</p>

Top Tanker (TOPT) is a Greece-based oil tanking company that reported US $324 Mil. revenues in 2005. The company's balance sheet equity was $194.37 Mil. on 2006-09-30, but the company sold two ships, the M/T Topless and M/T Fearless for a book gain in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>However, the company's market capitalization is $138.44 Mil due to various reasons including:</p>
<p>1) present dry-docking expenses; 2) shareholder lawsuits relating to the sale and leaseback of the company's fleet; 3) an unresolved SEC informal inquiry in the sale/leaseback; 4) and the resignation of an independent auditor.</p>
<p>In Q4 2006 the same day that the auditor resigned, the company announced it would restate prior quarterly financial results so that $50 Mil. recorded as cash could be recorded as restricted cash.</p>

<p>An Orange County teen is accused of selling thousands of dollars worth of computer equipment that he couldn't deliver.</p>
<p>Agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement arrested Thomas Thompson, 19, on Friday, WESH 2 News reported.</p>
<p>Investigators said he was selling computer routers on eBay but then never delivering them to his customers. Police estimated his alleged fraud at $800,000.</p>
<p>Thompson was arrested at his parents' Winter Park home and taken to the Orange County Jail.</p>
<p>Police said he had set up accounts on eBay to sell computer router cards, mostly to small business owners. Investigators said some of his sales were for $40,000.</p>
<p>After taking customers' money, Thompson would allegedly send customers empty boxes filled with newspapers, police said.</p>
<p>Police said he had one arrest on his record. He was accused of drunken driving last week, and his car was impounded.</p>
<p>Agents worked on the case for five months before making an arrest. Police said Thompson used several company names over the past year.</p>
<p>He is also accused of buying some of the cards from Verizon, and then not paying the company.</p>
<p>"Once he was able to establish credit, he was able to order 12 Cisco router cards, which he received the products and issued a worthless check of $540,000," said FDLE special agent Francisco Hidalgo.</p>
<p>Agents seized some equipment from his home on Friday.</p>

Obadia was one of the anonymous biblical characters whose information has been rare for most of researchers. some people attributed his era to the late 6th. century B.C;because,his little prophetic book refered to some that contemprary events, but according to my researchs, based on some (Islamic?)sources, he might be (Dhulkifl:ذوالکفل)who was one of minor prophets in Holy Quran, and at least in to places of this books (suras of Sad(38)&amp; prophets (21th))some explanations were interpreted. Based on one of the interpretating book of Quran,his proper name was (عبوديا=عيوديا) and his nickname was (Dhulkifl= one who caretakes)because he promised to his master (Elisha)not to be angry at all from now on.The last word is the period of his life might be about 8th or 7th century B.C.</p>

<p>Did you know that another name for the Sun is the G2V Star?In case you were wondering,the Sun is a big,hot,fiery ball with no atmosphere,water,or life.Though it may seem very large compared to the stars we see at night,it is actually an average sized star.The Sun, or G2V Star,is the center of the solar system.It does not rotate or revolve around anything.Besides the stars that we see at night, it is the only object in the solar system that produces its own light.The objects that revolve around the Sun are:Moons,planets,and asteroids.The planets are:Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,and Neptune.Pluto is no longer considered a planet.Pluto became known as just a big ball of ice in the year 2006. Our Sun provides light for all of the inner planets only.It cannot get to the outer planets because they're farther away.Our Sun is the only natural light that we have.</p>

A rock band created by TJ Kennedy (guitar), Keith Lipiec (drums), and Corey Hanrahan (guitar). What's After Platinum is called WAP for short. The group uses the motto "Rock or Die". After constantly cutting down the band Justin Gaval (keyboardist) joined the band. The band didn't last long with those four because Corey left the band to join start his own band that does not have half the success as What's After PLatinum.</p>
