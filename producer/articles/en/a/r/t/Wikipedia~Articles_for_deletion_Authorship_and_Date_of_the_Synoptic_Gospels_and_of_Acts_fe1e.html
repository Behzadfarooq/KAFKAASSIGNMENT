<p>Created by a new user (I thought new users couldn't create articles? - this new user must have been waiting around just to create it - its one of their first edits). It seems to be an attempt at introducing a particular bias. It fails to mention any of the <a href="../../../q/_/g/Q_Gospel_bae1.html" title="Q Gospel">Q Gospel</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Problem_e2b5.html" title="Synoptic Problem">Synoptic Problem</a>, or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markan_Priority_5b69.html" title="Markan Priority">Markan Priority</a>, suggesting a complete unfamiliarity with the topics and/or an attempt to circumvent mentioning the academic consensus. The authorship/date of the synoptics is extensively discussed in the Q Gospel, Synoptic Problem, and Markan Priority articles, as well as the articles for the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a> themselves - <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html" title="Gospel of Mark">Gospel of Mark</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, so this just seems like an attempt to fork the content and bias it. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 17:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. POV Fork, OR. I don't think the author's unfamiliar with the topic; the "attempt to circumvent mentioning the academic consensus" is clearly what's going on here.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I don't think there'd be anything wrong with having an article on this subject, but the current material is virtually unsalvageable, and it'd probably have to be rewritten from the ground up. The main author of the page seems to be determined, as Clinkophonist says, to ignore the scholarly consensus, and has adamantly refused several requests for specific citations which I've made on the talk page. As I noted there, he seems to be determined to present the debate as though it is one between fundamentalists and radical Jesus-myth type theorists, ignoring (or at least downplaying) the academic mainstream consensus - note the statement that the Gospels could have been written any time between the crucifixion and Irenaeus, for instance. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just don't see the <i>consensus</i> you folks seem to. The topic is heatedly debated, with a lot of conservative scholarship placing the Synoptics between 40 and 70, while more liberal scholarship tends to put them somewhere between 65 and 130. I've heard people declare that the so-called consensus is 65-70, as if the overlap of the two camps gave us the actual dates. The Catholic Encyclopedia, for example, tells us Mark was written c. 50-67 AD. Earlychristianwritings.com, a secular site, gives c. 65-80. With Matthew and Luke the differences are often quite a bit more marked. I don't see any consensus at all, just a jumble of hypotheses and speculation. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, I agree the article could use some improvement. I would appreciate some help in that, but instead it gets defaced by citation needed tags after nearly every sentence, including those which already have a citation! The talk page is decorated with the ever-constructive "this article is bollocks," and then it gets put up for deletion, with reasons wiki standards indicate require merely revision. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia needs an article that discusses Synoptic authorship in detail. I understand some of your objections, and I've already re-written it (nearly from the ground up) once, which seemed to be a step in the right direction. I'd love to work on it some more, to the point where most reasonable people can agree on its content, and the disputed tags can be removed. More than that, I'd love some help, which, with few exceptions, is the exact opposite of what I've been getting so far. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but none of those articles discusses the dates of authorship--they don't even mention them in passing! That's not surprising, since none of them need to do so in order to investigate their respective topics. See, the reason I began this article is because I was curious about what wikipedia had to say about dates and authorship. Much to my surprise, the only mention of dates I could find were on the individual Gospel pages themselves, and not in great detail. I also noticed two articles on Johannine authorship and Pauline authorship. So, thought I, I'll write up a little piece of Synoptic authorship. It's a widely discussed topic, I mused, so I'm sure I'll get lots of help and input. At first I did get some help, albeit very little. Now I'm fighting off vandalism from the guy who wants the article deleted. Fantastic. --hurtstotalktoyou</dd>

<dd>Don't AFDs normally get more votes than this? At any rate, I kind of agree that there's no particular reason not to have an article on this topic. None of the articles Clinkophonist cites deals explicitly with this issue, and it seems plausible to have an article with that title. That said, the current article is completely inadequate. Clinkophonist, why don't you work with me to try to make the article decent and have it cite mainstream scholarship, instead of trying (fruitlessly, it would appear) to get it deleted? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 18:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good to me. Heck, we could turn it into a stub and build off that, if you folks are so unsatisfied with its current state. I'm honestly not working off any bias or OR, here. I'm just interested in the topic, and I thought it would be fun to work on a page that seems needed in the wiki world. --hurtstotalktoyou
<dl>
<dd>It would be better to put the material in <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Problem_e2b5.html" title="Synoptic Problem">Synoptic Problem</a>, which is entirely about their authorship, which dates they have etc. The Synoptic Problem is completely affected by the order of the dates, what circumstances they could have been written under (i.e. the issues during the time they were written), and who could have written them - if they were actually written by Matthew-the-apostle and Mark-assistant-to-Simon-Peter then an interdependence would be unlikely, bar what would be expected for reporting the same events, so they are clearly issues that belong in that article. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 22:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, improve</b> Reviewing the edit history shows that there is general improvement over the less than two weeks this article has been in existence. It would be helpful if more users were contributing (not reverting). While the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Problem_e2b5.html" title="Synoptic Problem">Synoptic Problem</a> could discuss the dating issue, it does not do so at all, and need not do so. The subject matter is of sufficient significance to have an article in Wikipedia. Specific discussion about how to improve the article is better left to the talk page for the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The fact that the title and focus of the article has changed is, in my view, strong evidence that it is poorly concieved and unnecessary. This topic is, and should, be covered in the entries for the seperate books. There is not enough commonality to justify a sumary article. While there has been improvement in quality, the basic redundancy of the article makes it a prime candidate for deletion. Any important information or references can be merged into the appropriate articles. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 21:38, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's really not true. The article began as a personal essay on Synoptic authorship. I worked in some material for John just before I submitted it as a wiki article, forgetting it was already covered in the Johannine article. I was in the process of removing references to GJohn when I realized I should probably include Acts, since it is so closely related to the Synoptics. Throughout it all, the focus has remained on the Synoptics. In any case, the individual Synoptic entries don't cover authorship with much depth, nor should they. This article is a collection of hypotheses and theories regarding the composition of four works which are extremely closely related. Inserting those discussions into every one of the Synoptic entries would be extremely redundant and somewhat distracting, in my opinion. --hurtstotalktoyou
<dl>
<dd>Questions of relationships between the synoptics are and should be covered in the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a>. There are no issues of authorship common to them (and not common to the rest of the Biblical corpus) not best covered there. There dates are also not necessarily closely linked. The order of composition is covered in the Synoptic problem while manuscript and patristic evidence is unique to each book. The real issue here, in my mind is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The article seems designed to synthesize the <b>actual evidence</b> fo the dates of the Gospels rather than simply record what previous scholars have published. That's not what wikipedia is and on such controversial subjects is guarunteed to lead to edit wars as people fight about what 'facts' are true.<a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 18:56, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Oh, I wouldn't worry about edit wars. That's common with a lot of wiki pages, but it's never any reason to delete an article. Moreover, it usually seems to result in a better article. Most importantly, though, I cannot stress enough I am not trying to advance original research. I know better than to think my opinion trumps an entire field of scholarship. All I'm trying to do, here, is document the gamut of scholarly opinion, from the minority Christian fundamentalists to the extremist secular scholars. I do believe that's appropriate for wikipedia. --hurtsotalktoyou</dd>
