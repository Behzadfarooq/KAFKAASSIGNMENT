<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Very Strong Keep</b> - Delezio is notable in NSW and Australia. As pointed out he is a significant fundraiser and advocate for disabled people. This is a bad faith and petulant nom by the deletionist nominator who didn't like being challeged vide his/her statement in my talk when challenged on the earlier peremptory deletion <i>I am an editor; I can make decisions. I don't need permission.</i>. This idiotic statement should be enough to rule out the AfD nomination although the article does need expansion. One reason it has not been expanded is that as the article relates to a living person who lives a largely private life but does some notable things (albeit in an Australian context). <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 08:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Jayvdb's comment is. frankly, rubbish. The Father of the Year award is a fund raising vehicle BUT if you look at the list of the recipients you will find that almost all of them have articles in Wp or ought to because of their prominence in Australian history. That is to say the award is taken seriously by the award committee, the recipients and the Australian public perhaps even more than the Australian of the Year award which has been somewhat devalued by the continual awards to nondescript sports people. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 00:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This seems to be a borderline case illustrating the fine line between what should and should not be transwikied to Wiktionary. It is true that currently the article is merely a dicdef. However I believe there is potential for it to grow into a proper encyclopedic article (even if a short one). I think only those dicdefs should be moved to Wikitionary which cannot possibly be expanded into proper articles and will forever remain just that, dictionary definitions. I don't think this is the case here; it is of course a merest stub, but all things begin small. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 02:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> Geral Del Campo, while an author of occult books, is not a notable person. His contributions to occultism are minimal and only within the organization OTO is he recognized as an authority. I harbor no personal ill-will towards Mr. Del Campo at all and I feel that this article would be better served in www.thelemapedia.org than here. Subject is not worthy of inclusion in a broad-based, general encyclopedia such as Wikipedia.org. Subject's literary works are marginal in the field of occultism and are of interest to only a small percentage of a specific sect (Thelemites.)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You make a good point, Jackhorkheimer. However, let me give you a counter-example. I live in an area where the Boy Scouts of America is a large, thriving, and viable organization. They have thousands of members in the "council" region where I live and have numerous property holdings (more even that many minority religious organizations, i.e. the Ordo Templi Orientis.) The leaders of this "Chocoloco Council" (as it is called) have significant influence over the community and many fully grown, adult men still maintain connections with the BSA and the Order of the Arrow. Now, the question raised here is, Do the individual leaders of the Chocoloco Council in Northeast Alabama warrant inclusion in Wikipedia? Remember, this group is a potent force within the Boy Scouts of America which is a potent religio-polticial force within America! Should "Scout Master John X" from down the road have a Wikipedia entry simply because he elected, appointed, or otherwise empowered "Council Leader" and/or because he writes/revises a Scout manual, issues an article for "Boy's Life" magazine, or otherwise makes some small contribution to Scouting? Or should the inclusion criteria be broader, more catholic (in the lower-case "c" use of the word) than that? I would argue that this is a slippery slope argument. You must be careful regarding criteria for inclusion because publications alone may not suffice to merit notability. Likewise, should Wikipedia include every author of every minor religious tract ever written on the basis that some such piece of literature "saved thousands of souls?" The slope is slippery, indeed. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMensKeperRa_5c0d.html" title="User:MensKeperRa">Mens Keper Ra</a>Eyes down, human. 22:57, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is well and good but I notice by your name and a quick scan of the site that you are affiliated with this website. I am also attempting to verify that this site is in no ways affiliated with any of the religio-spiritual organizations of which Mr. Del Campo is a member. Unfortunately, doing a WHOIS lookup on the URL is proving useless. Can you please give some history of this website's service, its function, its creation date, and over-all history? One of the central guidelines of Wikipedia ("pillars" I believe they are called) is that Wikipedia does not serve as an advertising service for companies, persons, religious organizations, charitable organizations, or websites. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMensKeperRa_5c0d.html" title="User:MensKeperRa">Mens Keper Ra</a> Eyes down, human. 22:38, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b>. No. I am not "Mod176" nor do I have any idea who that may be. I would like to suggest to you that just because I target certain articles for deletion does not mean that I am another user or editor. However, please note that the articles I have tagged for deletion pertain to persons who operate on the fringes of the occult community (with which I am intimately familiar.) That others may be familiar with these people (and thus doubt the validity of their inclusion in Wikipedia) is not entirely ureasonable. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMensKeperRa_5c0d.html" title="User:MensKeperRa">Eyes down, human.</a> 09:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- Wow. came back to add a few more examples to something clearly labeled 'stub' and look what I find. This list was created because someone specifically said to me aloud they wished wikipedia had this info - so clearly it's information needed by the world. It neither picks your pocket nor breaks your leg to have verifiable information here, and if as Grutness, an alleged incrementalist, said, the complaint is partially that it is not very fleshed out, well it IS a two day old stub that is being worked on. sheesh. I am so damn sick of the Wikipedia anti-time travel list lobby/cabal - it's this cabal more than any other that is ruining the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 06:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>While information on what periods people have travelled to might be appropriate, perhaps you might want to start in a different direction, say by making a list of time travelers by era (or type. Sam Beckett is a different kind of time traveler than say the Protagonist of the book by Wells) instead of just concentrating on this singular example? At some point in time, I suppose the people who visited the Reing of Terror might be a large enough section of such a list to deserve a spin-off, but that is not yet demonstrated. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> - sure I'm an incrementalist - I even coined the term and wrote the metawiki article on it. Incrementalism doesn't support the idea that any tiny subject is appropriate at a given point in Wikipedia's development. Maybe, just maybe, when Wikipedia is ten times the size it is today, such an article will fit alongside articles of equal worth. But WP is yet to reach that stage, and this article doesn't fit with <i>current</i> expectations of what a Wikipedia article should be. As an incrementalist I agree with Mister.Manticore's comments on starting with a larger, more appropriate list, and only breaking out smaller subtypes as and when they become approriate. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:20, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>fails describe if advances knowledge or changes clinical practice (i.e. fails establish notability for inclusion in an encyclopaedia)

Admittedly some of these are noted for historical reasons, but many are not. Some suffer from not having their numeric results summarized in a standard way that may influence the decision making of doctors and patients. Because the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study (that we are discussing), and many other studies report their benefit in relative terms only, they can be misleading (see research on reporting problems: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8474513" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8474513">PMID 8474513</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14687273" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14687273">PMID 14687273</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10612327" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10612327">PMID 10612327</a>, etc). I am hoping that PMID 8474513 leads to a template on scientific reporting. A decision to delete here for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> seems an arbitrary value judgment. So WikiPedia can have subtle Star Trek and Andy Griffith trivia, but cannot have a report of an article that affected people's health? WK has templates for baseball scores, but not for scientific reporting? If you delete this for lack of notability, you start a slippery slope - where do you draw the line?

<dl>
<dd>To me as the author, the better question is how to fix what I have started. Does an article in its first 24 hours of life have to be perfect to avoid deletion? The shortcomings listed above are accurate and I will get to them. The toughest point to fix that you make is the naming of this article - the article probably needs renaming. Keeping the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources/example_style#Medical_journal_abstracts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources/example_style#Medical_journal_abstracts" rel="nofollow">PMID</a>] in the name helps it be linked to related content around the web (like shopping on the web with a model number rather than a description). Should the name be be 'Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study' as done by the studies listed above? Problem is that are multiple publications from the study and so this would not be a unique name. How about 'Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study (PMID: 7580661)'. This seems tedious, but better bibliographically.</dd>
<dd>This is a very interesting discussion. Regardless of the fate of this article, how is the current discussion archived? Please pardon any deviations I may take from WikiPedia norms, this is a new process to me.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - When I go to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a> and judge their original source (BMJ 1954), it has 211 citations in other medical journals per <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Scientific_Information_b216.html" title="Institute for Scientific Information">Institute for Scientific Information</a>. The more recent article cited (BMJ 2004) has 135 citations. The Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study that I am reporting has 1231 citations. While I am perseverating on this one imperfect metric, the point of it is subjective judgments of notability of this study are risky.<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgettrg_d35e.html" title="User:Badgettrg">Badgettrg</a> 14:31, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Those figures are a good start, but ground-breaking and scholarly are not sufficient to meet my notability yardstick. As the basis of my previous comment, I found <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22British+Doctors+Study%22&amp;start=390" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22British+Doctors+Study%22&amp;start=390" rel="nofollow">374</a> google hits on "British Doctors Study"; having briefly looked through those results, it appears that the study is referenced by govt agencies (other than the UK) and laymen, reinforcing its notability and reason for inclusion in Wikipedia. I've now done the same for "Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study" and found <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Minnesota+Colon+Cancer+Control+Study%22&amp;start=600" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Minnesota+Colon+Cancer+Control+Study%22&amp;start=600" rel="nofollow">343</a> hits, and they appear to put it in the same league.</dd>
<dd>To a certain extent, inclusion will also be based on subjective judgements, and inclusion of this study will be used to justify the inclusion of others (if not on paper, it will certainly be used as rationale inside peoples heads). i.e. there is a slippery slope on the other side of this hill. I am definitely warming to this article being kept as Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I agree this is a very nice summary and is quite constructive on Wikipedia; however Wikipedia is not a directory of journal articles. Perhaps a Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study page would be more fitting, with a summary of each journal article derived from the project on a subpage.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, <b>Delete</b> the wiki is always asking for verifiable data and this is it, and page references could link to pages like this one. I guess that the editor is new to the wiki (please correct me if I am wrong), so I feel that allowances could be made for this. Presentation and readability could be improved, but it is a good idea in my opinion, for what it might become. In may be encyclopaedic to list notable papers. The wiki is not short of space. There is a science in summarising and evaluating research articles and the wiki should not ignore this science. It may be new to the wiki, but the techniques and methods of evaluating statistical medical papers is a science in its own right. It is wiki policy to start articles at a simple level and works up to a very technical level for technical readers and both general and technical readers might want to see some evidence, if it is well presented.

<li><b>Delete</b> A Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study might be a worthy article but I can't judge that, nor should it be up to us editors to judge. If the study is widely referenced in review articles, textbooks and other media then it could be said to be important. This article is no more accessible than the original paper, making it too close to the primary source. In fact, the paper's abstract is more accessible – its concluding sentence contains the essential information that is just not apparent in the article. An encyclopedia must help to reader understand the significance of the results and probably the actual raw figures are not helpful to quote. Interpretation is vital but must draw on secondary sources rather than the editor's own abilities. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:13, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep and Move</b> to Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study , about which there are, according of PubMed, 251 articles. A major long-term clinical study reported in NJEM is notable, since this is the most prestigeous international journal for the reports of these study--no. 1 in Impact Factor in medicine in Science Citation Reports for decades. (don't be put off by "New England"--it means, among other things "Harvard Medical School" and its affiliated hospitals.) We do not have to judge notability, because there are secondary sources to report: first, the editors and peer-reviewewrs of NEJM, second, the authors of all the 251 other articles; This is not OR, this a report in a prestigious journal of the results of research. as CH said, "if the study is widely referenced.." and so it is--of the articles about it <i>29 are review articles</i>, iincluding a review for Annals of Internal medicine, &amp; Archives of Internal medicine, the 2 top internal medicine journals, and JAMA. It does not belong in fecal occult blood test, although that is one of the topics studied. The only problem is that this WP article has been naively edited.</li>

<dd>This particular paper would be one of the referebces, though the main one, because apparently --following the links in PubMed, it is the major publication of the results.

<p>The result was delete. The issues of sources was raised, and there exists rough consensus that these sources do not demonstrate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability.</a> Suggestions were made to merge to an article that does not exist, and of course <i>any</i> deleted article can be restored if/when required for merging into another. (E.g. I'm not keeping this "in case" someone cares enough to merge it, but I'll bring it back if someone does the work first.) It should also be noted that *cough* very new accounts with *cough* under ten edits need to presetn comeplling arguments or bring references to a deletion debate if they would like their voice heard. This is not intended as an exclusionary measure, but is simply a pragmatic one, and anyone editor is always welcome to use my talk page if they would like to discuss it further. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 05:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, on the general ground that we already have a very comprehensive and well-indexed collection of articles on all but the most trivial elements of Tolkien's works.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is only an opinion and I fail to see a reason for deletion. It is mentioned repeately in The Lord of the Rings trillogy and other Tolkien works. If you feel that the <b>longest road</b> in Tolkien's fictional Middle Earth should be deleted, then why not delete places that are not mentioned or visited in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, like <a href="../../../e/r/y/Eryn_Vorn_80d4.html" title="Eryn Vorn">Eryn Vorn</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrast.html" title="Andrast">Andrast</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaddawg_1316.html" title="User:Roaddawg">Roaddawg</a> 01:45, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this is a very good idea.

<li><b>Keep</b> As this is really only one of two roads in middle earth (north-south and east-west), there is nothing really to merge it into. In the general spirit of <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">user:Tevildo</a> above, if this is deleted all Tolkien geographical elements must be as well- this is of the same strand of material. I see no AfDs on other geographical items from Tolkien's work (although I checked only those linking out of this article and the two mentioned above, (Eryn Varn, Andrast, etc.)- why is this one the only item listed? It just seems rather pointless to delete information that people will read, as it has obviously generated some interest as per this debate. Not to mention the fact that notability does not have to be established outside of the book itself based on the mulititude of other trivial articles concerning LOTR.

<dd>In my opinion (again), arguments of this type are most troubling because they acknowledge how problematic the article is but still suggest keeping it because altering it in any way would unleash some sort of biblically proportioned wave of subsequent AfDs, or at the very least, merges and redirects. Any one article being nominated is, in and of itself, automatically justification to keep them all, in a rather odd bit of circular logic (please note that I'm accusing you of bad faith in any way). Perhaps the LOTR/Tolkien project people should spend some much-needed and appreciated effort consolidating trivia into a truly well-written series of parent article instead of presiding over an endless spinning out of non-notable bits and pieces.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> It's not clear to me what the ultimate name should be. As I said, Foster treats <i>North Road</i> as the primary name and says that <i>Old South Road</i> only applies to the stretch of it between Tharbad and Bree. Thus equating it with the Greenway.

<li><b>Keep</b> Okay <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a <b>work of fiction</b>. Therefore, there is <b>not</b> going to be any information on how the <b>Old South Road</b> applies to the contemporary world. The point of the article is to show the massive amount of Tolkien's work (stories, places, people, events) that are all connected by this <b>major</b> road. Each of the sources listed above does just that. I have read all of the entries on this page and it seems to me that there are some people who will never be satisfied no matter the justification. Articles such as this one (and this seems to be much more complete and profound than the works I am referring to) exist throughout Wikipedia and are there to enhance the knowledge of an individual about a specific topic. This is <b>an encyclopedia</b>. Everyone holds different interests, and the point of Wikipedia is to provide a place for everyone to gain more knowledge about a specific topic, fictional or non-fiction. --User:Lossoth 01:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Besides, the group isn't anything notable - they have not impacted the history or current affairs of Belgium, India, Punjab, Sikhism or Europe in any important way (unlike the comments about Muslims in Europe). Nor do they have any members of their community who have done anything notable (and if they do that should be listed on the page). Additionally, the article jumps from discussing a group in general to talking about the death of one of it's members without even mentioning who he is or why his death is in any way relevant to the article. -- <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyca_11df.html" title="User:Qwertyca">Qwertyca</a> 02:36, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the AGHOST entry. It has been recommended by Steel359 that I plead my case for the AGHOST entry here, as it's recently been deleted. I've read the notability guidelines thoroughly, and unlike many of the other "ghost hunting" or "paranormal research" groups out there I believe AGHOST actually has established significant notability in its field. The group has existed for more than 5-years and is a non-profit organization, which is unique among these groups. It also has had a great deal of press, including national (US) press, links to which I added to the article specifically to establish notability. The page <a href="http://www.aghost.us/106.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aghost.us/106.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aghost.us/106.html</a> from the organization's website lists links to some of the media attention it has received. Briefly, some of media includes the Seattle Times, the Oregonian, and ABC News (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=1347154" class="external free" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=1347154" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=1347154</a>).

<p>Created by user:KatieFlanagan who is listed on the company's website in charge of "media contact," who I think has created other accounts, (sock puppets/accounts, TK52 &amp; Drama950 which were created today after the discussion on the talk page according to their user logs and claims user:YAE is the only person who works for the company when the account was created today), to make edits to the page to make it seem like it was being created by neutral editors. Also, user has since moved the page after blanking the old page, YA Entertainment. Really strange behaviour. Anyway, user/article appears to be using wikipedia to advertise their company, only making edits to Korean dramas associated with said company.

Most AfDs I have initiated which have been kept have been because someone bothered to clean them up, but in this case, no one who has voted keep has made any attempt to add references or otherwise improve the list. Thus, I'm still leaning towards delete on this one, simply because while the article itself is possibly worthy of being kept due to the newsworthy nature of rappers being shot, the article itself is totally unmaintained and in need of references. Perhaps it could be left on a temporary basis pending expansion? <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 02:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this is a potentially encyclopedic topic that is actually somewhat likely to be looked up. The problem is, the current content is almost non-existent and there are no sources. I wouldn't be opposed to what is currently there being deleted, without prejudice of recreation with reliable sources.

<li>Well, there are some statements that are dubious from a linguistic point of view, like "French is difficult and there is [sic] many difficult rules". But native speakers seem to handle the language's "difficult rules" just fine. Besides, not all people from English-language communities think French is really that hard. The "difficulty" of French is not an encyclopedic fact, and surely stems from the author's personal POV. So this article definitely contains OR; my previous statement that I "couldn't vouch for" OR status was only about claims regarding facts about French per se. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">szyslak</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">c</a>)</small> 10:34, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know this is a popular game that's been around a while. The problem with this article is that there is no way to verify the rules and point system used in the game.

<dd>Yes, I think so. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> says pretty clearly that articles should not just be game guides. A paragraph describing play, perhaps a list of the basic rules, should accompany an article about the game itself. That being said, I admit that just writing all the rules/strategies is a good beginning for an article, which could then be expanded to the history of the game, uses in pop culture, etc etc. at which point the guide can be pared down.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 16:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

Shanghai Rummy is a <b>card</b> game. As for verifiability, there are many variations of the rules (aka 'house rules'.) Those currently listed seem to have survived editing and time. Otherwise, I suggest Mr. Reaves take the time to address his own concerns rather than raising the delete flag and expecting others to do the work. 66.177.5.252 03:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a fairly popular game, and rules variations are extremely common in card games and shouldn't be a strike against having a page for them. As for the content, I think rules of card games (of the sort that are played with a standard deck of cards) shouldn't really be considered a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Explaining how to play <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge.html" title="Contract bridge">bridge</a> or <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackjack.html" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> isn't a "game guide" in the same way that an explanation of where to jump to get star 1-6 in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_64_2f79.html" title="Super Mario 64">Super Mario 64</a> is. Of course we should strive to have card game articles be more than just the rules, but such an article would seem woefully lacking without at least a brief overview of how the game is played. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 18:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Additionally, though a "<a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">Google Test</a>" is not exactly 100% conclusive, searching for "Simple Remote" (also the name of the software they sell) returns no results that talk about the software or the company, other than the company's website.

<p>It appears fairly clear that there's no such person as Prince Christopher of Luxembourg if one checks any basic references, including the ones on the Luxembourg Royal Family pages, although the writing style of the article seems to also strongly indicate such. The article's original author seems to have invented him, possibly as an act of vanity that oddly reminds me of the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Gardner_b2be.html" title="Joshua Gardner">Joshua Gardner</a> incident. To further back his/her article, the author, FlyingFire, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Flyingfire_2db0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Flyingfire">edited the articles</a> of the siblings and Grand Duke Henri. Notice FlyingFire even went so far as to change the birth dates of some of the actual Royal Family children on <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg_e2e6.html" title="Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg</a> just to fit the birthdate of "Prince Christopher", or else Princess Alexandria would have been born very premature to have come right after Christopher. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnivron_b135.html" title="User:Anivron">Anivron</a> 07:53, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Original prod reason was: <i>The only weak claim to notability was 2 years ago, nothing apparantly notable has happened with the band since. Unsourced, failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, no non-trivial independant third party coverage failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.</i> <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 12:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I was the prodder (just saying for the sake of disclosure). Still those reasons above, I don't believe this band is notable enough yet. They did support Babyshambles, 2 years ago. Nothing has happened with them since from the look of it. 2 years is long time for absolutely nothing new to happen to a band. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 12:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - made the top twenty in the UK singles chart, and article alludes to a tour of New York which if it was properly sourced, along with numerous gigs in the UK would easily satisfy the accepted criteria - even without any reference to Pete Doherty! - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 16:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll happily change to a keep if the article becomes decently sourced in that case.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - After a quick search, I've added sources for the group's tour with Babyshambles, and their UK chart hit. On its own, I suggest the chart hit satisfies <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 10:54, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The first four results on Google are three Myspace pages and this article, and most of the others are lyrics. The name gets 27,800 hits, as opposed to the 1 million+ hits gotten by other bands. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtmack_78d4.html" title="User:Curtmack">Curtmack</a> 16:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>procedural keep</b>. Well, that was a flop. Even after being given a delete reason, and being relisted, no real solid outcome was achieved.

<dd>Oh crap, somehow I listed this without a reason, all of you feel free to slap me a few times! Anyway, the original reason for me listing this was as failing to demonstrate the importance of the subject. This is a new record label. I also <s>do</s> did not see any sources as to why this has any importance. Of course it looks like the article has been updated since my flawed nomination. As such I still think it can use some help with notability, (what makes this special, and or worthy of note?).

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> delete</b> (which I've already done 3 times). It has no evidence of any notability per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> I'm afraid.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 14:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't think we can G4 this, because it's a contested speedy. Doesn't it have to go through AfD at this point? <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 16:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You're right. No point speedying again (A7) as it can be recreated. Let's leave it to AfD. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:20, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I think it's questionable whether A7 should apply. When we ask for articles on corporations to make claims that their company is important or significant, we're actually pushing them to write <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">spam</a>. In my view, if the article explains the company enough that we can get a good idea what it is, and it seems unique or at least not heavily duplicated, A7 should not apply. If it seems heavily duplicated (say, an article on a dry cleaning establishment), some kind of claim of importance must be needed. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Individual moves are the subject matter for news articles, not encyclopedia articles. While the subject matter is clearly worth including in the article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> and possibly <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Galaxy_796e.html" title="Los Angeles Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>, I think we should really wait until the dust settles to see if this has real historical significance in and of itself. Perhaps it is a shame to delete outright this work, but I think that a transwiki of the article to wikinews, and merging of appropriate parts to David Beckham and elsewhere would be appropriate. Otherwise, this is a pretty dangerous precedent of encyclopedia articles on individual transfers. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 14:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

If a few people have publicly referred to the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a> as an "ethnic cleansing", that should be at least mentioned in that article. Some of the sources listed here could be used over there. But all <i>this</i> article is doing is attempting to establish an "ethnic cleansing" case by itself. Comments like "The Israeli occupation government uses a racist ID card system" are irrelevant. Does one of the sources listed actually say that this ID card is an ethnic cleansing tool?

<dd>First off, what you're doing is attacking users for their identity and nationality. Stop it at once. My personal opinions have nothing to do with this (nor do you know anything about me, except that I'm an Israeli. Guess that makes me guilty of whatever it is you're claiming).</dd>
<dd>We can all read, and the name of that article is "The <b>1948</b> Ethnic Cleansing...". If you want to talk about other time periods, you're dealing with the wrong article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Although I do not endorse the existence of this article, the listing of this article for deletion was done in bad faith. No debate occured on talk page, no attempt was made to move to an appropriate name. No discussion of any sort was made to come to an agreement with a user who is apparently very new. Also, the POV argument doesn't hold in light of <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_genocide.html" title="Rwandan genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>. I suspect the intention behind deleting this article are just as POVish as the intention behind creating thsi article.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't accuse me of bad faith. The article was created, and then deleted as it was a copyright violation. Then it was recreated, only shorter. It was copied from some website, based on an <b>unpublished</b> book. Apart from the copyright violation, it's a POV fork of Palestinian Exodus, written to advocate a certain viewpoint. As such, it should be deleted. It still should, as no one can even make up their mind what this article is trying to talk about (even the user who uploaded it called it "1948...", and then claimed it's about today as well). For allegations about current issues, there's <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. This article looks like an opinion column, and has no place here. Also, the user has engaged in personal attacks, using ad hominem tactics, and attacking users (such as myself) for their nationality. <a href="../../../o/k/e/User%7EOkedem_d37e.html" title="User:Okedem">okedem</a> 21:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a short article that has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/El_Salvador:_Gangs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/El_Salvador:_Gangs" rel="nofollow">zero mainspace pages that link to it</a>. While certainly a potentially encyclopedic topic, this article needs at the very least a rename and expansion. However, my suggestion is that we <b>merge</b> the verifiable parts of the page into <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Salvador_2636.html" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <b>delete</b> it. I'm sending it here to get more opinions and attention. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23"><font color="#0000EE"><b>Eric</b></font></a> (<a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">EWS23</a>) 16:34, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge into <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Salvador_2636.html" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>.</b> The topic is encyclopedic, but it should be kept in the main article about El Salvador, perhaps under the "crime" heading. The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> parts of this will fit comfortably into the acceptable length for an article about a nation. If one is going to create a separate article on a topic like this, it should be something to the effect of Crime in El Salvador, per naming conventions and so that all of the crime in the nation will be covered. However, I must reiterate that this section of the main article is not yet lengthy enough to split. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 16:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It would be good to have an article on Tatangelo's predecessor, J.C. "Pepe" Martin, Jr. I don't think there is much on the Internet and doing an article on Martin might require "original" research.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article chronicles one of the most memorable moments of American sports in 2006--Mikulik himself is not notable, but his tirade is--and the article is essentially about his tirade (we could re-name the article "Joe Mikulik tirade," but that just sounds lame). We do not have crystal balls. You might say he'll be forgotten next year. I say next time a baseball manager blows up, the ESPN wags will say he had a "Mikulik moment" or that he "went Mikulik." By the way, I consider <a href="http://www.theashevilletourists.com/images/2006_cards/mikulik.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.theashevilletourists.com/images/2006_cards/mikulik.htm" rel="nofollow">this official team bio</a> a reliable source and will add this reference to the article if it's not there already.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 17:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b>I am David, the author of this page. Evan Sackett IS NOT the author of this page. Yes, my screename is User:Evan Sackett. This is because I was trying to make the page and I incorrectly labeled it. If feel Mr. Sackett deserves this page. He is currently being published and I worked hard on this page. I shouldn't have added the material I did to Andy Warhol's page, even though it was true. There is a strange occurance happening with me. There is another user claiming to be Evan Sackett and all this. It's a mess we're getting straightened out. But give me time to work on this article.

<p>It's more a bad essay than an encyclopaedia article. An article with this name is bound to be very subjective so I don't think WP is the place for it at all anyway.

<ul>
<li>I am sorry but I would have to disagree with you on some points&#160;:
<ul>
<li>First, When I make the search you pointed out on google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=acceleo+code+generator+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=acceleo+code+generator+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">acceleo code generator -wikipedia</a>), I get 10700 results which is not bad. Acceleo is a young opensource code generator (April 2006) but is now quite well known and has a good community of users. Now we do have more related links in french as the project was initially french.</li>
<li>I do agree that beeing an opensource software is not a reason to keep an article, but there is nothing commercial in the article, it is explaining what the features are</li>
<li>Obeo is the company that has started the project so Acceleo and Obeo are related</li>
</ul>

<p>This person appears to not be notable enough for an article. The only thread that her notability rides is that she was (1) the first African-American female to be hired by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as a Special Agent and (2) the first female to complete a U.S. Coast Guard Patrol on the high seas and to board a foreign vessel, and a couple of other even more minor female firsts. However, there is a first female for <i>everything</i>. Some may deserve articles, the great majority do not. The first female FBI agent might be notable. The first African-American female (not even the first female) NMFS agent is not, in my opinion, the NMFS being far less notable and important than the FBI. "First female to complete a U.S. Coast Guard Patrol on the high seas and to board a foreign vessel" also does not, in my mind, confer sufficient notability for the person to have an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:25, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does not satisfy notability requirements. The only thing that could be argued as notable here is his affiliation with the Zophar's Domain website, but there is nothing notable about the person himself in that respect. None of his music projects described here are at all notable. Furthermore, there is no substantial content in this stub to even consider merging into the other page. radimvice 16:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>, though I'd argue whether it's more popular than either a reef or brackish water aquarium! Growth rate isn't much of a criterion, either, and however popular nano reef tanks get, they're surely going to be outnumber by goldfish tanks and tropical aquaria 100 to 1. But yes, it's an increasingly popular branch of the hobby, and probably deserves an entry of its own. That said, this article is lacking in many ways. I'd like to see the specifics about the procedural / technological differences between nano reefs and regular reefs, and I'd also like a potted history, emphasising the aquarists that pioneered the discipline. I'd like to see the article say why nano reef tanks in specifics, not generalities. All aquaria have issues with pH, ammonium, etc. What's different is the thermal / chemical instability of small volumes of water, the sensitivity of the fish compared with freshwater fish in small aquaria, and so on. The section <i>Pico Reef</i> should be merged with the introduction (e.g., ...very small nano reef tanks are sometimes called pico reefs). Otherwise, it's repetitive and not really saying anything new, just "as above, but more so".

<p>Yet even with gasoline selling for well above $2 a gallon, alternative-fuel vehicles may save their owners only a few hundred dollars a year in fuel costs. For many motorists, that may not be enough to offset the extra expense of purchasing such a vehicle, said Edwin Stafford, a Utah State University marketing researcher.... In the case of hybrid and natural-gas-fueled vehicles, there is the benefit of "conspicuous conservation." Status can be gained from being among a growing number of motorists driving a socially conscious vehicle that helps the environment, Stafford said.</p>

<p>The result was delete.</p>
<p>The issue of a reliable source is raised in the nomination and never adressed. WMMartin's comments about ease of finding sources and cleanup are noted, but (without casting aspersions) no sourced are cited by him. Lacking such, and noting that per the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification policy</a> the burden is on those wishing the article kept, the decision is clear.</p>

<dd>Yea, i noticed word mythical, who knows what confused person put it there, this is by no means mythical, if you search all over, the term lineal is always considered a recognized champ, especially if there are no others.

<dd>With respect, its not ridiculous. As noted, the article has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> This is a well known boxing term, anyone who doesn't know that already could find out with a search engine. The article is pretty decent, if you can do better then do so. To delete it is absurd, but that's what you get when you give control of something like Wikipedia over to elitist pedants who never would have countenanced it's existence in the first place. It's sad that even after Wikipedia ALREADY exists, some people's greatest aspiration in the world is to turn it into another Encyclopedia Britannica.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_b14f.html" title="User talk:Anonymous">User_talk: Anonymous</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.36.201.115_42b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.36.201.115">71.36.201.115</a> (talk) 07:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> In the boxing world, discussions about the linear heavyweight title are fairly commonplace. It is a way of distinguishing between real champions and lesser titlists who only hold sanctioning body belts. It is a real concept, too, dating from the championship of John L. Sullivan. There is no reason to delete this topic. MKil 17:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)MKil</li>
<li>It was relatively easy for me, as a non-expert, to find evidence of this term and its meaning from multiple sources. The topic clearly exists and is notable amongst boxing afficionados. The article does seem to contain some POV comments and suffers from poor construction, but these are not reasons to delete. Further, this is one of those rare cases where a list is useful: it provides order and context that would otherwise be missing. I suggest <b>Keep</b>, and tag for substantial <b>Cleanup</b>, including better and more consistent referencing, and a request that someone tidy up the table at the end. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 22:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
