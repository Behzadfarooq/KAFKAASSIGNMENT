The front page is a news page, and in the forum might be lots of chat, but from regular users that keep it running. The point where the site becomes great value, is for the inexperienced web/computer user that is requesting help. I had seem lots of users that looked lost, but ended feeling welcome in the site, and resolved their computer related problems. It also has a lot of sections that keep information accessible for users. If the original article was biased, I think it can be corrected, and it should not be very difficult to do.</small>

<li>You cite bad logic. It was you who called the site a "advertisement" from the beginning. Then you write this: "I'm pleased that, following the placement of the tag, your next edits cleaned up the article somewhat, replacing the "our" and "we" with "their" and "they", which is a great improvement." Then the following day you try to delete the page. Logic dictates that you call it a "GREAT IMPROVEMENT" and then you try to delete the site, means one of two things, you are confused or you've gone the way of the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkside.html" title="Darkside">darkside</a>. <small>(This comment by User:Big Booger was lost when I was trying to save an edit, and kept getting server connection errors, so I am manually resoring it. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 13:48, 5 November 2005 (UTC))</small>
<ul>
<li>I did indeed call the article an advertisement from early on. You or own of your puppets removed the tag immediately I put it on. Your selective quoting of me is interesting: to selectively quote myself from your quote, <i>I'm pleased that, following the placement of the tag, your next edits cleaned up the article somewhat</i> - note the last word.I then went away and allowed time for the article to be improved <i>more than</i> somewhat. This didn't happen: it was obviously just advertising and obviously had no encyclopedial merit or notability, as stated in the guidelines - which are prominently linked from all over the Wikipedia and where very clearly linked from the advertising tag you (or puppets of you) deleted. I'm sorry you don't agree with the listing of your article here, but the idea of listing here is to gain a consensus of Wikipedia community members. That consensus may have proved me wrong - a decision I would accept without question. But I fear that now we will never know.

I have used wikipedia countless times, but as many users I come here to learn a topic, so I am in no condition to edit an article, since I am learning the topic. In this case I do know about it. I am a member of the forum, but I don't think my vote should be discarded, because I can discuss about the forum knowing very well about it. If you think that the article should be deleted, take a look around the forum itself. Hardware and Software sections have lots of post requesting help. Tips and tweaks I believe is a noteworthy section where you can find a large list of tips and tweaks.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>tzefcI am another contributer at Techzonez. I have found it interesting to read the "delete" comments. These people obviously don't need the kind of help we offer. We are the place that a new user can come and find prompt and usually good technical advice. The atmosphere is always polite. No one will ever be humilated because they don't how to solve a simple problem. While there are many topics at Techzonez, the core reason for the site is tech support.

<li><b>Keep</b>Techzonez deserves to have a Wikipedia article. I have been a member of the forum for over a year now and can say without a doubt that it is the best tech support forum on the net. Better than the likes of MSFN and Neowin- because the people there are polite and ensure that questions are answered no matter what. The sheer number of questions that have been answered by the members of the community makes Techzonez one of the largest searchable databases of tech support questions on the internet. Also note that Techzonez is not 'just another tech forum'.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Dalbury, do you know what a sock puppet is? I'm sure you've spent god a lot of time here at Wikipedia and yet you keep rambling on without making much sense. Let me clarify. A sock puppet is <b>"A sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name. The Wikipedian who uses a sock puppet may be called a sock puppeteer."</b> All the voters against the deletion of this article are genuine members of the Wikipedia community, albeit first time users/first time editors. Secondly, why must we take down this article and why can neowin and slashdot stay up?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Did you read all of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock puppet policy</a> page? The last section, "Meat puppets", says:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A related issue occurs when non-Wikipedians create new accounts specifically to influence a particular vote or discussion. This is especially common in deletion discussions. These newly created accounts (or anonymous edits) may be friends of a Wikipedian, or may be related in some way to the subject of an article under discussion.<br />
These accounts are not actually sockpuppets, but they are difficult to distinguish from real sockpuppets and are treated similarly. Neither a sockpuppet nor a brand-new, single-purpose account holder is a member of the Wikipedia community. The reason behind this is, for instance, that an article about an online community should not be kept merely because all members of that community show up to vote for it. The Arbitration Committee has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neowin is a tech forum like Techzonez. Like I said 12,890 users do not constitute a 'narrow interest group'. Your problem is that it sounds like an advertisement, we have edit it to conform to Wikipedia standards. What's the fuss about now?<a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohitk89_5ec4.html" title="User:Rohitk89">Rohitk89</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What about the other question? Must we delete the article or simply edit it so as to prevent it from appearing like an advertisment? What if we remove all links directed to TZ? Also 12,890 people do not constitute a 'narrow interest group'.Rohit 15:30, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, please edit the article so it is no longer an advertisement. Also, please prove notability. And 12,890 people, in terms of internet reach, is <i>exactly</i> what I'd define as a narrow interest group.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've found Techzonez a helpful guide to my <i>baka</i> computer problems and therefore it's a valuable resource of information when it's edited into wiki-style information. It's important that such help.information is recycled to the general public---the Wikipedia is the perfect venue for this.<small>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taro_T_6e2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taro T">contribs</a> - Editor's first edit was earlier today. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 16:31, 5 November 2005 (UTC))</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> regarding your comment on the talk page,and i quote "Your quest for a Google rank is understandable, but doing it here is downright pathetic.?" we hardly need to improve our google ranking,its fine as it is thank you. You've clearly got some other underlying reason for opposing our wiki,rather than just the content. Anyway,delete away if it gives you a buzz. We innocently set up the wiki as a form of information,unfortunately you are too far up your own arse to see that. Oh and btw,you mentioned good manners in your previous reply,obviously no one told you its considered rude to use all capital letters in your username.

<li><b>Keep</b> Techzonez is a great place for sharing knowledge about computers and technologies in general, reading news, solving PC-related problems and discussing about a lot of arguments. It's a reference for a lot of people, so I think it's good that TZ is included in Wikipedia.
