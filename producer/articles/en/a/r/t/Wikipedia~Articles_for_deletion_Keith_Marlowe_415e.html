<li><b>Delete</b> this singular example of hagiography. Singular in that I don't think I have ever seen an article with so many edits where so few of them have been by logged-in users; virtually the entire article is the work of anons. Not that it's a problem, except in as much as the lack of references makes it necessary to rely on the reputation of the editors, but pretty much the only contribs from accounts with user pages are the addition of tags. Anyway, appears to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and looks very much like more Vaughancruft. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:07, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are lots of biographies on Wikipedia, that some people may consider "low value." This seems to be particularly true of the slew of American editors who have been editing/recommending the page for deletion lately. It is particularly troublesome that some of the criticism is grounded in an attitude of 'this isn't interesting to non-American readers.' That seems to be contrary to the Wikipedia spirit. If Wikipedia is a community, then it should respect that not all content will be equally interesting to all readers (including our friends to the South), however, that does not necessarily make it worthy of deletion. If you check Keith's web site, he has been published in nearly every daily newspaper in Canada (<a href="http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html" class="external free" title="http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html" rel="nofollow">http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html</a>). I doubt any of the editors could say the same about themselves. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.207.120.112 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.207.120.112_9018.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.207.120.112">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Because there is a possibility that someone from Canada (which would, of course, include people from University of Windsor and of course Keith Marlowe himself) could have been masquerading as you.

<li>Agreed except it is quite evident from the amount of editing from moderators that much of what occured on this webpage was the work of vandalism and personal attacks (which should be expected considering its a political figure involved). 208.181.120.222 somehow equates 'thoughts' with 'factual evidence'which is not always true As well, 208.181.120.222 (and everyone else) would have to argue that somehow Marlowe's term and Presidency were not a useful tool for understanding the fusion of the Conservative movement in Canada today (which subsequently is in government).Template:Blogger82.</li>

<dd>User:208.181.120.222--How exactly do you know that it was Keith Marlowe who wrote the article in the first place? (disregard the history when making your case, because I could create an account with the name Keith Marlowe). Blogger82 (if it is indeed you): The article doesn't actually say how Marlowe's term changed anything with the Conservative movement in Canada. In fact, the conservatives voted away his youth wing after they merged. <a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontomars2k4</a> 00:35, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Does a person have to "change" something about a movement in order to have a Wikipedia page? I'm not sure Patrick Brown or Tasha Kherridan or any youth president really "changes" a movement per se. They are involved, and do what they can to defend the party's interests, the youth members' interests, and the conservative movement's interests. Marlowe was a vocal supporter of the merger from early on, and was a significant reason why the youth wing supported the merger in greater numbers than the party as a whole.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Keith Marlowe has been published in the largest newspapers in the country (The Globe and Mail, the National Post, the Calgary Herald, the Halifax Chronicle Herald, the Vancouver Province, the Ottawa Citizen, the Calgary Sun, the Whitehorse Star, etc.) including several of the major university campus papers. Marlowe was the president of the PC Youth Federation, which is roughly comparable to the College Republicans or the College Democrats. If you have a problem with Keith, a young conservative leader in Canada, having a Wikipedia page, then I expect that you will all have a problem with other young conservatives, such as Paul Gourley or Eric Hoplin (both national presidents of the College Republicans) having Wikipedia pages as well. Look their pages up...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.207.120.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.207.120.102_7efb.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.207.120.102">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Irregardless of whether this happens to be true or not, 137.207.120.102 makes a good point in that wikipedia would indeed have to go delete almost every single page from every single youth president that is on here in the entire world.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think to delete this page is to ignore a critical part of history with regards to the merger of the Canadian Conservative movement in Canada. For someone that is looking into information concerning the final days of the Progressive Conservative party this page would be a suitable resource in conjunction with other pages. As I added some information that I considered to be quite relevant to this page, I suppose I bear some resposability for some of the information on it. However this can all be resolved through the use of edits and not through outright deletion. That would be considered an extreme measure. 137.207.120.102 is quite correct in pointing out that there remain many cases of other youth Presidents (from other parties and from other countries) on wikipedia. I doubt very much that as much internal-party change occured while those young men were in power that occured under Marlowe's. To remain fair, wikipedia would have to delete their webpages as well.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Seems to be a vanity piece and not really relevant to modern canadian politics or recent political history. It also has nothing to do with any political mergers, as Keith Marlowe is not noted in any Conservative Party documents as playing a key role. Also it should be note that Blogger82 contributed to the content earlier (most of the vanity content), and the IP address 137.207.120.102 is from U of Windsor. Why does all of the supporters for this page come from this school? It is true that other "youth" leaders have wiki pages, but no where come close to the overblown content that is in this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've read the posts on this page, and as someone who was involved with the party when the merger occurred, I do find some value in the page. I think deletion would be rather extreme, given that there are biographies of most of the more recent PC Party presidents (Bruck Easton, etc.) on Wikipedia. I think the page could be perhaps made more factual, and I will attempt to do an edit on the site this evening. At any rate, I hope the edit will appease the masses, and we can move on...</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The President of the Youth Wing of one of Canada's then leading political parties makes him notable enough for mine. Needs editing though.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article of Keith Marlowe is pretty bad. Loged in users could do a better job. Not that they are bad. Someone needs to put more references, I will try to find some more info on him. I dont think it is necessarily worthy a deletion. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFellowWikipedian_5e3b.html" title="User:FellowWikipedian">FellowWikipedian</a> (A person from Canada) 11:49, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>President of the youth wing for one of Canadas lesser powerful political parties. According to wikipedia, for a political individual to have a page they must have held office in some level of government. Marlowe fails to meet that. Also this has been up now for five days. And should be deleted soon.</p>
