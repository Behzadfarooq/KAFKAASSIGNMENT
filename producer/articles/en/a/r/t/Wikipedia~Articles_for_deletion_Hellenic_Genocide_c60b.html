There is substantial evidence that the genocides commited by the Turks in the years between 1908 and 1923 (Armenian, Hellenic, Assyrian and others) are a fact, involving the extermination and deportation of millions. The fact that after decades of a fruitless denial, Turkey still cannot come to grips with these facts, does not make it reasonable not to present them or consider them disputable.

<li><sup><font color="#FF8C00"><b>Keep</b> This is an excellent factual contribution providing information on a Gewnocide that has been hidden for too long because it is denied by the perpetrators, the Turks, who now are trying to remove it. It is a fact that probably a minimum of 1 million Greeks were murdered in a systematic act of genocide, and that fact should never be forgotten. In order to check facts, one only has to check census figures collected by the Ottoma\n Empire for minirities. Only the heads of households were counted. Where are those hundreds of thousands of heads of households now? Where are their families? Denying the facts of genocide permits genocide to be committed. This Genocide is a fact, as was the Genocide of the Armenians, now recognised by more countries each year, in spite of the insistance by Turkey that it never happened. To not have this article would be to politicise Wikipedia. For an introduction to this subject read a book written by a contemporary witness, US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, read 'The Blight of Asia', available to read online and in bookstores.</font></sup></li>
<li><sup><font color="#FF8C00"><b>Keep</b> The turks are responsible for the Armenian, Greek and Syrian Genocide and the EU is starting to press forward with this issue.. it seems that turkish propaganda is playing a detremental role. Until this very day churches are confiscated. By deleting this article, means that were are giving in to barbarism and lies. Hopefully this is not what wikipedia is about.</font></sup></li>
<li><sup><font color="#FF8C00"><b>Keep</b> I think this is a well written article. The Turks should come to terms with their own history and stop being stubborn about it. Germany is a great example of a country that has repented for their sins. The European Union are pressing Turkey for this issue and also to have relations with Armenia. What are Turks afraid of anyway, true free ethnic equality?</font></sup></li>
<li><sup><font color="#FF8C00"><b>Weak Keep</b> The topic is noteworthy in spite of the obvious problems with the current content. Whether the article content is accurate or POV should not drive the deletion decision. Those can be fixed via editing and fact checking. The debate surrounding the historical facts is relevant and there is content available to fix this article's content. Having an article about this topic is appropriate. My only reservations are about the chances of this article successfully reaching NPOV status. Due to the controversial nature of the subject matter I expect that will be a challenge. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 20:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></li>

The article as it stands now is a POV rant with major factual inaccuracies/distortions. I had suggested renaming to a less-inflammatory title or merging with other articles, but facts that I can find are scattered through several other Greek/Greece/Turkey/Turkish articles. It is a historical fact that Greek people were forcibly removed from Turkey, just like Turks were forcibly removed from Greece, Armenians from Turkey, etc. Pretty much every ethinc/national group in that region has been on the top and the bottom of the hierarchy at one time or another. All of these events are pretty important, if little-known, historical facts (read anything about the region by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Kaplan_ed3d.html" title="Robert D. Kaplan">Robert D. Kaplan</a> for some great predictions). They helped lead to WWI and WWII... may lead to WWIII. The entire family of articles about Balkan history needs a ton of work, but I don't know nearly enough to do anything.

Leave this hatred propaganda...We fought because of religion difference, the war ended 90 years ago, and Greek army was defeated.

<li><sup><font color="#FF8C00">Dear Cansin, there is no hatred propaganda. Greece and Turkey will be neighbouring forever. It would be a major step towards peace though, to help Turkey stop the denial approach of history and recognise the genocides. History always speaks about the past. Leaving it behind is forgetting history, which is not the right choice. In what concerns your references to Byzantium and Anatolia, well, this is your personal pov and I do not agree. The Ottomans were quite tolerant with other religions and ethnic tribes. The Young Turks however, were not tolerant. 20th century, that's when Anatolia stopped being a "mixed up" (multiethnic I would describe it) area.--<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 07:40, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></li>

There is substantial evidence that the genocides commited by the Turks in the years between 1908 and 1923 (Armenian, Hellenic, Assyrian and others) are a fact, involving the extermination and deportation of millions. The fact that after decades of a fruitless denial, Turkey still cannot come to grips with these facts, does not make it reasonable not to present them or consider them disputable. A genocide does not have to be recognised by its perpetrators to actually be a genocide.--Spryom 12:19, 26 May 2005 (UTC) User's second edit to Wikipedia. RickK 20:27, May 27, 2005 (UTC) Keep--.

Please keep this page. Mark Tomson. USA (Revision as of 21:19, 26 May 2005 212.70.194.23) Keep This is an excellent factual contribution providing information on a Gewnocide that has been hidden for too long because it is denied by the perpetrators, the Turks, who now are trying to remove it. It is a fact that probably a minimum of 1 million Greeks were murdered in a systematic act of genocide, and that fact should never be forgotten. In order to check facts, one only has to check census figures collected by the Ottoma\n Empire for minirities. Only the heads of households were counted. Where are those hundreds of thousands of heads of households now? Where are their families? Denying the facts of genocide permits genocide to be committed. This Genocide is a fact, as was the Genocide of the Armenians, now recognised by more countries each year, in spite of the insistance by Turkey that it never happened. To not have this article would be to politicise Wikipedia. For an introduction to this subject read a book written by a contemporary witness, US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, read 'The Blight of Asia', available to read online and in bookstores. (Revision as of 22:09, 26 May 2005 AnnaL) Keep The turks are responsible for the Armenian, Greek and Syrian Genocide and the EU is starting to press forward with this issue.. it seems that turkish propaganda is playing a detremental role. Until this very day churches are confiscated. By deleting this article, means that were are giving in to barbarism and lies. Hopefully this is not what wikipedia is about. (Revision as of 10:41, 27 May 2005 62.252.32.14) Keep I think this is a well written article. The Turks should come to terms with their own history and stop being stubborn about it. Germany is a great example of a country that has repented for their sins. The European Union are pressing Turkey for this issue and also to have relations with Armenia. What are Turks afraid of anyway, true free ethnic equality? (Revision as of 20:09, 27 May 2005 138.5.97.153) Weak Keep The topic is noteworthy in spite of the obvious problems with the current content. Whether the article content is accurate or POV should not drive the deletion decision. Those can be fixed via editing and fact checking. The debate surrounding the historical facts is relevant and there is content available to fix this article's content. Having an article about this topic is appropriate. My only reservations are about the chances of this article successfully reaching NPOV status. Due to the controversial nature of the subject matter I expect that will be a challenge. Tobycat 20:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC) <strike>Keep. (Note that I am not a sockpuppet). I posted a blurb to the article's talk page before it was VfD'ed, but I'll post again here. The article as it stands now is a POV rant with major factual inaccuracies/distortions. I had suggested renaming to a less-inflammatory title or merging with other articles, but facts that I can find are scattered through several other Greek/Greece/Turkey/Turkish articles. It is a historical fact that Greek people were forcibly removed from Turkey, just like Turks were forcibly removed from Greece, Armenians from Turkey, etc. Pretty much every ethinc/national group in that region has been on the top and the bottom of the hierarchy at one time or another. All of these events are pretty important, if little-known, historical facts (read anything about the region by Robert D. Kaplan for some great predictions). They helped lead to WWI and WWII... may lead to WWIII. The entire family of articles about Balkan history needs a ton of work, but I don't know nearly enough to do anything. Sadly, most of the people who do know enough seem to be from the region, so they bring a strong POV to editing.
