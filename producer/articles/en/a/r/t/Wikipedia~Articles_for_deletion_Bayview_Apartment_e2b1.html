<li><b>Comment:</b> This is neither a real estate spam or conflict of interest. It is only a record for the historical page regarding the Wespoint collapse and the herigage buildings' history of the apartment. Of course, the apartment itself is the evident that the remaing investors survied are enjoying their life style with the facilities and environment of the apartment. The combined unique features of the apartment cannot be found in all other apartments in Port Melbourne. 30-Oct-06 220.238.76.132 06:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments against deletion</b> The primary purpose and goal of Wikipedia is to provide free education and knowledge exchange. The article of Bayview Apartment may sound like a real estate spam if the people read the article at the surface. Actually, the Bayview Apartment is a window opening to a broader explorer to the heritage buildings, which indicates the historical economy, culture, community in Port Melbourne. More information will be added regarding the heritage buildings if this article could be kept for future viewers. In the past decade, Port Melbourne has been dramatically and rapidly transformed from a working class slum to a very attractive and livable suburb closing to the Melbourne city. That’s why these words such as “due to its location, convenient shopping and dinning environment, and enjoyment of the leisure” were inserted into the article. Bayview Apartment contributed a remarkable and significant influence to the transformation of Port Melbourne, especially to the Bay Street, which is virtually a heritage street. The retail shops of the Bayview Apartment make the Bay Street more variable and vibrate the Port Melbourne community. Then the article mentioned the collapsed developer Westpoint, who built the Bayview Apartment, inevitably Bayview Apartment become a historical mirror of the collapsed Wespoint. Westpoint went to under became one of the biggest news in the financial market in Australia history. Westpoint originally organized two schemes to investors through either buying the unit of the apartment or the promising notes through the financial planners and its sales network. The investors who bought the promising notes ended with the tragedy of their life saving lost. Those who bought the unit eventually are survived because today they still own the property and keep the market value and may enjoy a moderate capital gain in the current property market situation. The article paid attention to the investors survived. Does it sound like an investment scheme promotion seminar? The purpose of this article does not promote any sort of the investment but gives to a future viewer a recognition that “bricks and mortar” make more common sense than “promising notes and mezzanine companies” if a future viewer may not be a sophisticated or astute investor. Therefore, the article itself is very educational to the future viewers, which exactly is in compliance with Wikipedia’s policies and objectives. Obviously, the notability of the Bayview Apartment speaks itself. After 10-20 years, people may forget the lesson of collapsed Westpoint (one of the most notable financial collapsing in the Australia history). However, if people walk pass the Bayview Apartment building and read this article in the Wikipedia, free encyclopedia; Bayview Apartment has full of the historical stories in a very broad aspect. 31/10/06 220.238.76.132 13:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Merge into Westpoint company article and redirect. The bankruptcy appears to be a very notable event making the company worthy of coverage on Wikipedia, but the apartment complex is just one of their projects. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 13:20, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is no doubt that Bayview Apartment is a window to those notable events. If the window was shutted, the viewers might not be able to see the insight/outsight. People may not be so enthusiastic and interested in finding the history for the sake of the history. But if people see the heritage buildings of the apartment, that may trigger their curiosity to type the words “bayview apartment” in the search box of Wikipedia. Then all the stories will be revealed and Wikipedia reached its objective.(Note: the Bayview Apartment is a huge complex which occupied a whole block of the land by multiple buildings. Two heritage buildings are a visible attraction) 01/11/06 220.238.76.132 13:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
