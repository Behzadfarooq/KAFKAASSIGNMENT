<li><b>Borderline -- weak Delete</b>. It says <a href="http://nrcc.org/nrcc_contents/tools/spotlights/brown.shtml" class="external text" title="http://nrcc.org/nrcc_contents/tools/spotlights/brown.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> that "Dr. Brown was recently appointed to serve on the Advisory Council for the National Institute for Aging by Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson." I don't know if that means much, but there it is. It looks like she's a go-getter and active public citizen, but there are lots of those. But not all of them get them come to attention of the national GOP. Here's the thing: if the editor had written a longer article, stressing her publications and involvement with the Center for Value-Based medicine, and topped it off with her political campaigns, maybe it would be a keeper. But she didn't, and is anyone really ever going to back and do that? Especially considering they would have to add <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2004/10/14/news-1386200.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2004/10/14/news-1386200.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>: <i>"[A]n insurance company, the Pennsylvania Physician Healthcare Plan, [was] co-founded by Brown in 1995. The company failed four years later and was taken over by the state government. In 2000, the company was sued by the state for fraud, conspiracy and illegally conveying money to its directors. The suit was settled out of court, and the terms of the settlement were not disclosed."</i> Yes she has published many technical articles and some books and served on boards, but does she pass the Professor Test? I think not quite. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:15, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undecided.</b> If DialUp is right, and this is the same person, then that woudl probably qualify, just about, as long as the named institutions are genuine and significant (and let's not forget that every lobby group has its own tame "institute"). On the other hand, how come nobody actually bothered to put in enough information about the candidate while they were running? This is a classic example of exactly the point I made in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a> - information on a failed candidate is hard to verify and unlikely to be miantained because it was created not by a consitutency interested in the candidate, but by a constituency interested in the election; once the election is underway this constituency has no further interest in keeping the candidate's article up to date. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 10:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Note that a great deal of her public service is highly partisan (i.e. "not real organizations" or, more NPOV, "head of minor, probably non-functional organizations that serve to increase partisan political position without affecting actual public health"), but that is not grounds for this vote. The <i>article</i> only profiles her as a bit of trivia for losing in two elections to the House. 440 losers per four years is too high a number, but the real number is higher than that, as there is no indication that this woman was the nominee of one of the two parties, and we have many more losers in the primaries. If this were a biography/profile of a Republican Party operative, it might well be a keep, but the notability established by the article is solely that she lost twice. Everybody hurts some time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>She was the Republican nominee, not some minor party where you can get on the ballot by having 25 friends willing to sign a petition.

<li>I have no problem with that, as they are archivists. I don't believe, however, that an encyclopedia article is necessary <i>as a biography</i> of each failed candidate. My delete vote, though, was not actually based upon her herself but on this article, which did not include any information on her except her losing status. By itself, I don't think that triggers biography. In this particular person's case, she is being kept politically alive by some of the most harsh right wing Republican organizations. (I have heard her discussed by left wing sites and radio, as she's a bit vicious and nasty from my POV.) Thus, I do think a biography is possible, but not this article. Obviously, I would reconsider if it were rewritten. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
