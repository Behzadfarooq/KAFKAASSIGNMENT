<p>I was a member of the List of Lost episodes mediation a few months ago, where we unanimously came up to a consensus regarding season/individual episode articles. The guideline that we established for season episodes straight from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Lost_Episode_guidelines_a509.html#General_article_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Lost/Episode guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Lost/Episode guidelines#General article guidelines</a> reads as follows:</p>
<p>"In lieu of Episodes of Lost (season X), Lost season X may be created, consisting of a summary of the main themes and developments of the season, for the reader who wants a broad overview before diving into the individual articles. These season wraparound articles should be relatively brief, link to the individual episode articles where appropriate, and should not attempt to summarize individual episodes but rather emphasize broad themes, plot arcs and character developments."</p>
<p>As of now, these pages do not discuss any themes or character developments; they are blatantly plot summaries. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> Point 7 (<i>Plot summaries. Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic.</i>), the current season pages do not pass this policy and should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 06:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: I definitely do <b>NOT</b> want this AfD to be seen as an attempt to overpower the mediation. I am not presenting any arguments whatsoever regarding redundancy with individual episode articles.</dd>
<dd>I am merely acting as a committed member of WikiProject Lost and fully believe that deleting these articles now will overall benefit the quality of our Lost articles and Wikipedia as a whole. I also hope and expect this deletion to be temporary until we as a Project can create meaningful pages discussing thematic and character developments over the seasons. <b>Delete</b>, as nominator. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 07:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and let the WikiProject Lost people decide if they want seasonal summaries in addition to individual show summaries. I find them useful and interesting even though I don't watch the show. Flip a coin as to which format is better, or keep both as a better solution. I don't see it as a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> Point 7, because the individual episode articles are even <i>more</i> detailed plot summaries. See: <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Rabbit_%28Lost%29_8d59.html" title="White Rabbit (Lost)">White Rabbit (Lost)</a> for a single episode summary. This should have been a request for comment, and not a vote for deletion since there is discussion already going on in the WikiProject Lost page as to which format is better. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 08:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC).

<li>I am not against the format of articles about seasons, I am against blatant plot summaries. I posted this last week at the WikiProject talk page, and only two editors have replied.

<li><b>Delete</b> These pages were much better when they contained summaries of the entire season, episode by episode. I lost interest in editing when we went to this format. Cominbg back to this page fresh today I didn't even notice the links to the individual episodes buried on the bottom of the page. Horrible Web usability--doesn't help the reader at all. --<a href="../../../s/i/x/User%7ESixtrojans_c1f3.html" title="User:Sixtrojans">Sixtrojans</a> 04:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think people understand that the only reason these articles still exist was as a compromise to end a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_478f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">previous dispute</a>. They have no actual value and were only used to get people to stop arguing. That debate is long since dead, and we don't need these articles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I was one of the parties in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_mediation_Lost_episodes_7992.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Lost episodes">original mediation</a>, and the creation of these season articles was one of the core reasons that we were even able to navigate through the process. The debate took months, and I am disappointed that Wikipedical (one of the other parties in the mediation) decided to propose these articles for deletion so soon after we had come to our painfully-achieved compromise. I am also disappointed that there was so little attempt to gather further comment (just a brief note on the WikiProject page, in the middle of the holiday season). The articles may need some cleanup, but that's no reason to delete them. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 02:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
