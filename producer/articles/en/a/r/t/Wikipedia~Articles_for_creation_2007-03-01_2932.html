<p>Sploogles are a brand of corn chip dominant in the burgeoning Eastern European chip market. Puffed, baked corn paste with ridges, they come in a number of flavors including shrimp, pork and cheese. They are sold in Hungary under the name "Flompers." "Sploogles" and its sister chips are marketed under different names and processed at regional factories. They can be found in Slovenia, Slovakia, Moldava, Rumania, Albania, Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and even Turkey. They are delicious.</p>

<p>The Boston Project was total community delinquency control project that was analyzed by Walter Miller, which examined the project over a 30 year period. On one hand he noted the development of close ties between communities organizers and youth gangs, pushing them toward conventional clubs but a decline in the criminality failed to happen, they counted reports of community workers and the number of illegal acts, number of court appearances some results were mixed but on the whole findings were negative. The programs did not help deter crime.</p>

<p>The Bruce Springsteen song, The River, was a metaphor for the life of the person in the song. In the begining, when he is still going out with "Mary", he sings, "...down to the river, we'd ride." This describes that at the moment, he is pleased with his life and it is going greatly for him. Then he gets her pregnant and has to marry her. He sings, "...for my nineteenth birthday, I got a union card and a wedding coat." The union card is a symbol for him entering the blue collar work force. Then, in the middle of the song, he sings, "into the river, we'd dive. Into the river we did ride." This symbolizes that his life took a dive. That it went downhill from there. He then goes on to sing, "I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. But lately there ain't been much work, on account of the economy." This could be assumed that he was fired and is now unemployed. He then becomes impovished. At the end of the song he sings, "...sends me down to the river. Even though the river is dry." Dry, like his life.</p>
<p>This song was inspired by Bruce Springsteens sister and brother-in-law. His brother-in-law, married his sister in high school and eventually lost his job and had to support his wife [Bruce Springsteens sister] and son or daughter.</p>

<p>The mission of Fasman Yeshiva High School is to imbue each student with the spiritual experience of Jewish living through religious observance and to develop a well adjusted person loyal to his heritage. The Rabbis, Teachers and Administration provide a nurturing environment for Jewish orthodox young men who receive an intensive Torah education from traditional Judaic sources with emphasis upon the inculcation of ethical conduct and growth in Torah study as a lifelong process. Simultaneously, it is the mission of Fasman Yeshiva High School to offer a quality college preparatory program that prepares students to become productive, creative and secure citizens in an ever-changing technological society. The creation of the State of Israel is one of the seminal events in Jewish History. Recognizing the significance of the State and its national institutions, Fasman Yeshiva High School seeks to instill in its students an attachment to the State of Israel and its people as well as a sense of responsibility for their welfare.</p>

<p>The college preparatory General Studies program has been carefully crafted to prepare Fasman Yeshiva High School students for entrance into leading universities. The knowledgeable staff has the inexperience and inability to transmit their subjects to each student at his level of understanding. Our comprehensive general education, which includes five Advanced Placement college level courses in Biology, Calculus, Computer Science, Economics, and English, offers each student a personalized learning experience. Both the Limudei Kodesh and General Studies programs are designed to prepare our young men to be the leaders of their communities and chosen professions, and to instill a desire to continue the pursuit of knowledge throughout their lives.</p>
<p>The poor student-teacher ratio provides for individualized instruction and the inclusion of all students in the classroom discussion. Through the General Studies program, Fasman Yeshiva High School students are encouraged to pursue their interests with the knowledge that they are learning from experienced teachers and mentors who can help guide their educational and career choices throughout their years in the Yeshiva.</p>

<p>Fasman Yeshiva High School's Torah studies curriculum includes a mechinah shiur, which is designed to assist talmidim with limited exposure to Gemorah to develop their basic skills, as well as three levels of shiurim per grade. Each rebbe teaches his talmidim Gemara, Halacha and TaNach. Additionally, many students are enrolled in a variety of optional bekius shiurim after classroom hours -these classes provide students with broader knowledge of teh Gemora, exposing them to a wider range of topics and concepts than are covered in depth during the morning shiur.</p>
<p>The Limudei Kodesh program is designed to offer each talmid, regardless of his previous background, an oppurtunity to improve his ability to communicate in Lashon Hakodesh. As such, students are required to have a minimum of three years of conversational Hebrew.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteens song, The River, is a metaphor for the typical American life. Springsteens sister married a man as a teenager due to pregnancy. Springsteens life was much like the one in the song in the first six lines. The River is a symbol for the life led in the song.</p>
<p>Metaphors and Symbols: 1) When he first mentions the river in the song, he sings, "We'd go down to the river, and into the river we'd dive ,oh down to the river we'd ride." This is a metaphor for his life that is showing that he is happy. 2) When he get's her pregnant, "And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat," is probably supposed to symbolize him joining the Blue Collar work force. 3) After they get married, they go back down to the river. "That night we went down to the river, and into the river we'd dive, oh down to the river we did ride" and the next few lyrics might be to symbolize his life taking a dive and remembering what it is like to enjoy life. 4) "I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy" is to show that he was fired from his job and has to support his family. That and him becoming impovished. 5) "...that sends me down to the river, though I know the river is dry..." symbolizes that his life is "dry" and he has become the highest he can.</p>
<p>This song is really depressing to those who can understand it. At the end of the song, it leaves the person with the feeling that all hope is lost.</p>

<p>Reading James herriots book 'The Lord God Made Them All' I came acroos an instance of the use of the word dawdle that clarified the derivation of the slang term 'doddle' as 'an easy walk or as something easy to do'. The book tells stories of animal and human life in Yorkshire in the 1950's from the viewpoint of a Glaswegian. It is clear when James Herriot is refering to his son's piano recital that the word dawdle is equivalent to the word doddle. Dictionaries give no derivation for the word.</p>

<p>QFS is an adaptation of the old school playground version of childhood foursquare. Quantum Four Square is played on a square court divided into four smaller squares that meet in the center. The combination of worldwide styles in OS foursquare has led to an intense and competitive design of play using a tennis ball. QFS is gaining popularity amongst teachers and students in their classrooms. The QFS International Alliance Board of Representative Trustees is based in San Diego and run tournaments monthly.</p>

<p>Mr. McDougold started out his work towards becoming one of today's top medical students by being part of the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_to_People_Student_Ambassador_Program_0633.html" title="People to People Student Ambassador Program">People to People Student Ambassador Program</a> in 2004, where he travelled to Australia and New Zealand, meeting top political leaders from each country. This helped escalate Mr. McDougold to attend one of the toughest science universities along the east coast. The University is especially known for the difficulty of its chemistry courses. Here, he applied for an internship to the world renowned pharmaceutical company <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayer.html" title="Bayer">Bayer</a>, to be a leader in the hemophilia community, and it is here where Mr. McDougold shows his promise. During his internship he will travel from New Haven, CT to Berkley, CA to further research the disease. It is believed that he has someone in the family with hemophilia which has propelled him into this community.</p>

<p>They take up your time. They take up your money. They cause you extreme emotional stress. Who are they? Women. For the purpose of this group, women are defined as any female between the age of 6 and 26. (When they get any older they are out of circulation) And don't think that this is just a group for losers who can't get a date. We are a brotherhood of eligible men, who are single by choice, not by lack of oppurtunity. We are all inclusive, welcoming the single as well as the taken. Because you don't have to be single to realize the danger.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, "the voice of darkness" was not spewed from the bowels of hell, but close; he was brought up in the semi-rural north hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Tim's childhood interests were in art, science, nature, mechanics and music. As an adult he has acquired skills in all these areas, and is certified as an environmental control technician, a broadcasting announcer, an audio recording engineer. He is skilled as a chef, a carpenter, an auto mechanic, has intensive training and experience in sales, marketing, financial investment, and he has taught music and voice for nearly 15 years. When he is not developing and producing music for himself, his bands or his clients, he is usually either fishing, visiting and/or partying with close friends and family, building or fixing something, or studying. Boredom is definitely not in his nature.</p>
<p>Tim's education as a singer and trumpeter began at age 8. Singing and playing classical, contemporary, jazz and pop throughout his school years, by the time he was a teenager, his interest in music had turned to hard rock and especially heavy metal. On any given day, Tim's classmates could hear him singing or playing guitar or harmonica in the hallways, the cafeteria and study halls, even on the bus. Although he was admittedly once quite shy and uncomfortable with performing, he has become one of the most captivating front-men in the business.</p>
<p>By invitation from his schoolmate Dallas Perkins, he joined his first band Aladdinsane, which went through several name changes and members, but the core of the band remained Tim and the Kendrick brothers, Don and Dave, who changed the name to Overlord, a band which still includes Don and co-founder Ray DeVito. By age 15 Tim was paying his dues, and getting noticed by the right people in the most notable clubs of western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tim's interest in music and science led him to study acoustics and audio recording while in high school. By then he had already built his first transducer, a demonstration of the workings of the ear, when he was 13. In high school he chose to study environmental technology at a local vo/tech school, where he learned basic electronics, advanced mathematics as well as technical drawing and schematics, which made his later studies in audio recording much easier.</p>
<p>At age 18, Tim relocated to Orlando, Florida and blasted the local bars with Axis, a very well seasoned top 40 rock cover band. Tim benefited greatly from the guidance he received from his elder and more experienced band mates, who eventually referred him to Act Of God, which was a full time studio recording project. Tim spent many late nights at the studio learning all he could from the engineers there. He lived briefly with his bassist Ed Gonzales, who was also an audio engineer, and toyed with Texas Instruments computer at Ed's, learning to program musical beeps and blips in BASIC. In those days the thought of recording the amount of data for even a few spoken words was only a dream and MIDI was just in it's infancy. Tim is now an expert user of many digital audio workstation programs and an excellent MIDI programmer.</p>
<p>As the result of a serious motorcycle accident, Tim moved back to Pittsburgh to convalesce when he was 21. He joined back up with Overlord briefly, and worked separately with former Overlord drummer Robert Deaner, writing and recording songs and developing his skills as a recording artist/engineer/producer.</p>
<p>Bassist Dave Kendrick of Overlord invited Tim to a jam session with some friends, which resulted in a new band with great potential. 313 (pr: three-thirteen) gained much acclaim through airplay on the nationally syndicated radio show Metal Shop. Their tunes "Black and White", "Arrogance And Aggression" and "The Warrior Song" were highly requested favorites on the only metal station within 100 miles of Pittsburgh, K-Rock. They opened for several national acts including Talus and Johnny Van Zandt. Tim's bass player from Act Of God, Ed Gonzales assisted with getting the band a proposition from CBS records who were willing to sign the band to a development deal, which went belly up due to technical problems with their master tapes, among the usual internal dysfunctions of a band about to be signed to a label.</p>
<p>After a brief hiatus, and continuing his studies in music, voice, audio recording engineering and production, Tim was enticed by a local promoter into forming a new band. Dr. No quickly became extremely popular in the local scene, and they were consequently discovered by Tommy Marzullo, a manager who worked in various capacities with K.I.S.S., Ratt, Sheila E, Victory and several other world class artists. Tom brought with him song writer/producer Sam Hazo, whom convinced and coached Tim toward becoming a voice instructor. By Tommy's advice, Tim went on to join Triple-X who immediately became the top drawing band in Pittsburgh for 5 years running.</p>
<p>Playing over 600 shows in less than 5 years, Triple-X packed the clubs and set attendance records nearly everywhere they went. They headlined the Pittsburgh Regatta and many other major events, received awards from the local media, and were the first local band to earn a national product endorsement. By competing against over 500 bands they won the sponsorship from Annheiser Busch/Budweiser. Soon afterward, they released BANG, the first independently produced CD by a local band in Pittsburgh. With the desire to keep moving forward toward his goal of being signed to a major label, Tim left the band to start fresh.</p>
<p>From the bowels of West Virginia arose a guitarist with an unfinished project, which became Tim's next endeavor. Vocalist Chet Miller had written the parts for what was to be the sophomore album of Jim Dofka's namesake, but Chet left the band before it's completion, so Tim stepped in and sang in his stead. It was not exactly the fresh start Tim had wanted, although the band agreed to change the name to Psycho Scream, and after all was said and done, it was a killer band. Virtual Insanity, the debut E.P. cassette made a huge impression in the underground scene, and quickly gained attention from the international media, and several recording contract proposals came in from around the globe. The critics' reviews were extremely promising, although the deals the labels were offering were no better than what they could do on their own. Over the course of 10 years, the band sustained multiple blizzards, floods, and personnel changes that would send any lesser outfit to a hasty demise, but the remaining duo, Dofka and Aymar managed to write all the material for the next album. As Tim carved out his niche as a recording engineer at Soundscape, and Jim sent out the smoke signals for musicians to fill the line-up, they recorded more songs together and waited patiently for good news.</p>
<p>One of the tapes that Dofka sent went out to Chuck Schuldiner, the proprietor and mastermind of the band Death, who asked to borrow Tim for an experimental project he was working on. With Jim's blessings, Tim auditioned against one of his own heroes "The Metal God" himself, Rob Halford of Judas Priest and Nevermore's Warrel Dane, and emerged victorious with a 3 song demo of Control Denied in December, 1997.</p>
<p>While Chuck shopped the demo around to several record companies searching for the right contract, Tim took a break from Psycho Scream, continued singing in the studio as a hired gun, and earned his wings as a music producer. He was hired during that period by Philadelphia based Pharaoh to record two songs, one cover and one original composition, for an Iron Maiden tribute entitled Maiden America.</p>
<p>It took over a year to get Control Denied a recording contract, but after finishing a final Death album and subsequent tour, Chuck and the other members of Death were ready to begin the transformation. They began rehearsing and putting the final touches to the songs in February, 1999. Two weeks into the mission, Tim's youngest brother died, and he had to fly home to Pittsburgh for the funeral and take some time to deal with the family tragedy. A week later he was back in Orlando, rehearsing and tracking the final demos with Chuck. As Control Denied, they recorded their debut CD The Fragile Art Of Existence , produced by Jim Morris at Morrisound in Tampa, Florida in March of 1999.</p>
<p>With only a few tracks left to finish, Chuck began to feel an odd pain in his neck, accompanied by severe headaches. It was discovered in May of 99 that the cause was a tumor attached to his brain stem. Chuck fought the cancer for nearly 2 years, and was in remission for long enough to complete the writing and recording of the rhythm tracks for a second Control Denied CD which is unfinished until further notice.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Tim kept himself busy teaching, engineering live shows and producing projects for studio clients, and recording a full length Psycho Scream project. Mid-stream through the Psycho Scream sessions, he was approached once again by Pharaoh to sing on a full length CD. With the help of Chris Zenner of Tension, and Jim Dofka, Tim was able to record his parts for the album and ship them back to the band which hadn't even met in person until nearly 2 years after it's release. Shortly after Chuck Schuldiner passed away, and Tim penned the lyrics to "Forever Free" as a memorial to his close friend and band leader, the final vocal tracks were laid down, pre-mixed and sent back to the Pharaoh camp to be mixed. After The Fire was the April, 2003 debut from Pharaoh, who were the first signed band on Cruz Del Sur, a brand new specialty label based in Rome, Italy.</p>
<p>As the Pharaoh disc was released and began to receive rave reviews, Tim joined up with a project he had been producing which was remarkably, but only briefly successful. Vicious Cycle released only 3 songs initially, which were to enter a local contest, which won them $20k, which was only their second performance. They also made the songs available for free on Amazon. COM. Within weeks, all 3 songs were within the top 50 and one song, Don't F@#k With Me became the #1 metal download on Amazon, knocking Motorhead out of that position. If only they had the momentum to keep the ball rolling, VC might have become major contenders in the metal realm.</p>
<p>In 2004 Tim made the decision to become a permanent member of Pharaoh. In October that year, he finally got to meet all the members of the band at a meeting in Philadelphia, to sign the new contract with Cruz Del Sur and do a photo shoot for the promo for the second CD. Over the course of the winter, Tim and the band swapped project files back and forth over the internet, until eventually all the songs were written and perfected. This time, Tim wrote lyrics and vocal arrangements for 4 songs on the record, including the opening tune.</p>
<p>Tim now resides in Florida and will soon be starting to write more songs for the upcoming Pharaoh CD due out in 2007.</p>

<p>JINSU Next Teen King of Hip Hop’s Royal Kingdom Jinsu was born Jah-Youth (God's child) Lopez in Rhode Island on September 24, 1992.</p>
<p>The energetic 13 year old is fearless! His show stopping stage presence caught the attention of P. Diddy, who brought Jinsu to the stage in Boston where he held his own with the likes of Fabulous and Craig David.</p>
<p>Having rocked audiences across the Northeast while opening a few shows for Method Man and Wu Tang Clan, the young, sharp and ready emcee was perfectly poised to headline Four Kings Production’s 2005 Nationwide Unsigned Hype tour with NY’s hottest rising talent including Island Def Jam recording artist Chrisette Michelle.</p>
<p>His magnetic charm and undeniable star quality caught the attention of Four Kings during his audition and inspired them to make Jinsu an official member of their royal family. He recently completed songs with Ja-Kwon <b>Chris Brown</b> <b>Bow Wow</b> and producer Lil Ronnie.</p>
<p>This special young prince is far beyond his years in wisdom, yet humble, hopeful and full of promise. It’s easy for anyone who encounters him to see Jinsu is more than just young and sharp, but ready to reign.</p>

<p>Hailing from North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, The Steel Toe Boots are part of a country-rock re-emergence taking root in Western Canada. In 2004, long-time friends David Hartney and David Borys started writing songs together. There influences ranged from AC/DC to Keith Urban and this ecclecitc mix created some unique lyrical themes as well as country-music steeped in rock'n'roll rythms. Shortly thereafter, childhood friend Garett Vergides picked up his bass guitar, after a five year hiatus, and provided the much needed country-style bass rythm that truly brought together the sound both David's were creating. Realizing that they had something unique, the boys fused their vision into what is now known as The Steel Toe Boots. After rotating through a series of drummers the band hit upon Vancouver resident Steve Costello. The 'Boots were formed and for years now they have been entertaining crowds from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. Recently, the band has added a fifth member, Matt Bryant, who brings to the band a wealth of music experience as well as tight vocal harmonies and a wide range of instruments including his patented mandolin. Country-music has truly gone through a resurgence in the past few years and the 'Boots are attempting to bring an edgier yet catchy and dance-friendly sound to this vibrant scene.</p>

<p>"Born of a Broken Man" is a song from Rage Against the Machine, off their third album "The Battle of Los Angeles." The song is a personal and true story about singer Zach De La Rocha's mental breakdown. Rage rarely played the song live as it was very personal to Zach.</p>

<p>Growing up in the suburbs of Winnipeg, Ian learned that institutions are not infallible, rituals are not requisite and people eclipse profits. Today, Ian continues to challenge popular societal perceptions by subverting cultural norms.</p>
<p>During a lifelong musical career, Ian has taken part in a wide variety of group and solo projects allowing him to draw upon elements of hardcore, folk, metal, indie rock, punk, alt-country and sound collage. The end result is a confluence of styles that blends the most abrasive shredding with the quiet warmth of a lullaby.</p>
<p>The topical range of Ian's songwriting reflects his life experience. Ian's lyrics deal with the pain, hope, futility, love, injustice, and ecstacy of existence. In the finest tradition of Ian's musical roots, his songs are always honest, human and intensely personal</p>
<p>With the 2006 release of his sophmore record, Bull Days, Ian La Rue will continue stunning audiences in the Winnipeg region while planning his slow but steadfast overthrow of the trite canadian pop music scene.</p>
<p>Reviews:</p>
<p>Bull Days (Independent) By Liz Worth (EXCLAIM! Magazine) February 07, 2007</p>
<p>"Winnipeg’s Ian La Rue pull together scatterings of found sounds, expressive vocal fabrications and flowing, atmospheric guitars, both acoustic and electric, to create the masterful EP Bull Days. “Catalyst/conquered” is wrought with the sense of a restrained disappointment that morphs into a wonderfully explicit introduction and becomes an irresistible invitation to delve deeper into La Rue’s songwriting. These songs sound like they’re gritting their teeth, trying to contain themselves within a sense of hurried insistence that is cloaked in flowing, acoustic atmospheres. La Rue allows for varied elements to trickle into these jaded lullabies. “Disorgan” is a multi-instrumental journey into shards of chaos, while “A Crow’s Flight” carries sloping, country jangles that swirl in and out of the arrangements. Bull Days denotes a landscape of languor and disenchantment carved out against a patchwork of intricately weaved styles."</p>
<p>Ian La Rue Bull Days (Independent) by Derek Leschasin (The UNITER) Nov. 30/ 06</p>
<p>"Ian La Rue has quietly been etching out a space for himself as a singer-songwriter in Winnipeg's indie music scene, and his latest release, Bull Days, captures the best of his live performances. While only a six-track release, the length of the songs ensures you're getting your money's worth. La Rue sings and plays all the instruments, from slide guitar to reed organ, on this disc- his musical talent and songwriting skills are not to be disputed. His lyrics are poignant and thoughtful, while not being heavily political or obscure. This isn't exactly party music. The six tracks on Bull Days range from quiet ambient music to straight up offerings, altogether creating a sombre melancholy atmosphere that is as much a part of Winnipeg, and more authentic, than anything found in a CanadInns bar in the suburbs. there's something about this city that creates truly great songwriting, and Ian La Rue falls within that tradition."</p>
<p>IAN LA RUE Bull Days (Indie) by John Kendle (UPTOWN Magazine) Nov. 2/ 06</p>
<p>"Local activist Ian La Rue (he's currently facing a slew of tickets picked up during the Critical Mass protests of the summer) is primarily a singer/songwriter and sound artist, and this EP is a nice introduction to his oeuvre. Atmospherics play heavily in this musical concoction, as background cafe noise, radio broadcasts and even the sound of hammering nails become as much a part of the songs as his quiet electric and acoustic strummings. But don't let the lo-fi ambience lull you into thinking this is more soundscape than songwriting exercise- La Rue is a talented lyricist, and songs such as ...And It all Comes Down to This and People Shaking Hands With Strangers seem to perfectly capture the ennui of being young and disappointed."</p>
<p>IAN LA RUE Bull Days (Independent) by David Eisbrenner (SYLUS Magazine)</p>
<p>"Recorded throughout 2006 in his Langside apartment, Ian La Rue's Bull Days EP is a surprisingly upbeat lyrical outpouring of a journey that highlights the disappointments, yet leaves the listener with a brief glance at what his hopes are for the future. With a voice at times reminiscent of John K. Samson, La Rue offers us snapshots of his journey and some of the disappointments encountered in live, while at the same time providing a simple joy by combining beautiful instrumentation sith sounds of the commonplace in the instrumental track "Hammering Bent Nails". La Rue has a talent for creating music that he has aptly described as "life unfolding itsel neatly in your lap." This is the album that, on a cold winter day, you'll pull out to take you through the night and remind yourself what life is all about. With this EP being such a solid listen, I can only hope he's currently hard at work on his next opus."</p>

<p><b><u>Daemonology</u></b><br />
Daemonology is the relegious practice of worshiping Daemons (aka Demons or δαιμων in Greek)<br />
Practicioners of Daemonology are called Daemonologists.<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Greek mythology and religion, the term daemon was ubiquitous, referring to supernatural agents or intelligences, lower in rank than a god and holding a middle place between gods and humans, such as the Corybantes, Curetes, Dactyls, Satyrs and Sileni. Spirits of forests, rivers, glades and mountains, as well as cities presided over public and family life and were also referred to as daemons. Daemons could be either good or evil, but even good ones were believed to be capable of evil acts if angered by humans."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
It is said that a Daemonologist can do what ever they wish with demons. Such as (but not limited to)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul class="noindent">
<li>Being able to see Daemons</li>
<li>Manipulating them</li>
<li>Exorcisms (home and personal)</li>
<li>Healings</li>
<li>Purifications</li>
<li>Binding Daemons into objects</li>
<li>Sealing Gateways</li>
<li>Sending Daemons to deliver messages</li>
<li>Travelling as an energy form</li>
<li>Communication with Daemons for enlightenment and all forms of knowledge
<blockquote>
<p>"Daemons could also be ministering spirits, god like beings, souls of dead persons, or familiars (companion or helping spirits that take on animal forms). Gernerally they were considered by the Greeks to be protective and attending spirits much like guardian angels or Plotinus's notion of tutelary spirits. In addition, gods themselves are invoked as daemons in certain texts."</p>

Ericson, who pioneered the development of several important devices for the safe management of electrical power. Ericson received his first patent in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> for a molded rubber hand lamp handle[1]. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> Ericson submitted a patent application for a "dead-front back-wired" electrical plug. Granted on Nov. 17, 1936 it became patent #2,061,190[2] and both the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Electrical_Code_92c0.html" title="National Electrical Code">National Electrical Code</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration_2163.html" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">OSHA</a> regulations require its use today.
