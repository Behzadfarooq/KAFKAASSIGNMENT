<p>All this is, is a list of random unassociated weapons in computer games which have been named Masamune.

It was previously split from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masamune.html" title="Masamune">Masamune</a> for being too long, but this was incorrect, it should have been cut down, which it now has. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't dispute that the papers are accurate, but the coverage is more along the lines of "a local teenager has released a popular software package" (and that's based merely on self-reported download statistics) rather than a non-trivial account of his company and its impact itself. If this company were notable, we would see more in-depth coverage outside of the local papers. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 16:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Of course I agree with you. I am pointing out the flawed nature of the original keep vote, which is just a variation on "it exists, keep it." This does not advance an argument for notability.

<li>Yes, I have voted keep becausse I believe he is worthy of note, and if he doesnt meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, we should be looking at why; I suggest that the reason is due to locality, and the fact the modern press (online news and blogs) dont care about people of this ilk. To make sure there is no doubt, I have no association with this man, the UMC, any other religious body or the Philippines. I am merely concerned that a major Bishop of a notable Church is being considered for deletion when a stub for a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholic_Bishops_of_Chicago_118d.html" title="List of Roman Catholic Bishops of Chicago">Bishop of Chicago</a> would not be. In my opinion, the post and the mans actions should be considered synonymous (unless their term is cut short due to controversy); he is elected to those positions by his peers and parishioners, because of his actions. The problem in this case appears to be that the actions that put him there dont appear to be readily accessible outside of the UMC publications (some of them are not directly affiliated). So do we assume that he did nothing?? Or do we <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and leave it to be expanded over time. His <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Bishop_c4dd.html" title="Resident Bishop">Resident Bishophood</a> puts him as one of three most senior in his Church in his country and his other positions appear to put him amounst the upper management of the international UMC.

<li>I think it's easier to justify he would qualify as notable on the Filipino or Tagalog wikipedias.

<p>An article with only primary source references does not imply any intentional desire to create an un-encyclopedic entry or that the sources are inaccurate. It does say the encyclopedic content of the article would be greatly improved by the addition of reference.</p>
<p>The three core content policies of Wikipedia are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, In general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a> are created at or near the time being studied, often by the people being studied, and so provide a good foundation for beginning to building an article. But primary sources are by definition often <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">orginal research</a> and due to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> concerns may not be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>.</p>
<p>The addition of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">Secondary sources</a> which are usually based on primary sources and other secondary sources by a third party who is not connected to the source, provides for a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and being based on the combined research of others would not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">orginal research</a>. Here you see that the addition of secondary sources assists the editor to write (and readers to verify) an article that meets all three core content policies of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Additionally, an article must meet a minimum threshold of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> in order for it to remain on Wikipedia. One of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Rationale</a> for requiring a level of notability is that a in order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. Everyday Multiple articles are proposed and considered for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_Today_0ca9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/Today">deletion</a> per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> an article that is not clearly notable is not likely to survive the deletion process. Keeping in mind that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">the burden of evidence</a> lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">Jeepday</a> 20:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While non-christians might not get it, bishops are usually notable as politicians are. The article itself has numerous assertions of notability, so that is not really the issue. As for verifiability, well the internet is western-centric when it comes to news, so just because he doesn't have that many "Google hits" mean he isn't in the news. What needs to be done is to find more appropriate references using local newspapers/tv news/etc. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 14:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

As it is, it's a somewhat passive article. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 14:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The character has a significant role in the TOS episode "Space Seed," which was the foundation for TWOK.<br /></li>
<li>Many film scholars have stated that TWOK is an allegory for Moby Dick, with Khan being Ahab. This being the case, Joachim is very much Khan's Starbuck; loyal, but questioning Khan's actins and motives. He is more than a mere "button-pusher." He is Khan's right-hand man.<br /></li>
<li>In non-canon Star Trek books, Joachim is a major character, especially in the Eugenics Wars and books about life on Ceti Alpha V. Yes, it's non-canon but many readers of these Star Trek books would come to this Wikipedia page to read a biography of the character.<br /></li>
<li>The point was made that if Michael Eddington doesn't have his own page, Joachim shouldn't either. Well, I think Eddington should have his own page! He deserves it just as much as Joachim.<br /></li>
<li>The rumors that Joachim plays a major role in Star Trek XI. As time goes on, people will want to know who this guy is and this article will help refresh their memories.<br />

<li>I have an easy answer for the question you pose (why aren't the books that he's in cited in the article?). It is because I wrote the bulk of this article Thursday 2/1 and it was marked for deletion not even a day later. I knew it wasn't perfect and had a lot of work to be done, but I decided to put it up in an imperfect state and let the Wikipedia community help the article evolve and grow. It never had a chance to do that. There's volumes written about this guy but I don't see anyone spending effort and time fixing this article when it looks like it's just going to be deleted, just days after it was put up. I'm not taking it personally at all that this was tagged, but I do think it goes against the Wikipedia sense of community to afd something before other people have a chance to let the article evolve. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenaciousT_5d53.html" title="User:TenaciousT">TenaciousT</a> 19:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I frequent Memory Alpha for my Star Trek fix, but I just watched The Space Seed and The Wrath of Khan so I thought I'd pipe in. The character is very notable when you take it in the context of the movie AND the TV show. If one watches the Extended Director's Cut of TWOK along with the audio commentary and bonus features, you see the intent of the creators' to make a strong Joachim character. (The actor is uncredited because his agent screwed-up. He was supposed to have top billing!) This article can be cited, verified and cleaned up, but it will take time. To paraphrase Khan, time is a luxury this article doesn't have. Having said that, I think it's a shame this article was AfD'd the same day it was created. I agree with the author, TenaciousT, that it never had a chance for peer review. Some of Wikipedia's best articles started out as uncited, unverified, POV crap but through a long process, they get better. I say we give this article a chance, or move it to Memory Alpha.

Whether the character is to appear in an impending Trek film is, at this time, what I like to refer to as <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystalballery</a>, and from what I can tell, whether some of the stories he is in really are canon is highly debateable. Above, it's noted that, outside of canon, he really <i>is</i> notable - but here in WP, that straddles the line on <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.html" title="Fanfiction">fanfiction</a>, if not actually crossing the line. See the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> link on why fanfic is specifically excluded. The agent's mistake for the billing is debateable, but I am making my decision and excluding that - because I don't have the DVD on hand. Here's the clincher that will change my mind: if there is clear cut evidence that he will, indeed, be a notable part of any upcoming movie, and that movie has crossed the line out of being crystalballery, then he gets an article. Until then, my stance is that he should be listed in an article that catalogs secondary (and maybe tertiary) Trek characters. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Michael Okuda in the text commentary on the DVD version of TWOK Extended Director's Cut specifically states that the Space Seed character and the movie character are the same person and the misspelling is a production error. In the movie, Khan also says <i>These people have sworn to live and die at my command two-hundred years before you were born</i> implying that his henchmen were with him on Earth in the 1990's. The timeline is also established in the movie that the crew of the Botany Bay were stranded on Ceti Alpha V for 15 years, making Joachim an offspring of the crew very unlikely.<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenaciousT_5d53.html" title="User:TenaciousT">TenaciousT</a> 17:35, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Cox's books apparently suck (tons of bad reviews on Amazon.com, and no, suckiness does not affect notability!). The article <i>can definately</i> mention that Cox makes Joachim Khan's dad if we can reference that (I don't have the novel). The fact that this character was given a different relationship to Khan in some non-canon sources seems like the sort of thing the article would be useful for explaining. I am cutting the summary waaaaaay back as it currently obscures Joachim's major part in the plot of Star Trek II, i.e. Joachim's refusal to cooperate with Khan's megalomania results in Kirk's victory. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 17:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As Khan's "Spock", Joachim's character seem to have several functions. He shows the loyalty of Khan's followers but also demonstrates that this loyalty is a sensible one and doesn't extend to blind obedience. Joachim's ability to pilot the Reliant with no training enables them to escape exile. Joachim's later refusal to pilot the Reliant leads to Kirks victory. He's not so minor a character that he's not Wik-worthy. I've chopped down the article into about 1/3rd of its original length by removing unneeded summary. What's left is still an awful lot to merge. I know this guy is notable enough because my bf isn't a huge Trek fan but when I asked him if he knew who Joachim is in Star Trek he said "is that Khan's henchdude?"

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm probably biased, as a viewer of <i>The Phoenix</i> (apparently one of very few), but I think some deleters have oversold how "extremely minor" Joachim is. He is, as Shaunda has said, "Khan's Spock," with lines and screentime. Everyone who saw the movie remembers his death scene - even some of the people commenting on how NN he is have quoted from it! I also agree that the excessive rambling of the original article about the overall plot rather than Joachim's specific role, had the ironic effect of diluting his claim to notability by making him seem like a bystander carried along by general events. The reworked article is much better, and allows me to upgrade from the weak keep I originally planned to cast. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 04:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The comment immediately above this mirrors my own thoughts. Many of the Delete opinions were given when the article was in poor shape. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> gives an example of a "minor—but still notable—character in Star Trek...who has sufficient depth to sustain an independent article." This falls in exactly the same category and few with knowledge of the corpus of the Star Trek universe would make a contrary appraisal. Many of the early arguements against the article (crystal ballism, just a summary, etc.) no longer apply. As the good parts of this article have been very much expanded and the overly-long summary is reduced into an excellent new form, perhaps it is appropriate to give this a fresh debate? --<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 04:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> although I'll stick with my weak delete for now, I think the only barrier to keeping the article is the lack of information from the novels. If that part can be expanded to show him playing a major role, then it should survive. This article therefore needs <b>more time</b>.

<li>Eston, my curiosity in your recent activities has brought me to this article that you have marked for deletion. I must say, I’m not surprised that you’ve managed to bring your elitist tendencies to web 2.0. Like the way you instruct your students, if they don’t fit your mold you toss them away with the trash. Even a well written article like this one isn’t worthy in your book. What will it take for you to learn that by telling people that their work isn’t worth publication you’re pushing potential Wikipedians to the fringes. Your personal page marks how many times you’ve been vandalized, I wish there was a way to track how many people you’ve single handedly turned into vandals. This is a <b>Strong Keep</b> and I urge my fellow alumni to vote the same. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.PiKA4EvA 23:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Re: off-screen</b>- I have added specifics about Joachim's appearance in the novels and went into more detail about how he was represented in 2 different Star Trek games. The novels and the games now have their own headings at the end where they seem to belong.

<li>Its other name is "stick grenade", as documented on pages 402–403 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0807120111</a>, which documents 7 different types of this grenade. Further information can be found on page 56 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1855322889</a>, and page 115 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1574887602</a>, where it is documented that Allied troops nicknamed one of these types the "potato masher". Fixing this article involves nothing more than editors using sources, such as the aforementioned books, to correct the article, and renaming it to a better title. None of that involves an administrator hitting a delete button, and can be done by ordinary editors using ordinary editing tools. I strongly urge editors to <i>do the research</i> before nominating articles for deletion, and before contributing to AFD discussions. It took me 1 minute to put "Stielhandgranate" into Google Books. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:14, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> this article is about some childrens game with popsicle sticks, not the hand grenades! (have you even read the article?) That's why I'm nominating it for deletion. If it was clearly about stick grenades I'd have just redirected. If it is some notable toy, the article should be renamed to a better title and rewritten with some sources. If not, we could just redirect it to stick grenade and forget about it. — <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKieff_55f7.html" title="User:Kieff">Kieff</a> | <a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKieff_8631.html" title="User talk:Kieff">Talk</a> 15:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course I've read the article! How do you think I knew to search for "Stielhandgranate"? The article tells us in its second sentence that it is about the hand grenades.
<p>Now consider what you've just written. The two ways to solve the problem with this article that you yourself have come up with are either (a) to edit it into a redirect or (b) to rename and to edit it using sources. Neither of those courses of action involve an administrator hitting a delete button, and both can be done by ordinary editors using the ordinary editing tools that they have at their disposal. <b>Don't nominate things for deletion where you don't actually want an administrator to hit a delete button.</b> That is not what Articles <i>for deletion</i> is for. If you are unsure about sources, {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} is the correct tag (and looking for sources yourself is <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">the correct action</a>). Excising any unverifiable material and leaving the rest, if you were (say) to find that there are no sources about the art works, is also an ordinary editorial action that doesn't involve AFD. If you want a rewrite, {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-rewrite_97ec.html" title="Template:Cleanup-rewrite">cleanup-rewrite</a>}} is the correct tag. If you want to open discussion of a merger, as editors are <i>already</i> discussing with the several <i>other</i> articles that deal with stick grenades, then {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} was the correct tag, and joining in the existing discussions the correct action. If you want to open a discussion of what name the article should properly have, its talk page is the place. {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd1_cc96.html" title="Template:Afd1">afd1</a>}} was not the correct tag for any of the actions to fix the article that you envision being taken. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs a lot of work, yes, but I brought it up to the standards of WP:SOFTWARE a while before this AfD was even processed. It's verifiable and notable by any standard you'd care to put it to. While some might be tempted to make the argument that the game wouldn't recieve as much coverage without the Jackass brand name on the cover, the fact of the matter is that due to this brand recognition the game is going to recieve a fair amount of attention almost by default. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 16:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No valid sources, subject is not notable, article has not been improved since the last AfD, the primary editor appears to have left Wikipedia. This device falls into the same category as perpetual motion devices, except less likely to work, and without the same knowledge of scientific principles as those employ. Also, there have been famous attempts at creating perpetual motion devices. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrous_1c91.html" title="User:Tenebrous">Tenebrous</a> 01:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether a device is likely to work has no bearing on the "delete-ability" of its article (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>, anyone?). The key questions are: does the article <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite sources</a>; is it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>? (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> can be introduced via cleanup once citations and verifiability are given.) I see a link to the relevant patent which means someone did patent such a device. "LIFE Magazine, Sept 14, 1962" is also cited as a source so the existance of this device (working or not) can be verified from reliable independent sources. I can't see the relevance of the 1991 research paper section to the rest of the article, but it too is backed up by a reference to <i>Science</i> magazine. Hence <b>keep</b> because the article has at least two sources cited. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 01:41, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Magazine articles aren't generally reliable sources. The Science article has nothing to do with the device, it's only a stab at proving that the principles behind it are sound. That someone has patented something is in itself meaningless. People have patented lossless compression algorithms that compress all data to a given size, but it doesn't mean those exist either. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrous_1c91.html" title="User:Tenebrous">Tenebrous</a> 01:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Further, the device also fails under notability. The creator of the device is notorious as a crank, but more notoriously crank-y for other things, and he does not have an article on Wikipedia either. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrous_1c91.html" title="User:Tenebrous">Tenebrous</a> 02:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>The</i> Science <i>article has nothing to do with the device...</i>" - I acknowledged that in my previous comment, when I said, "I can't see the relevance of the 1991 research paper section to the rest of the article". In other words, the section based on that report doesn't fit in with the description preceding it.</dd>
<dd>"<i>Further, the device also fails under notability...</i>" - repeating the same unsubstantiated claim multiple times will not get you anywhere. Besides the prior mention in LIFE magazine which you seem so eager to dismiss, there's <a href="http://www.cridder.com/morgue/press/news/neurophone.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cridder.com/morgue/press/news/neurophone.html" rel="nofollow">this 1996 article</a> in <i>The Anchorage Press</i>, written by its editor-in-chief. It describes the device as not having been tested by conventional science. We have here at least two non-biased, mainstream sources which mention the neurophone in detail. There are lots of patents for weird things that aren't operable or implementable, sure, but I'm also sure that not many of these failures get as much mention as a magazine write-up and a dedicated newspaper article. Those that do would be notable, no?</dd>
<dd>All in all your reply serves to confuse your reason for nomination even further. If the device is really non-notable, why do you add that "its creator is notorious as a crank"? If someone is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/notorious" class="extiw" title="wikt:notorious">notorious</a>, it implies they are <i>notable</i>, not that they aren't (see the Wiktionary definition if you're unsure). By the way, it's not true that <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flanagan_5f69.html" title="Patrick Flanagan">the device's inventor</a> has no article. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 06:12, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am disappointed to see that Mr. Flanagan has an article on wikipedia, but clearly I was mistaken there. I still do not accept either of those sources as being good enough to base an article on; The Anchorage Press is unheard-of even in Alaska and does not carry a reputation for good journalism. I see that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> has been lengthened since last I read it, but I still see no reason why minor articles in either of these publications should be treated as works upholding the scholarly standards of what purports to be an encyclopedia. Is it really so confusing to you that the person responsible for creating this can be more well known than the device itself? And I would not consider him notable in a wider sense, either; perhaps a tiny fraction of the United States population has heard of him, and very few others in the world. Further, I see that this device is mentioned in Mr. Flanagan's biography, and given there a few sensibly short lines. Given that the information in this article is duplicated elsewhere, save what is wholly speculative, why do you feel that this article must be retained? Especially when the only other article that references it is---guess what?---<a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flanagan_5f69.html" title="Patrick Flanagan">Patrick Flanagan</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrous_1c91.html" title="User:Tenebrous">Tenebrous</a> 13:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>I still don't see why</i> minor articles <i>in either of these publications...</i>" - can you tell us where the division of minor/non-minor articles comes from?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think a good Wikipedia article on a pseudoscientific concept is important. If Wikipedia doesn't have an article then the only sources are all the web sites touting it as a device that others are trying to repress. It seems to have enough references, and saying that LIFE magazine is not reliable is disingenuous. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion.html" title="Perpetual motion">Perpetual motion</a> has an article. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 02:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or , just possibly, merge into the article for the inventor--That article is so full of unsourced statements and wild claims that this material will actually move it a small distance in the general direction of verifiability. What evidence is there for the notability of the invention--not the boy who invented it, but the invention itself?. Most patents are for devices never actually realized, and do not show notability by themselves. There is zero evidence that any products were actually produced--the Life photograph shows him holding what might be a model, but does not say what it is. If something never existed, the claim can be notable either as an idea or a hoax or a presumed fraud, but the object cannot be N as there is no object. WP is not a crystal ball.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <i>Science</i> paper though cited is totally irrelevant, as it was not about the device, and even the article here makes no such claim. The website phisciences is a personal website. The website neurophone.com is a non-independent website. Worldtrans is the very model of an unreliable site, including dreams as well as ideas, to quote themselves. The Life reporter should have been ashamed of himself, but that does count as a source that is often reliable; however, what was notable to him was the youth of the inventor, not the object. Ditto for the older of the newspaper stories. Calling this nonsense RS would show technicality trumping common sense. To meet the technicalities, I assert that local newspaper stories on scientific topics except by well-regarded science correspondents are inherently unreliable. If it is kept, the article certainly needs NPOV. Unfortunately, from the edit history, this was recognized earlier, but every effort to remove the personal sites etc or to call them what they were failed. NN self-delusion. if major news sources wrote about it , then it would be a N self-delusion.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Honestly, anyone can name anyone anything and a list based merely on a language is rather arbitrary. I can name my son "Cupboard aquarium baseball".

<li><b>Delete</b> because there are no reliable sources for the assertion that these are common names. If a Russian magazine or vital statistics department announced the most common baby names in Russia, and if the list were published somewhere reliable, an article could be created referencing that (as I suspect has been done with the most popular American baby names). But there are no references in this article to reliable sources. (Note: This is not a "list of Russian names" but a list of "<i>common</i> Russian names". It's therefore a bit different than the other AfDs because it seems to refer to a specific subset of names only, so in my opinion the "cupboard aquarium baseball" argument doesn't really apply.) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 21:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Wikipedia does not have a process for a proposed guideline to become an official guideline except by citing it here to show it is used and useful, and claiming that there is consensus on the article talk page that it is ready to be a guideline. So it is appropriate to quote proposed guidelines here if you want them to be official ones. If you don't, then go to the talk for the guideline and say so, or slap a "disputed" tag on it. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:17, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is that itself not a pretty clear indication that there is no consensus for deletion? I have no problem with you nominating this individual list for deletion, but I think it might be inappropriate if you use this as precedent for other lists. If the same criticisms apply, nominate them all at once--especially since you know about them. If the same criticisms don't apply, then any claim of "precedent" in the future is inapplicable. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is better dealt with as a category, with only the notable/major ones getting articles. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 05:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a particularly poor example of these hospital lists (possibly why it was chosen as a test case?), but the same principles apply. Many hospitals have wikipedia articles, and the number of them that do will no doubt slowly increase with time. A complete list, with both red and blue links, is the best way to keep track of which have yet to be created - a category cannot do that. This is no worse than many of the other similar list categories. DGG's reason for favouring delete actually casts doubts as to the efficacity of deletion: <i>"This approach worked nicely on towers"</i>. What happened with towers was that individual articles on towers were turned into <i>just such lists as these</i>. These should similarly be kept as lists, so that any hospitals which may be deemed <i>not</i> worthy of having their own articles have somewhere where any information on them cound be merged. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 09:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this may be a poor example of an article, but the principle idea behind it is sound. Hospitals are reasonably capable of being notable. Grouping them by geographic region is also a reasonable method of sorting.

<li><b>Keep</b> this is useful as a development list, a valid use for a list.

<dd>I don't advocate the "we have X, why not Y" argument, but a precedent of sorts is the somewhat ridiculous decision to keep school articles.

<li>Unlike masts, which usually evoke feelings of antipathy, hospitals, by virtue of their nature, services, and their quality of care are usually of great interest to the public, and so are often subject of public information and/or news articles. Their building structures are usually well known beyond their catchment locality. I would draw the line at "clinics" (definitions may vary). The underlying subjects are notable, and the lists are capable of so being too if they impart useful additional information so I would vote <b>Keep</b> However, the system of these lists is a hotch-potch. The Jamaica list would benefit from being sorted by geography or by specialty, like some of the others. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Compromise</b>: This article has a lot of POV, but it also contains a lot of important information. I would agree that it is a POV fork too. I propose merging this into the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini article, but under a new section called "Criticism". This article is almost entirely about negative aspects of Khomeini's Islamic leadership, and lacks the positive aspects of his leadership. If it was put in a Criticism section, as is the case with many biographical articles, it would show that these views are those of critics and are not universally accepted. I do not think this should be deleted or just merged into the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini article in manner that very little information is salvaged. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 04:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for same reason as the other user who says this is an "attack" page. Criticism of the Khomeini ideology is legitimate, but stating his "views on non-Muslims" (if this is true) makes no sense unless these views had something to do with the state policy on non-Muslims. Later in the same section it says that Khomeini had no problems with Jews and Christians. It contradicts itself horribly. A better (and more legitimate) argument can be made for spreading hostility against Bahais. Khomeini, whatever we may think of him, is also viewed as a spiritual leader and holy man by a few million Shia Muslims in places like Iran and Lebanon, so I think his article should be careful in not going over the edge with condemnations. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalakaville_8bee.html" title="User:Malakaville">Malakaville</a> 05:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Seeing the references added to the article, the nominator has formed an opinion, which is <b>keep</b>: the article is now worthy.

<dd>Concerning notability, there were several game magazine reviews in German magazines. The game owner has provided some scans: <a href="http://www.clonk.de/press/PCGames2003.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.clonk.de/press/PCGames2003.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.clonk.de/press/PCGames2003.pdf</a> <a href="http://www.clonk.de/press/Shareplay2004.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.clonk.de/press/Shareplay2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.clonk.de/press/Shareplay2004.pdf</a> <a href="http://www.clonk.de/press/SuperPCSpiele2005.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.clonk.de/press/SuperPCSpiele2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.clonk.de/press/SuperPCSpiele2005.pdf</a></dd>
<dd>The game was also presented at the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Convention_37c1.html" title="Games Convention">Games convention</a> in 2005 (iirc), and got a short show in German television during that event. Googling for Clonk will also lead you to some game reviews of shareware sites and fansites created for the game.</dd>
<dd>Although the game is available in several languages, the vast majority of players is from Germany. Other notable distributions are in Finland, France and Russia (which is probably the reason why the former two also have a Wikipedia-entry in their native language).</dd>
<dd>Since I am a coworker in the game developement of Clonk, my view on notability is probably biased. However, I think there's enough facts to fulfill the guidelines of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. The localized Wikipedia-articles about Clonk have also been written and are maintained by "regular" fans. Sven Eberhardt 23:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The song appears never to have been released as a single, and is thus going to have difficulty where notability is concerned. The band and even the album the song is from are eminently notable, but the song isn't. This is an article which was previously Prod'ed, but the tag was removed with no additional assertion of notability (although the same series of edits cleared up some confusion about what song the article was actually about). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> A NN song from a notable album, still isn't appropriate to have an individual article. No assertion of notabilily.

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> This article is primarily an original research synthesis (which is anyway based on primary source material of a comedic nature which is unreliable for the serious-mindedness of this analysis) - fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. An earlier version of the article briefly made it onto the main page DYK section before being removed for lacking reliable sources.</p>
<p>Please see the earlier version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amphibiosan&amp;oldid=103900966" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amphibiosan&amp;oldid=103900966" rel="nofollow">here</a> with my comment about this on the main page error report page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103906406" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103906406" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the article has been updated - the original version's own assertion that as Futurama is a comedy, it is an unreliable primary source and may not be regarded as an effort at creating stable or canonical definitions has been removed, though the long list of serious-minded research conclusions about the biology of this fictional comedy species derived from the primary source remains. Further references have been added but these amount to further original research efforts to justify the long list of serious-minded guesses - the new references are mainly links to actual biology texts that do not mention this species at all. They are simply used to support a fan's speculation. Then there's a link to a one-line speculation in a review on Startrek.com that the "Grand Midwife "seems like a cross between Yoda and T'Pau""(?), a link to an almost-no-content random fansite page<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mountfuturama/worldsoffuturama.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~mountfuturama/worldsoffuturama.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and also, it is strangely implied that as one of the Futurama writers may have a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, this supports the original research?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem of the name of the article persists from the original version - the article itself indicates that it is not based on reliable sources:<i>"Although the name "Amphibios 9" is shown clearly in "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch", "Amphibiosans" are never referred to as such in the series. The name has, however, been picked up by fans and is used in such capacities as fan fiction and role-playing game statistics. Note that in Futurama, the inhabitants of Earth are called "Earthians"."</i></p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> The main issue here is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> - the name of the article is but one element of the problem with the article content. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is a core content policy. The previous version of the article is relevant for the related comments which still apply to this version.

Fans do often put a lot of work into their fan culture artefacts and writings - this doesn't make these encyclopedically notable. I already gave the creator a break by not opting to afd immediately after the article was pulled from the main page, but waiting for a few days instead. There are a ton of Wikipedia articles with "blatant problems" - this one appeared on the main page, so it was rather more "blatant" than average and caught my attention. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The author has apparently left Wikipedia in disgust over matters having nothing to do with this article. He's had 45 DYK's in 2 months and wrote <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_Articles_ee78.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal/Articles">all of these articles</a>. They’re not fancruft either. Because of that track record that was hoping he will return. And now, out of all the crap on Wikipedia that sits there unchallenged, this admittedly stupid but at least well-written article gets dragged to AfD. There are guidelines regarding when to ignore all other guidelines when it serves the greater good. Going tough on this article is not serving a greater good.

<dd>Yes, thanks for your recent "surveillance run" through my list of articles on my user page, which was apparently a response to my expressing my opinion in an unrelated discussion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_31#Adam4Adam" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_31#Adam4Adam" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. I'm baffled why I was singled out for this monitoring/discrediting effort, as my role in that discussion was quite limited before you started your little exercise. I was waiting to see if it would cross over into full-blown wiki-stalking or not. If you bothered to look at the histories of the few articles you tagged as having reference problems (actually you overlooked the external links provided in the articles for a couple of them - and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Pearl_96c2.html" title="Princess Pearl">Princess Pearl</a> is out of my hands. I keep that up to mark the first time that I rescued a badly written stub from speedy delete - I rewrote it as a coherent stub with a notability claim and pretty much left it to the fans after that (I've never seen the show)), you will see that those articles come from much earlier in my wikiexperience when I was experimenting with creating stubs and basic articles and was content to just to drop in a few external links). I keep them on my user page for nostalgic purposes. The kind of article content I create now are more like <a href="../../../j/m/w/JMWAVE_8bce.html" title="JMWAVE">JMWAVE</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_American_School_of_Medicine_5b99.html" title="Latin American School of Medicine">Latin American School of Medicine</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Soubise_dffc.html" title="Julius Soubise">Julius Soubise</a> which reflect my experience gained since those early days. For the record, I've <i>never</i> attempted original research synthesis - even in my novice days. It's useful to have someone to remind one that one's early attempts at articles could do with some brushing up (I'd rather forgotten about them) - but may I respectfully remind you to read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and to avoid the comprehensive "checking out" of editors you disagree with in policy discussions - it can give a bad impression. If you feel that editors without a perfect editing history should be barred from nominating articles for afd or participating in article discussions, I encourage you to voice your ideas in the appropriate policy channels.

<dd>Yes, if you'd read what I written properly, I said I was waiting to see if the unusual level of attention you seem to be giving to my articles - apparently in response to an opinion you disagree with in the context of an unrelated <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> discussion which you seem to be taking rather personally (a discussion which I was not even a main participant in!) - was going to cross over into wikistalking.

<li><b>Delete</b> At first glance the article has references, but on examination they turn out to be a Futurama comic book, which would be ok if it contains the statement that it is supposed to reference. In addition there are the editors' original research from viewing the TV show, and blogs and fan fiction, which are not reliable sources. The reliable sources, biology books, are not about the subject of the article. The series is notable, and has multiple independent reliable sources to show that. The individual episodes probably do not, and the individual characters such as this probably do not. The mass of related articles appear to be a case of loyal fans of a fictional work showing their appreciation of the work by spewing articles about every minute aspect of it all over Wikipedia, however non-notable they are by the applicable standards. I like Sherlock Holmes stories, but I do not find it necessary to write an article about every person he encountered, every place he went, and everything he touched in the stories. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article actually uses <i>only</i> written sources, mostly scripts. The blog and fan fiction mention is a <i>tiny</i> element of this article and could be removed in a snap if we rename it. Let's please try not to judge this article differently because it is based on scripts of a comedy show. I'm not convinced discussing certain elements of a script is original research. Any article involves selecting info to present versus info that isn't relevant. There are no theories here nor personal observations other than saying what species traits the green guy showed in certain episodes. Pointing out stuff like Amphibosians have nipples like mammals but are invertebrates because they have no bones doesn't cross the line into original research. And please remember that there is lots of esoteric minutae on Wikipedia...while it can go too far Wikipedia really is the place for it. <a href="../../../c/e/p/Cephalopod_size.html" title="Cephalopod size">Cephalopod size</a> is its own article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheetah_Girls_tours_3772.html" title="The Cheetah Girls tours">The Cheetah Girls tours</a> is its own article, as is <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Marx_25d1.html" title="Young Marx">Young Marx</a>. I'm not convinced this is original research nor that it's too specialized since other Futurama races have articles as well. No one answered me when I asked if those should be proposed for deletion too. How about this article on the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mor-Taxan_cc81.html" title="Mor-Taxan">Mor-Taxans</a>?

It is my understanding, through reading <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSWAF_a12d.html" title="WP:MOSWAF">WP:MOSWAF</a> and similar guideline articles, that citing an episode is acceptable as a primary source. The episode of "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch" contains much of the information in this article.

<dd>To clarify, when I say <i>Merge</i> in an RfA discussion context I don't necessarily mean merge <i>every</i> detail in the source article. Rather, the merge should typically entail some editing which culls out information which is unreasonable to include in the target. The target must be balanced as where lots of detail is OK in a child article, that same level of detail would be overkill in the parent. How much detail? Well that's part of the ebb and flow of normal Wikipedia article editing. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 23:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Additional comment by relister: Personally, I think that merging to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Simon_Fraser_University_e31b.html" title="History of Simon Fraser University">History of Simon Fraser University</a> won't work, as that is a one edit stub that will be overwhelmed by this content, and is unlikely to be watched closely enough to prevent the content from violating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> at some point in the future. I encourage opiners who believe that prior opinions should be endorsed to make it crystal clear which prior opinons they are endorsing; the possible merge solution was unavailable as a close in deletion review because it was unclear whether some "per above" opinions were in favor of or opposed to that solution. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 07:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant <b>keep</b> as the outcome involved the resignation of the president of a top university. In other words, a significant outcome outside the case itself. Normally I would suggest a merge back into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a> but the ArbCom situation suggests that would not be helpful. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is overwhelming evidence of sustained nationwide coverage of the controversy, including a set of articles from more than halfway across the country two and a half years after the story broke (<a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Citizen_8564.html" title="Ottawa Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a>). Articles whose primary subject is this case include multiple full-length articles in each of the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_and_Mail_1d03.html" title="Globe and Mail">Globe and Mail</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macleans.html" title="Macleans">Macleans</a>, and at least two Google Scholar results. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 08:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Reasons listed:
<ol>
<li>If we apply <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, the case shatters the required threshold of multiple reliable sources. I find upward of 30,000 words in Lexis-Nexis and Newsbank alone, over multiple months from almost all major Canadian news outlets (very few international though). The case reverberates in the Canadian press until today. Notability is also given by the institutional impact. Resignation of a president of a major university is no small thing. I cannot see how 30,000 words should be summarized in two lines in History of SFU. The case, while probably not a first-tier academic scandal, is clearly far from obscure.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> requires tight sourcing of all claims and balanced writing. It does not mean sourced comments must be removed because they put individuals in a bad light, and many other academic scandals on which we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_academic_scandals.html" title="List of academic scandals">articles</a> have an element of wrongdoing by at least one participant. All are or should be held to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, none should be (or have been, to my knowledge) completely removed. After reading most of the articles I find that the article does not deviate in tone from the majority of articles from the major news outlets. It is not "grossly unbalanced". If the article appears biased, then it's because the facts are biased. If individual sources are found to be unreliable, this should not be a problem as most factual claims can be sourced in triplicate. <i>(Addendum: I support GRBerry's removal of the lurid details. The article should focus on the institutional process and impact in the style of Rick Coe's <a href="http://www.caut.ca/en/bulletin/issues/1998_may/sfu.html" class="external text" title="http://www.caut.ca/en/bulletin/issues/1998_may/sfu.html" rel="nofollow">analysis</a> for the Canadian Association of University Teachers).</i></li>
<li>This article revolves around three individuals and one institution. The institution, SFU, and one individual, President S., are notable ex officio; one individual, LD, is seemingly non-notable outside this case; and one individual, RM, is of contested notability. This argument has been made that because of the contested notability of this last individual covering the case in the detail allowed by the richness of the sources constitutes undue weight. I cannot find a precedent for this. We cover scandals in the bio of individuals if the scandal revolves around one person and biographical information is available (see e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_McCarthy_%28CIA%29_61d3.html" title="Mary McCarthy (CIA)">Mary McCarthy (CIA)</a>) or in a stand-alone article on the case (see e.g. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_lacrosse.html" title="Duke lacrosse">Duke lacrosse</a> case), or as in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> case, spread over multiple articles. If RM is non-notable outside this case and biographical information is hard to come by, there should be no bio entry on her for risk of providing false information. But this should not affect this article which meets all of our standards per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and no arguments other that "there should not be two articles on RM" have been made in support of the claim that it fails our policies. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Easily passes the notability threshold (and I'm reluctant to grant that to "news" events.) If <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is an ongoing concern, apply an appropriate level of protection to the article, but do not delete it. BLP applies to <i>unsourced or false</i> information, not <i>true and well-sourced information which makes someone look bad</i>. This information is already a significant part of public record and consciousness, and our failure to include it will do little or nothing to "protect" those involved. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 09:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>&lt;sigh&gt;</b> This will be kept here because it meets the notability requirements, only to be deleted because of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concerns later and per the ArbCom remedies, brought up at deletion review and brought back here.... My opinion is there should be a <b>cooling-off period</b> with implementation of a <b>Brian Peppers solution</b>, per my reasoning at the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#27_January_2007" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">DRV</a> and because <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETIND_80d6.html" title="WP:TIND">there is no deadline</a>. The scandal <i>does</i> meet the notability guidelines, but it was relatively minor. And that's the primary continuing interest in this: a <i>scandal</i> involving the obnoxious <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a>. And that's why people are interested in this, not because of its effect on university administrative procedures. No one is champing at the bit to write University of Michigan speech code controversy, even though that was a big story in its day and we could no doubt find hundreds of sources on it. It could be a good article (and no doubt will be one day); but no one criticizes Wikipedia because it isn't covered here. It is important that we cover <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monicagate.html" title="Monicagate">Monicagate</a> currently; this is optional and can wait. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 17:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree that "keep and cleanup" should not be a permissible opinion in this discussion. BLP issues should be addressed during this five-day procedural reprieve and not expected to be solved afterwards. And it also shouldn't be addressed in this handwaving "there are problems in the article somewhere" manner, we had enough of that during the DRV. If there are objectionable passages they should be brought up here to make sure they're fixed prior to closure of this AfD. That's not to say that I don't think GRB did an aadmirable job cutting through the clutter (double negative). ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Almost the entire text of this page is virtually identical with that of Levine's official website. It therefore constitutes little more than PR. While some of the isolated facts may be true, the blatant copying precludes it from being a neutral, encyclopedic article. Anyone wishing to write a legitimate, multi-sourced and balanced article on Levine would have to start fresh, so it makes sense to delete this puff piece.</td>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This does not require a complete rewrite, and elected officials for California are definitely notable, as with any other state.

<p>This article should be merged/redirected into the Xbox 360 article. A launch is a big deal: but it's something better suited for a video game wiki. We don't have launchs of other electronics/computers here, do we? (if we do, they should be merged as well in my opinion) Video games should be no exception, period. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 07:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

All three articles should have been grouped in a single AFD, otherwise there will be conflicts (this will be merged, and people will try to merge the Wii launch article having this as precedent, while others will try to recreate the Xbox 360 launch article because the Wii launch was kept). I suggest closing this and reopening the AFD with the three grouped as one. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. All video game consoles (with the exception of a few) are major products, but none have launch articles (that I know of): except the 3 newest. The newest consoles should be no exception. They are much better suited for a video game wiki. Wikipedia shouldn't be a fan's guide to mass information on console launchs (or other launches for that matter: computers, DVD, Windows versions, etc). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 01:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Naturally the three newest would have articles about it, while older ones were launched in the early days of wikipedia (or even, long long before wikipedia existed). Thus this is just one reason why claiming "older consoles don't have and article for launch and thus this one shouldn't either" is not an argument at all. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm voting keep on the basis this article has been constantly deleted without ever being given a chance to improve. Now it has been sent straight to AfD after it passed the deletion review to allow it to exist. I believe it should be given a chance to exist and improve to a state where it could properly survive an AfD, I feel this is a justified feeling as it appears to be a magazine that has spun of numerous other magazines. Thus indicating that it is likely to be rather notabile, certainly at least one or more of those ones that have been spun off I suspect could even survive on their own thus surely the parent one ought to likewise survive.

<p>I disagree. If you take a look at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Podcasters" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Podcasters" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>] there are many you could state as not notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. However, many of these people are playing important roles in the growth of podcasting. Scott.cropper 17:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— User:Scott.cropper (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EScott.cropper_b8a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Scott.cropper">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>I also disagree. Within the contemporary trend of "Lifehacking", Merlin Mann is a major player. Applying the 100 year test, someone with an interest in the evolution of personal productivity schemes would find such an entry relevant and notable due to the stark contrast of Merlin's methods to more prevalent high-tech implementations. Furthermore, if we strictly apply the notability criteria the wikipedia will have no content on contemporary figures that aren't pop stars or politicians. This is a grey zone, and I am of the opinion that this particular entry should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As Peregrine Fisher mentioned, the existence of these articles has already been debated, with a consensus of Keep. However, I do agree that the rambling "plot summary" nature of the article needs to be pared down. It should be condensed down to 500-1000 words, and more attention should be made to the non-plot elements of the episode, than just the storyline. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 20:00, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per the reasoning of Extraordinary Machine and Steve block. WP:NOT is policy. The article violates that policy. And there is no sign that there are any reliable, independent sources that we could use to add "real-world context and sourced analysis" to the article as required by WP:NOT. No need to redirect (unlikely search term) or merge (what information is there to merge?). Responding to folks above who cite "precedent" as a reason for keeping: Wikipedia is not a court. Each subject is treated individually, on its own merits, i.e. are there enough reliable sources independent of the subject to write an article. Even <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> emphasizes that "This page is not policy." If people find <i>arguments</i> made at past AfD's convincing and relevant to this AfD, then repeat those arguments. But <i>outcomes</i> of past AfD's have nothing to do with this one. Anyway, precedent is not uniform on episode articles, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Merry_Fisticuffs_%28Gilmore_Girls%29_7775.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Merry Fisticuffs (Gilmore Girls)">this</a> (cited by Salad Days) or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pieface_%28The_Buzz_on_Maggie_episode%29_c5f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pieface (The Buzz on Maggie episode)">this</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. With the plot summary it's a violation of Wikipedia policy and possibly U.S. law. Without the plot summary (i.e. as of this writing) it's completely devoid of information.

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability isn't the relevant criteria for episode articles. This one fails NOT and EPISODE in that it is an overly long and detailed plot summary with nothing else. I'd support keeping it if it had some analysis or other real world context, but as nothing but a plot summary, it's not encyclopedic and a potential copyright issue. I'd have no objection to merging a much shorter summary into an episode list, and I'd reconsider my vote if this article was improved to address these issues. "Per previous AFD/precedent" isn't a valid argument as wikipedia doesn't operate on precedent - consensus to keep some episode articles doesn't imply that there's consensus to keep all of them. Nor does policy say that all episode articles are inherently worth keeping - it says they should only exist if there's good reason, specifically that they are needed because there's sufficient info beyond the plot summary that it would be too much for an article on the season or the show. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As informative as this article is, I don't agree that it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, as a single chapter fraternity of some 15-20 members at a small university. Furthermore, it's no longer even recognized by the university (<a href="http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/dkelly2/Triniteers.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/dkelly2/Triniteers.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the lack of inclusion <a href="http://www.trinity.edu/departments/cci/fraternities.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.trinity.edu/departments/cci/fraternities.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). To preserve its content at a more appropriate location, I've copied the material to the <a href="http://www.trinitywiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Triniteers" class="external text" title="http://www.trinitywiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Triniteers" rel="nofollow">Trinity University wiki</a>. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 22:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The historical relevance as being the first social club at Trinity University should be noted. The fact that the university does not recognize the fraternity is inconsequential. The United States does not recognize Cuba, but that doesn't make it unimportant as a country. The level of membership also should not be called into play. Groups at Yale such as Skull and Bones usually have small memberships, but their entries are not up for deletion. I believe there is merit in capturing the history of this group that should not be overlooked. <b>User:sfrancis353</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>None of those are particularly compelling reasons to keep the article. For starters, I'm pretty certain that the Triniteers <i>weren't</i> the first social club at Trinity; the school had been around much earlier than 1936 and a cursory glance through books on its history mention plenty of groups and clubs that could lay claim to the title of a "social club". In order to make that claim, you'll need to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify it</a>. Second, the United States-Cuba bit isn't an appropriate comparison in this instance; we're not talking about a nation of millions whose existence is recognized by nearly any person who can claim a basic knowledge of geography.

<dd>Concerning your last point, though, yes, there <i>is</i> merit in capturing the history of this group — which is why it is now preserved as an article on the Trinity Wiki, a place that will allow articles that may not garner the amount of importance required for inclusion here. Furthermore, I'm sure that there are sources at Trinity itself which could use the research of someone who's willing to put in the work. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 23:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Correction -- First men's social/service group at Trinity University (aka fraternity). All non-academic based fraternities/sororities at Trinity University are local to that school. No national charters that aren't academic related have really been allowed to take root there. This creates a very unique atmosphere at the school and has helped define the history and character of it. The names of the groups themselves such as Triniteers, Spurs, and Bengal Lancers show the uniqueness that these groups have. One major question I have based on this deletion criteria is inclusion in wikipedia of Trinity's Kappa Kappa Delta fraternity. This also is a Trinity University only fraternity. The main reason I wrote the Triniteer article is based on the inclusion of this other small lesser known fraternity. Seeing them linked to the Trinity University site, and also seeing mention of the Triniteers on the Trinity University wikipedia site without a link made me feel that there indeed there was some relevance in capturing the history. Within the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="List of social fraternities and sororities">List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities</a> there is an entire section pointing to local groups that only have one chapter, are these more relevant even though there numbers are the same, and in many cases the schools are just as small? I understand your points and obviously the final decision is up to the powers that be, but at the same time I want to give the Triniteers a fighting chance. <b>User:sfrancis353</b></p>

<dd>Hopefully someone with more experience with Greek-related articles on the Wiki will drop by and give some input — I don't think this AfD should be closed with the input of only two editors, and you make a pretty good case. We'll see where it goes.</dd>
<dd>By the way, the KKD link was actually an external one linking to the Trinity Wiki, rather than an internal link to an article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - simply not notable; there is a lot of precedent for deleting articles about individual frat chapters, for example.

<li><b>Keep</b> A full professor in a major law school holding a named chair. That means three or more successive peer-reviews by already-qualified academics.

<li><b>comment--WP:PROF</b> I remind everyone that WP:PROF is a proposal, not guideline, not even an accepted guideline, and certainly not policy; it is still being actively discussed on its talk page, and is of no authority whatsoever.

<li>But there's a difference between a game based around music, and a tv theme song. Because a tv theme has one group, and a game like guitar hero has so many, it would be impractical to list band information on all the groups on the one guitar hero page. You can't compare the two.<a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHoponpop69_1615.html" title="User:Hoponpop69">Hoponpop69</a> 01:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>- I wouldn't underplay the importance of being an extra song in guitar hero. Yes it is extra but it's not just a fun little thing to be played in the background of the actual game play, it's a continuation of the actual game play in a significant way. To compare it to songs in other games where music isn't the focus would be unfair. Aside from that they are a real band that plays real shows and has two real albums avalible for purchase, one of which is on the very real iTunes music store. Don't get me wrong it's not that hard to get on the iTunes store, but it does take a certain amount of notability. This isn't just some band passing out demos to their five friends. You can find reviews of their music from legitimate sources. So yes they aren't the "theme song" of guitar hero per say, but they aren't only guitar hero. And techincally they are the song played on the title screen of the game so... 63.139.168.233 06:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The very suggestion of deleting this article, based on the reasons given, needs to be called into question when not all of the GH bands are receiving the same scrutiny. In fact, it smacks of a personal attack/vendetta against this band. The entry for Graveyard BBQ, for example, isn't being challenged and let's examine the facts: they have only one album released and available for purchase as opposed to The Acro-brats' two CDs, Graveyard BBQ has been on only one of the Guitar Hero games while The Acro-brats have been on both; The Acro-brats have played more shows, and so on and so on. To me there's no question of whether or not this entry is valid. The only question is what was the motivation behind the individual who called it into question in the first place. 24.218.220.18 20:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: The band COULD be notable for the GH work, but the page itself is entirely unsourced. If they're notable, surely there's more that could be said about this band then brief mentions of their two albums and a brief trivia note. The 'personal vendetta' idea is taking this way too personally; I have no personal interest in this article, I just think it fails Wikipedia's policies. If there's a less notable article that shouldn't be there, then nominate it for AfD as well (see also: <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>.) <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiakalla_89a9.html" title="User:Tiakalla">Tiakalla</a> 05:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Tough one. First of all she is not the same person as Ildan, let me clear that. She is a well-known professor of Bogazici University, one of the best universities in Turkey. She is also a translation guru, one of the best translators this country has ever seen (imho, of course). She is far more famous than Mehmet Murat İldan, that i can say without hesitation. But, i don't see translation works and academic career as a sign of notability. Because of that i'm for deleting this article, although i voted "Keep" for İldan, the self-promoting one.

Do you know John Berger? She has at least 25 books translated. Can you understand the importance of this?.. My dear friends, you can never ignore her big works! I am sad to see the above childish comments on her... Please don't talk about the issues which ypu have no knowledge at all. She is a good published translator and no one can dare to prove the opposite!.. I am really disappointed to see the ignorant comments on her.

<dl>
<dd>I removed the prod because its notability is at the least unclear. I thought proding it before too, until I ran across these things:
<ul>
<li>There are 4 different language versions of the article on wikipedia (this en one, <a href="../../../../de/p/i/x/Pixel_cars.html" class="extiw" title="de:Pixel_cars">de:Pixel cars</a>, <a href="../../../../fr/m/a/n/Mangacars.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Mangacars">fr:Mangacars</a>, <a href="../../../../pl/m/a/n/Mangacars.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Mangacars">pl:Mangacars</a>), with no real similarity between them, and the others are longer than the enwiki one</li>
<li>Googling for "manga-cars" gets 130k hits, "pixel-cars" gets 55k hits.</li>
<li>While reliable, non-trivial, independent sources don't jump out at you when you do the searches, what you do see is a range of forums dedicated to the concept (<a href="http://www.pixelcarart.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.pixelcarart.com/" rel="nofollow">10k members</a>, <a href="http://www.mangacars.pl/" class="external text" title="http://www.mangacars.pl/" rel="nofollow">2k members</a>, <a href="http://www.mangacars.fr/" class="external text" title="http://www.mangacars.fr/" rel="nofollow">2k members</a>, <a href="http://www.pixelcars.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.pixelcars.de/" rel="nofollow">1.5k members</a>)</li>
</ul>

<dd>The subject doesn't really personally appeal to me (at all), but the above makes me think it's somewhat of a widespread concept, and that it should be put through AfD at least. --<small><a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 03:48, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Tentative <b>keep</b>. I've been tring to standardize the articles for several <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Forces_Base_7079.html" title="Canadian Forces Base">Canadian military bases</a> in the past week. Some of these cadet training centres are co-located on the bases and the information being provided about the cadet facilities was sometimes overwhelming the military information about the bases. I created both CSTC articles as part of an effort to direct these editors in a standardized consistent direction, in contrast to what has been taking place. There are many so-called "place-holder" stub articles on Wikipedia that have been maintained for various reasons and I think these CSTC articles will fill in over time.<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_east_e6a7.html" title="User:Plasma east">Plasma east</a> 17:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not certain why you consider this to be "worthy" of deletion. It is a well-founded college and graduate school. It has been around for over 60 years. This article is also the most complete online article on the college. I also would note that other schools that are similar to Piedmont Baptist College have pages.

<dd>The Williamette Week Online article has two sentences about the site and two sentences describing interesting stories. It's pretty trivial. The Portland one isn't online, so I can't check it. The title isn't promising. Horowitz has about a paragraph of information, but that still falls into the "directories" exclusion of sources that don't count for notability, and even if we count it, it's still only a single source. If you can find me another good solid paragraph about the site, then you might have something. The problem is that almost all of the links and sources given are trivial in their information about the site. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

Here is a link to the article: <a href="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/106749.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/106749.html" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> I am interested how you will see this article.

<li>Commondreams is at least mentioned in passing two textbooks on gbooks: <i>Media Now</i> and SAGE's <i>Key Concepts in Journalism Studies</i>. That seems like a start on sourcing, as is the stuff on "A-list blogs" in <i>Politics and Government in the Age of the Internet</i>. After exhausting those, would-be editors could start on the 100+ other books on google books, the stuff on scholar, and the many news reports. Then they could try JSTOR, MUSE, LookSmart, and Factiva. And if they could come up with very clever search terms, they could maybe even try web searches to find reliable sources.

We can certainly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that much about it.

A lot of "keep" arguments being based on "<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">This number is big</a>" - notability isn't the same as popularity or prominence on the web. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:59, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's true. But the fact is that some of the numbers are big, and that poses a significant problem in finding if there are, or aren't any <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>-fulfilling reports. If there are 101 ghits, it's easy enough to skim through them. If there are $BIGNUM, it isn't. Likewise, separating all the trivial news reports isn't easy. I still think that skimmimg recent journalism/media studies textbooks would be the best way for people who want this kept to conclusively prove that it is notable, but I've neither the time nor the inclination to check. Garage bands have more appeal than anything concerning Unitedstatesian politics.

The absolute <i>best</i> source I have seen offered above is a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0865714428&amp;id=7vD55mKAVmoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA202&amp;lpg=RA1-PA202&amp;ots=vMEOmB9qE4&amp;dq=common+dreams+news&amp;sig=GZpjpW4JAkUH7is3LlLnKaAlg3I" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0865714428&amp;id=7vD55mKAVmoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA202&amp;lpg=RA1-PA202&amp;ots=vMEOmB9qE4&amp;dq=common+dreams+news&amp;sig=GZpjpW4JAkUH7is3LlLnKaAlg3I" rel="nofollow">two sentence description</a> of the site in a book that is apparently only held in <a href="http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/49205454&amp;tab=holdings?loc=98101" class="external text" title="http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/49205454&amp;tab=holdings?loc=98101" rel="nofollow">four libraries in the entire world</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#Criteria" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#Criteria</a> specifically defines "a brief summary of the content" as "trivial" coverage, so the <i>Better World Handbook</i> therefore fails to satisfy even one of the <i>multiple</i> non-trivial independent references required to establish notability, and the <i>Better World Handbook</i> is the <i>best</i> source I have seen offered. With no sources to establish notability, the remaining arguments are "I like this website (ILIKEIT)" and "Morton is a poo poo head (IDONTLIKEMORTON)." Neither of those is a valid argument, and therefore, AFAICT, the site doesn't meet notability criteria. We're not in the business of writing articles about <i>popular</i> websites, we're in the business of writing <i>sourced</i> articles about <i>notable</i> websites. No one has offered even one non-trivial source, much less multiple such sources, and I therefore recommend deletion.

<li><b>Summary</b> Its notable enough that multiple newspapers use it for a source and reference it. There are lots of popular sites on the web, like <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> however they are not used as sources for major newspapers. The fact that major newspapers use them as a source goes to show the site is notable. If you would like a closed examination it would be to look at Digg.com, where as Digg is not referenced by Washington Post, they are not because they are popular but not notable. Where as Common Dreams is both. Its hard to see the line where popularity and notability divide, however when major newspapers and not just average people begin using it as a source, its clear its passed that line. So how do we find out if a news source is notable? The basic idea of a news source is to cover other items and people, not to attract coverage for itself. Much like Schools do not require sources to show their notability, it makes little sense why a news source would, considering the popularity and notability (enough to be cited by the biggest national papers). It seems to say that Washington Post and other national papers find them notable enough to include thier views and cite them, but since there is little evidence of someone writing about them, they fail WP:N, is a bit of wikilawyering. What happened to the spirit of Wikipedia and not the letter of the policy? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 20:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really sure what you are talking about.

<dd>There's been no consensus that being cited indicates notability, that's why that doesn't appear in the guidelines. This isn't wikilawyering over technical details, this is making up a new definition of notability and saying it is "in the spirit".

<dd>Please AGF. I am stating that we adhere to the spirit of the guidelines, stating that an article cannot exist without sources is false, hence the WP:SCHOOL example. My point isnt that citations are required to be notable, its that citations for a news site are an example of notability. How can they be not notable yet often references by the most notable sources in the world? That makes little sense. As I stated, you will not see Digg being used as a reference, however you will see CDNC. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please AGF yourself, wiklawyering is a pejorative term. And my point still stands: this isn't wikilawyering by people arguing "delete". Your argument for notability (and I'm not commenting on the validity of it here) isn't expressed by the principles or spirit of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Nobody is arguing over technical points, they are saying that the principle - multiple, non-trivial mentions in independent reliable sources - isn't met. So by all means make your arguments for notability, but don't make false attacks on the other side. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not sure why you are so hostile, and I really do not appreciate it. But you have yet to counter the point so I will just ignore it and ask you to take a wiki break if you are stressed out. As I stated they are cited by the most prominent news companies in the world, that shows notability. If you think I am wrong, show me another news source with as many citations that isnt notable.

<dd>I'm not being hostile; I'm saying that accusations of wikilawyering are in bad faith and just not true. I'm not in the least bit stressed out because, as I said earlier, I have no feelings either way regarding the subject. My point is that nowhere in the notability guidelines does it say that <i>being cited</i> shows notability.

<dd>I am not sure why you keep repeating yourself, but I already explained this. Who said its part of WP:N? I am stating that much like Schools notability is derived from a different criteria for different items. The reason WP:N is not policy is because of that very fact, it snot all encompassing. I am explaining that being cited by many of the most popular news agencies is a show of notability. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 11:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um no, I have been specifically stating that the criteria in that <b>guideline</b> is not appropriate. Did you read the massive paragraph? It makes comparisons to WP:SCHOOL where schools are deamed notable without having someone write about them, etc. As for accusations of wikilawyering, it wasnt meant as a attack, its a term. Seeing as there has been a mountain of WP:INSERT GUIDELINE HERE talk, it seems there is much wikilawyering going on.

<dd><a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">Wikilaywering</a> is a pejorative term, so there's an implied attack there. And I don't think any wikilawyering has gone on; it's not simply quoting and using policies and guidelines, but dwelling on technical details which override the spirit. But this argument isn't really relevant to the deletion debate, so I will accept it as a difference of opinions (and advise that using the term doesn't normally help your cause). On topic again, I disagree that being cited indicates notability; I think a topic needs to have been specifically written about. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I am not denying that the people the article links to are notable, I am just saying that, until we have articles on them, there is no need for a disambiguation page.

<dd>OK, I'll accept delete on Éanna if none of the information (the King's names and reign dates) is lost. Of course that will mean creating an article and we then need a disambig. The page is more than a basic disambig and does contain information, minimal I'll accept but because it is royalty it is notable. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 16:55, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> So you are saying that we should have articles on words, describing their history? That is not an encyclopedia, that is a dictionary.

<li><b>Delete</b> Dorota for sure. Practically unused among Czechs as the first name for decades, sometimes employed coloquially in Czech language as offense (dorota == dumb and/or quareling woman). Jiří (diminutives Jirka, Jiřík, Jiříček) is a very frequent Czech first name but I somehow fail to see much of value in the article so delete this too.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Major regional shopping centre within northwestern Sydney (I know of it despite living at the other side of Australia and having never been there) - was the subject of a major corporate tug-of-war in the 1990s that made the news. I'm not close enough to find sources (Australian sources prior to 1995 tend to be located in real libraries near their source) but am happy to vouch for its notability - it's not simply a corner store. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 13:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per Rebecca; if not <b>Strong keep</b> per Orderinchaos78 - the article is a large well-known shopping centre in Sydney, and a Factiva search brings up 413 articles in newspapers, including a major issue with the owners (or former owners) GEM Property Trust back in the late 1990s, when they tried to put "Venture" Stores in the shopping centre, which all failed, and they overvalued the place - they had to write $12 million dollars off the shopping centre's price - OIC78 seems to be right; the article is also referenced, more than can be said of most articles of this type too. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 22:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Voting or making comments on editors who have made votes that you don't agree with them to try and discredit their comments/vote is not on. I've had to edit various other pages in the last three months, and I don't have the page on my watchlist, which means I haven't had much to do with it. I have already shown why this article should be kept, and that is to do with the financial worries of GEM in the late 1990s. If you want to vote delete, you can do so, but don't try to attack or discredit those who disagree with you. The fact I may have once provided an edit on the page in question is nothing more than an aside. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 02:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Same - I'd note I only edited the article *after* it came here - I saw the AfD, tried my best to improve it, left it for others once done. The idea of stub articles is to establish a framework that will jog those who know something about the subject or have more time and/or resources to fill it out. I've been filling out stubs in the Perth geographical area which prior to my contribution were simply one line stubs that did not express notability. It may well have been that the creator did not have the means of research at hand, or worked a 40 hour week and couldn't get into the State Library or whatever - it is a volunteer effort, after all. I have not changed my opinion and still believe Carlingford Court is notable both in terms of its magnitude and also in terms of its history. I also believe AfD is overused as a "cleanup" tool. Holding a gun to one's head is not the way to encourage article growth, as has been discussed elsewhere. As it is, there's nothing wrong with the article remaining as a stub, and until Wikipedia policy changes and says "no stubs" (which I doubt will ever happen), that will always be the way. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 05:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> People have raised good reasons why it might be notable, but none of these are in the article itself. Wikipedia being voluntary and not a job, some leeway should be given to delays in adding additional content as per comments by <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a>. But if there actually is some notable copy to be added, let's add it and we can bring the great Shopping Centre Debate to a close (and if there's not, then we can also bring the Debate to a close the other way).<a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 02:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Two references to street directories, and one article in a local business magazine talking about a building expansion. That's still not "multiple non-trivial reliable published sources" per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I stand by my original opinion that this article should be deleted, and/or have any genuinely notable information merged into a parent article about the local community. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 04:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Orderinchaos78 and JROBBO and Rebecca. The reasons being given to delete this article would cover 4 in every 5 articles on Wikipedia and just about every stub there is, it should be kept and improved. If you think it needs sources then put a sources tag on it!! Is the writing NPOV? Yes. Is the subject notable/would Wikipedia be a better place if this article was completed? Yes. Does it fail any of the speedy deletion criteria? No. Can it be improved? Clearly yes if you read the submissions above mine. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 13:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

We know nothing about the material from which Rupees are made, nor how the Rupee came to be so widespread in the Zelda universe, nor any <i>other</i> aspect of Rupeean history, nor what bank guarantees the value of the Rupee, and so on.

<li>I don't disagree with you, but for future reference, nothing is "inherently notable," and the only topics that are encyclopedic are notable ones.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Parts of the article are inappropriate for wikipedia, but the solution for that is to remove those parts, not delete the entire article. This article should probably be 1/3 its current size, and only include appropriately sourced information.

<ul>
<li>It's not "virtual currency" and it's not important to the Zelda universe. It's simply a "colorful" way of representing an in-game measure of the character's money. It's of equal importance to Zelda as coins are to Super Mario games. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a place to house gaming trivia, which everything except the first sentence is. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 00:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would argue that if Mario collected "Mario Ingots" then that would also be deserving of an article. I would suggest looking at an AFD for something like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goombas.html" title="Goombas">Goombas</a>, AFD here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Goomba_4ab5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Goomba">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Goomba</a>. Similar to the Goomba, the Rupee is an iconic part of the Zelda universe. Anyways, I've said my peace. My argument that it should be kept is well-taken as is Chardish's argument that it should be deleted. No need for never-ending rebuttals of those we disagree with.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 04:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't place the Rupee on the same level as the Goomba. That level of notability is reserved for the Tektite or Octorok. Also Mario Ingots, if they exsisted, would probably wind up in the Mario Series article, just like the Rupee.&#160;:<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckwheatjones_99f0.html" title="User:Buckwheatjones">Bucky</a></li>

<li>Questions: What impact on popular culture? (Remember, we're talking about popular culture, not internet gaming forums.) How are rupees important to the Zelda series? (Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if they were called "gems" or "crystals" instead of rupees.) And most importantly, what do the different values of rupees and the size of Link's wallet have to do with either of those? - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 06:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Other video games, for one pop culture example. They're very important to the Zelda games. Have you played any of them? You wouldn't be able to beat the games without them, and they're even used in puzzles sometimes! They're NOT called gems or crystals. We're not talking about the name ("Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if they were called "gems" or "crystals" instead of rupees."). We're talking about the monetary units themselves. A better hypothetical situation would be "Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if there was no money system." The answer to that would be "a lot."&#160;:) I'm asking for a merge. There's not enough real-life consequence to the rupee to have an article, but there is tons of consequence in regards to the Zelda series, so the information should definitely not be deleted. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 22:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Other video games" could be a trivia thing in the main <i>Zelda</i> article. The fact that Zelda games contain a monetary system is of minor interest to the <i>Zelda</i> games - a few sentences in the main article would do this topic justice. "Zelda games frequently feature in-game currency known as <i>rupees</i>, which appear as crystals of different colors and are found over the course of the adventure. They can be used to buy items and powerups, and are occasionally used to pass certain required game objectives." And find a good source. That's it. Everything else is trivial.</li>

<dd>I have heard that before but going by previous discussions it does not matter what people think only the closing admin.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Matrix, you have been told MANY times that articles need to be <b>verifiable</b>. The external links in the article do not assert notability. Most of them just mention that the group are in Melodifestivalen (and apparently ended up at the botton of the field). Surely the world's biggest rap band has sources you can quote in an article about them?--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonadea_ce0a.html" title="User:Bonadea">Bonadea</a> 22:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><u><b>Speedy</b></u> <b>Delete</b> A book about non-notable inventions, many of which didn't get off the drawing board. Amazon.com Sales Rank: #27,583 in Books. Not bad, but not so good that I'd support a keep vote without some other claim to notability. Besides, the current article is little more than a list of the chapters of the book. If the book does turn out to be notable for some reason no-one's noticed, the article should be trimmed right back to a stub.

<li><b>Comment</b>, these are <i>not</i> non-notable inventions. Many (possibly all) already have a page here on wikipedia. It is <i>not</i> a listing of chapters, but instead stating what inventions it covers. A perfectly reasonably thing to include in the article. Also if you look at the inventions you will see many of them have a wikilink to their own article page like I said. Thus obviously <b>not</b> non-notable inventions. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Largely irrelevant-the notability of a book's <i>subject</i> has no bearing on the notability of the book. Nor does sales (notability is not popularity). If and <i>only</i> if reliable non-trivial secondary source coverage exists is the subject notable. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 09:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I know that a book being about a notable subject doesn't mean it is notable. Likewise the reverse is also not automatically true. Thus is why I was replying to <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a>'s delete vote where it was stated "<i>book about non-notable inventions</i>". Probably could have stated it better, either way the combination of your statement and mine I think now makes my point clear. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 12:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>. What I was saying was 'non notable book about non notable things'. Most of them never got off the drawing board, or past the prototype stage. That doesn't mean they aren't interesting, but it does make it less likely that they have impacted the universe in any noticable way. And per everyone, we need to establish the notability of the book. The only argument presented on this page so far is sales, which aren't bad, but not, I think, good enough. Currently #9,283 - a problem with Amazon rankings. It does seem to have been #6 at one point <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22My+Tank+is+Fight%21%22+amazon&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22My+Tank+is+Fight%21%22+amazon&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> , but I'm not planning to change my vote unless the article explains why the book is notable. Currently, it says "Parsons describes the work as "pulp history" given its nature of combining technical details with a more action and humor-focused writing style. The book was published mainly because of Something Awful's huge popularity as a humor website, with many people interested in purchasing a book by one of its contributors. It is based on a series of columns for the site." BFW. The bulk of the aricle is a list of chapters, followed by apparently OR observation that "Many of the inventions are of German origin because ...". Actually, I will change my vote. See above.

<li>What dyu mean?? claims to be?? i am robert wilson. why would i lie about my name? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rumandraisin (<a href="../../../r/u/m/User_talk%7ERumandraisin_08bf.html" title="User talk:Rumandraisin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rumandraisin_976f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rumandraisin">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for several reasons:
<ol>
<li><i>If</i> Rumandraisin is the leader of the band, then he's got a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Somebody should tell him not to edit this article if it is kept, and not to re-create this article if it is deleted.</li>
<li>All of the "singles" are self-made by Rumandraisin. They look like somebody made them in MS Paint. I don't think that they are valid.</li>
<li>Their website <a href="http://indiestore.com/zinctechdragon" class="external autonumber" title="http://indiestore.com/zinctechdragon" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> looks pathetic. I know that this isn't a basis for deletion, but look at all the spelling errors. Those give me the impression that this is simply a garage band, and we all know how <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_one_cares_about_your_garage_band_9e75.html" title="Wikipedia:No one cares about your garage band">Wikipedia feels about garage bands</a>. Also, they only have 4 songs loaded on their website, which is the limit for free users. Looks like they aren't paying for their free hosting service.</li>
<li>The most important reason: <b>Fails <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a></b>. I tried to find the chart claims on somewhere other than the band's website, but I couldn't find them. My guess is that they were fabricated to make the band look better than it is. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PT</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">O</a> 22:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> In my mind, this is dangerously close to indiscriminate information. However, and in defense of the article, this is not the creator's own choice of top 20 most controversial videos but simply the list that appeared in an MTV special. I'm sure a little bit of cleanup would remove the OR and POV and the list itself is clearly verifiable. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> article. It is original research beyond repair. As written, it is a list of characters with things they're afraid of. The diagnostic term <i>phobia</i> is more specific than that. It requires much greater severity and more debilitating effects than most people realize. Basically, unless the characters are said to have been diagnosed with a phobic disorder, applying the label in this list invokes POV. Even if we changed the name to List of fictional characters diagnosed with phobic disorders, that wouldn't fix the current list. We could more easily start over from scratch than work our way through this whole list figuring out which item fits and which does not. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 21:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The list does not seem to distinguish between an actual "phobia" and a run-of-the-mill fear of something. For example, I may fear burning my hand on a stove, but that does not give me a phobia of the stove or a phobia of being burned. Because it is problematic, the list should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 16:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (probably) - converting it to characters with clinically-defined phobias seems like a better solution, but even so, I'm not sure it adds much, and feels like indiscriminate collection of information. (For example it includes homophobia, which is not a clinical "phobia", but the common term for disapprobation of same-sex behavior/identity.) But if someone came along with a good proposal for limiting &amp; cleaning it up, I'd consider changing my mind on the value of the article/list. The proposal would need to include (a) defining; (b) weeding / paring; and (c) organizing by disorder, which might actually add some value to wikipedia's phobia articles. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 03:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Look at <a href="http://www.artrocker.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.artrocker.com/" rel="nofollow">the web site</a> -- they have a lot of activity there. As a bi-weekly ditributed by Borders, they probably have a circulation in excess of 200,000 -- way over the notability threshold.
