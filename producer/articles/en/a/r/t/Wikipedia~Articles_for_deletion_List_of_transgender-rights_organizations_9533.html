<p>This isn't so much an article as it is a big list of links. Surely, it's all well and good to have proper articles on various <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> related topics, but I don't see that Wikipedia's mission includes hosting a directory of these groups. Whatever such organizations are verifiable and significant could have their own articles, and there could be a category for these, I have no problems with that. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:40, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> please see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LISTs</a> if you don't understand the purposes of lists, why categories cannot replace lists, and why individual articles cannot replace lists.

<li>I've read it, and I'm aware that lists can do some things that categories cannot. I still think it should be deleted, as it's mostly just external links, and the people editing it obviously <i>want</i> to use it as a list of external links, so I don't see that cleaning it up by removing them would help. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do you think this can actually turn into an article? I'm not even saying a <i>good</i> article, but just <i>an</i> article. It seems to me like any encyclopedic purpose served by this is already covered by <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_social_movements_dccb.html" title="LGBT social movements">LGBT social movements</a> and possibly others. Maybe I just lack imagination, but I can't see this becoming a proper article. If anything, maybe this is a holding place for material that could be worked into a different article? If that's the case, let's unlink it from article space and move it to LGBT social movements/templist or something. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - To my mind, this is exactly the kind of thing that someone could come to Wikipedia looking for. There is no format violation to speak of as far as I can tell but if someone was to put forward a reasonable merge candidate, I'd look at it. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 22:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> â€” I'm very concerned about the process this has undergone. Firstly the article was "speedy" deleted by <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a> without discussion, warning, or listing here. By the rationale given for the above nomination, and the discussion on <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html#Deleted_page" title="User talk:Friday">User talk:Friday#Deleted page</a>, this administrator seems to feel that any "list of..." pages are eligible for speedy deletion. Even just narrowing the objection to "list of X organisations" there's a whole category (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_organizations_2c4a.html" title="Category:Lists of organizations">Category:Lists of organizations</a>) that would have to be deleted, including such articles as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kurdish_organisations_ea30.html" title="List of Kurdish organisations">List of Kurdish organisations</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_veterans%27_organizations.html" title="List of veterans' organizations">List of veterans' organizations</a>, etc. etc. I'm also concerned that Friday suggests there was a consensus for the speedy delete, and that "saying you want to follow a democratic process is, well, quite at odds with how things work here. Afd is not a democracy" (see user talk page). <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 23:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Not sure why you'd say it was deleted without discussion. As I said on my talk page, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_transgender-support_organizations_9744.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of transgender-support organizations">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of transgender-support organizations</a> was about an article nearly identical to this one, and someone mentioned this article as being deletable for the same reasons. I'm also not sure why you're continuing to go on about "process"- since there was a disagreement, I undeleted and brought this to Afd. Is that not exactly what you wanted? Can we use this Afd to talk about the merits of the article and whether or not it should be deleted rather than talking about process? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm "continuing to go on about 'process'" precisely because you don't understand why it's important, and because you say things like "Not sure why you'd say it was deleted without discussion." For an administrator to believe that a speedy deletion consitutes discussion and consensus is very worrying. I encourage you to reread the policy page <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>. I wanted to answer your question, but you are right that this discussion should be focussed on the article. I'll keep further comments on topic. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 00:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you using this as a test case against "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of.html" title="List of">list of</a>..." articles? Because there are well over 100 articles in the sub-category <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_organizations_2c4a.html" title="Category:Lists of organizations">Lists of organizations</a> alone. What is the difference between this and the articles I linked above, or even <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sign_languages.html" title="List of sign languages">list of sign languages</a>? If there is a reason that these pages are less objectionable to you, perhaps we can modify the article.

<dd>Not remotely. Some lists can become decent articles.

<dd>I've now removed all the weblinks, support organisations, and associated dreck, and turned it into a standard list of links to other articles. There should be no excuse for deletiong this now. Trying to delete this on the basis that the "support groups" page was utterly disingenuous - while the other list was full of non-notable grounds with no public profile (and no intention of getting one), many of the groups on this list are well-known and very much deserving of individual articles. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not agree with the statement that the list's purpose could be fulfilled by a prospective category. There are uncountably many instances on Wikipedia where there exist both a list and a category about the exact same subject. I find the list useful and encyclopedic in its current state, I think that it should be maintained and improved, and that it will naturally transform from a list of external links into a list of Wikipedia articles as these organizations get to have their own articles. You should realize that not every single noteworthy organization has an article on Wikipedia yet, and this list also serves the purpose of keeping track of these related organizations until they might be covered by an article and put into a category. I urge you to also check the guideline of direct relation to this discussion: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Perfectly useful list. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:07, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I like how this list and the "support organization" list distinguish between service and advocacy. certainly over time, some of these groups will stand the test of time and have pages in their own right and some will not, but this list has the same red to blue ration I see in many political and geographic articles. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScarykitty_2934.html" title="User:Scarykitty">Scarykitty</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a directory or a repository for links. Additionally, the insane number or redlinks make this a pretty useless list. The main article namespace is not the appropriate place to make a list of articles that one believes should be created. If someone wants that kind of list, they're free to make it within their userspace. While redlinks are sometimes acceptible in lists for the sake of completeness, this list is almost nothing <i>but</i> redlinks. The few that are blue could easily be put into a category (either one that already exists or a new one). --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 00:43, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, which invalidates the above claim that "Wikipedia is not a directory or a repository for links. According to the List guideline, embedded links in the list contents are even recommended, provided they take the user to the appropriate resource. The links needs some attention, but that's a reason to improve it, not delete it. <a href="../../../m/u/g/User%7EMugaliens_0078.html" title="User:Mugaliens">Mugaliens</a> 14:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

Some external links and some redlinks can be useful, but this is a list of nothing but 41 redlinks with 8 bluelinks and 1 external link. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 16:32, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The redlinks and external links are now removed. Additional information has been added. Would you consider changing your vote? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 02:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> internal redlinks to subjects of worth are why lists are <i>good</i>, not a reason to delete the list. The redlinks point out deficiencies in wikipedia, not within the article itself. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 11:57, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and categorise articles. WP:NOT a directory. Lists can occasionally be useful, bit this one is not. If the organisations are not worthy of articles, they're not worthy of noting in a list. If they are worth of articles, there's no point having a navigation list to reach them until they articles exist. Use the article request framework. Sub-categorise to achieve appropriate corss-reference by topic and location. Far more functional than this simple directory list. (I know, WilyD - we don't agree on this one, either.) <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 13:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> with List of transgender-support organizations into List of transgender organizations (or of similar name).
