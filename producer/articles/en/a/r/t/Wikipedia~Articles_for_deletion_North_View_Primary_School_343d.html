<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> BAD FAITH NOMINATION, only created a few days ago! Please allow for organic expansion of the article. I'm sure verification is possible, but as you know, Rome wasn't built in a day. -- <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibrarianofages_593b.html" title="User:Librarianofages">Librarianofages</a> 01:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no need to call it bad faith. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. And whether or not Rome was built in a day isn't very relevant if a school is fundamentally not-notable. Also, while we're at it "organic expansion" is nothing more than a buzzword. Please try to make an actual keep argument. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Although I agree it isn't proper to assume bad faith, I think it's also disingenuous and improper to discount someone else's reasoning out of hand like that. Organic expansion is a perfectly legitimate description of what happens to Wiki articles as they are noticed by users with knowledge of the topic over time. We don't have to have this Wikipedia project wrapped up and finished before finals, you know. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 09:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>May I ask then what the word "organic" adds to the phrases "organic growth" or "organic expansion"? A good sign of something being a buzzphrase is the presence of irrelevant qualifiers. Furthermore, I question the assertion that this an article that even would see any signigicant expansion if we gave it time. Both Kappa and I attempted to expand it and it is still a small stub. This won't be any larger than a stub. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>keep. This school is listed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Singapore_4e88.html" title="List of schools in Singapore">List_of_schools_in_Singapore</a>, a huge and unwieldy article, which would not be an appropriate place to put the additional detail contained here. I expect this article will grow as have many of the others listed there. The achievements shown are notable, and I expect documented notable alumni will be added. I know of no reason why Wikipedia cannot be inclusive of "Encyclopedia of Education", of which Singapore has surprisingly good coverage so far, in my opinion. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I said, the article meets all content policies. Certainly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is among those.

(Nor is it clear that deletion would be a reasonable fix if the article did not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, though in this case that is beside the point.) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 04:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not a directory. Nor is Wikipedia a collection of random information. And as to how to deal with those two issues, what would you propose other than deletion?<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You make reference to two sections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, that A) Wikipedia is not a directory, and B) Wikipedia is not a collection of random information. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> defines these terms as follows: A) Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed. Wikipedia articles are not: 1. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Genealogical entries or phonebook entries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, and <b>3. Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business</b> Now this what is raised as an issue, but WP:NOT defines this as <b>For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable.</b> There is just nothing in this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems relevant to making this particular article improper. B) Next we have <b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b>, which is defined as 1. Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Travel guides. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 3. Memorials. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 4. Instruction manuals. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 5. Internet guides.<b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 6. Textbooks and annotated texts. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 7. Plot summaries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, Again, there is no aspect of this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems applicable in any way to this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is often thrown out as a justification to delete articles, but I agree completely with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> that it simply doesn't apply in this case. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As to the first point, this entry is little more than an address easily in the "phonebook entries" category. As to the second point, it should be apparent that the list there is not intended to be exhaustive. In fact, almost daily, articles are deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "random collection" criterion even if they don't fall into exactly one of those categories. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know what's printed in your phone book, but in mine, phonebook entries look like <b>North View Primary School 123 Main Street 123-456-7890.</b> This article far exceeds what a phonebook entry is, by any reasonable definition of the term. The fact that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "indiscriminate collection" clause is used to mean "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia", and the fact that there are many people who misuse it and get articles deleted, does not make it a valid argument. The examples provided are intended to serve as cardinal prototypes of "indiscriminate collections", and none of them are within miles of this article. How can we meaningfully apply Wikipedia criteria if their clearcut meaning can be changed to mean anything anyone wants it to mean. You don'texcuse bad arguments to keep (e.g. the fact that some similar article was kept doesn't justify retention of this one), why should a bad argument re <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (e.g., other people use it to mean something other than what it says and they delete articles anyway) be acceptable? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Frequently, information that on its own is random can be placed with other relevant information to create a good article. Deletion is rarely the best thing to do with verifiable information; the ideal solution is to present it in a digestible format in its proper context, so that it is accessible to those who will find it useful. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 07:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article as it stands now does not seem to meet the retention standards set by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. However, this is an article that was one of the first created by a brand new user. While it lacks sources (thanks to Kappa and JoshuaZ for taking the time to do some research and make improvements), it does make claims of notability regarding alumni, which I was unable to verify, perhaps as the school is in Singapore. That the article was prod'ed hours barely six hours after the article was created, and then put here on AfD less than 12 hours after that is simply not adequate time to allow a fully formed article to be created. While I have no reason to believe any bad faith was involved, I do not feel that anyways near adequate time was allowed to improve the article or address the prod tag. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abandom AfD</b> This is another instance of the Wikipedia <b>delete, delete delight</b> song. A new user should not be welcomed by this song however bad their article is. Yes, OK, raise a concern on the page, tell them how to address the concerns, and if they don't improve then put an AfD, but with such a new article and new use an AfD notice so soon is simply an abuse of process. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:45, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Carlossuarez46 - come on lets keep this in proportion, most schools have many pets, therefore by your own argument if it is arguable to have an article about one's pet then it clearly is acceptable to have it about numerous pets, and their owners! But seriously, almost all schools should be in Wikipedia in some form or other. There are many advantages to WIkipedia to have them in. Very oftent he writers are new users and therefore the AfD is inappropriate and all in all I don't know why there is so much time wasted trying to get them deleted, it only does the reputation of Wikipedia a great deal of harm! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 19:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article needs time to develop. It already shows that the school competes and even wins in interschool competition.

<p><b>Comment</b> "Bad faith" means, nominated for deletion for some ulterior purpose - i.e., not because I believed the article should be deleted per Wiki policy. If you study the whole history you will see that I put a prod on this article as it is a <i>primary</i> school, generally considered not notable in previous AfD debates. I told the creator of the article on their Talk page that I had put the prod in place, explained why, told them how to remove the prod and asked for them to make clear why the school was notable if they removed the prod. The prod was removed without any further edits to the article. I then brought it to AfD and told the creator I had done so. A lot of effort to go to if I just wanted something deleted for a "bad faith" reason, don't you think. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 22:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have created a new article entitled <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schools_in_Yishun_0ca5.html" title="Schools in Yishun">Schools in Yishun</a> which can be a start toward building an encyclopedic treatment of this and the other weak, directory-style stubs. I believe that the guideline <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> provides reasonable recommendations and I am trying to see them through. To that end, it would be helpful if this article were made into a redirect rather than merely deleted. Very little of the information currently in the article is of encyclopedic interest, other than the fact of its existence. The linked articles, however, do contain some information of general interest regarding Singapore's approach to education. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:26, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or merge per above. "Schools are notable" is a statement of doctrine, not an argument from evidence.
