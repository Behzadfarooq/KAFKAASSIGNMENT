<dd><b>Comment</b> I think this means that <b>the AfD nomination is withdrawn?</b> I agree that the name chosen by Dawkins is slightly unfortunate, but no other reasonable name used by notable commentators has been suggested. I've started a section on the talk page about it and if we can find a name that is used by at least 4 notable commentators and has at least 300 ghits then we can rename the article later - I would not oppose a consensus to rename if it emerges from the talk pages after this AfD (though I would contribute to the debate). But let's close this AfD, with thanks to all contriubtors, and get on with improving the article and others. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 18:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, no - the AfD discussion is not finished. Please do not make all our minds up for us! The original proposer may have changed her mind, and the article has changed substantially during the course of the debate, but there is still a discussion taking place, and we need to agree whether to (a) leave it where it is; or (b) delete it; or (c) turn it back into a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>; or (d) make it a redirect to somewhere else; or (e) keep it but rename it.

<dd>Because the article can't be written without undue weight problems. This analogy used by Dawkins is reported in a couple of sentences and the the rest of the article (several paragraphs and the real point of the article) is used to criticize it.

<dd>Well the article has 4 sections, 3 expound the argument and the 4th has 3 critics and <s>1 supporter</s>2 supporters, so it's pretty much 50:50; and Dawkins thinks it's an <i>argument</i> not an analogy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nice misrepresentation of the article. One section (tiny) is the lead, the second section (tiny) is the background, the third section is an OR synopsis of Dawkins argument <b>taken from a critic of the theory</b>. The biggest section <b>by far</b> is the criticism section. Hardly 50:50. The article as it now stands is just a tag line to hang <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_McGrath_3c9d.html" title="Alister McGrath">Alister McGrath</a>'s new book on. As for the deletion policy - your link does not address POV forks. What it does do is highlight my concerns - is this article capable of an NPOV stance with good authorship and I still say no. It has become a vehicle to reduce <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> to criticism of one particular phrase via an eclectic mix of OR and apologetics and I see no hope that focusing on this one phrase will produce anything else. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 19:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well said, Sophia. This whole article stinks. It's a million miles from an honest attempt at an NPOV encyclopedia article. The whole enterprise is built on spotting an opportunity to indulge in some dishonest Dawkins-bashing. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 22:16, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well in word count it's 37:63 but NPOV does not mean exactly the same number of words for and against: it means reporting fairly and NPOV what notable commentators have said. Other editors can judge for themselves whether "stinks" and "dishonest" are good arguments for deletion or <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDeletion_policy_5007.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="WP:Deletion policy">policy</a> <i>"XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or Neutral Point of View (NPOV) debate is generally an abuse of process, and the article will usually be <b>speedy kept</b>."</i> <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 22:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> One important point you neatly gloss over is <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a>. That is the issue here and your figures confirm the problem - <b>63% of the article is devoted to criticism</b> according to the numbers you have given (ie 26% <i>more</i> attacking the theory than explaining it). Wikilawyer your way out of that one NBeale. This is NOT a content dispute and I resent your attempts to slur honest editors. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 22:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, this is not a protest strategy in a content debate, the problem is that this article <i>can't</i> be presented neutrally. The relevant policy is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#POV_forks" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#POV forks</a>. We might not be right in these concerns, but since this argument has not been mentioned anywhere other than in book reviews of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>, it is a <i>genuine concern</i> that this should be treated in the main article. Claiming that Sophia is abusing the AfD process is therefore an unfounded personal attack. Please recall that when you, NBeale, were concerned with neutrality <a href="../../../e/x/i/Talk%7EExistence_of_God_3007.html#Massimo_Pigliucci_--_deleted_content" title="Talk:Existence of God">here</a>, we didn't accuse you of trying to suppress information, so let's continue this debate assuming good faith... on both sides of course.

<dd>Thanks for pointing out the POV fork policy. Seems perfectly clear from reading this that this article is <i>not</i> a POV fork. The balance of the article fairly reflects published sources: if you can find futher notable published sources that support the argument please add them (disputes about 63:27 balance seem to be disputes about content to me). But I don't think further responses from me here are helpful.

<dd>The article is a substantial reworking of the original article providing thoroughly reliable and verifiable sources addressing the Ultimate Boeing 747 argument as an integral argument separate and apart from the book. The result of the previous AfD is irrelevant and the vote here is meaningless without referencing the article as it exists.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The orginal article was arguably premature in that <i>at the time</i> the only notable reference to this argument was in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>. However since then we have seen four notable commentators address this argument. <b>This new article is carefully refed and quite different from the old one</b>. Although 3 of the commentators criticise the argument and only one defends it, this is an accurate reflection of the critical debate and the article itself takes no POV on which commentators are right. If course the article can be improved but it is way above the notability threshold IMHO. And there is too much material to incorporate into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> article which is already a bit long. FWIW I am the original author of the article, but the need for it was identifed by another Editor who put in a WikiLink from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> 13 days before I created the article. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 22:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is an article which, in one form or another, has been around for quite some time, and it's well worth having an article on the subject. Even as is, it contains enough info and is notable enough to justify its own article - this is probably Dawkins' favourite argument, in TGD and elsewhere, and also something that has been responded to by a number of other people.</s> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheologyJohn_ded0.html" title="User:TheologyJohn">TJ</a> 22:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>True, but the current title is very restrictive and TGD specific. Dawkins has an essay from 1998 entitled <a href="http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1998-sumimprobabilityofgod.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1998-sumimprobabilityofgod.shtml" rel="nofollow">"The Improbability of God"</a>, and some title along such lines would be more appropriate if we want an article on the underlying argument. The only advantage of this current title is that we have a nice image of an aeroplane with a caption highly suitable for an uncyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 23:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Dawkins' argument is <i>not notable enough</i> on its own, neither is Dawkins a philosopher, so we can't expect to extract a logical outline of the argument from a popular text like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a> without some serious original research, and I don't think it is NPOV to use an outline proposed by a critic.

<li><b>Change vote to Rename</b> - I like the "improbability of God" suggestion, it would enable one to look at the argument itself - which is significant - in its broader historical context, would be a good way of arranging material, and would be very helpful. Am trying to work out how to strikethrough my previous vote. Thanks, Merzul. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheologyJohn_ded0.html" title="User:TheologyJohn">TJ</a> 00:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for considering it, now another thing that requires consideration would be the actual title. "Improbability of God" is maybe slightly POV. That's certainly the title of Dawkins' essay and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Martin_28be.html" title="Michael Martin">Michael Martin</a>'s book, but perhaps we can think of a more neutral title... And Sophia, note that the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_God_57c6.html" title="Existence of God">existence of God</a> and most arguments we cover with individual articles aren't quite like this. The <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_poor_design.html" title="Argument from poor design">argument from poor design</a> is highly related, but seems more of an "impossibility of God" type argument. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 00:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>Yes, in essence what the Stenger link has in it is almost a full list of articles for this set of improbability hypothesis examples. We do not really have each of these very well documented as nicely as the current '747 article in Wikipedia (POV aside). That the '747 article today appeals to some people need not mean that tomorrow the article will have the same appeal. So it may end up more ironic than sarcastic if you consider what could be planned for the future using '747 as the catalyst for change ends up not being congruent to the essence of my reply. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 14:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>
