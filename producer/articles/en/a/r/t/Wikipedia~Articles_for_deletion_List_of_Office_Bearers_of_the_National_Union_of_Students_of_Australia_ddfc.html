<li><b>Keep</b> Individually many of the people may be non-notable (although a substantial number are notable, including 4 Members of Parliament and other prominent political figures), but the list as a whole is notable, as these are elected officials of a student body which has its own article. Furthermore, there are articles related to the various factions and student bodies, and this provides context as to how much of a role those student associations and factions have in NUS. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 05:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b> It's also information which, while not being made up, can't be found anywhere else.

<li>I would argue for <b>Keep</b> as it seems to be more significant than many other articles on the site and while many of the past office bearers are not notable now, it is only a matter of time before more are notable (although, speaking as one of the people mentioned in the article, I doubt I will be one of them) and Wikipedia will be seen as having anticipated their rise to power. --<a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">Roisterer</a> 08:29, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is of interest to plenty of people - it's particularly informative about the early careers of the quite a few people who have gone on to achieve significant success afterwards. It's also very definite in size - as the NUS has only existed since the late 1980s, it's nearly complete as-is. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:40, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been thinking about this a bit since this discussion started. I understand people's concerns about this not being encyclopedic, and it is true that this list isn't. So it's alright that it gets deleted from Wikipedia. However, I've found that it's been very successful in getting people to add extra information which would never otherwise be compiled, and I attribute that to it being posted on a Wiki. So I was wondering if people have a recommendation for another Wiki that could be a useful host for such a list, so I can continue to work on adding to it? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 11:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I won't take it elsewhere unless it gets deleted. I was just trying to find a way that I can still work on it in Wiki form if Wikipedia won't have it. But yes, I'd much rather do it within the Wikipedia project. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 06:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's always a subpage in your user space, which people can still freely edit... i.e., something like User:Braue/NUSA Officers. I don't see any harm in keeping this there, as long as you don't link any articles <i>to</i> there (<i>from</i> is all right), or have any free use pictures there. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 06:58, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>What on earth is the point of deleting a page which is likely to be a helpful reference source for a number of articles on very notable people, as well as an interesting read in its own right? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:14, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It's perfectly encyclopedic, and quite interesting. It's highly verifiable, as most of these people have received press coverage within their terms and since, and in terms of the national officebearers, quite a lot of press coverage. Quite a few of these people have gone on to notable success (particularly as MPs). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:34, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability is not a deletion criterion. The article asserts its importance and its content is verifiable. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-02-12 10:17</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Standard practice on Wikipedia is to permit long lists of such data today. The information in this page is effectively a part of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia_3eda.html" title="National Union of Students of Australia">National_Union_of_Students_of_Australia</a>. Were the article not to be kept the correct solution would be to merge the content into that article. However, if it were merged someone would just unmerge it right away due to the length. The long term maintance issues of such lists may someday result in their removal, but that isn't our practice today... and one by one AFD discussions isn't the right way to change the project's practices. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 10:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
