<li><b>Comment</b>. With every single one of the articles listed in the September 21 mass-nomination of elementary and middle school articles now closed as a no consensus keep, the success rate of school deletion listings has dropped from its previous low of 13% earlier in September to 11% now. And from now on nobody on Wikipedia will regard elementary school deletions as a pushover. So far for September, one school article has been deleted for 49 kept. The deleted article was a hoax. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:19, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it may almost be time to re-open a wide-ranging debate about Policy. Given the survival of almost all schools at the AfD process, the chronic nomination of schools (particularly mass-nominations) is steering very close to <i>disruptive</i> behavior, going forward. I think the question needs to be put to those that do not believe schools to be notable institutions in their own right, how many elementary schools have to survive the AfD process in order to establish a "rough concensus" that school articles (and stubs) should not be deleted? I'm not merely asking this rhetorically, but how many AfD votes that do not result in article deletion are necessary to establish "rough concensus" to "not delete" (as opposed to a concensus to "keep")? An honest and open debate on that question will soon need to begin, in order to end the abuse of AfD with multi and mass-nominations of school stub articles that will doubtless survive the AfD process. The issue is not whether schools should be debated on "their own merits" but whether or not "elementary schools are non-notable" is a legitimate reason to nominate an article (or 21 of them in one day) for AfD. If a policy can established on that question, then we could actually debate each school on it's merits as an article.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 15:41, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"elementary schools are non-notable" is not a valid reason to put one on AfD, but "<b>this</b> elementary schools is non-notable" is a good reason. However, it's impossible to actually do this at the moment, because of the large "schools are notable by definition" movement. It is clear that the continuing nominations of NN schools for AfD indicate a sizable minority of Wikipedians disagree with the premise that schools are inherently notable. A middle ground is required - as has already been suggested, a page with a table of schools in a particular district (and other misc. info like roll size, founding date, etc.), and any notable schools can be linked to from their entry on that table.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 23:25, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>In grave danger?</i> This has already happened, even if some haven't caught on yet. Because WP embraces consensus (and keeps by default unless ~70% favor deletion), and because enough committed editors care about these articles (claiming schools are public institutions, and ipso facto, notable), these articles will almost always stay. NB: I don't care, really; I don't know whether I think schools are notable, but I understand that enough people do such that a decision has effectively already been taken. Soon enough, indifferent editors like me will understand the same, and this rough keep consensus will become policy. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:41, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problems with a broad "keep articles on schools" policy is the inevitable extension to encompass primary schools, kindergardens, creches, technical schools, military schools, vocational colleges, language schools, art schools, schools for the gifted (and not so gifted) and other innumerable variations of organised education. I would personally prefer each article to be debated on its own merits, which happens for just about everything else. A quick look at the comments on this page suggests that I'm not alone here (although I am outnumbered)&#160;:)--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 09:38, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think the fear of extension to kindergartens and language schools is exaggerated. I don't see why you want to debate every single article on wikipedia "on its merits", there are far too many new articles to do that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 12:48, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Over the past year the argument has shifted from just keeping all secondary schools, to now keeping primary schools as well- I fail to see why this trend will not continue. The problem with school article votes is that there a lot of people who believe schools are always notable simply for being a school. A minority of the people who bother voting on these articles believe that school articles should demonstrate notability in the same way bands, websites, etc have to (i.e. they should be more notable than the average). This is yet another average school, so <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutter_c4c0.html" title="User:Grutter">G Rutter</a> 20:37, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, we now have a majority who think elementary schools are always notable for being elementary schools. Perhaps kindergardens might be a bit of a stretch, but the point regarding "definition creep" is still valid. We debate every other AfD entry on merit, it seems odd to exclude schools from this process.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 00:12, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Kappa, you have not been here long enough to remember when even high schools had to meet notability criteria. At that time, those who expressed concerns that elementary schools would be next on the list if high schools were granted automatic right-to-exist status were pooh-poohed. Look, however, at the last spate of AfD nominations, and the comments made by users such as yourself. I will not be surprised at all when arguments begin to be made for the automatic inclusion of kindergartens and daycares, on the sole ground that they are "inherently notable". This is what I fight. I have no objection whatever to articles on genuinely notable schools. I would have no objection to an article on a genuinely notable daycare or kindergarten either. At the same time, I oppose the blanket inclusion of any public institution. And yes, if I had my druthers, battleships, Simpsons episodes, and baseball playeres would all have to meet entry criteria as well. It is, however, a disingenuous argument that just because they are currently immune from AfD, so too should something else be. (Oh, and trust me, pokemon characters are not all sacrosanct. I've happily seen a few go into the furnace recently.) <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I feel motivated to speak in Kappa's defense here. Kate's tool says he has been here since Sept. 2004, and that you've only been here eight months longer, Denni. No offense, but I do believe it's natural and expected for consensus to evolve, and I think its a bit irrelevant to refer to an older state of affairs that apparently existed 21 months ago, but had dissolved as early as 13 months ago, as if it were of precedential value. On a related note, it seems to me that the "rump" of opposition that continues to fight high schools only serves to promote other schools. Those who oppose schools rarely make any distinction among grade-levels, so why should their adversaries. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:47, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, but I think Kappa is perfectly capable of speaking in his own defense if he chooses to. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:51, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks Xolox well put. As I said, I think the fears of people claiming daycares to be "inherently notable" are exaggerated, but the most likely way to create such people is by continually attacking educational institutions as non-notable. The idea that consensus should be torn up on baseball players, Simpsons episodes etc, seems an incredibly retrograde step, exposing every editor who would try to improve such articles to a semi-random threat of deletion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you keep saying "non-notable, delete" about things that people think should be kept, it will reduce the amount of notability they demand from any topic. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If <i>you</i> keep saying "notable, keep" about things that people think should be deleted, it will increase the amount of notability they demand from any topic. Nobody wins, and Wikipedia loses. I think consensus is transient and relative to a particular article - to try and extend it to a <i>class</i> of articles results in the current problem. Not all schools (or Pokemon) are created equal.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 05:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you agree that consensus <i>is</i> "inconsistent" and "arbitrary", how can you then state that there exists consensus on school articles?? *confused*--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 01:02, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Consensus on a class of articles is more consistent and less arbitrary than semi-random decisions on each one.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps a worthwhile mental exercise when considering AfDs relating to institutions is to imagine the subject as a person. In this case, we would have "St Anne's School is a teacher who lives in Seattle. She is five foot four, has brown hair and blue eyes <i>(this is the equivalent of the data on the school's ethnic makeup)</i>. She thinks she's a very good teacher." Would that be notable? The fact that the school is a few thousand times bigger than a person makes no odds - zero notability multiplied by a thousand equals zero notability. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:28, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I'm not so much trying to argue notability or lack of, but suggesting a different approach: the question of whether these articles contain any encyclopaedic information. Ethnicity data for a school or an American county may look impressive, but without some kind of "value-added" it's no more useful than someone's eye colour. And my other argument stands: if an entity consists of several thousand people, it means nothing if they're all non-notable. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 16:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>As far as I'm concerned ethnicity data for an American country or a school adds a great deal of value. It tells me a lot more about a person or community than eye color does. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why? It's raw data, with absolutely no value. "The high proportion of Hispanics in this school/county has created ethnic tension" or "His blue eyes secured him the role of Inspector Knacker in Crime Drama X" are useful information, but this is completely absent in this case. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:13, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
