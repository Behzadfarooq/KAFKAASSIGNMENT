<dd>Muntuwandi, I would say that it is not sacred, but Zetawoof was expressing another legitimate concern about perceived plagerism as my first rewrite was substantialy based on only one source.

<dd>The information isn't "sacred" - the issue is that the phrasing of the introduction (particularly the emphasis on Évora as a "barefoot diva") is heavily derivative - the original revision was practically a paraphrasing of the source. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 10:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My bad - I misread the three interviews "Interview with D.Kay" to mean D.Kay was the interviewer as opposed to interviewee. At the request of the entry's author, OriginalJunglist, I've since looked at this entry more closely, and I'm now on the fence. It looks like their CDs aren't on a major label - am I right, are they a band whose CDs are self-released? If so, I'd still be inclined towards Delete, but until I know for sure, I'm going to withdraw my vote.TruthGal 17:41, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It's generally unfair to use the major label criterion to claim a dance music act are non-notable. The majority of dance music is typically released on vinyl, which major labels rarely touch with a bargepole so most dance acts tend to release on smaller independent labels. As they have been repeatedly covered in mainstream music magazines, I'd say they are notable. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 18:48, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Subject of numerous articles is sufficient. I don't care if they are on a major label or not - and neither should you. Will we hold independent films to the same standard?

<li>All notable "independent" films ultimately secure deals with major studios for distribution rights. Else they wouldn't get into theaters, and we'd never be able to see them.TruthGal 06:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let's avoid the word "notable" as I assume you're using it in the Wiki-sense, which makes your argument self-fulfilling. About your point though - you're incorrect. I live in Atlanta and have the opportunity (as does anybody living in a large city) to see films that have not secured deals with "major studios." A film, song, group or individual could be encyclopedic in nature without the benefit of a major studio / major label / major fill-in-the-blank. The desire for homogenization is not universal. There are those who prefer coffee that isn't from Starbucks and pasta that isn't from The Olive Garden. There are also those that listen to music played only on the college radio stations and go to films shown at art houses in only a few cities at a time. I'm not comfortable with the notion that a select group of "majors" determines "notability." Drew30319 03:28, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't mean to get into a pissing contest with you, Drew, but I work in the film industry. It's basically a cartel - a half dozen conglomerates own and control everything. That "indie" film you saw at the art house? It was distributed by one of the major film studios (though sometimes under a subsidiary company name). For example, here are some current "indie" films and their major studio distributors: Little Children/NewLine, Notes On A Scandal/Fox, Volver/Sony, Curse of the Golden Flower (Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia)/Sony. Even Derecho De Familia - released under the IFC First Look banner... is part of a conglomorate - IFC is owned by Cablevision, a company which has a market capitalization of 8 billion dollars (not very "independent"!). Name a indie film playing at your local cinema (though not Lefont Garden, because the theater conglomorates pushed that great art house out of business), and I'll tell ya the giant evil company that's distributing it. By the way, I think this is fact is at best lamentable and at worst detestable, but it's the economics of the business. Getting a film into theaters is expensive and ultimately must be bankrolled by a giant corporation. Hopefully, digital films will change all that. Anyway, I long ago had retracted my Delete on this entry. I figured as an Ani DiFranco fan, I'd give Ill.Skillz the benefit of the doubt. (Although Ani's Righteous Babe Records actually has a distribution deal with music conglomerate Koch Entertainment, recently purchased by Entertainment One (the #1 wholeseller of CD and DVD in Canada) for 80 million dollars. Sigh.) TruthGal 08:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I was looking on the web for references to this group and hit an interesting coincidence; there is a hip hop dance group called 'III Skillz' that was formed by Carlos Taguba and which has toured North America (see <a href="http://www.20adosavecbrio.ca/en/Awards/Top%2020%20Recipient%20Bio%20and%20with%20Picture.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.20adosavecbrio.ca/en/Awards/Top%2020%20Recipient%20Bio%20and%20with%20Picture.pdf" rel="nofollow">this PDF link</a>). This would certainly seem to be a different group but an interesting coincidence. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 02:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>question</b> Is it true that the three interviews that appear pivotal to notability of the band are all associated with blogs or am I misinterpreting the interviewing organizations (these would be Play.FM, DNB Forum and DrumAndBaseArena)? If they are blogs, then would they, in fact, qualify as "non-trivial published works" if the blogs were not themselves considered notable? I'm just exploring this with some questions as I know that the 'notability' of blog postings is a hot topic of discussion and we are in a transition time where we don't want to dismiss out of hand an emerging medium. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 02:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd definitely wouldn't use DNB Forum as a measuring stick for notability. The other two seem to be well established sites, not blogs as such. It's a bit of a tricky one, as in recent years many music magazines have stopped publishing, arguably due to the growing coverage of music online. Ill Skillz have also been covered in Knowledge magazine and Mixmag, both of which are relatively mainstream magazines covering dance music. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 02:56, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, when you have a moment, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> might be worth a read. It is possible that someone might come to AfD first. Perhaps they've edited for years anonymously and only today felt the need to create an account. Who can tell? Not me, my mind-reading powers are woefully unreliable. Since you are able to read minds, is this Bwithh's sockpuppet? MER-C's? Naconkontari's? Mine? Sockpuppetry is rarely a serious matter. If EnabledDanger were a sockpuppet account, there would be no reason for the owner not to use it to vote in XfDs, just so long as they didn't vote twice. Having <i>your</i> article deleted from Wikipedia isn't life-threatening, or even painful. Ms Alexander will be doing her stuff on cable TV whether this article is deleted or not.

<li>You are politely digressing from the point, and asserting claims of clairvoyance which I never made. I suggested it was suspicious, and voting in AfD with sockpuppets is a serious offense if it represnts a 2nd vote. Whether the subject’s career and life will go on is irrelevant, the point is applying the notability standards evenly despite the personal likes and dislikes.</li>
<li>This is not “my” article. I came here as part of the AfD process. I’ve never heard of Hoopz nor watched the VH1 channel. I became involved in the discussion because I think the nomination write-up is abysmal and the arguments supporting deletion are weak.

<dd>I don't really see anything worth merging--it isn't THAT common of a format &amp; I'm unaware of any programs that could process .tar.*.gpg in a single step. Explaining .tar.(bz2|gz|Z) is reasonable--they're more common and gnu tar has hooks for gzip/bzip2/compress, but not for gpg.</dd>
<dd>I guess that, if the consensus is to merge, a merge to tar might make some sense. But where would it stop? Would we include .tar.gz.uue? How about .tar.gz.gpg.uue (or at lest .tar.gz.asc)? --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 18:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>There are several schools, all in Quebec, Canada. There's also some stuff in Alberta, Canada too, if I recall correctly.

It has distinct parameters (someone who is notable <i>solely</i> for their illness) and could have some encyclopedic value (say, somebody was looking for info on Terri Schiavo and wanted to know if there were other people whose only notability was illness... or something like that.

In other words, if we chose to delete this article, we would need to delete more than 100 other lists of people who share a peculiarity among themselves. One of the funniest is a dead-serious List of people who died in the bathroom.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is not unserious, and could be made encyclopedic by converting it to an annotated list (the annotations would provide context and support notability). I also disagree with the requirement in the lead section that the article exist, because adding list entries could identify articles for creation. I don't think a table is necessary, as the date of death is not relevant to the list (and could be found in the article). It also may be more appropriate to change the name to "people who became famous through illness" and expand it to cover terminal and non-terminal cases.<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 13:27, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Probably an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate list of information</a>, but that argument aside, fundamentally requires unacceptable POV determinations. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> does not provide the tools for editors to determine whether a terminally ill person became "famous" as a result of their illness or accessory to it, nor does it empower a determination of what "famous" entails for these purposes. The latter could be somewhat mitigated by renaming the list to "...notable...", but that is a poor solution that would allow the inclusion requirements to change if and when <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is revised further and that does nothing about the editorial determination issues regarding the cause of fame/notability. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 14:05, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the first, which section of WP:NOT do you contend this list violates? For the latter, I don't see that as much of a problem in terms of NPOV, or if it is a problem, is no more of a problem than any other determination about whether a person is famous/notable. The condition of terminal illness, I think doesn't have any question of NPOV, so the only question is would we have an article about them if they had not been terminally ill? I think that except for rare cases we wouldn't, and if the illness came before their notability, then they'd go on the list. As such, I just don't see the NPOV problem. Could you explain why it's a problem? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:32, 25 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the NPOV issue, the article fundamentally requires an editor to make a decision that cannot be supported from sources: "would we have an article about them if they had not been terminally ill". Our notability standards are ill-equipped to allow editors to decide <i>why</i> someone is notable, only <i>whether</i> they are notable. Complicating the issue is the current (although apparently lax) requirement that the subject have "an article in WP to link to", which does not <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoid self reference</a>. Concerns I have with the list include a number of people who may not meet the inclusion requirements: <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunny_von_B%C3%BClow_a8ff.html" title="Sunny von Bülow">Sunny von Bülow</a> (possible notability as a socialite/philanthropist before illness), <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Clark_9f53.html" title="Barney Clark">Barney Clark</a> (notability concerns, has no article), <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Cruzan_a7be.html" title="Nancy Cruzan">Nancy Cruzan</a> (injury, not illness), <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenifer_Estess_bb63.html" title="Jenifer Estess">Jenifer Estess</a> (no idea who this is, no article), <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Ann_Quinlan_c4a9.html" title="Karen Ann Quinlan">Karen Ann Quinlan</a> (uncertain if unexplained <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistent_vegetative_state.html" title="Persistent vegetative state">PVS</a> qualifies as "terminal illness"), <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Shiavo_675e.html" title="Terri Shiavo">Terri Shiavo</a> (uncertain if unexplained <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistent_vegetative_state.html" title="Persistent vegetative state">PVS</a> qualifies as "terminal illness"), . Several others are notable because of actions they took after their illness; they are known for those actions, not the illness itself. The inclusion criteria are unclear as to whether this is meant to qualify (is someone who writes a book about their illness notable because of their illness, or because they are a successful author?): <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heather_Crowe_1c89.html" title="Heather Crowe">Heather Crowe</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_service_announcement.html" title="Public service announcement">PSAs</a>), <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Fox_543c.html" title="Terry Fox">Terry Fox</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_of_Hope_3661.html" title="Marathon of Hope">Marathon of Hope</a>), <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Gertz_834f.html" title="Alison Gertz">Alison Gertz</a> (activism), <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Glaser_2f30.html" title="Elizabeth Glaser">Elizabeth Glaser</a> (activist, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_Democratic_National_Convention_c914.html" title="1992 Democratic National Convention">DNC</a> speaker), <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirsty_Howard_29d3.html" title="Kirsty Howard">Kirsty Howard</a> (activism), <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrie_Schwartz_58a6.html" title="Morrie Schwartz">Morrie Schwartz</a> (author), <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattie_Stepanek_5c7c.html" title="Mattie Stepanek">Mattie Stepanek</a> (poet). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 23:00, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just don't see the first as a problem, or if it is, it's a problem that is endemic to all notability decisions. At some point, someone is making a determination that X is important, while Y is not. Recognizing that in some cases it is because the person had a terminal illness should be no more difficult to determine than whether they are an author, a singer, or left-handed. Still, I suppose this list could be titled differently to say "List of people with a terminal illness" (or possibly "terminal condition", given the PVS concerns) with a section for folks who didn't have any other claim to fame, so to speak. That would probably be preferable to me actually, since it would include more information. The Lou Gehrigs and Steven Hawkings of the world. So if that option will satisfy you, I'd be glad to endorse it. The list already says such people shouldn't be on it. As for your questions, Barney Clark would be the first man to receive a Jarvik artificial heart(mention on the Jarvik article would cover him), and Jenifer Estess refers to the woman this <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287503/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287503/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> movie is about. So I'd say she'd qualify as notable, or at least the movie would. Probably does need an article at some point. I don't know for sure about people writing books, but if their books are primarily about their illness (in constrast to say Hawking who writes about physics), I'd vote for placement on the list. Perhaps in a specific section for them too. But in any case, the inclusion of anybody on this list that doesn't belong is a clean-up issue though, not so much of a deletion one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per the "indiscriminate list" clause of WP:NOT.

<li><b>Keep</b> - a not unexpected vote perhaps, given that I originally created the page. To respond to some of the points above:
<ul>
<li>Could those editors who believe that this list is unencyclopaedic explain why they believe this to be the case? If you mean "not the kind of thing that would be found in a traditional paper encyclopaedia" then I agree, but I assume you are familiar enough with Wikipedia to know that that's not what unencyclopaedic means in this context. I'm hoping you aren't merely using unencyclopaedic as a synonym for quirky, as it's well-established that quirkiness alone is not a sufficient reason for deleting articles.</li>
<li>In respect of the objections to "famous" - you have a good point here. I think this can be dealt with easily though - if this list is restricted to people who are notable enough to deserve an article, and use the wiki process to determine who those are, we have a workable lower threshold. I've no objection to a rename either.</li>
<li>Editors who are suggesting that this list should be deleted per the indicriminate collection clause of WP:NOT are falling into a common trap. Please read that section of WP:NOT - it lists eight categories of article that should be deleted, that's all. This is not one of those eight, unless I'm missing something?</li>
<li>Serpent's Choice - I don't feel you are interpreting NPOV correctly. NPOV is about ensuring that what we say is presented in a neutral way. It's not intended as a filter for editorial decisions - that is quite rightly the domain of the collective judgment of editors and the wiki process. A judgment about whether to include an item of information in an article can only ever be a judgment, and in that pure sense is therefore a breach of POV, but if we accept that reasoning, then nothing in Wikipedia is NPOV, as for every fact included, someone somewhere will have made a decision to include it based on an opinion.</li>
<li>Fabhcún - re: "it makes it seem as if these people used there illness as a platform for fame" - can you expand on this please - What is is about the list that creates this impression? Is this your reason for supporting deletion? If so, I think we can explore less drastic options.</li>
<li>Personally, I feel that the list is a pretty clear-cut inclusion-worthy entry. Kicking222 gets things spot-on, I feel. A principal reason why we have lists and categories here (rather than being <i>solely</i> a collection of articles) is to enable readers of an article on a topic to find other topics with similar characteristics. To those proposing deletion, I would ask - how would a reader of an article about a person whose "notability" is solely due to their terminal illness be able to find articles on other such people if this list was deleted? Alternatively, if you feel that a reader wanting to do that would be making an invalid use of the site, I feel the onus is on you to show that that is the case.</li>

<li>Hi Sandy. Please could you explain why you believe this to be unencyclopaedic and worthless, and why you feel that the lack of sources and varying levels of notability are deletion issues rather than a cleanup issues. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 19:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Some good points made by some of the above contributions (though I wish some folk would read the essay <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> before commenting). Its current unsourced and rather primitive form make it hard to support – its editors would have had more chance if it had been well sourced from the start. I feel it has unsolvable problems with its entry criteria. The "becoming famous through" part is tricky and borderline. I'd have prefered "notable" rather than "famous" since it is much less loaded. And then there is the definition of "terminal illness". There are so many conditions that may or may not be terminal (AIDS, cancer) and many that will be terminal should the person not die of something else first (if you know what I mean) like prostate cancer or serious heart disease. There is too little to connect these people together to make a list like this a useful study tool IMO. Most of the people are also borderline notable. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 18:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Colin, some good points from you too. I disagree with your final piece of reasoning though, about the list's lack of cohesiveness. People with articles at Wikipedia are notable for a wide variety of reasons, and for every other reason (people who are notable through acting, through political leadership, through sporting prowess etc), we have lists, so a list of people whose notability is due to their having an illness is surely also worth keeping, isn't it, otherwise how does one find these people? Do you feel that nothing is salvageable from the list if it is deleted? If we developed the list into a "list of people whose notability is a direct result of their having a terminal illness", and sorted out the sourcing problem, what would your view be then please? <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 19:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unlike the "terminally ill" list, which is also under discussion, this list is ill-defined, as others have noted. What is a celebrity? What constitutes an incident? In a broad sense, even a heart attack constitutes an incident, and (unfortunately) that path to demise afflicts even the best among us. So this list is undefinable and thus unacceptable. <a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.98.212.144.html" title="User:129.98.212.144">129.98.212.144</a> 05:30, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>keep</b> - as the notability of the mural is not questioned in this particular AfD (the only argument for deletion that applies to both is the number of Google hits, which is not a valid argument for keeping or deleting anything), the real decision seems to be whether to merge or not, which AfD does not govern. Editors are free to pursue that if they wish as normal, or to make a joint AfD nomination for both articles which does question the notability of the mural. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep &amp; Cleanup</b></s> <b>Keep unless Merged</b> This may be a situation where the whole story is greater than the sum of the parts. Individually the mural and the man are not clearly notable though interesting, but the combination of the two and the circumstances of his artistry and death during El Alamein are to me a fascinating and notable story. Applying the notability guidelines requires some good judgment -- this will be a great story in 100 years, when many of our current "notables" will be irrelevant.</li>

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Ah, the joys of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Wikipedia%7ERandom_page_patrol_a2ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Random page patrol">Wikipedia:Random_page_patrol</a> in turning up such nuggets (end plug). See the Votes for Deletion discussion on this 1985 porno flick from way waaay back in February 2004<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:It%27s_My_Body" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:It%27s_My_Body" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, which revolved around whether Wikipedia is or is not "Pornopedia" (plus some confusion about how to go about verifying the article) and ended in an apparent keep consensus. But let's get back to today and also the nascent guidelines on film notability<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28films%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28films%29" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. How is this film encyclopedically notable? Well, there is a claim that at the time of its international release it was controversial and banned in several countries with significant press coverage (it's not clear why this film in particular is supposed to have been so much more controversial (the underwear sucking? the orgy scene?) than the 1000s of other porn films around). I can't find sources to confirm the controversy. There are 2 hits in the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news database for this title - news stories from July 1986 about the revelation that Traci Lords was underage in a number of films, including this one (which gets a very passing mention). Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for claims of encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:31, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Neutral</b>. Although I'm typically inclined to delete adult films, as very few of the thousands of them have any features at all that cna remotely assert notability (or even differentiation from the pack), this appears to have two factors in its favor. First, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traci_Lords_8a29.html" title="Traci Lords">Traci Lords</a> is not a random adult performer, but one of the most recognized names in the recent industry, in part due to the controversy around her age (which is itself germane to this article) and in part because she made a successful transition to mainstream acting. Furthermore, if this movie did indeed generate sufficient controversy to be banned in parts of Europe (other than where its content would generate an auto-ban, as in the UK), that would contribute to notability as well. I cannot imagine that very many adult films could offer <i>more</i> claim to notability without <i>Deep Throat</i> and the handful of others that have reached universal recognition. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 22:15, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article has been around since Feb 2004 (and received significant editor attention in a VfD), so that's ample time for refs supporting the special controversy/ban claim to show up - but they haven't, and a Factiva news database sweep showed nothing except the underage issue which would cover all the films Traci Lords made before the age of 18, not just this one in particular.<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hadn't noticed this article had been around that long. Assuming that there really was public debate in Belgium and a newspaper article in Turkey, I'd stand by my comment, but I can't find them either, so I'll just back out of the discussion. Perhaps a means to address the underage issue is to expand the list in the Traci Lords article to mention all such films, without then requiring articles for each of them (barring other notability issues; her first such movie probably counts?). I know the Italian WP contains a comprehensive list that could be adapted to that purpose. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 23:07, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable biography with little potential for expansion. Computer chess is an interesting field of research, but Nalimov is only a footnote. It is difficult to accurately assess the importance of Nalimov <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablebase.html" title="Tablebase">tablebases</a> to chess computing in general, as the format is likely to become an intermediary to some greater solution. The only posited proof of notability, the <a href="../../../c/h/e/ChessBase_ebc6.html" title="ChessBase">ChessBase</a> award, is more of a symbollic gesture offered by a small company to up-and-coming enthusiast researchers. It is not a notable award in the chess world and it is not granted by a major chess publication. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 07:45, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> per nom; the only question I had was to the notability of the ChessBase award, and based on the nominator and what I can find on it online, its notability appears weak in terms of granting notability to the subject of this article. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 23:23, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. ChessBase is probably the most important maker of chess programs (their <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_%28chess%29.html" title="Fritz (chess)">Fritz (chess)</a> played with the World Champion Kramnik recently, and won) and chess databases.

<li><b>Keep</b> Since we have a dispute between the nominator and Ioannes Pragensis as to the notability of the award in question, and assuming that each assertion is made in good faith, why not risk error on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion. The rest of the nomination criteria seems to be based on primary research or subjective opinions of the nominator niether of which is a valid argument in the Wikipedia world. In reading through many google hits, it seems that Nalimov is a chess celebrity and this is not a vanity article. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 06:56, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A page about a living "New York based Artist", whose rather unusual name gets just 34 hits at Google, most of which turn out to be for a presumably unrelated Hawaii-based psychiatrist. The article is modestly written (the capital "A" in artist is probably just a typo) and of course <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability (people)</a> is a mere guideline (as is the possibly relevant <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">WP:AUTO</a>), "Notability (people)" does talk of <i>Painters, sculptors, ... whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</i> and I see no evidence of this here. I suggest waiting till Giannasio makes a slightly bigger impact. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>I nominate the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_perspectives_on_dinosaurs.html" title="Religious perspectives on dinosaurs">Religious perspectives on dinosaurs</a> article for deletion for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first section mentions how this issue is inextricably intertwined with evolution; really, this article is simply a part of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> and is largely covered there.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs in the Bible is not that important; it isn't very prominent, and seems to simply be a duplicate of rather unreliable stuff from the Behemoth article.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs according to the metaphorical take on various scriptures doesen't really say anything at all and is totally unsourced.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs in Young Earth Creationism is already covered in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_Creationism_a76b.html" title="Young Earth Creationism">Young Earth Creationism</a> and this section adds nothing not said there.</li>
<li>Earth created with age's only source is a site criticizing the viewpoint, and again, is covered by various <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> articles.</li>
<li>Jehovah's Witnesses section is already covered in Beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, and again, is simply an outgrowth of rejection of evolution – they believe dinosaurs are ancient, they simply don't believe in evolution, and I'm not sure if this is independently notable.</li>
<li>This page is essentially fundamentalist Christian perspectives on dinosaurs, and no one has added any other religious perspectives to the article even months after a call for them to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this article IS deleted, being a subarticle of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article, some of it would need to go into that article. I think a simple mention that the antiquity of dinosaurs is rejected by young earth creationists, and those who reject evolution don't believe in the notion that dinosaurs are the ancestors of modern species. As this is basically all the article says anyway, and we can simply link to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and/or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> in the section, I don't see any reason not to do this. It is not very important to the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article, and as it is sufficiently covered by <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> and related articles I see no need for this article, as it isn't really notable in and of itself. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 10:53, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> So I'll comment, since I created the article originally, and since I've been one of the core editors on the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article since January 2006. Basically, there were around two years of constant tussling over the presence and nature of a religious views paragraph in the main article on Dinosaurs (check that article's talk archives to see what I mean). Relocating the content to the Religious Perspectives article was a compromise solution, and one that has almost entirely prevented subsequent conflict in the parent article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Would I personally prefer that "religious perspectives on dinosaurs" not be a topic covered by Wikipedia? Surely; I also personally think that being overly inclusive is not a useful exercise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However... the presence of this article has contributed in a significant and very positive way to the quality of the parent article since I started editing it in January 2006. Christian-viewpoint editors -- who are legion on Wikipedia, and who might have been tempted to add to the Dinosaurs article, as happened constantly prior to the creation of the religious perspectives fork, have instead worked to improve the sub-article (where the content is more appropriate). And the content IS appropriate, I should emphasize -- it's reasonable to include <b>significant</b> minority perspectives about dinosaurs in Wikipedia even if they aren't "scientific."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the religious perspectives article is deleted, we can look forward to many more disagreements over the addition of religious perspectives information to the parent article... Killdevil 02:45, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, that's not a reason to keep an article. Yeah, defacement is annoying, but really, I don't even think there are that many even looking at the article; they've probably all moved onto <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, and similar articles by now. Bowing down to trolls is not a good policy, though, and we have to keep the standards up. And if we link to the creationism and similar articles, won't they be diverted there anyway? Or we could just remove it as irrelevant junk not supported by RSs. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 04:27, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> OR <b>Keep</b>, <i>not</i> Merge with <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a>. I don't care wheter this article stays or goes, but I strongly oppose merge the content back into <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a></i>. The reason this article was created in the first place was to keep the embarrassing, barely-relevant creationist perspectives on dinosaurs out of the main dinosaur article. Any attempts to integrate this content back into that article will be reverted immediately by the editors of Dinosaur who have been content with the existance of the article as a comprimise since last June. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 15:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I fully understand the situation you are experiencing. However, granting these people their own article to continue this nonsense is not the way to deal with vandalism of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. If your article is vandalized again they should be warned/blocked/banned. I am saying this to you in full respect and understanding of your situation but we need to be firm on this. People who vandalize by adding nonsense must be blocked, not granted their own article to keep soapboxing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> to preserve the intergrity of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. There is no question that Wikipedia should report on the scientifically nonsensical and misguided attempts of some religious groups to discredit the established fossil record. The article makes clear in a neutral manner the fact that these movements place themselves in contradiction to entire fields of geology and biology. The existence of such views among fringe groups has been reported on in many major media sources, and keeping the article does not validate their ideas. "Delete because it's all unscientific nonsense" is not a valid argument, since if that were the case we'd have to delete <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greys.html" title="Greys">Greys</a>.

<dl>

<dd>The last time this was a major issue in the dinosaur article, we had an admin involved in the debate -- he blocked people who violated 3RR by removing religious language from the article... which is just to say that many of the people who have commented here are dedicated to keeping "science" articles "scientific" but that this is NOT a universal sentiment among editors on Wikipedia, and not among admins either.

<dd>Looking through the last 1000 edits it seems apparent that the vandalism from anons haven't stopped although they are of a different nature now. Second, the insertion of POV non-sourced information prior to the forking came primarily, at the end anyway, from one anon with a static IP. But this is also about something bigger than the Dino article. It is about the fact that these people effectively bullied their way to an article that shouldn't be here. And that is unacceptable.

Admins on Wikipedia have had a free hand for too long." This candidate also stated "If the advocates for the scientific point of view comport themselves rudely and disruptively, while the advocates for creation science comport themselves politely, the creation science people will be the ones left standing and allowed to write the article." and received <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Kelly_Martin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Kelly_Martin" rel="nofollow">41 votes of support</a>. While the people who have voted above seem to support a scientific basis for Wikipedia's dinosaur articles, it is not a foregone conclusion that an administrator who acted to protect a scientific interpretation of <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> would be able to retain his/her adminship privledges, as more than 40 people supported a candidate who would desysop an admin who used Admin tools to protect an article from a non-scientific standpoint.</dd>

<dd>No, I fully understood your argument, and that you fully support a scientific basis for Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. My point was simply that not everyone sees it that way, and both regular users and admins need to be careful when editing/blocking, as those priviledges (editing and blocking, respectively) can be taken away if the majority of the group decides maintaining a scientific point of view, and reverting non-science edits, is "abuse". You stated above you would fight for an admin who was taken to ArbCom over protecting an article from Creationist POV edits, but that does no good if 41 others support desysopping an "abusive" admin, right?&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

As much as I would like to take a strictly "firm" approach to Abortion in terms of notability, verifiability, etc. (Do we <i>really</i> need a "Fetal pain" sub-section?), I have found all efforts toward this end to be disasterous. If you brook no concession <i>ever</i>, you're forgetting that Wikipedia <i>is</i> a collaborative effort, and is intended to be inclusive of many POVs. Thus, "firm, but fair" is my solution at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>; we compromise sometimes, attempt to accommodate editorial concerns/minority views sometimes, but, ultimately, only to a point. I see the situation at Dinosaur as being analogous to our own; they have accommodated minority views, but drawn a line, and said, "No more." These sorts of compromises are fair and have led to relative stability on both Dinosaur and Abortion. I appreciate your efforts to try to preserve article integrity against OR and NPOVUW violations, but, again, there needs to be compromise. And, as for giving people their own "soapboxes," POV forks off major articles are nothing novel: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_religion.html" title="Homosexuality and religion">Homosexuality and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_abortion.html" title="Religion and abortion">Religion and abortion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_sexuality.html" title="Religion and sexuality">Religion and sexuality</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_and_religion.html" title="Slavery and religion">Slavery and religion</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism_and_religion.html" title="Fascism and religion">Fascism and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_the_internet.html" title="Religion and the internet">Religion and the internet</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_and_religion.html" title="Gender and religion">Gender and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_politics.html" title="Religion and politics">Religion and politics</a>. Obviously, <i>general</i> religious forks have precedent on Wikipedia, but forking by religion or denomination do not (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Abortion_and_Evangelical_Christians_a8aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abortion and Evangelical Christians">a recent AfD nomination</a>). -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 18:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, do not merge. Of course this is essentially part of the controversy between creation and evolution, but there is no reason for having only one article about that controversy. For instance regarding Roman Catholic sacraments there are plenty of articles, and essentially these are all about believing or not in the holiness of such. Mixing the non-scientifical approach of the world with one that is based on scientific empirism, is bound to continuously jeopardize the objectivity and quality of an article and cause truly endless discussions, for water and fire cannot be one. The current weasel wording in the style of <i>some people</i> does however require naming at least a few people or groups of people with a proper source. The article is not a soapbox and must maintain Wikipedia standards; its talk page may hold the soapbox function as this is far from uncommon on Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../d/e/c/Dec_30.html" title="Dec 30">30 Dec</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 20:35&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> My deepest sympathies with those editors dealing with vandalism of their beloved dinosaur article. Seriously. However, we Wikipedians tend to be smart... clever even. I'm sure someone can come up with a way to prevent this other than having an article which consists entirely of information available in other Wikipedia articles, and whose context is only clear when more is said about the religious views spawning it. Also, I find the argument that "this needs to be included so I know how religious people deal with dinosaurs" deeply flawed, because the vast majority of Christians, many of my family and friends included (full disclosure for COI purposes: I am not a Christian), are not biblical literalists, and "believe" in evolution, so to speak. If the subject's notability rests entirely on the fact that a sub-group of a religion holds its belief, then that subject's notability will depend partly on how notable that group is, and Creationists are not as notable as Christians generally (through they may be more outspoken). On the other hand, part of the notability of a belief is unrelated to the groups which hold it: to think otherwise is to think that <i>every</i> belief, held by <i>any</i> notable group is <i>therefore</i> notable, and this is obviously untrue. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 12:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think I change my mind to a clear request for keeping it. There have already been many long discussions regarding several articles about which ones should be merged or kept as an independent article. If this article was deleted, it would not make the discussion more easy. And I clearly think that the information in the article is something that should be known. I feel that many in here just want the article away because they do not like the viewpoints the article describes. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummer_Song_7ecf.html" title="User:Summer Song">Summer Song</a> 14:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>To give some additional comments: Wikipedia shall not proclaim christian standpoints. Wikipedia shall not proclaim creationist standpoints. But it shall not proclaim anti-christian or anti-religious standpoints either. And it shall not proclaim a point of view that it is only sickness or madness that cause someone doubt the main evolution theory, or other teachings that is generally considered proven as fact. It may seem like many in this discussion just want to mock every attempt to question the evolution theory or other scientific thoughts. There are several types of creation beliefs. There are some creation beliefs that are just laughable, but there are also some with at least some more educated thoughts. And that is exactly what this article is talking about. The article presents various thoughts that are held by religions on the topic. I think that the article has a value. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummer_Song_7ecf.html" title="User:Summer Song">Summer Song</a> 15:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Geez... calm down. No need for the personal attacks. A bit of assuming good faith would be nice here. I am not anti-christian and I never called anyone sick or mad. Yes, the article represents a point of view but nothing else. Where are the reliable sources? Where can I verify that this in fact is not something made up? Those are answers that ALL Wikipedia articles must provide answers to, not just the Christian ones. I have been called everything from a islaomphobist, anti-jew, dumb liberal to stone-age conservative here. But never anti-christian.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Regardless of whether much of the material of the article has been discussed elswhere, the present article draws together the variety of thoughts about a topic which constitutes a major point of contention between scientists and many religious individuals and groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject of the article is <i>not</i> the presentation of <i>facts</i> from a fundamentalist Christian viewpoint. The subject of the article is that such differences of philosophy and opinion exist, and what those differences are. <i>Any</i> belief that is held by a significant number of people is worthy of an encyclopedic article in an encyclopedia that can afford to be as large and diverse as this one. I do think that it would be good to get paragraphs written by people who are familiar with viewpoints other than Jewish and Christian ones. As for the balance of opinion, the article states that within these faiths there is both acceptance and non-acceptance of the scientific assessment of the evidence. Note that I have done a little rewriting, because we are dealing essentialy with <i>belief</i> rather than fact. We now have disagreement with or support for theory or assessment rather than disagreement with "fact". This honours the "fact" that the article deals with "ideas" and has moved from the realm of science to the realm of philosophy. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 10:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This article does not satisfy Notability, as I understand it.</li>
<li>Also, it is based on a couple of blogs, by Gaurav Sabnis and Rashmi Bansal. Both of them are alumnus of competing institutions, which makes them biased. In addition, I dont see how 2 bloggers (both from IIM, which competes with IIPM), can come up with some unverfied accusation, and post them on Wikipedia, as part of some college student slander campaign. This reduces Wikipedia's integrity and credibility.</li>
<li>I also believe that since blogs are self-published, Wikipedia does not count them are verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Further, another source used in the article is Businessworld, a magazine where Rashmi Bansal is an editor, and therefore is also biased.</li>
<li>And finally, Rashmi Bansal, whose college newsletter JAMMAG published the first article, has a warrant for her arrest in relation to content on another issue in her magazine. that adds to the fact that she is not a credible source. You can read about her on Google News.</li>
<li>The article is largesly uncited, and significant portions are quoted incorrectly from sources that are in any case not conforming to Notability and Verifiability.</li>
<li>For those of you not from India, IIPM has over 5000 MBA students studying, and over 50,000 alumni in the past 30 years. It has 400 companies including FORTUNE 500 and India's largest firms recruiting. The institute publishes leading business magazines. The Director is a respected economist and professor. The Dean has recieved numberous awards and is a best selling author who has lectured widely in the EU and US. The faculty teach alongside Ivy League faculty.</li>
<li>Notability of the institute is clear from this <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/aee282d6-5aec-11db-8f80-0000779e2340.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/aee282d6-5aec-11db-8f80-0000779e2340.html" rel="nofollow">Financial Times newspaper</a> article and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/57cb97bc-f3db-11da-9dab-0000779e2340.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/57cb97bc-f3db-11da-9dab-0000779e2340.html" rel="nofollow">another earlier Financial Times</a> article. In addition, IIPM's official site has an archive of press clipping <a href="http://www.iipm.edu/IIPM-News.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iipm.edu/IIPM-News.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.iipm.edu/IIPM-in-Media.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iipm.edu/IIPM-in-Media.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>In fact, this article has been contentious for over a year, but because experienced bloggers were familiar with Wikipedia, they were able to keep adding to the article and reverting changes withouta discussion. I am trying to work on the main article on IIPM as well, which has been partially protect for now.</li>

<dd>Dear Hornplease, you have not addressed any of the issues in the Delete notice, which I will assume you have read. Please do so, sir. There are over 10 reasons, each of which is self-sufficient, for this article to be deleted. In addition, Wikipedia is not the place for this topic, which, as you describe it 'as it relates to blogs' and 'notable instance and precedent...especially for Indian bloggers'.</dd>
<dd>Allow me to quote from [Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not]:</dd>
<dd>Opinions on current affairs is a particular case of the previous item. Although current affairs may stir passions and tempt people to "climb soapboxes" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced so as to put entries for current affairs in a reasonable perspective. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I urge you to consider creating an article in Wiki commons. or Wikinfo, which might serve your purpose better. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and if we try to follow the KISS principle, and avoid instruction creep, Wikipedia should have an IIPM article with a criticism section that mentions this blog issue. It does. And thats a good article that we can make better. I hope you agree with me, or we can continue this dialogue.--<a href="../../../i/i/p/User%7EIipmstudent9_c5ec.html" title="User:Iipmstudent9">Iipmstudent9</a> 11:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you wish to avoid lengthy criticism of Arindam and his institute taking up large amounts of the IIPM main page, it would be best to let this article stay; I address this to you if you are concerned primarily with their reputations. (Note that we typically try to avoid main articles that are mainly criticism).</dd>
<dd>Please note that <i>none of the reasons</i> given above indicate that the issue itself is non-notable; at best they indicate a content dispute. That is not grounds for deletion. The notability of the issue is unquestionable in that several mainstream sources -<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> will explain what they are - discuss the controversy. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 19:17, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hornplease, what I wish matters little, no? Similarly, your advice on what is best, is, with all due respect, irrelevant. What does matter is Wikipedia's five pillars - and the Notability principle does not cover a topic such as this 'controversy'. Wikipedia is not meant for articles that cover current events. Please look at the sections into which Wikipedia is organised - there is no place for such a page. And with regard to Arindam Chaudhuri, it has been widly reported in the Indian press that IIPM is a society, and Arindam is not the owner-manager as you claim, and not even a trustee of the society. The IIPM website calls him honorary Dean. IIPM has over 5000 MBA students studying, and over 50,000 alumni in the past 30 years. It has 400 companies including FORTUNE 500 and India's largest firms recruiting. The institute publishes leading business magazines. The Director is an IIM Bangalore professor. The Honorary Dean has recieved numberous awards and is a best selling author who has lectured widely in the EU and US, and is the recepient of many awards, that you can see at www.arindamchaudhuri.com, including a recent press clipping i saw online about a Priyadarshini award from Maharashtra (Mumbai) Chief Minister. The faculty of IIPM teach alongside Ivy League faculty. Financial Times has recognised the IIPM as a innovative and visionary institute in the world.</dd>

This is not to say that the material is not worthy of inclusion, but please take a look at our policy on Neutral point of view. Editorial oversight—A publication with a declared editorial policy will have greater reliability than one without, since the content is subject to verification. Self published sources such as personal web pages, personally published print runs and blogs have not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking and so have lower levels of reliability than published news media (e.g. The Economist) and other sources with editorial oversight, which is less reliable itself than professional or peer reviewed journal Age of the source and rate of change of the subject—Where a subject has evolved or changed over time, a long standing source may not be accurate with respect to the current situation. To interpret utility one must appreciate how the subject has changed and if that change has impacted any of the salient points of the source information. self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will note that Rashmi Bansal and Gaurav Sabnis are both bloggers, and both IIM alumnus, which makes them biased against IIPM. Further, JAMMAG is self-published by Rashmi. And finally, Rashmi is a contributing editor in Businessworld. And lets not forget, she's currently under arrest for libel in Bombay for comments in JAMMAG.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About blogs used as sources</b>: It is true that the blogs are being referenced in the article. However, as far as I can see, they are not being used to assert the blogwriters' statements as facts. Quotes are being attributed to their respective authors, and not put forth as information. They are being given as evidence, and I think Wikipedia does not frown upon such use of blogs. Still, maybe we could re-word many sentences to reach an NPOV consensus. In any case, blogs are certainly not the <i>only</i> sources on which this article is based, as explained below.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>*There are no verifiable sources in the artilce which justifies the libelous statements aainst IIPM.--<a href="../../../i/i/p/User%7EIipmstudent9_c5ec.html" title="User:Iipmstudent9">Iipmstudent9</a> 17:12, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "libelous" statements are not being put forth as facts. They're ascribed to respective people and publications. You can, if you have the references, mention the counter-statements made by IIPM to answer these claims. If you add these, you must also make sure that they are represented as IIPM's quotes and not assert them as actual facts.</dd>
<dd>Plus, I'm pretty sure Outlook, Businessworld, The Economic Times, NDTV and MoneyControl have been referenced extensively on Wikipedia and count as reliable sources. You're right, none of them justifies the contentious statements, but that's not the point now, is it? The article is just a description of an event, it is not there to prove or disprove anything. <b><a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximvsDecimvs_b00c.html" title="User:MaximvsDecimvs">Max</a></b> 19:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>About notability</b>: Let us keep JAM aside for the moment since there is a debate on whether it is a reliable source or not. This controversy has been reported in the Indian media, most notably <a href="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=152721" class="external text" title="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=152721" rel="nofollow">The Indian Express</a>, and <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?category=National&amp;slug=Row+over+IIPM+blogs&amp;id=79968" class="external text" title="http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?category=National&amp;slug=Row+over+IIPM+blogs&amp;id=79968" rel="nofollow">NDTV</a>. It has been written about in national magazines such as Businessworld and Outlook (whose online editions require free registration, so I'm not providing links). It had been reported last year in other papers too (Hindustan Times, DNA, Mumbai Mirror etc.) but their online archived versions are either unavailable or absent. The problem of not finding enough references for this article is because Indian newspapers are lousy as far as maintenance of their online editions are concerned. Many don't even maintain archives. That is why a lot of older archive links don't work. But I think Wikipedia is not averse to offline references (i.e. actual hard copy references) as long as the original references are well-described (page number, section number, para number, ISBN etc. are properly quoted), and anyone who has a copy of the paper/magazine/book can easily look up the info. Anyway, there is a scanned paper clipping from Hindustan Times in this article.</dd>

<dd>* Max, if you followed the incident carefull,y you would know that there were no legal notices sent from IIPM.

<dl>
<dd>As a side note, there is also the fact that <a href="../../../i/i/p/IIPM_abdc.html" title="IIPM">IIPM</a> is the largest spender for print ads in newspapers, and hence many newspapers may not have carried this story altogether (conflict of interest, anyone?) or removed the online version of articles pertaining to the issue, which makes it difficult to find "reliable" references. Of course, this is only a thought expressed by many as to why more mainstream sources are not being found, and no one can really do much about it.</dd>

I actually would prefer this get a very small mention in the IIPM article with most of the content remaining in this article. I think the remaining points from Iipmstudent9 all relate to the content of the article and not whether the article deserves deletion. Note that the above keep vote reflects the fact that the existence of the controversy can be confirmed in multiple, reliable sources. It does not mean that I believe any of the statements made in the controversy are true are false. I might make some replies to some of the issues related to the 'content' of the article above, but disputes about the content should not influence the AfD - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 19:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I doubt anyone is going to type "Destroyer (Babylon 5)" as a search term (I found the article as a random result).

<dd>Eh, I have no idea what somebody will type, but disambigs are cheap, as cheap as redirects. If there was just the one type of destroyer, that'd be one thing, simple redirect. With two (plus who knows how many added in the future if the series is further developed), I think a disambig is the easy choice. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, the disambig is fine, though the reason I created the stubby was because previously, the B5 destroyer articles linked to the destroyer Wikipedia page that is about the 20th century warship class, which has nothing to do, either in form or function, with the destroyers on Babylon 5 (on Babylon 5, they serve as a cross between aircraft carriers and battleships). I'll go ahead and throw in a link on the Destroyer disamb page for the Omega Destroyer, which is the one primarily seen on B5.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaguleader_6976.html" title="User:Raguleader">Raguleader</a> 17:29, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nomination is weak and the nominator has not done his homework; this man is not a "professor" he was along with his musical endeavors a successful dentist and philanthropist. I've sourced several obituaries to the article and these are just a few among many. There is also extensive online discussion of his notability. This is obviously not a vanity entry and notability is clearly established by the three non-trivial sources now referenced from the article. In addition to the sources, he is the recipient of two major notable awards the Rhodes Scholarship and a Harvard Fellowhip - multiple awards are clear evidence of notability per Wikipedia guidelines. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 07:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Those wishing to keep the article should add more "independent, reliable and verifiable:" sources than 2 obits and an "appreciation." If he was notable over a long career as an impresario, there should have been articles about him along the way, not just obituaries. Articles about the music festivals which make more than a passing reference to him would help to support his notability. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is getting into some real hair-splitting. As volunteer editors we shouldn't be sent out on research missions to fulfill expectations beyond the basic guidelines which call for multiple (two or more) independent and non-trivial sources.

<p>It depends where and what the obituary is. In this case, the obituary in the Times, one of the 2 major UK national newspapers, is 500 words long, with two pictures of LB, one rehearsing the Youth Orchestra, and one more formal portrait. The obituary in the Guardia, ditto in importance, with headline:" Musical idealist whose enthusiasm gave birth to a great European youth orchestra" of 250 words long.

<p><s>This seems to be the only Buffy episode with a separate "comprehensive synopsis" article. I'm suggesting <b>delete</b> rather than merge because the standard format for Buffy episode articles looks to be a summary plus an "expanded overview" and this level of detailed summary is apparently not desired by those who work most heavily on the Buffy articles, not to mention being a violation of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>.

<li>Vote changed to <s><b>weak keep</b></s> <b>weakest possible keep</b>. Kevin Murray, there are two different exhibitions, and I was unable to connect him to the Ft. Lauderdale one. The different forms of his name and the pseudonym complicate the research task; I looked hard but only found gallery (i.e. not independent, because they <b>make money</b> when they sell paintings) sources for biographical information. Note that the Grace Art Gallery and Art News links are not independent, and the Humanities Web bio is substantially the same wording as his official gallery bio.

Two look like art fair awards, being held in Cannes notwithstanding, and the other -- the <i>medaille d'or Leonardo da Vinci</i> -- doesn't turn up in any searching, so who knows who gave it out. About the only thing left for notability is that painting of Ike.

<li>Believe me, it isn't the quality of his work. For AFD purposes I'm simply troubled by the dearth of independent reliable sources. The quality of his work is an indicator why there are so few, e.g. no appearances in books covering modern impressionism or French painters of the 20th century. Even minor painters get name-checks from time to time. If you look at my contributions I engage in article saves all the time and I'm no automatic deletionist. I don't believe in deletion without at least giving an article's notability an opportunity to be established. I don't think that "letting it go" is really a good idea if there are serious questions. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was wondering if this article could be speedied, but I listed it for AFD because the CSD A7 criteria is meant for pages that don't assert the importance of their subjects.

<li><b>Delete</b> as there are indications his linguistics and translation work may be notable (Arabic and French wikipedias have stubs articles too) but there are very few English-language sources to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:44, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lack of English-language sources is not a valid reason for deletion if sources are available in other languages.

<li>I created this article. I didn't write it myself, I copied the entire thing from the team's entry on the league wiki. If you guys want to delete it, I guess there's no way to stop you, but it's not as if the article is profane or offensive, and there is still plenty of information within it. Maybe it deserves a thorough cleanup, but I don't know about deletion.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - while it doesn't yet have <i>multiple</i> independent sources, it has appeared in print, in Custom PC Magazine in the UK this month, as one of it's top 10 "casual games". The magazine is not available online, but a member of the Nexus War Forums was kind enough to provide a photo-shot of the appearance recently <a href="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f214/rickykemp/PHOT0070.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f214/rickykemp/PHOT0070.jpg" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Does this magazine qualify as large enough for this? Circulation is approx 22,000 according to the publisher.

<li><b>Keep</b> Most other browser games have a seeming lack of sources, yet they have articles simply because they've been around longer, and thus have more accounts. If you extrapolate out the data, you would probably find NexusWar to be just as notable as any other browser game. There are far more articles on Wikipedia that are of less notability. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorseOdin_e3e5.html" title="User:NorseOdin">Kazmarov</a> 23:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've been asked to re-evaluate, but I stand by my recommendation. I see no value in following the letter of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here as none of the six individuals is notable beyond this common event. It's a bit like articles on crimes or major events like disasters -- of course there is coverage of the person in relation to the event, but that doesn't make them individually notable. The Fatima comparison is also irrelevant; Fatima was a major "miracle" in the sense that it was and has continued to be notable worldwide, not the least because of the rumors concerning the third revelation. There's a movie<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800095824/info" class="external autonumber" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800095824/info" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, Mel Gibson may make another<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=2806" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=2806" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, there's been at least one thriller written about it<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780739333464" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780739333464" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, etc. I would hate for some kind of "equivalence" rule to lead us to have articles about the Madonna under the Chicago bridge.<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/22/earlyshow/main690089.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/22/earlyshow/main690089.shtml" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> If I may coin a phrase which may seem incosiderate, I'd call this something like holyspiritcruft.

<li><s><b>Merge-or weak Keep</b></s> Bearcat makes a good point, so I read the articles on Fatima and the three girls. Under the premise that the Fatima article is long it makes sense to move the major participants to their own pages; however, the Međugorje article seems sufficiently short enough that the participants could be listed there with redirects from their names. I dispute the premise of the nomination since the nominator is citing his own disbelief in what is a notable event, which is irrelevant to good editing at Wikipedia.

<dd>A <i>lot</i> more than <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantalus.html" title="Tantalus">Tantalus</a> will need to be fixed.

If sufficient legitimate documentation somehow appears to validate this purported practice, I'll revert the removal of content from the other articles myself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The substance of this article, which I created as part of my current tidying up of the articles on the Kingdom of Lydia, is based on an article entitled "The Maeoniae" by Charles Weyland that appeared in the December 1996 issue of Merel. In addition to those already discussed, the author provides, for example, the following reference:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Lydia was the place of origin of the Maeoniae, a class of slave whose limbs were cut off upon being admitted to the temple as girls, and who were compelled to prostitute themselves thereafter. The amputations were effected in compliance with the principle of the golden ratio, which was thought to be most pleasing to the senses. The initiates of the sect became exceedingly skilled in the arts of their profession."</i></dd>
<dd>William Sandbach (1876), in his Preface to his translation of <i>The Oera Linda Book</i>.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not wishing to be indelicate, but I find it hard - nay, impossible - to believe that this subject would have absolutely no references at all on the web apart from your page.

Sandbach is indeed the English translator of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oera_Linda_Book_abcd.html" title="The Oera Linda Book">The Oera Linda Book</a>, itself of at-best dubious veracity. However, I cannot find any indication that he discussed (or would have discussed) bizarre Greek sexuality in the preface to what is ostensibly a <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friesland.html" title="Friesland">Frisian</a> book about proto-European culture and the goddess <a href="../../../f/r/y/Frya.html" title="Frya">Frya</a>. Furthermore, I cannot find <i>any</i> indication that "The Maeoniae" by Charles Weyland exists, or, in fact, any evidence of a magazine or journal titled <i>Merel</i> that might have printed such an article. At this point, some clear evidence of valid documentation is going to be necessary to convince me otherwise. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 23:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ah, I see now. Here's an apt description from a random website: "Ordo Anno Mundi A magical society offering full training in the Ophidian (Serpent-venerating) Traditional Craft, members receive their training by post.

I posit that this is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for Lydian history (and that it is rather generous to consider it well known). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 00:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I gave this searching up references thing one last go, just to see if I'd need to revert my own edits removing this material from the rest of WP. It is my considered opinion that Ordo Anno Mundi <i>made it up</i>. There is an English translation of Oera Linda by Sandbach, and I <i>guarantee</i> it doesn't talk about kinky Lydian sex in its introduction, or in the introduction of either of its two legitimate reprints. I'm not surprised there, Ordo Anno Mundi has some funny ideas about what Oera Linda means. Charles Weyland has never written anything anywhere remotely reliable; I am faced with the staggering reality that, although there are other people with that name (including a character from the <i>Alien</i> movies), I cannot find <i>a single Google reference</i> to anyone who might actually be writing about Lydian history under that name. I can't even find a record of him writing for <i>Merel</i>, the Ordo Anno Mudi journal, because their website is no longer extant. I suppose I could crawl through Wayback, but why? As for the Taylor book, I am all but certain it does not exist. There are several books by that title; none are by a James Taylor, nor are they published in 1902. There are two Taylors who have written about the topic, neither so titled a book, neither published in 1902 (although Thomas translated Greek poetry in 1889). There was one major book about Greek religion and myth published in 1902; it was in German. The Gilbert book, <i>Lydia</i>, is even more ephemeral than its Taylor counterpart. This article is a hoax and whether it was by the creator of this article or by Ordo Anno Mundi, it still needs to go. And so, to paraphrase good Forrest Gump, that's all I have to say about the references for maeoniae. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 07:59, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why have you drawn attention to my talk page in this manner? If you read it carefully you will see that I have been an active Wikipedia editor for well over a year, and have contributed a great deal of useful information. For example, I helped make <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_monarchs_5d27.html" title="List of English monarchs">List of English monarchs</a> the excellent and detailed resource that it is today (though I can't claim <i>all</i> the credit!).

<li><b>Comment</b> I suggest keeping in the 'funnies' bit as it's very clever.

<dd><i>Individual</i> <i><b>scheduled or expected future events</b></i> <i>should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.</i> (emphasis in original)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Note that it says speculation is allowed, as long as it's "well documented", not something a Wikipedia editor made up themselves. Something that says "Japan is making a bid" is great, but we don't have to limit ourselves to that. The speculation over countries like Scotland bidding is "well documented" as it's on the public record, therefore we can include it here. Aside from that, 2015 RWC is notable, and almost certain to take place, so I don't think the crystal ball clause applies. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 02:20, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Explain how this meets "well documented" - two countries are documented, and the other six have no documentation at all. You have an article that states eight countries/regions <i>might</i> have an interest in placing a bid. Very definition of crystal ball. Why not write an article that the United State might have interest in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, because interest in Cricket in the U.S. might increase by then. <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECiticat_8adf.html" title="User:Citicat">Citicat</a> 14:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So we can't find any public information that Argentina's considering a bid? Fine, then delete Argentina from the list. Same for the others. That leaves us with Japan and Scotland, which have both made statements on the public record that they're considering a bid. Turn the article into a stub with just those two. As more countries get into the bidding process for what is one of the largest international sporting events in the world (behind the Soccer World Cup and the Olympics), we can add them into the article - with proper sources, of course. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 15:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, dunno how much this will interest anyone, but I'm an editor at ANUS and would like to point out a few things. ANUS is the continuation of a hacker/free speech organization from the Houston BBS scene in the 1980s, has been mentioned in Spin Magazine and the Houston Press, has resulted in numerous FBI visits for our members, has published almost a thousand pages of online documentation, has the oldest underground metal site on the net (not just the web, as it predates that -- was an FTP ezine first), and has over 400 active members who do a lot more than troll. We're not a troll organization; we're a political organization and a publisher with its first volume coming out in a few months. Add that to the fact that the website has been online in various forms since 1993 and has been cited in numerous places and you have our importance on the net, which is something others sometimes resent and try to attack. I don't see how our "notability" is up for questioning at all -- we've paid our dues and continue to contribute to the internet community. OH, and I forgot to mention the MacBong which got us mentioned in WIRED. I know we've fought with WikiPedians in the past over this, but I don't see why this has to be acrimonious, since the facts are obvious for all to see. If you have any questions, drop us a line at <a href="http://www.anus.com/mock" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anus.com/mock" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and we'll talk it over. If that's not enough, come visit the ANUS and see if there's something of interest for you there&#160;:) Anus.com 19:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia needed like, what, 10-18 or so Vote For Deletions until they got the GNAA article deleted. That says quite a bit about this "democracy", in which we need to vote again and again until we get the results we want. LOL. --Iconoclast 18:12, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The subsequent nominations of the article were not made by the same person over and over again. The point you've raised actually rather helps to emphasize Wikipedia's democratic nature: if valid arguments are raised and consensus is reached about deleting an article, then simply the fact that many previous deletion noms have not gone through won't result in the article automatically being kept without the arguments in favor of its deletion being examined.--<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzer_Red_d6c7.html" title="User:Azer Red"><font color="Darkred"><b>Azer Red</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/z/e/User_talk%7EAzer_Red_02c0.html" title="User talk:Azer Red"><font color="red"><i>Si?</i></font></a> 01:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>2nd additional comment, lest I be accused of propogating geographic bias</b>: To me, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown.html" title="Countdown">Countdown</a> to the United Kingdom is similar to <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> in North America. Not every Jeopardy! five-time champion, or Tournament of Champions winner, has an article in Wikipedia; in fact, many five-time champions have had their articles deleted. The precedent from the Jeopardy! AfD discussions have been that one must have transcended the show and received significant press coverage from their appearances on the show, such as <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Timanus_660b.html" title="Eddie Timanus">Eddie Timanus</a>, or set a significant record on the show (i.e. <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Rutter_d8f3.html" title="Brad Rutter">Brad Rutter</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome_Vered_cb5b.html" title="Jerome Vered">Jerome Vered</a>, or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Madden_b8cf.html" title="David Madden">David Madden</a>). To me, it seems that Brittain is akin to a typical five-time Jeopardy! champion, or a regular Tournament of Champions winner (I should point out that the last three Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions winners, Mark Dawson, Russ Schumacher or Michael Falk, have not have articles created.) <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 15:30, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
