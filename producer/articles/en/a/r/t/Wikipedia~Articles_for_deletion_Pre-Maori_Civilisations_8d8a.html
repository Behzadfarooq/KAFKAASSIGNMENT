<p>This article is nonsense. All archaeological evidence is against any European settlement of New Zealand prior to Polynesian settlement 1000-800 years ago. See any peer-reviewed literature. My source is K. R. Howe, <i>The Quest for Origins</i>, and I've attended a meeting of NZ Society of Archaeology discussing this question.

<li><b>comment</b>: There have long been speculations and rumours that there may have been a pre-Maori colonisation of New Zealand, but the evidence ranks close to the Von Däniken levels for believability. An article on these theories should probably exist, as long as it is made clear that it is a theory viewed with extreme scepticism by the scientific community. I don't believe this article, as it currently stands, could easily be turned into an article that would fulfl that requirement. As it currently stands, it is heavily POV, and deals with just one of the people who has raised this theory (and not one of the main ones). I'd suggest <b>deleting</b> this one, and hopefully someone more in the know could write something better at a later date. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 12:02, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> I considered nominating this for speedy deletion on the grounds of patent nonsense, looking into this further I don't think it's quite that bad, but it does look like extremely dubious pseudoarchaeology. He baldly uses terms like Indo-European and Celtic to describe the alleged pre-Maori inhabitants, as these are linguistic terms we could not jump to this conclusion even if there was significant archaelogical evidence of pre-Maori inhabitants in New Zealand. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 12:07, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep, Edit</b> This article is not anti-Maori, it is simply trying to inform people of the previous history of New Zealand before the Maori arrived. It is unfair to suppress NZ's Pre-Maori history, labeling it racism. The New Zealand government has banned carbon dating on any artefacts found, and I thought that wikipedia would be a safe haven away from any cover ups or embargo's for all to find the truth. Although I am not the author of the site, I have contacted the author for help editing the wiki - though have had no reply. I agree that my grammar and wording is not so good - I should have planned it better, and will re-write asap, although I am not sure which parts are POV. Is there any <b>external</b> archaeologists that could comment on this? IE, scientists that have not studied the history of NZ? Because half the problem is that the scientists of NZ are set in such a deep mindset that they have tunnel vision and simple cannot accept any different theories. The other half is probly that all the Maori activism in NZ's history may become void or hypocritical. --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 20:05, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>How come, after I left an incorrect piece of information on an automotive article for a while, no one complained at all. Suddenly when article that could imply racism everyone is all over it. I don't think this is very fair. Other articles have websites as their proof, why can't this one? There is hard evidence of pre-maori civilisation why are you trying to hide this from society? What is realy going on here? I believe the reason this article is being kept down because if it gets into mainstream, it will make the Maori activists, and stereotypically the race look hypocritical. However this is not fair, and should not even be a factor in keeping this down if we get to know more about the history of New Zealand. --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 21:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Nzhamstar, I visited the celticnz website and couldn't find any convincing evidence for its claims. Martin Doutré has found some stones and thinks that they represented pre-Maori activity but he didn't have any finds or scientific dates from excavations to tell us about. How does he know these sites aren't from the post-Maori era? Some of them look natural rather than manmade, has he carried out excavation work to demonstrate his ideas? The saga of the embargoed documents from the Waipoua Forest which don't seem to actually contain any useful information and are freely-available for inspection anyway don't help his case nor do quotations from speculative nineteenth century antiquarians who had a lot of ideas about mass population movements that are now discounted. Mr Doutré appears to looking for evidence that supports his theory and ignoring other explanations- this technique is the hallmark of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoarchaeology.html" title="Pseudoarchaeology">pseudoarchaeology</a> and it is why the article being criticised. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 22:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see. But what of the carvings that surely do not look Maori or European? And why has the government banned carbon dating on the artefacts?--<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 23:43, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is not fair to suppress this information. The only reason it hasn't been proved true is because reknowned scientists and archaeologists ignore the evidence because they are too busy believing in the fact that there is no Pre-Maori history, and/or are too scared (or complacent) for being labeled culturally insensitive or racist for studying such things. It hasn't been proved wrong. Why is the government banning open archaeological investigation and carbon dating on these artefacts? --<a href="../../../n/z/h/User%7ENzhamstar_14d3.html" title="User:Nzhamstar">Nzhamstar</a> 23:43, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is certainly some evidence that there was human contact with New Zealand before the permanent settlement by Maori. The kiore (rat) appears to have been here longer than permanant settlement, and could only have arrived with humans. This indicates that Polynesians arrived at New Zealand earlier than the accepted dates for Maori settlement, but did not stay (or did not survive). This is a very different hypothesis from suggesting Celtic peoples settled New Zealand.</dd>
<dd>By the way, you fail to quote any evidence of said "Maori tradition". You need to quote peer reviewed journals, not wild speculation. You say that scientists suppress the evidence, but scientists have no motive to suppress such items, and every motive to publish any evidence that would show such a radically different version of prehistory. If you could provide proof, you'd win the archeological equivalent of the Nobel Prize. In practice, archeologists don't pursue such theories for the same reasons as physicists don't pursue perpetual motion machines.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 04:09, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Governments suppress the findings - not scientists! Scientists and archaeologists want these restricted sites out in the open, rather than censored because of Maori superstition. The only way this can happen is to inform the public of what they are missing out on. And the way to do that is Wikipedia which is supposed to be a "big open encyclopedia" for everyone to access and add stuff to and now I'm being kicked to the curb for offering proof and evidence of an alternative, censored history of New Zealand.
