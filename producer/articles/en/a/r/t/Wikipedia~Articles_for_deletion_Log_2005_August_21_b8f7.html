<li><b>Keep</b> It has a couple thousand daily hits. It's poorly written, yeah, but I imagined that will eventually be fixed.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - While it's true the article needs to be rewritten and expanded, and it doesn't meet any of the suggested minimum requirements for a webcomic, I get the sense that this comic has a large enough fanbase to justify including it. In other words, it seems likely useful to enough people, so it should be kept.

<p>Don't Delete This group is special because of the "strange" way they were created. How big they are: they may not have a lot of members but that doesn't mean that people don't know about them! They are like my second family! they've supoprted me when times got rough, and even, for instance, when one of our members developed cancer and the d69ers (I was new when it was going on) sent her a book with "get well soon" handwritten and drawn cards via snail mail!

<p>I vote with Saphira. Why does this particular forum deserve it's own page? Because of the history of resiliency and the level of Maturity and kindness displayed; unique in the wealth of Harry Potter fansites.

<li>I didn't say your vote <i>was</i> invalid; I said it <i>may be</i> invalid; the decision is not mine. It's usually granted that the author, even if anonymous, has the right to a vote on an article he created. However, in your case, you do not appear to be the author and some might consider you a sock puppet. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 01:43, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see what you mean now, however I was merely pointing out in my initial comment that the author's article <i>is</i> valid because I myself know for a fact that it is based on actual literature regarding a Hen that lays golden eggs - which has been considered a phenomenon in medieval folklore across Europe as well as a running theme in many fairy tales and stories. Also the Hen or <i>Black Pullet</i> is of considerable importance in the occult as a powerful image. Anyway, I still move to keep this article but perhaps rename it or even combine it with the The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg. which could therefore be expanded as well with this article included. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 03:52, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: It is a goose - so who's going to search for a hen? What use is a redirect? Should we also have unsystematicly-named articles on Partriges that lay golden eggs, Ptarmigan which lay golden eggs, the Albatross that did lay an egg that was golden?</li>
<li>Comment: So let's see according to your statement above we count the number of times that the Gooose appears in folklore (Aesop's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Goose_That_Laid_the_Golden_Eggs_14ac.html" title="The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs">The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs</a> which has been sometimes considered a Hen as you can see by <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hen+that+laid+the+golden+egg&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hen+that+laid+the+golden+egg&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Googling it</a>, and The Brothers Grimm's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Goose_e9a7.html" title="The Golden Goose">The Golden Goose</a>). Now how many times does the Hen feature in folklore <b>and</b> other affiliated themes? (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Pullet_5ccd.html" title="The Black Pullet">The Black Pullet</a>, the Russian fairy tale Kurochka Ryaba as stated below <b>and</b> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk_0562.html" title="Jack and the Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>, and that's not even mentioning the fact that it is also used as an Alchemical term.) So I guess it's 3-2 for the Hen so far. Also this Hen comes up in other fairy tales as well. However as stated before I feel it should perhaps be placed, moved into a category where the Goose, Hen and other fowls that lay golden eggs can be located etc.. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 20:56, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>How do you figure that? I think I've provided more than enough evidence to prove against your belief that "Goose" is more common than "Hen". What you are forgetting is I'm not contesting against the fact of it being a Goose or not, but the fact remains there is still a considerable difference between both creatures, one is a Goose the other is a Hen - and in both respects we have seen that they are described as such in their respective folklore. I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 23:01, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>If there exist a notable Russian fairy tale as stated below on this subject, it should be dealt with at Kurochka Ryaba, and not in this article. This article contains nothing about any Russian folk tale, and my vote remains to delete it - if you or anyone else should decide to create a better article about this story in the future, there will be nothing to stop you. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 23:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've checked it; there is a Dutch fairy tale about a hen with golden eggs.

<p>The result of the debate was delete with a copy to BJAODN.</p>
<p>In evaluating this discussion, I merged the three related discussions. Given the topic, it seems to me that an inconsistent result would be the worst possible choice.</p>
<ul>

<p>By strict vote-counting, I get the following:</p>
<table border="1">

</table>
<p>The last line represents the opinions if you took all three discussions and merged them, then eliminated duplication. The fractions come from 2 people who voted differently in the different discussions.</p>
<p>I should also note that 5 of the "keep" voters did so with comments that make it very difficult to tell if they were being serious. Their stated reasons appear to have no connection to the discussion. My hypothesis is that the discussion is about a joke and they consider surreal comments to be humorous and therefore appropriate. Not every culture shares that view, however. I was within a hair's-breadth of putting those comments in the "could not call" column.</p>
<p>Noting that a synopsis is already in the BJAODN archive, I am going to take the last step to delete the pages and the related redirects. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:52, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

We've tried to keep it to the facts wherever possible. The majority of the current references are to wikia.com because that is where most of the information is. Only two of them are to WikiFur itself, though, and one of those is an announcement that could also have been referenced to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Furry_fandom&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20243784" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Furry_fandom&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=20243784" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia edit</a>, or to a LiveJournal post.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Comparing Wikifur to Wikipedia in terms of media coverage is unfair. Wikipedia is a large, general purpose encyclopedia aimed at the general public, wikifur is not. A by-the-word interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not refer at all to size or distribution of the third-party source, only that it be well-known. The fact that this non-furry third-party source chose to directly quote from wikifur and redistribute its content is an example of wikifur's notability and a demonstration of it's usefulness outside the fandom. -- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeVandalizer_1f70.html" title="User:DeVandalizer">DeVandalizer</a> 10:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And in reply to your statement: My belief is that material that is verifiable and does not contain any NPOV violations should have a place on Wikipedia. Using other people's reports (notability) is a way to try to achieve some assurance of that, but it seems like it's just a shortcut for Wikipedians doing the fact-checking themselves, and that when it is easy to do then they should do it. I can understand that when it's a complicated question of law or science which is hard for laymen to understand (which is why there is NOR, to avoid that uncertainty), but I don't really see the application to this particular article, which makes reasonable, referenced assertions about the mission and history of a wiki that has existed and operated for over a year, and which is well-known within its sphere. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 06:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Don't find a lot of the reasons cited for deletion here to be that compelling. Just because the wiki isn't covered in Time magazine doesn't make it non-notable; I realize major media coverage makes a handy shortcut to deciding what deserves space, but it shouldn't be used as a crutch either. The article should be improved, rather than deleted before it has the chance to get better, as I can't think of any serious reason it can't be made better or more referenced. --ToyDragon</li>

By the way, I only have like 20 edits, lol. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 20:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are around 2100 articles in Category:People. I do not know how many of these articles would be included in the conservative count - some are, of course, stubs, while others are highly trafficked, linked and/or featured - but I'd say around 4/5 of them, or ~1700. This is not surprising given that the chief part of a community <b>is</b> its people. But why would anyone want to take them out? WikiFur is not Wikipedia - it is intended (in part) as a public directory of members of the furry fandom, and it is used as such by many, who find it convenient to get a summary of facts, accomplishments, and links to further information. We do encourage users to develop public articles about themselves if they are in the fandom, because in this case much of the information that would normally go on user pages <i>is</i> relevant to the topic of the wiki. It is often the topic that new users have the most knowledge about to hand, so they can make a quick contribution, plus it gets them used to having their writing edited. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 21:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I'm just saying as far as measuring WikiFur's notability by article number isn't accurate because most of those articles are written about people who, frankly, don't matter in a global encyclopedic sense any more than I do. So, number of articles probably shouldn't be used to offset the low google results, since the articles are not at all about significant people. Like, it's not like these are essential articles to be knowledgeable about the furry fandom, and many are autobiographical. This is compared to ED (might as well get that out of the way), which, while not a good article candidate in itself in my opinion, has information about famous internet people that you just can't find anywhere else, thus making it a more notable source of its purpose in comparison to WikiFur. I think the very low traffic kind of speaks for itself. I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard not to like insult your wiki and am not expressing myself well and probably insulting it anyway, but I'm doing my best here. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 22:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine, but the only person who's brought up measuring notability by article number (twice) is you. We all know anyone can make a wiki with lots of articles, usually by <a href="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">importing them</a>. The link I pasted above was in reference to editors, as I see community involvement as a big factor in wiki notability. In that sense, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "very low traffic". WikiFur certainly don't get a billion hits a week - more like 120,000 - but then the furry fandom does not have a billion people in it. We're happy with our figures, as they make for a high-traffic site within its domain (especially considering we're not giving out porn&#160;:-). I would argue that this, plus the ability to verify the facts in the article from the given references (which I don't think anyone has disputed), is sufficient reason to keep it.<br />
ED is a discussion apart from this AfD. While I agree with Wikipedia's link policy, I think it should probably have an article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 20:58, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> It IS an ARG. It is only just now beginning, which is why it seems like nothing.
<ul>
<li>Just being an ARG doesn't guarantee anything an encyclopedia article, it would have to be a notable ARG, and not getting any Google hits means it isn't notable. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 04:34, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>, This is a known ARG. This should most definitely be protected though, since it's Microsoft it is a ripe target for vandals.
<ul>
<li>If you would have taken the time to read the rules, you'd know that there are requirements for notability. Moreover, repeatedly stating anonomously that something is definately notable does not make it so outside of the fourth grade. Thirdly, you are looking for the term "keep" instead of "don't delete", not dat anonymous votes are counted. --<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomedae_bf2b.html" title="User:Lomedae">Lomedae</a> 12:31, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>; Protection is the last thing that should be applied to this article since in it's current state it is useless to anyone who does not follow the subject and complete gibberish to those who aren't familiar with the company's previous viral marketing campaigns. The only reason I see to keep it is that the Xbox ARGs have been successful and notable in the past, and it's likely that this will receive a similar following. —<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooK_398d.html" title="User:FlooK">FlooK</a> 13:36, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

Would you rather have it in this shape, or as "I like pooping"? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a>21:58, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - It's a major event in the history of Microsoft/XBOX, and like all widespread riddle-based ARGs, the idea is that they start off with as little information as possible, and end up revealing more than you could have hoped for. Given the huge amount of interest in this page, I see no reason why it should not have an article on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherryMay_10fa.html" title="User:CherryMay">CherryMay</a> 20:29, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>As ManoaChild commented, it is gaining attention rather rapidly. Most game-related sites have posted news articles speculating on its meaning, and given the short time that it has been online, there have been thousands of people trying to solve its mystery (many of which can be seen in internet forums/news discussion articles). Whilst there is only speculation at this point in time, I feel that any solid news, evidence, or factual information should be listed as a current ongoing event. If the website timer expires and the entire site turns out to be a 'generic advertising ploy' after all, with no other site occurrences or 'trails', then by all means the wikipedia entry should be deleted. Until that time, it does seem appropriate to have a wikipedia entry on the subject for its current factual state.
<ul>
<li>As I said in my nomination, there were zero Google hits for this word, how can it be so notable? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 05:21, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, now there are about 6000 Google hits on Origenxbox360, all speculation. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 06:15, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clean up</b> If the information it contains is organised properly, with external links for more information and theories (putting all the theories in one Wiki article would be silly), I see no reason for this to be deleted... it's an ARG that's only just beginning, so granted there is only a small amount of information for now... but within the next 30 days, something else is bound to come up about it. --<a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicFalcon_8991.html" title="User:CosmicFalcon">CosmicFalcon</a> 13:51, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This text is of dubious encyclopedic nature, and shouldn't exist by itself.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I do not understand the reasoning behing this nomination. The list of trustees of an institution is very well defined.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the article is kept, it think it would be preferable if it was <i>not</i> just a list of <i>current</i> trustees, as that will soon be dated unless maintained, but a historical list, including all trustees in chronological order from the foundation of the school with years for their election and resignation. There seem to be enough people around here interested in Caltechcruft to make such a list. BTW, noting that the list was uncategorized, I just added a new Caltech category to contain this and other Caltech-related articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now (for people a little into the thing, it's notable enough). I too would opt for userfy and left the {{<a href="../../../a/n/o/Template%7EAnon_493b.html" title="Template:Anon">anon</a>}} template on the userpage, and I especially don't agree with the OR mentioned above; he's just trying to make (literal)translations. The problem is that the author picked some of the less important letters/treaties (the hittite/egyptian peace treaty after the battle of Kadesh would have been a better start). It reads just so awkward because it's difficult to translate cuneiform and hieroglyhs into <i>modern</i> languages. E.g., the name Hattusili (thats hittite), if written in cuneiform and literally translated would become somthing like gispasidingirlim (so you write gispasidingirlim and read Hattusili) <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 12:29, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pedantic, OT question for Lectonar. A long time ago, I took a class on Hittite, &amp; from what I remember your example about "Hattusili" actually being "gispasidingirlim" doesn't make sense. Are those the original Sumeric values of the cuneiform characters? If so, wouldn't it be more accurate to represent "gispasidingirlim" as (guessing here) "GIŠ-PAS-IDIN-GIR-LIM", or something similar? But I do agree with your point, that the spelling in these ancient documents can be problematic; it is fascinating to compare how the names of well-known Egyptian pharaohs are transliterated into cuneiform with their spelling in the native Egyptian texts, e.g. "Wasmuaria satepnareya" (cuneiform) with "Usermaatra Setepenra Rameses" (Egyptian), suggesting that the scribes fossilized Egyptian spelling much as has been done in modern English or French. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:26, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Leave fans to bicker on messageboards, not on Wikipedia. You can't verify the numbers, since there is no universal body to tabulate these figures. Fans will obviously use estimates to suit their own POV.For example: <i>"According to Dion's Wikipedia article, she has sold 184 million albums and 28 million singles, making her total worldwide sales 212 million. Her record company is not as certain about the sales of her singles. They state that she has sold 28 million singles, but they are not sure about the sales in other French-speaking parts of the world."</i> That's cringeworthy for a suppoesdly encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 18:43, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Elections under party lists in regions Russian Federations</dd>
<dd>Elections are spent to a regional legislature of the Russian Federation by the mixed principle: half of deputies is selected under party lists, and half — in one-mandatory constituencies with a different through passage level. Thus the information presented below, concerns only half of deputy case in each separate region. Some parties are united in selective blocks. Participation партсписков since July 2003 is obligatory.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> for poesybeat folks: No one is claiming it does not exist, we're just trying to enforce a certain standard of <i>notability</i> to merit an encyclopedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough -- it is indeed a "new and non-widespread artform." If that causes it to fall below the standard of inclusion for Wikipedia, then so be it. It seems to me that one advantage of Wikipedia over the long-standing, non-democratic encyclopedias is its ability to pick up on innovations.

<li><b>Comment</b> to address your concerns: The cities it links can be much better communicated using a map, not an article. Provinces maintain a lot of roads, this does not make it notable. <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_101.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 101">Hwy 101</a> consists of one sentence, therefore notability not established. Same with <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_138.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 138">Hwy 138</a> but it did get to two sentences. <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_69.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 69">Hwy 69</a> is part of the Trans Canada Hwy, so it is notable and a keep. Putting two sentence summaries beside a name on a list is not a major reorganization. The article length can be shorten by sticking to relevant information and by remaining on topic. The current list goes into secondary and tertiary highways which should be placed into a sub list and noted on the main page as 'other highways' or what have you. -<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 22:07, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>By major reorganization I meant changing the format from a list of links, and the separate articles being as detailed as necessary to a list and two sentences for each highway, with a link to a separate article for more <i>notable</i> highways. (BTW, I fixed up hwy 140's two sentences a bit.) This is changing the format of an entire category. And what exactly makes a highway <i>notable</i>? The federal government designating it as "Trans-Canada"? A considerable amount of people using it? In my opinion a <b>King's Highway</b> (forgot to mention it before) is just as notable as an electoral district. Also, I am not sure about this -- is it possible to somehow link to the highway's entry on the big page? Otherwise, the user might get mightily confused when he gets the list of every highway in Ontario rather than the info of the one highway he's looking for. --qviri 00:50, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Hoax</b>. There's been something about this article that just didn't <i>feel</i> right to me, &amp; after a bit of research learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information in the first paragraph is a giveaway to anyone familiar with Ethiopian history. (I can go into more detail elsewhere, but to say that Ethiopia had a "government protemp" in 1745 is nonsensical.)</li>
<li>A quick search in a couple of books on Ethiopia fail to find a mention of Shilavo, which include Henze's <i>Layers of History</i> &amp; the <i>Bradt Travel Guide to Ethiopia</i>; if this was an important comercial center in the 18th century, I'd expect Pankhurst's <i>History of Ethiopian Towns</i> to at least mention it -- &amp; he does discuss or mention the history of over 50 other historic population centers in the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horn_of_Africa_5bbd.html" title="Horn of Africa">Horn of Africa</a>.</li>
<li>Yes, there is a place in Ethiopia called "Shilavo". However, most of the hits from Google are to articles mirrored from Wikipedia, but one or two do allow us to learn that this community has an airport/airstrip (call letters "HIL"), &amp; is located at 44 deg. 46' E &amp; 6 deg 5' N -- the middle of the <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a>, hardly the place to attract commercial farms, let alone industry in the late 19th century.</li>
<li>A little more searching revealed that it is also known as "Scillave", possibly the Italian spelling. Google on this, &amp; you find <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ET/7/Shilabo.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ET/7/Shilabo.html" rel="nofollow">this hit</a> at fallingrain.com. Based on this, Shivalo/Scillave is a small village of about 733 population.</li>
<li>Let's take a look at the original author of this article: an anon IP, which can be resolved to a DSL account in Chicago. Am I the only one to smell the rotting fish at this point?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Hoax</b>.

<p><b>Delete</b> A silly article about an insignificant movie character, with uncited sources, that reads way too much into the movie 65.49.152.201 21:14, 21 August 2005 (UTC) <b>Keep</b> {The written quality of the article is done to a high degree of effectiveness and a quick IMDB.com search of Roy Chiao will indeed verify that the actor, who portrayed Lao Che in the film, did indeed die from complications and heart disease in China in 1999. The Temple of Doom was also indeed criticised for its perceived racial undertones, especially later during the Indian sequences of the movie. These facts are indisputable. To remove an article simply because it relates to a "minor film character" would be entirely counter-productive to the very purpose of having Wikipedia -- that is to say, inform the public and provide as much information as possible on an infinite number of topics and listings.} -65.49.152.227 21:37, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm finding a few cases of bands (or their labels) identifying themselves as Vampyric black metal, or it appearing in somebody's fansite or a record-selling site. For instance, <a href="http://www.fmp666.com/relea.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fmp666.com/relea.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://www.redstream.org/Cadaveria-Far-Away-From-Conformity_RD9343.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redstream.org/Cadaveria-Far-Away-From-Conformity_RD9343.php" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, or <a href="http://www.rusmetal.ru/vae_solis/lycanthropy.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rusmetal.ru/vae_solis/lycanthropy.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Note that the third one almost explicitly ID's the phrase as a neologism. Also, of the 396 google hits for {"vampyric black metal" -wikipedia}, I noticed a number of them on the first three pages presenting it as "'vampyric' black metal," further suggesting that this is a neologism for a particular flavor of black metal. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 07:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Talking about genres that don't exist... new genres arise every day. Look at how many exist already. It's because everyone wants to be different. I don't think this topic should be deleted because you say the genre doesn't exist... it may exist, it's just not a wide-known genre.</li>

<p><b>keep</b> - the issue of emo fashion needs to be a separate topic from the music itself. either that, or somehow connect it more directly with the "scene kids" article. -chadski</p>
<p><b>Redirect</b> - most of the content is extremely subjective. for instance, i have never heard of 'refused' getting credited for that hairstyle. on top of that, when you click on the link to the 'refused' page, there is a picture of refused, and none of them are sporting the said hairstyle. furthermore, the part about weezer doesn't make grammatical sense, and anyway weezer displayed the previously-established 'indie-rock' look.</p>

From looking at <a href="../../../t/o/s/User%7EToshiba_e007.html" title="User:Toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s multiple edits of the Douglas article this is actually a dispute over content.

I never wanted any of it to begin with, felt like I did everything to try to accomodate Toshiba but even the most basic facts were ignored/deleted (e.g. that Laura was in fact driving the car, and not Judy Dyke).

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../t/o/s/User%7EToshiba_e007.html" title="User:Toshiba">Toshiba</a>, I would appreciate very much if you would stop deleting large portions of the article. And that the 'multiple users' that sometimes follow you around would cease to do the same. I've urged you plenty times to discuss any specifics (style of language etc) that you might disagree with on the talkpage but with no luck so far. As you are aware of, there's the police report photo (that you can enlarge) on the page, yet you seem to want to delete information that is verifiable to anyone who reads the report. You also insert a lot of information that contradicts the report. Also, you seem to want to delete any information regarding the person Michael Dutton Douglas which might be one reason the article is a stub. One of the reasons the Laura Bush segment on MDD is similar is because you do the same things to that paragraph. Of course the subject matter is notable, Wikipedia is about collecting all human knowledge and so far there's has been at least four LB biographies that discusses the subjectmatter, plenty of newspaper articles and entries on many other web resources, including Snopes. If included in the Laura Bush article the subject would simply become too dominating. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">saxet</a> 00:47, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Some death victims <b>are</b> notable, despite this new "no killing victim articles on Wikipedia" trend, especially one killed by a future First Lady of the United States.
