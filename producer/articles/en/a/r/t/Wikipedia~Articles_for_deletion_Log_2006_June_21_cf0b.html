<dd>Thank you for the civilized discussion, Deizzio. I have a number of observations to make in regard to this AfD request:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. What? Are we running out of disk space? &lt;wink&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Let us concede that the number of minutes a page has stood unedited is no factor in its future editing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Note that no concern has been expressed over the following, whose notabililty is entirely reliant on familial relationships to the powerful and famous: a) US First Ladies; b) Other US gubanatorial spouses, many of whom are first ladies/gentlemen of populations larger than several European nations; c) the spouses and offspring of any of the various European royalty; d) <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiloh_Nouvel_Jolie_547d.html" title="Shiloh Nouvel Jolie">Shiloh Nouvel Jolie</a>. Certainly, marriage to famous people <i>does</i>, in many cases, confer notability. Or shall we AfD Mrs. Clinton?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. It is difficult to understand why Mr. Gregoire, more than any other gubantorial spouse, is the focus of concern. Surely he's at least as notable as 2/3 of the other folks on in the Spouse of Governors category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. Inasmuch as Governor Gregoire's politics have -- <i>allegedly</i> -- been intertwined with her husband's business, it seems to me that Mr. Gregoire, perhaps more than any other gubanatorial spouse, is in need of a stand-alone page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>6. Let it be known, I couldn't give a mouse's backside about Mr. Gregoire. But the same is true of my interest in <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_Madison_d47d.html" title="Dolly Madison">Dolly Madison</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Brown_Simpson_0fc1.html" title="Nicole Brown Simpson">Nicole Brown Simpson</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>. We could AfD 'em all, for all I care. But Mr. Gregoire is neither more nor less notable than any of the others. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 23:48, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't see an article for Patty Blagojevich. US First Lady is a very high-profile position. US state governor's spouses generally aren't. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:45, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Marriage to a person who does meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> test does not satisfy the test. If one's notability is <i>entirely</i> dependent on that of another, then that person is not notable. The examples given by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> do not support the thesis that marriage to a "notable" person conveys notability. They are people who have notability in their own right, who have managed to parlay the advantages of being married to a notable person into achieving their own personal notability, or have played a significant role in the reason for their spouse's notability. The interesting trivia that this person is the first "first gentleman" of Washington can be included in Ms. Gregoire's article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:12, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

And to respond to the numbered comments above: irrelevant; irrelevant to point of being insulting; First Ladies are in the news a LOT, prove it, see first subsection answer, wrong -- try clicking that link, and Hilary Rodham Clinton is an elected US Senator -- asking rhetorical question is bad enough but asking <i>stupid</i> rhetorical questions is far worse; your difficulty in understanding is not our problem; there's not a shred of a breath of a mention of that in the article -- source?; and for someone who doesn't care at all, you've spent a fair number of words ladling out the smokescreen. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:12, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Could we be a little more civil please? You could easily have made the point that Mr. Gregoire is not as notable as Senator Clinton without being insulting.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article is not verified. Off the top of my head, my former employer <i>Camp William Hinds</i> is older. Checking online it is past its 75th anniversary now. It is a <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">BSA</a> camp. Many of the early BSA Councils opened camps in the first few years of their existence and they would thus be over 70 years now. I suspect that there are plenty of old summer camps. Even the article limits the claim to "first ... independent Christian camp in Texas" - which makes me think there were non-independent Christian camps in Texas before them, and probably also camps that were not explicitly Christian. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:57, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article appears to be original research and a personal essay, and hence not appropriate for Wikipedia. I have seen no evidence that the phrase "Tolerances versus preferences" is widely used in any field, and a request on the talk page in October 2005 asking for references has not brought any positive response. The only users who have substantially contributed new material to the article or supported it in the talk page are the banned <a href="../../../j/r/r/User%7EJRR_Trollkien_70d5.html" title="User:JRR Trollkien">User:JRR Trollkien</a>, the banned user <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">user:EntmootsOfTrolls</a>, and the <a href="../../../1/4/2/User%7E142.html" title="User:142">original anonymous contributor</a>, also banned (who could well in fact be the same individual as the two banned users, based on the editing history). <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 00:50, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> MUSIC says notable if released 2 or more albums on a notable record company, and theirs both has a page, and according to that page, seems to have released things from some other notable groups. Seems to me this satisfies "Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)." Not saying keep just yet cause I don't really know anything about them, the label, or anything, but it appears to me to qualify. If I could ask the above why they felt it did not? -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 02:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Keep in mind that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a guidline not a hardfast rule and editors may look for more than just meeting a part of this guideline when making their decision. In this case, it should be noted that the group has not yet released an album on <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobster_Records_f9ff.html" title="Lobster Records">Lobster Records</a>, they released the prior ones by themselves as far as I can tell. In addition, I personally look for independent reviews of released albums and/or of a performance. Currently this band's album will not be "dropping" until next year and their current tour has a bunch of TBA's as to where they will be playing next. Based on these factors I feel they are not yet notable, although I certainly wish them luck. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 03:01, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Read the article more carefully. They are <i>"currently signed to <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobster_Records_f9ff.html" title="Lobster Records">Lobster Records</a>"</i>. Their previous releases are all listed as <i>"Independant"</i>, which can mean anything from myspace to selling CDs out of the trunk of their car. It does not appear that they in fact have released anything on a major label yet. Many bands sign with record companies, but end up not releasing an album, or they do and it sells 37 copies.

<li>Not looking to argue... just want it on the record: Wiki editors/admin need to loosen their policy on record releases. The business is very different now.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree that only relying an a assumed "2 record minimum rule" is not a good idea, but this band's only claim to fame appears to be being signed with Lobster Records. They've not yet toured or released anything with a label, the work they released themselves doesn't seem to have gotten any awards and they fail every other WP:MUSIC criterion there is. I don't think there's anything else notable in the article that warrant us to step away from the criteria listed. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Authorial Comment</b> - Er... people keep on forwarding this to me telling its been up for deletion a few times, so thought I should actually say a piece to try and get it sorted one way or another. I'd write up the entry myself, as it's clearly not up to par, but I really hate the ego-ification of Wikipedia: subjects clearly shouldn't write their own entry. Why did someone think me worth listing? I'd guess it was because I was the gentleman who coined the phrase New Games Journalism, which *does* have its own entry and kind of precipitated the whole debate about games journalism that's bubbled along for the last two years and annoyed just about everyone (Which is why I was cited in that New York Times Article, a few other hefty academic books, the occasional academic course and get invited to go speak at conferences and such - I started a "movement", God Damn Me). As far as I was aware, I was the first guy who won a real world award for his games writing back in 2000 when I won the PTC Best New Specialist Journalist award (Against people from the NME, New Scientist, Health and Fitness, etc). I've written for videogames, such as the script for the game Chaos League. Comics wise, god knows how Phonogram will be taken, but it's already had noted creators like Warren Ellis say that it's one of the top three singles of the year. And working for magazine-wise, I've worked for Wired, The Guardian newspaper (Where I wrote the first long-form videogame review in a mainstream newspaper ever), Edge, PC Gamer, Games Developer, Develop, MCV, Gamesmaster, PC Format and far too many others. Hopefully that's enough stuff to sort it out one way or another and stop people mailing me about it. In terms of comments on the entry, I don't think either Commercial Suicide or Kenickie.com are really that relevant. Generally speaking, keep up the good work. Wikipedia remains one of the marvels of the modern world. [Kieron Gillen] 18:00 21 June 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li>This is a printer error message, true, but not just any.... Well written and has sources. I'd say merge to the appropriate printer article, but it seems to cover multiple printers. Merging it to the Office Space article isn't right either. (It doesn't make sense to propose a merge as TBC does, if you can't say exactly where, cleanly... that's an argument that, if notable enough, the article needs to stand alone) It should stand on its own. <b>Keep</b> or, if you must, merge but then make sure that ALL the other articles that reference it are properly corrected to point to the right section of whereever it ends up.

<li>It doesn't. However we sometimes use as an argument for delete "This topic needs an article, but this one here under consideration isn't it, it's not well written and reflects badly on WP and there is no evidence anyone has worked on it lately to make it better...", thinking that it is better not to have any article than a very poor one. The comment was addressing that argument, should it be raised (which it hasn't been). Sorry for lack of clarity. The key point is that this term is notable enough to merit an article, or some exposition, and trying to force fit it somewhere won't work well, too many different places reference it. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps to some individuals, particular those who may not be "tech-minded", the phrase might appear pointless; but then, aren't any number of obscure topics which are uninteresting/unknown to the masses also "pointless"?

<li>I can see that being badly written would push an article over the edge to be deleted, but I don't think it applies in the reverse situation. Yes the article is well written, but that doesnt overide that fact that its about an error code on a printer. Most of the notability seems to be attributed to its uses for a joke in a movie - in which case, it should have a short mention in the movie's page. However when voting merge, I am not reffering to the entire article. A short description of what it is and what it means followed by its significance as a cultural reference spawned by that movie.

<li>The point here is not the diagnosis itself, but rather that HP missed the mark in developing this term for not thinking globally enough. That miss is (within limited scope) culturally significant given how widespread it is, and it has entered popular culture (again, within limited scope). Doesn't really belong on the movie page in my view, rather with the relevant printer (but which one? it applies to many) Hence not mergable. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, merge where appropriate. If it is notable for being in Office Space then that is where the mention belongs. If there is a band with that name—and there are numerous bands named after all sorts of common or clever phrases—then if the band is notable it will have its own article. Note that the main reason it gets more hits (which without office space references is about 30,000, not 70,000) is that it is a much more common error than for example "PC Load Legal" or "PC Load A4", because Letter-sized paper is far more common. "Paper jam", which gets more than 300,000 hits, does not have an article. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 20:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is pretty funny. The feeling at CFD seems to be that only the most important groupings ought to be Categories. Just imaging if every movie ranking were a Category, how many Categories would be at the bottom of articles about famous movies.

<li><b>Avada Kedavra</b> this one. It's not encyclopaedic in the slightest, as it does nothing but summarise a single chapter of a book, including lots of quotes that are probably significant copyvios. This page could only justifiably exist if a page for every other chapter of every other <i>Potter</i> book existed, as there's no reason for it to be singled out above the rest. And if a page for every chapter of <i>any</i> book existed, it would be a completely ludicrous state of affairs. Are people likely to search for this chapter title, though?

<li>I think perhaps the nominator did not do his research on this one, as this is pretty clearly notable.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - MichaelBillington's googling technique is silly and I don't buy Mgm's argument. If some barely, if at all, notable actor (playing "the boogeyman" is his most notable film appearance?) is in a film, that doesn't make the film notable in my book. Being listed on IMDB certainly doesn't imply notability.

<dd><b>comment</b> I did not search for page creators when deleting, and one would think if I was in bad faith seeking a "revenge" upon TRFS I would nominate those Wikipedia articles written on TRFS' own fan films, even though they have been acknowledged by Lucasfilm. In fact, I looked only, as I said in my original nomination, for those articles I did not feel made a sufficient enough claim of notability. And, as TRFS has heard me say before, a nomination for deletion is not a deletion itself, merely a statement that the community needs to review this and attempt to come to a consensus as to whether it has a place here. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 14:53, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment: An bare assertion, by itself, is not, I agree. But if the assertion is supported with evidence of failure to find notability in the expected places, and thus there is good reason to believe the subject is in fact not notable, that is sufficient cause to remove the article. It is my view that Peter Haynes is notable, for several reasons, in several areas, as I outlied above, but notability IS a valid and important thing to measure articles with, IMHO. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Interestingly enough, I don't find the text "any retard with a computer" anywhere on that link you provided. Regardless, focus on the "weaker" reference if you want, but the NZ Short film links are the key - it's a major film competition in that county, done with the co-operation of Peter Jackson. I'd say that easily counts as credible. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 16:54, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you see that little box on the left of the splurd site? It apparently loads a random phrase above the "click to read Splurd's comics," one of which is "Proof that any retard with a computer can make a webcomic." Hit "refresh" a few times, and you'll see it. As far as the New Zealand Short film contest goes, they seem to list around 4000 "filmmakers" <a href="http://www.nzshortfilm.com/filmmakers.sm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzshortfilm.com/filmmakers.sm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Are you suggesting we should have articles on all of these people? I don't think so. What I'm looking for (and what Wikipedia requires) are "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," such as major newspapers, magazines, etc. Not film contest web sites with hundreds or thousands of contestants, or amateur webcomics bloggers. If the security guard near Mark Hammill's house is getting more press than this filmmaker, then we probably shouldn't have an article on this filmmaker. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 02:56, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All 4000 entrants? Probably not. Repeat finalist in film contests? That's rather a different bar though. Association with notable people confers (a small dollop) of their notability. Peter Jackson is mega-mega-notable, and his association with Peter Haynes confers (a small dollop) of notability on Peter Haynes.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's verifiable (and verified), NPOV and not OR. Those are the three necessary criteria; notability doesn't have as much consensus on Wikipedia as a criterion for inclusion but even there it has enough, I feel, to be included along with 1,000,000+ articles. It's like libraries. The little local one will only have major works in English, works which are likley to be consulted every month, at least. [[[Widener Library]] at Harvard, has 3 million books including shelves of things in Sanskrit or medieval Catalan, works that might be consulted once every half century. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 13:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This list has been around for several years, but its definition and purpose seem vaguely defined. While I suppose I grasp that this is a list of "famous public personae", I question the need for a list of this sort, and whether it is encyclopedic in nature. I can't really decide where I think this information belongs, but I don't think it merits its own article -- and I certainly don't think it deserves <i>this</i> article, which is sparse, confusing, disjointed, and unmaintainable as written. <b>Delete</b> as unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:57, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Well for a kickoff, the title surely falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate information</a> - an inherently unmaintainable list. In addition, the article itself is extremely garbled and confusingly-written, and the list itself is arguably inaccurate. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Cooper_62c7.html" title="Alice Cooper">Alice Cooper</a> aren't "characters", they're pseudonyms. It strikes me that such a debate could arise over any number of potential subjects in this article. There's just far too much ambiguity - <a href="../../../z/i/g/Ziggy_Stardust_12cd.html" title="Ziggy Stardust">Ziggy Stardust</a> is surely just a fictional character? <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Partridge_33fe.html" title="Alan Partridge">Alan Partridge</a> is a fictional character who sometimes interacts with "real" people - should he go in there? Completely unmaintainable, far too much possibility for debate over what should and shouldn't qualify, and therefore it's just not Wikipedia-fodder. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 10:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This company is not an MLM. I am not sure where you got that impression, but that accusation is false. Celebrity Foods does use job sites on the web to recruit sales representatives, customer service reps, warehouse workers, etc., but none are the for the use as an MLM. In response to this being a copyright violation, this is also a false accusation, as this was written and revised based upon the things that I know about the company. Finally, the fact that a Google search was performed and there are some dissatisfied customers, this should not have anything to do with this article being nominated for deletion. I am sure that Wikipedia has articles on other items that are disliked by people, yet those entries remain. Numerous revisions have been made in an attempt to be accepted, yet I am unsure what needs to be edited to make this sound less like an advertisement. This is all factual information about Celebrity Foods presented for the purposes of providing basic information. Advertisement is not the aim. What suggestions or links to assistance can you provide to help? --User.Celebrityfoods</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, in principle. Normally, I don’t care if an article on a pornographic movie/actor/actress/whatever survives or fails an AfD nomination. However, the nomination for this and the other pornography-related articles by this editor does not provide any substantive reasoning to support the allegation of insufficient notability.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> My boyfriend and I were listening to HP6 on audiobook, and I wondered if there was a list somewhere online of all the points awarded and taken away in the Harry Potter books. We both independently thought of Wikipedia. It would be interesting to look through a list of all the points ever awarded and why, and where else on the web could you find something like this? I know it's seriously incomplete because I don't have the time to go through all 6 books by myself. It would be a monumental task for one person, but if 20 people each found 15 examples, it would all come together easily. And that is why I turned to Wikipedia. If you have to delete me I understand, but if you could help and find just a few examples, then I'm sure there would be lots of people who would appreciate the end result. Thanks for your consideration. &lt;3 <a href="../../../o/a/t/User%7EOatmealpie_2578.html" title="User:Oatmealpie">oatmealpie</a> 14:52, 22 June 2006</li>
<li>I know that, at heart, the Wikipedia is designed to create an encyclopedia for the people, a perfect shining image of the knowledge garnered without censorship and politic. But this theory makes the assumption that people are perfect, and that trick never works. Wikipedia, in my mind, should be for the amalgamation of as much documented information as possible, and House Cup Points just happens to fall under that category.<br />
If the rest of this community disagrees with me, you will delete this topic, and there's nothing I can do about that. All I can do is to attempt to persuade you otherwise. This slash and burn editing will lead only to the false elitism and ignorant hierarchy that plague online bulletin boards and chat rooms. If you have nothing to add to the topic, leave it alone and it will die of it's own accord, but don't actively call for deletion on no grounds better than "It's a silly topic".<br />
<i>I encourage you all to remember that if it was a topic considered of vital importance that everyone can agree on, the Britannica already covers it.</i><br />

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm conflicted enough that I can't "vote", but maybe I can provide enough information for other people to be able to. See the <a href="http://www.adultfilmdatabase.com/index.cfm/Action/DV/VideoID/31581/Swedish_Erotica_12/" class="external text" title="http://www.adultfilmdatabase.com/index.cfm/Action/DV/VideoID/31581/Swedish_Erotica_12/" rel="nofollow">AFDb entry</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222412/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222412/" rel="nofollow">IMDb entry</a> for the film. In favor of keeping it would be that: the movie is part of a notable series (Swedish Erotica); it is chock full of other notable actors (the legendary <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Holmes_5d3a.html" title="John Holmes">John Holmes</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Gillis_06c4.html" title="Jamie Gillis">Jamie Gillis</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliet_Anderson_ab6c.html" title="Juliet Anderson">Juliet Anderson</a>); it is the only appearance of <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambi_Woods_50b9.html" title="Bambi Woods">Bambi Woods</a> outside <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Does_Dallas_f560.html" title="Debbie Does Dallas">Debbie Does Dallas</a>; finally, it does get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+12%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+12%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">13,300 Google hits</a>, which is certainly Googlebombing, but compare it to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+11%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+11%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">677 Google hits for "Swedish Erotica 11"</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+13%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Swedish+Erotica+13%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">529 for "Swedish Erotica 13"</a>. In favor of deletion would be that it is just another compilation film, no real plot; number 12 in a series; and while the article we have can be expanded from the IMDB plot summary and actors listing, it will never be longer than 2-3 paragraphs. For what it is worth, if it is kept, I'm willing to expand it to that. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>move</b> to Swedish Erotica and <b>expand</b> into an article on the Swedish Erotica series. This was a very notable series of films, but there were, of course, dozens of them, so doing an individual article on each might be pushing it. IMO this particular film passes the (non-policy) <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a> guidelines (which I stress again are <i>not</i> policy and should not be used as the sole deciding factor), and would make a good starting point for a larger article on the series itself (although at the present time it's little more than a stub). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:31, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First, Mike, it seems like 80% of those could be <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a> and should not appear on AfD unless they're contested. Second, Agent 86, <strike>yes, you're way in <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> territory.</strike> As you point out, what is under discussion here is the article, not the nominator. Some nominators help their case by making a pitch for deletion, others don't. But in the end it has to be the article to make its case for inclusion, not the nominator for exclusion. If you're voting keep on an article without merit because you have an issue with the nominator you're disrupting WP to make your point. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:15, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Follow up</b>. Please note that I in no way made any issue about the nominator or any sort of ad hominem argument. My issue is clearly with the article. My concern about <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was that I might be verging on the edge of it by responding to each nomination; however, the nominator chose to make multiple nominations and therefore there is nothing wrong with responding to each. On re-reading POINT I see that, in my opinion, I've done nothing contrary to it. In any event, I think I succinctly made my position clear that I am commenting (not <i>voting</i>, as AfD is not a vote) on the articles and was <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> about it. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 14:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> OK. I was saying this mostly because you pointed it out yourself, but I'll strike it and apologize. Nevertheless, stick with the articles at hand and not the nomination. Articles have to provide proof positive and not nominators proof positive. If you don't think <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is a viable criterion, stick to checking whether <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> are fulfilled. <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is only a shorthand for saying that the article hasn't attracted enough outside attention to meet those three policies. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I recall this was one of the more notable pornographic films that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traci_Lords_8a29.html" title="Traci Lords">Traci Lords</a> starred in. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electric_Blue_28_%28second_nomination%29_d896.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric Blue 28 (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Electric_Blue_28_(second_nomination)</a> - which was kept around on much weaker grounds. Only a "weak" keep until I can find documentation saying so, but my memory tells me this was one of her more famous films before the scandal. Side note, Agent 86 is doing nothing wrong in his comments and recommendations. Nominator has nominated a slew of articles for deletion all at once, with the exact same explanation or lack thereof for each one. Rather than assuming each to be trying to disrupt the Wikipedia, I'm assuming good faith for both. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are three links to other publications on the page, it's improperly sourced but it is sourced. Booking, tabling, etc. are covered in the Seoul Times article. I've personally been to a K-Club before (not that particular one) and the experience sounds quite similar, it should not be hard to find (more) solid secondary sources for this article and quite easy to trim off the OR excesses. The article probably should be renamed K-Club instead, but that's another matter. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 07:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article was not sourced at the time of the original PROD. I looked for references but did not find these, only a few mentions in blogs and personal pages. I could see an article about K-Clubs or "booking"; perhaps someone more knowledgeable about the scene could make the article more general.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Don't remove the AFD tag on the page Glovste. All it does is allow the AFD to continue without potential Raasta fans knowing about it. If you really want to help your case, look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and make an argument that it fits under one of these criteria, attacks on professionalism isn't going to sway anyone. That said, I looked at the page, and I'm not convinced it's a national chart. It seems to be a chart for listens on that particular website. Yet, if they're a non-English language band (like song title would suggest), then the Google test might be irrelevant. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 06:42, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> 28,000 listens in a country with 164,000,000 people? That means 0.017% of the population of Pakistan has listened to it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:37, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Dunno how you got the figure of 28K listens. Is it that 28k albums are sold? If so, the listenership wd be much higher, 'coz the average family size in pakistan wd be much higher than a western household. Also, ppl. don't need to buy a single (In India, the no. of singles released could be counted on the fingers of one hand; dunno abt Pakistan though) to listen to it, thanks to FM radio and cable TV. If you are refering to the 28, 000 listens mentioned on the website, it refers to the no. of times people listened to it on the website and not total listens. Given the literacy levels and internet access in Pakistan, i don't think too many ppl wd be logging on to the website to listen to the song. But on radio and TV, they can listen. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 07:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> Yeah, I get the point. Have I 'vandalised' since the multiple warnings? No, I have not. So why are you repeating yourself, when it clearly does not appear necessary. Secondly, what you've written here and tagged as <b>Response</b> is hardly a response to the comment I left about the band's notability - to access those pages all you need to do is register yourself a free account, which takes less than 2 minutes, and being a wikipedia 'admin' you are obliged to do whatever it takes to ascertain the worthiness of an article, so I'm sure you will have the time for that. Your reply seemed more a case of letting out your personal frustration on me just because I removed your comments a couple of times. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 124.168.76.159 (<a href="../../../1/2/4/User_talk%7E124.168.76.159.html" title="User talk:124.168.76.159">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_124.168.76.159_1684.html" title="Special:Contributions/124.168.76.159">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You are not in the position to remove my comments from this page. You are invited to respond to them, but if you remove them you're liable to be blocked for it. Also please sign your comments with four tildes ~~~~ so that we don't have to do it for you. About the pages you linked to, I don't see why I should sign up. I did a search for <a href="http://www.pakmanzil.com/revamped/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Search&amp;file=index" class="external text" title="http://www.pakmanzil.com/revamped/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Search&amp;file=index" rel="nofollow">Raasta</a> in the search field and came up with no articles and 2 downloads.

<li><b>Response</b>**** The point about comment removal has been understood already and you do not have to continue going on about that. Since I have not removed any more of your comments ever since those warnings, there is no question of me being blocked for it, so I'm sure that we have both said enough on the topic of content removal and subsequent banning now. Any further attempts by you to continue to rave on about that topic should, and would be deemed as harassment, and otherwise futile at best. Now regading the 'burden of proof', it seems that you have a habit of stating the obvious, or shall I say, answering questions that were never even asked in the first place. I simply do not need to be told that it is my responsibility to demonstrate the validity of my article, rather than you trying to prove the invalidity thereof, because I already know that, and that is precisely what I am doing here. By directing you to proceed to a URL where this band's song is also the top rated, is precisely me 'providing proof positive', and you having to register an account on that website is simply part of the process in me providing that 'proof positive'. Nobody asked you to provide 'proof negative'. ~ signed <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 124.168.76.159 (<a href="../../../1/2/4/User_talk%7E124.168.76.159.html" title="User talk:124.168.76.159">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_124.168.76.159_1684.html" title="Special:Contributions/124.168.76.159">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Such a list makes finding such parodies a lot easier. Or would you prefer surfing every single episode article? I would however include rigid rules about what to include and what not. The body in the film "Stand By Me" wasn't found in the sewers but near a train track. So either it was a parody of the book, or not related at all.

<p>Simpsonscruft - the potential for this list to expand is very large, given the sheer number a) of Simpsons episodes, of which I would warrant nearly every single one contains parodies of celebrities, (b) the sheer density of parodies actually present in each particular episode and (c) the record-holding status of the show with regards to celebrity guest appearances, practically all of whom poke fun at themselves (parody could mean anything from the guest appearance of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> in a jetpack to more indirect parody characters such as <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty_the_Klown_e44b.html" title="Krusty the Klown">Krusty the Klown</a> as a parody of the TV clown <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusty_Nails_3981.html" title="Rusty Nails">Rusty Nails</a>.

<li>It is not whether the book is notable or not that is under discussion. It is whether the <u>article</u> on the book is notable (or asserts notability sufficiently and in a referenceable manner). I see you have worked on the article to start to seek to assert that notability. For me it is not enough to change my nomination yet. For others it may be sufficient. This is the entire purpose of this nomination: Either to have the article improved by one who has the knowledge to improve it, or to have it deleted. It is not rhetoric that preserves articles, but good work. Thank you for starting that work. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Remember <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a>, the general audience of Wikipedia probably does not have the background or knowlege about Islam to recognize when a book covering it is notable. As the originator of an article covering a topic where there are probably very few experts involved in en.wikipedia, the onus really falls on you to flesh out these articles and justify their notability. You can't expect the average user to come along and even have an idea where to start expanding an article like this.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dream Disciples have toured the UK and Europe many times and have played at the huge WGT music festival in Germany and headlined the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitby_Gothic_Weekend_ccbb.html" title="Whitby Gothic Weekend">Whitby Gothic Weekend</a> in England; they have released several albums on indie labels; they have been featured in many music magazines and had at least one member who was once a part of a band that is otherwise notable. This is a band that easily satisfies the notabilty criteria. ---- Constantine-x
<ul>
<li>Please cite specifics and give some sort of sourcing. I'm not saying that this isn't true, but I've had a hard time finding any definitive information source to indicate notability. Releasing albums on non-notable indie labels is not notable. Features in non-notable magazines is also not notable. I'm not unwilling to bow to reason here, I'm searching for some legitimate citations that I can point to and say "this is why I am working to fix this piece of crap article instead of deleting it." --<a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVengeful_Cynic_111e.html" title="User:Vengeful Cynic">Vengeful Cynic</a> 19:58, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A band only has to satisfy one of the criteria in order to be 'notable'. Having a member from an otherwise notable band means that this band meets the required standard. I would also suggest that Resurrection Records is a 'notable' indie label given that they include the likes of <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkubus_Sukkubus_fa58.html" title="Inkubus Sukkubus">Inkubus Sukkubus</a> on their roster. -- Constantine-x 16 June 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Given the European tours, albums spanning a decade, link to another notable band (via Karl North) and presence outside of mass media traditions (mention in the last two Mick Mercer books plus goth magazines -- "publications devoted to a notable sub-culture") I believe they fulfil at least five of the listed Wikipedia criteria to be notable. 80.189.249.6 21:40, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> they are very notable in their genre, Wikipedia has always ensured coveradge for Indie/Cult/Genre culture as well as the mainstream. I assume no-one is suggesting that only bands/films/books that make the top 20 in their respective sales/box office chart are worthy of inclusion. Gonzo 10:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Dream Disciples were Signed to Dik Brothers records, the label owned by Fish of Marillion and did a 100+ Date tour supporting Fish in the Early 90s

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: notable band on the UK gothic scene in the 1990s and early 2000s. Extensive touring, signed to major UK goth independent label, sold a decent number of records for a minority genre band. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 20:33, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I must add that Dream Disciples pulled a crowd nearly as big as Rosetta Stone at the Mercat in Birmingham on some occasions, although that's not really a Wikipedia-sourced statistic! I do suspect that if you were in the UK goth scene in the mid 1990s you can't have failed to have heard of them; they were one of the most prolifically touring bands and had quite a following. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 20:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Much as I love the game, and believe this information to be mostly correct, I also believe it to be Original Research and Unverifiable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This information is useful and encyclopedic, and while the term "Boss Song" seems a little weak, it's definitely been used before Wikipedia picked it up (by DDRFreak etc.), and I'm not sure where this (useful and verifiable) information would otherwise go...

<li><b>Delete</b> I've played.. 6 US home, 2 arcade, and 1 import versions of DDR, and this article still confuses me. Article name is odd too. Since the information is in every respect "opinion" (even the name it says is fan-made), and no sources are given, this fails NOR. A list of the hardest songs would be an acceptable alternative. That would not be original research: since the games declare which are the hardest, it would not be opinion, and could easily be cited. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 23:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you view the edit history for Scottish Socialist Party United Left, you will actually note that at 00:41 21 June 2006, a link/reference to the online website of the Scottish Socialist Party's newspaper, the Scottish Socialist Voice newspaper was removed, the editor claiming that because they believed it to be "self-promotion?", it required removal. Notwithstanding the fact, that links and references to sources and bodies cited are a requirement under Wikipedia's [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>], following reinstatement of the link, the editor who deleted the newspaper hypertextlink then LATER nominated the article for deletion on grounds that would appear to have NOW been extensively and ably rebuffed. There has been much reference (and importance placed in some comments) to the groups name appearing on search engines. Notwithstanding the fact that a topic coming up on search results on Google does not represent valid grounds for dismissing the existence of a group (the group's very own <a href="http://www.ssp-ul.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ssp-ul.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> IS linked to within the article), the statement made by the proposed deletor in support of their deletion proposition does not correlate with the facts NOW, given as of 1324GMT Thursday 22 June 2006 "SSP UNITED LEFT" solicits a considerable quantity of hits and extensive commentary across many reporting platforms on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22ssp+united+left%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22ssp+united+left%22" rel="nofollow">Google</a>. This also clearly refutes the proposed deletor's contention "Unremarkable people or groups/Vanity Pages", a comment which we now note has now been rejected, and indeed scored through (see top of page). Much as many would like it to be, profit-driven corporations such as Google News are not the arbiters of what is or is not news or newsworthy. What is or is not news is entirely determined in a dynamic, symbiotic relationship between multiple purveyors and myriad consumers of that news. The fact that any one individual does not regard a topic or issue as news, does not mean it becomes 'un-news' to everyone else. There are MANY web-based stories regarding Scottish Socialist Party United Left (or "SSP United Left" for short). Whatsmore, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. The newsworthiness of an event, should be an afterthought. Importance and interest our forethought. We feel the importance and interest in this topic to be more than clear, and indeed in microcosm more than ably indicated by the level of contribution to this discussion regarding it's proposed deletion!It's worth pointing out that while the entry is titled "Scottish Socialist Party United Left", Scottish Socialist Party is commonly abbreviated to SSP, which helps explain why the latter i.e. "SSP UNITED LEFT" has many hits, and the former, i.e. "Scottish Socialist Party United Left", has few. Furthermore, the article has been written and edited with reference to and in attempted full compliance with Wikipedia content policies. It is worth pointing out that a group, subject or topics existence is not solely and blindly determined by any online references it happens to have on the internet. Online reference does not confer a greater level of reality, identity or legitimacy than off-line. Nor should undue weight be placed on this as a criteria for worthiness or inclusion within an encyclopedia, whether it be an online or off-line version. It will be clear from actual reading of the article and it's sources that the importance of the organisation mentioned therein is extensively and indisputably asserted. As such - the article - containing clear and present value of an important subject and topic and clear assertation of this, does not remotely represent a valid subject for deletion. This is in line with Wikipedia's founding spirit and philosophy. Furthermore, being written by a number of independent commentators, there is no evidence contained therein that the article represents a vanity article. Regarding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Importance" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Importance" rel="nofollow">importance of the topic</a> (which is a proposed Wikipedia policy). Clearly the emergence of a new faction or grouping within one of Scotland's leading left-wing political parties, a party which is in crisis and has been headline news for months does represent clear evidence, and I quote "that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)." While we would reiterate our disagreement with the simpicity and independent objectivity of a google hit orientated argument as being a key and acceptable (if somewhat crude) benchmark of a topic's importance - we would point out that "scottish socialist party" typed into google, solicits 193,000 results <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22scottish+socialist+party%22&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22scottish+socialist+party%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22scottish+socialist+party%22&amp;meta=</a> typing "ssp united left" into google a faction which has emerged within the party (total membership 3000: total faction signatories currently about 150) solicits 62 results on google after ONLY a few days of being in existence. Since its inception, even a casual glance at the history of the organisation it seems clear that - like it or loathe it - the Scottish Socialist Party has been something of a political phenomenon which has achieved a great deal on the Scottish political stage, for the Scottish people, many of them poor, disabled and disadvantaged. Most people will feel that such a group - politically under represented at the political debating table for many years - does not deserve to be casually described or derided (even unwittingly or accidently) as an unremarkable group of people, nor have the early history of the founding of a completely new network within the party, which includes many important human rights campaigners and leading members of the Scottish Parliament (which is effectively Scotland's semi-autonomous national government!) dismissed as vain, or even worse casually deleted from history by Wikipedia. Not if Wikipedia wishes to truly aim to properly service the accurate, fair and balanced information needs of people worldwide, both today and into the future. This, we feel, would betray and undermine all the good work that Wikipedia has achieved since its foundation. We thank you for your continued support in helping bring clarity and level-headedness to this matter and trust you will help continue to keep the beacon of truth alive on the site. The fact that many organisations, people and/or websites do not subscribe a news feed to Google News, does not make anything they have to say 'un-news' and represent a lack of coverage, significant or otherwise. Yes the Scotsman/Scotland on Sunday newspaper did get the name wrong, calling it "SSP United Front" instead. No matter. Until recently their story was being reported on four <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=893302006" class="external text" title="http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=893302006" rel="nofollow">Scotsman</a> group websites, and now one. Whether a story or happening in the world receives no coverage, little coverage or a lot of coverage is entirely inconsequential. In the shifting sands of 24/7 news, and in particular the bolting race horse that is 'net news', it doesn't change the fact that that event did happen or continues to happen. We are all well aware that there are many happenings in the world (and many injustices) that never see the light of day in the media. It is worth reminding ourselves time and time again that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. The word encyclopedia - derived from Greek - means "all round education". It is not possible to give people an all round education, by leaving certain segments of the circle out or giving certain angles less prominence than they deserve. 172.141.16.153 13:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To elaborate on my argument above, at Wikipedia we don't think being a non-reliable source is a bad thing. After all, by our own standards for reliable sources, Wikipedia is not a reliable source, and all the regulars here think that Wikipedia is a good thing. We just, by the official <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy against original research</a>, can't use material sourced to a non-reliable source, no matter how important the topic is. Once there is coverage in media that meets the fact-checking standards required to be a reliable source, write an article using solely that material. See <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORGET_afc0.html" title="WP:FORGET">WP:FORGET</a> for a semi-humorous guide on how to do this. (The suggestions for how to "forget everything you know on the subject" are humorous, the rest of that essay is quite serious.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article as it stands is garbage. Most of the criticism is generic and could be said about any number of products or companies. If it has sugar bought from America then it is benefiting from price supports and so tax payer money is going into greedy corporate pockets. If they buy third world sugar, then they are exploiting the poorly paid. If they use no sugar (diet), then they are charging for a product with nonnatuaral ingrediants. This kind of criticism is unencyclopedic and only useful in the marketing wars between the sugar-water sellers.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am very sorry for my late reply to this, It could not be helped because I had to deal with some people who wished me to modify my page. I also apologise in advance for any offence I may cause in disproving other's theories that this was not, to quote people's words "something made up in school one day."</li>
</ul>
<p>This action of putting "The Day" signs at strategic locations within a school is a documented and well used practical joke throughout the minority of American High schools. It has since spread to Australian schools.</p>
<p>I only thought of re-documenting it in wikipedia after reading about the "Columbine High School Massacre" in which one of the shooters was found to be in possession of "The Anarchist Cookbook." This triggered my memory and I remebered that this book has several offshoots, one of which is "The School Stoppers Handbook" or the "School Stopper's Textbook" (excerpts can be found at <a href="http://http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=451" class="external text" title="http://http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=451" rel="nofollow">| FIS</a> and <a href="http://http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/fuckschool.htm" class="external text" title="http://http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/fuckschool.htm" rel="nofollow">| OP</a> , some of my primary sources for this information ) which describe how through disinformation and acts of anarchy, a school can be stopped from running efficiently. Number 24 in both of these lists, describes how to distract teachers by sticking up "The Day" signs so that other acts of anarchy could be performed without intrusion.</p>
<p>For the record, cases have been reported in Australian schools, such as Waratah and Kotara High school. However, I chose to record Lambton High School's event, because the Police and Anti-Terrorism Unit were involved, thus giving the even more notoriety. My only source of primary information was an interview via phone that I had with the school and local police station, to confirm whether an event as such had taken place. Other secodary sources included the forum's on the now removed <a href="http://www.fridaystheday.cjb.net" class="external text" title="http://www.fridaystheday.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">| Friday's The Day</a> website,</p>
<p>What I have heard through unsourced means is that is was two students suspended, even though more "supposedly" helped them to commit this act and that the Police and Anti-Terrorism Unit were involved because a bomb-threat had been called in the same day. Technique 72 in the "School Stopper's Handbook."</p>
<p>As such, I believe the article in question is fit for listing in Wikipedia. Regardless of the outcome, I would appreciate a reply from <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> ( Who put the up for deletion. ) as to whether the article will stay or go. Happy Nit-Picking on other's works</p>

But only if someone first sits down and researches them, and <b>publishes a book</b>, an academic paper, or a magazine/journal article detailing that research. <b>Then the subject becomes eligible for Wikipedia.</b>"</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply <s>and the insult</s>, but the issue is out of my hands now. The question I would have for you is whether anybody other than yourself and perhaps those at Lambton High School or the "minority" of high schools would ever think of putting The Day Signs into this encyclopedia and finding it useful. When I put it up for deletion, the article did not mention any of the sites listed above, nor any work of reference - I think you'll agree with me that the article does read like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">something made up in school one day</a>. Certainly, if this is notable, some of the information could perhaps be integrated into the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article or maybe the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a> article. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 07:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm sure it is out of your hands now. If I didn't think it was valuable to the encyclopedia I wouldn't have put it up. That is common sense. As for agreeing with you, please do not make assumptions on my part. It is a great suggestion that this be incorporated into the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article, especially since the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article is being considered for deletion for a third time. Are you trying to waste more of my time by suggesting this? You seem to be deleting my articles. . . and this is an editable encyclopedia, why don't you edit my name yourself? My point has been made, as such I do not need to "further my case" at this point.</p>

 Hey guys, i am one of the suspended students who was involved in fridays the day. We got the idea from another school who did it, though quite some time ago. I think it is worthwhile to feature this article. By the way, i made the fridays the day site. All it was was a pathetic flash cartoon and a spooky warning, as well as the forums, but it got the message accross. We were not the first to feature 'the day' signs and we certainly won't be the last. It is worthwhile because when it happens again, those who attend the school will need a point of referance.

<dd><b>Response To Theatrestudent</b>. According to the public records at Companies House, HIDDEN TALENT PRODUCTIONS LTD., company number 05757637, was incorporated on 27th March 2006. That means it is less than three months old. By your own admission, it has only been involved in one production thus far - in association with the Students and the Student Union of the educational extablishment attended by the company's Directors. Take all the offence you need - these two facts do not demonstrate any kind of notability for inclusion wrt Wiki standards. Additionally, were it not for the fact you have bothered to create a limited trading company for this venture, I would suggest that the article be deleted as being <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">something made up in school one day</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 17:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge and Cleanup</b> or <b>Delete</b> - The article had <b>four</b> external links to a single software company's site. I eliminated three, but I'm not sure the fourth needs to stay. I think all of the articles that 132.239.90.209 suggested merging are excellent candidates for merging - none establish notability on their own in my eyes, but as a group they offer the beginnings of a good article. Of course, given that the general level of statisical illiteracy is (necessarilly) higher than the general level of mathematical illiteracy, I don't know how many readers such an article will attract, but it would be more helpful to them than each tool having its own article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 23:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes it does need a clean-up agreed. Tour information from their Myspace does list some big shows/festivals and notes that major tours are in the works. Also, their album is available on "itunes" in the US for purchase (though apparently not in Canada). So, doesn't thq that make them as noteable as being on Amazon?. On top of that, according to the "all music.com website" anyone can have an entry on Allmusic provided they send them a free CD and you can buy the CD "AMG will add any product submissions we receive to the database as long as they are commercially available in their country of release.

<p>Just some random guy in A-ball who happened to hit a homerun off of Roger Clemens during a rehab start. Mr. Clemens has been pitching a long time, and there is no one else on wikipedia just because he gave up a homer to him. Also, to those who might argue that there is something significant about an A level player getting a homerun off of a sure Hall of Famer, it is worth noting that even the best of pitchers give up many homeruns in their careers and even the worst hitters in baseball hit homeruns off of the best pitchers sometimes (after all, pitchers hit homeruns occasionally). Not only will this guy not be remembered in ten years even in baseball circles unless he adds a few more accolades to his resume, he will not be remembered in ten months.

In his short time in the minors, the man homered off Clemens (in his first return to the major leagues), probably the greatest pitcher who ever lived. Drennen's hit made national news, with every major paper commenting. This is no random guy and no random story. I wonder to what extent the nom understands the dynamics of the story. I object to the false projection ten years down the road, at which point Drennan is entirely likely to have made his mark in the majors.

<dd>I do admit that this article fits into a strange nether region that defies categorization in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and leads to reasonable arguements on both sides for keeping based on an interpretation of that guideline alone. Vis-á-vis athletes, the guideline indicates that professioal athletes should be allowed in, and minor leaguers are certainly paid for their efforts, but other categories in Bio such as top athletes in non-professional sports and top athletes in college sports imply that the level of selectivity is slightly different. Baseball is unique among the major American sports in that there is an extended farm system that develops talent rather than teams just relying on high schools and colleges to develop players for them. WP:BIO goes on to discuss how first team squad members (not a baseball concept I know) that have not appeared for the first team <i>may</i> merit an entry, and this implies that lower level team members do not. By analogy, minor leaguers are the equivalent of the reserve team, and therefore WP:BIO strongly implies they don't belong. I acknowledge that the policy can be interpreted either way and that mine own is merely an opinion on how it should be read and only consensus can dictate how each case will be handled. I hope you can acknowledge the same about your views.</dd>

<dd>That long-winded explanation deals only with why minor leaguers in general do not belong and does not answer your question relating to this specific person. According to my interpretation above, this person would have to have done something highly unusual or special to merit inclusion. Being a sandwhich round draft pick (not quite a number one) is not enough in my eyes because his value is not yet known. If he goes on to be a Major League regular, then he will certainly merit an article, but he may flop and be forgotten like many picks (even #1 picks) before him. That leaves the homerun, which is the main (probably only) reason this article was written as is readily apparent by the content of the article, which focuses nearly exclusively on this event. A home run is just not too important an event in the grand scheme of things, many thousands having been hit in baseball history from its inception. Sure, there have been notable homerun feats like Reggie Jackson in 1978, Bill Mazeroski in 1960, Joe Cater in 1993, and even Bo Jackson in 1989, but this particular home run did not reach those lofty heights of importance, and none of those players have an article solely because they hit those homeruns. Roger Clemens has given up 347 home runs in his major league career alone, and this was just one more. While he may be the best pitcher of all time, that does not make him immune to homeruns. Even the best pitcher may give up a home run to the worst hitter on any given day, whether through luck, skill, or a temporary lapse in judgment. Any player could have hit a homerun off Clemens that day, it just so happens Drennen was the guy to do it. It does not make him special or notable. As for the press coverage, this speaks more to the hype surrounding Clemens than to any special achievement on Drennen's part. Any major sporting event is going to be covered by every news agency on the planet, and day in and day out the plays of certain players will be discussed. A third-string catcher on a last place Major League team who allows a passed ball that costs his team a win will be featured in media outlets across the country (particularly if it is a New York team), but if the game was not important to the team's overall performance that year, the incident will quickly be forgotten and the article on that player will not mention the incident regardless of how much media coverage was generated. The same situation exists here. While I believe your interpretation of WP:BIO is valid (even though I do not agree with it), I have yet to see you explain what makes this homerun special, or any more noteworthy than the 347+ other homeruns Clemens has given up in his career.</dd>

<dd>Thanks very much. That was a very good answer. There is little I think that I need to say now that I haven't already said. As you surmised, my reading of WP:BIO is that all pro athletes qualify for inclusion. Therefore, I would be inclined to keep the Drennen article regardless. I also don't see any reason why we wouldn't want articles on all the top draft picks- meaning well beyond the top ten. That's the kind of information I would hope a major on-line reference work could provide. The fact that the Clemens minor-league game was greatly hyped, televised nationally and covered by newspapers coast-to-coast (NY Times, USA Today etc <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/astros/2006-06-06-clemens-return_x.htm?csp=34" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/astros/2006-06-06-clemens-return_x.htm?csp=34" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>,<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16FF3E550C748CDDAF0894DE404482" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16FF3E550C748CDDAF0894DE404482" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> - with Drennen's homer drawing extensive commentary and feature articles the next day <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/06/8baseblurbs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/06/8baseblurbs.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060607&amp;content_id=1493339&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle" class="external autonumber" title="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060607&amp;content_id=1493339&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>,<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2473587" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2473587" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>- makes the Drennen article especially interesting.

<li>All I'm saying is, at the moment, my reading of the wording of WP:BIO, rather than anything idiosyncratic, shows that he meets it in at least two variables.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We have very carefully gone through this article and deleted any references as to how to make armours and advice on which armours to use when. Admitedly, this is a struggle, as people do want to put that stuff back in, but I check it regularly (usually at least once a day) and remove the game guide stuff. The article is on its way to being a concise listing and description of the armours available in <i>RuneScape</i> and a brief discussion of what they do. It is no more game guide-ish than the main article, and it is much too long to incorporate back into the main article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - A concise listing and description of the armours available in RuneScape, and a brief discussion of what they do, is exactly what should not be on Wikipedia - Wikipedia is not a game strategy guide. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 10:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Answer</b> - I disagree. A game strategy guide would tell a player how to obtain the equipment, how much it costs, how much it is worth, and how and when to use it. This article does not do that (except when it is vandalized). It is an encyclopedic description of the equipment available to players when they play the game. Anyone who would use this information as a game strategy guide simply doesn't understand the concept. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 16:57, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - but telling you what armour is available, and where you get it from is not game strategy information? Because that is all this article contains. The fact it may not be a complete strategy guide doesn't mean it is not a strategy guide. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:19, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> - no, I don't believe it is. It is a summary of what is awailable. A game guide would have to tell you how, when, where, or why to use it. In other words, a game guide would give advice. This article does not give advice, no matter how hard the vandals try to make it do so. It does not have strategy, such as "players should wear this armour or that armour when fighting this or that monster". That is game guide information, to me. Many articles about many subjects have lists of what is available. For instance, an article about a record producing company might list the artists, but it is not giving advice just by that listing. This article is as encyclopedic as any article about a game can be. If it is deleted, then every article about every game on Wikipedia should be deleted, from the main articles to the sub-articles. I mean MapleStory, Diablo, World of WarCraft, Final Fantasy, all of them. Because this one is more encyclopedic that almost all the rest. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 15:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But why are you going after RuneScape first? This series has 45 articles in total, including the Portal and its subpages. StarCraft has at least 200 (218 by my count).

Also, quickly reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, whilst I do see a rule against game guides, I don't see anything specifically against mentioning items in videogames. <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_armour_2013.html" title="RuneScape armour">RuneScape armour</a> doesn't seem especially game-guidedy either: for example, whilst Barrows armour, its requirements and the effects of different types is mentioned (which I admit is on the borderline), it doesn't tell me what I need to do to get it. I happen to know that the procedure is quite complex and demanding, and that procedure is certainly not mentioned here. I say someone should give it a good going over and cut anything too gameguidey, but certainly not delete the whole article.

<li><b>Additional note to admin</b> - I agree, please do take into account the reasons for keeping this article. They are well thought out, reasonably argued, and passionate. There is nothing offensive in this article. It is a summary of the armours available in the game of <i>RuneScape</i>. It does not give advice on how to use those armours to "win" the game. It is encyclopedic. Just because this information is not <i>vital</i> does not mean it should be deleted. Wikipedia needs more information, not less. But I strongly believe that if this article is deleted, all articles on games, whether online, sidewalk, board, or other, should be deleted with it. Let's not discriminate against a poor little article about <i>RuneScape</i> just because someone doesn't like or understand the game, or doesn't care for games in general.

<li>Sarcastic KEEP - <i>Over time (15 hours of battle time), Barrows armours decay to an unusable state. When recovered from the crypts of the brothers, they are fully functional; the description at this point would read, for example, Ahrim's top 100. They degrade in four stages, from 100 to 75, to 50, to 25, to 0, at which point the description would read, for example, Ahrim's top 0. Barrows items do not lose strength as they degrade; however, at 0, they lose all defence bonuses. Degraded Barrows armours can be repaired by Dunstan in Burthorpe, by Bob in Lumbridge, by the smith at the pest control mini-game, or by the Tindel Merchant in Port Khazard. These repairs are rather expensive. The armours can also be repaired in POHs on a repair bench</i> - this is REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND SHOULD NOT BE DELETED YOU SILLYHEADS, wikipedia is a vital source for this kind of information as it is a nencyclopedia and encyclopedias should tell us about how you can get your Barrows armors from Bob in Lumbridge. Who could think that this is not encyclopedia information, itis vital to the safety of the world. You might laugh but one day you will need ytour barrows armour, or you will need to know just that <i>Mystic boots are an integral part of the mystic robes set.

<p><b><s>No vote yet.</s></b> Bringing here to get some consensus. Prodded because "per the external link, only about 200 kits have been sold of this non-notable program". Never formally deprodded, but anon objected on the talk page as follows: "Objection. This is a useful link to a musician like me. Sounds like a jealous competitor objecting, the company has a long waiting list. This link should not be deleted, it is a very useful addition to the Wiki. Quality should always win over quantity, and the x0xb0x is a notable evolution in the history of a pivotal electronic instrument."

<li><b>Comment</b> When I nominated this article, the first thing you saw was an argument: <b>Chalcedonian Christology is not a Syncretism with Platonism</b>. A diligent user has since edited the article so that it's descriptive rather than argumentative. I'm not an expert on this, but it may be that the problem has been solved. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 20:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Per the history, it sure looked like OR at first. But <i>the best outcome of an AFD discussion is an improved article</i> - nice job Lambian. It is now encyclopedic, mostly NPOV, educational, and better verified than most articles here. (In fact it would look more like a Wikipedia article if we lost the non-references from the bibilography.) If merged to <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos.html" title="Logos">Logos</a> it would create an undue weight problem in that article. It might reasonably become a child article of it, however, possibly merging some of the relevant section there into this article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod contested. This is almost the definition of non-notable: a college group founded four months ago that google provides less than ten separate hits. Further, this is a probable vanity/resume-stacking page: the article creator, MSkoglund, is rather similar to the executive director's name. His assertion that the group is "intrinsic to a massive divestment movement" is ludicrous and self-aggrandizing, as well as not proven in the article at all. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeleuze_eace.html" title="User:Deleuze">Deleuze</a> 17:36, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to admit I didnt realise it wasnt the main page for SA Idols, I just assumed. In that case i would have ot agree that it is of little use as a seperate page.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I'm of the opinion that any real camp (ie, not a church camp, not an after school program) that has been around since 1930 is probably notable. My concern is that there is not very much non-self-generated information out there from which to construct an article. <a href="https://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=15945" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=15945" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> was the only one I found in the first few pages of g-hits. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Agree with BigDT: a camp that's been around for 75 years has to be at least somewhat notable... at least for its age. This may sound silly, but seeing some camps here on AfD recetly, maybe better to establish some policy on camp notability? <a href="../../../i/k/h/User%7EIkh_d701.html" title="User:Ikh">ikh</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/h/User_talk%7EIkh_d708.html" title="User talk:Ikh">talk</a>) 19:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I was the one nominating the article for speedy delete. I looked for some info to check for notability but can't found any. As of now, this is an advertisment page. I m not sure age is enough to warrant this camp an article but I can understand the logic. I wouldn't oppose the article being re-created if it include other factors of notability than age alone <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiadlem_d8b6.html" title="User:Riadlem">Riadlem</a> 19:48, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I disagree with the age test. The <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> was founded in 1910, and many BSA camps were founded in the 1910s and 1920s, making them over 75 years old today. I even worked at one myself, and I worked at exactly one camp. As a family run camp, I think the relevant test is <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and this article contains neither an assertion of meeting those standards nor links to the required number of reliable sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:35, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - With regards to the BSA comparison, I would think that BSA council camps would certainly be notable and there are several that have articles ... see <a href="../../../l/o/c/Category%7ELocal_council_camps_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_fde1.html" title="Category:Local council camps (Boy Scouts of America)">Category:Local council camps (Boy Scouts of America)</a>. But even though BSA camps are notable, that's not a useful comparison to this camp, IMO. If <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is the only standard, then you're probably right about notability. As a corporation, they aren't notable ... but really, I look at something like a camp or school - even ones that are for-profit (I have no idea if this one is - I'm just assuming) as more than just <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I look at them more like <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, even though they may be for profit. If sufficient non-self-generated sources can be found to write an article (the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> standard), I'm not overly opposed to keeping the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response Comment</b> It is easy to overbroaden the scope of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> - after all, most organizations (camps, non-profits, the BSA, the Association for Left-Handed Tiddlywink Players in Poduck, etc...) are of the same legal forms as things that WP:CORP was intended to cover. If we had a standard for schools, camps could easily be fit with it. They both impact the same demographic. Unfortunately, this article version doesn't contribute to meeting the WP:ORG standard, as no third party sources are referenced. (And most of the article is made up of schedue minutiae that I'd be surprised to see in a third party source.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Again, this is a case lacking clearly applicable standards, but unless there is some evidence that the camp stands out by its particular history or historical importance, by its particular nature, by its unexpected location, by its activities or anything of that sort, there is no reason to keep this as the content then clearly has zero encyclopaedic value. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:54, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. The info seems clear enough, just not terribly important. Lsjzl, you mention you'd support keeping if the article tried to compile all the ways to connect, and I agree. My "weak" delete comes from the feeling that maybe this article needs more time? Right now, though, it sounds like notes someone has taken on a topic being studied in school. To the author: 1) add a 1-2 sentence intro about the topic in general an its importance. 2) Introduce sections that show the range of possible connections.

</ul>
<p>The 'not for things made up in school' principle has been taken out of context. Tipsy should not be compared to yo-yo crazes and the like. Simply, some aspects of school life provided the creative inspiration for Tipsy, but it was no more 'made up in school' than Harry Potter or Malory Towers. Admittedly, the wording of the article is misleading, suggesting that the actual soap opera began as a joke, rather than the concept behind it. There could be case for reducing the size of the article as it is certainly quite lengthy, but not for its deletion as Tipsy is a fairly well-known and significant soap opera. A recent edit does assert its notability. The 'episode guide' was in all likelihood copy and pasted, as Andypandy suggests - not, however, from a website, but from Tom Lane's original notes that he wrote while planning plot outlines and subsequently sent to various local media establishments for their use. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.134.80.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.134.80.113_92a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.134.80.113">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> In regard to the notability of the soap, I can confirm, as a resident of west London, that 'Tipsy' has caused a large stir locally, through word of mouth more than anything else. The gung-ho deletists need to remember that it is difficult to determine the notability of local matters from afar, and as most wikipedia regulars know, the google test is not foolproof. The 'made up in school' debate seems irrelevant - the Beatles originated from a group of school friends, but I'm sure we all agree they deserve an entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.134.80.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.134.80.113_92a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.134.80.113">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Its fairly clear that a soap with 500 episodes of information this does exist. I can understand why someone in Canada might not be able to appreciate quite how popular a soap is within a certain region of the Uk but it has certainly progressed beyond any notion of being just a school joke. I beleive that most episodes of the soap were viewed via a direct line to the host server which was only available for short periods of time. It was notoriously difficult to watch episodes at the time and it is unsurprising that they are hard to come across now. However, I noticed that the article actually now has a link to the a site withe several transcripts with almost 40,000 words which provides pretty good evidence.

<li><b>Comment</b> It does not matter whether Wikipedia accepts the entry or not. What matters is people will eventually recognize what Earthism is all about as briefly described here in my entry and will be written in length in my thesis and book: Spective Earthian Treatise, Spective Earthian Manifesto. I am not insulting the wanna-deleters, you should just take in account and be more respectful of original, innovative, and gifted individuals; we are the ones that shape the world when it comes down to it. Not "nay-sayers” that only get joy from trying to shoot down an idea, or smear it like all those Christian web-sites that are trying to vandalize Earthism by linking it to so-called "Flat-Earthism" or young Earthism.

<p>The Earth recognizes my spirit and my soul. The Earth is a living being. . . the Earth is a life form.

The Earth will welcome me back with open arms. I am a Guardian of the Earth. It is my duty and responsibility to do everything in my conscious power And ability to protect the Earth, our environment, and our biosphere's existence. It is a goal to continually become more environmentally conscious. As a citizen of the Earth, it is important to strive to maintain The Earth's fragile ecosystem. It is my responsibility to minimize the pollution and destruction that I [or anyone else] inhibit onto our planet.

When I sincerely repent, the Earth recognizes my sincerity. Sacred is the Earth to forgive my vices, and reinforce my virtues. My spirituality is an Earthism.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am only going to say this once again - this article is about a non-notable neologism that lacks credible verification. That is a pretty cogent reason for deletion. Nothing you have said indicates why according to official Wikipedia policies and more than a score of other guidelines, this page should be kept. Your effete intellectual elitism and personal outrage at being challenged seems to have obscured from you this basic truth. Consensus in this context relates to the general opinion of the community about whether this page merits inclusion or deletion, and not to the validity or development of your ideas. At the moment, all the users who have commented are in favour of deletion, except you, the article's creator. As I have stated before, my credentials are quite irrelevant and despite your purported laudable achievements and dubious claims to mental lordship, you have not addressed the core reason why this was listed on AfD, instead invoking puny, small-minded and thus ultimately ineffective ad hominem attacks.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Jammo, you have no idea what you are talking about, and you have been equally or more than pompous. You tell me not to personally attack and then you follow suit. You are a complete hypocrite and disgraceful. I have demonstrated no outrage, since you can not accurately determine tone in inflectionless prose, so don't assume. I have remained calm, and if anything, I have been baffled by people not being open minded to a wonderful concept. You have attacked me personally on several occasions as well, so maybe you should read the rules you so slavishly follow once again before you go preaching them to others. How dare you call me small-minded. Wanting to remove ideas so others cannot see them is "small-minded." I do not claim "mental-lordship," but I have been recognized for scholarship and artistic ability, which merrits respect. You need to read your comments again and see what a contradiction you are.

<li><b>Comment</b> Like I said before, it does not matter whether you save or delete (I’ve supplied enough reading for you to take to mind and heart). Wikipedia has a silly reputation anyhow. This whole process has been a joke. I can't stop laughing. If Wikipedia wants to continue to get contribution like yours, the mundane (e.g., list of local railway stations, list of bus stations, etc.), well, it should keep its same practices, but if it wants contributions from innovative, creative people, there is a serious level of refinement needed. Don't try to pretend that this website has an extraordinary level of credibility, because you would be one of the few that believes it. Also, you cannot just rely on what has been published on the web, your research ends with a google search like a freshman in college. Once again, silly Wikipedia-folk protecting their silly artificial wall... Have a good one. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpective_8f20.html" title="User:Spective">Spective</a> 19:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Mundane is a matter of perspective. I find your readings mundane and uninspiring despite your assertions of personal creativity, but that is not the reason they must go. They go, as I have said many times throughout the above, because they lack either credible verification or real notability. The reason the internet is relied upon is because it is more universal than research journals or other sources, which are time-consuming to access and are unlikely to contain your writings (unless you can show that they do and exactly where they do). Wikipedia's credibility problems are caused, <i>inter alia</i>, by articles that do not cite credible sources - this ones falls into that category. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 23:33, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Academically, I first introduced the concept of Earthism to describe the source of spiritual inspiration of such artists, philosophers, and geniuses as Leonardo da Vinci, Alberti, Aristotle, and others who primarily were inspired by Nature (and not a concretized god) as documented in their personal journals, artwork, treatises on art, painting, and philosophy. My graduate level course thesis was completed in 1999 while an undergraduate at the University of Washington entitled “The Renaissance, the Elements, and the Consciousness of Western Mankind.” In May of 2004, I presented the same researched material (refined) to the Pacific Northwest Renaissance Society Conference at Western Washington University in a presentation entitled “The Elements of the Renaissance,” documenting the profound influence on the Italian Renaissance masters of the primary elements (water, fire, air, and Earth), and a spirituality that had never been appropriately denoted, Earthism and Earthian belief system, which has inspired geniuses throughout the ages - often referenced as a sort of Nature mysticism.</li>

<p>The 2004 PNRS conference website has since expired, but it did contain my name and an abstract of the thesis. The current home page is <a href="http://www.stmu.ab.ca/PNRS/conferences_NEW.html" class="external free" title="http://www.stmu.ab.ca/PNRS/conferences_NEW.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stmu.ab.ca/PNRS/conferences_NEW.html</a> , but that does not have detailed information of the 2004 conference where I presented my research. I’ve published my thesis on various websites, but websites come and go, and only elite sites have a budget to remain, or ones that have been spoiled by an abundance of advertising. So if Wikipedia only publishes works that have privileged access, you are instituting an elite class structure that seems contrary to the true goal of intelligent investigation. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpective_8f20.html" title="User:Spective">Spective</a> 05:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>The Wikipedia community is not ready for Earthism</b>, but many around the world have been longing for such a symbol. May Earthism free minds around the world.

Cheers, Jammo, you must have spotted something notable to return over and over... or why would you bother? Thanks for taking the time.

I've also fixed the article's description, which had it "in Botswana and north-western Namibia". Since Namibia is west of Botswana, and northwestern Namibia is on the coast, that would have been a little difficult.

<p><b>Do Not Delete</b> Hello. My name is Syed Druglord, leader of so called band in question. The article does not consist of namedropping and/or rubbing shoulders with notable bands. We are releasing records alongside those "notable" bands. The Kill Art Movement is a NEW publishing and promoting company under which the songs are written and released. The Bavarian Druglords are currently releasing music through Northern Star Records. This entry is not a bid to do anything other than supply a short concise introduction and summary to a notable band who are releasing music and are impacting the underground music scene. I suggest you shouldn't pass judgement and/or make generalisations so easily. Take time to learn about the music scene being discussed first. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>I am a fan of this page and the page is quite valid. TBD have alot of admirers and fans around Detroit and beyond. Their music is quite unique and recently a friend of mine in the UK told me that he heard the music being played on BBC radio as well.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am generally in favour of keeping shopping centres - if they show some notability (generally, this means they at least are quite large or form the central activity centre of a town or sometihng similar). I lean towards the keeping of schools nowadays, but there is a difference between a (usually) perpetually operating school, and a non-notable shopping centre which is at the whim of market forces. If it is very large or heritage-listed for example, it is less likely to have notability problems.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Actually shopping malls are notable. They're good indicators of a region's economic status and the consumer purchasing behavriour.

Beyond that, I can tell you that they were at least mentioned, if not featured, in the documentary <i>Athens, GA: Inside Out</i>, and get some mention in books such as <i>It Crawled From the South</i> by Marcus Gray and <i>R.E.M.: Fiction</i> by David Buckley. As a huge R.E.M. fan, this band leapt right out at me when I saw the page. It needs work, and I'll be glad to work on it sometime tonight or later this weekend if I get a shot, but nobility isn't in question here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>This article should be kept for numerious reasons. Not only is it only controversal because it is a sexual stimulator, but taking it down would be precident for complainers to ask for the deletion of other "obscene material." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that aims at increasing knowledge, and I managed to get to this page by reading and following links. The educational value is there, proven that it is more than just an advertisment, but more importantly, the free speech value is there as well. Furthermore, the fleshlight IS the best known product in that category, and deleting the article just takes away from wikipedia as a whole. The best arguments for keeping IMHO are that it is like the ipod vs. a mp3 player (as stated below) and also, if this is deleted, then precident will follow and people will demand other objects deleted as well (like the sybian, mentioned below) Just my two cents. This page should stay.</p>
<p><br />

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, yes, that's rather the point of advertising. Fleshlight have a good marketing strategy, which has lead to their product becoming well-known (which is what we, at Wikipedia, should base our decision on), and (presumably) to increased sales.

<dd><b>Comment</b> No i wouldn't remove Ford, but I wouldn't let them add "Explorer" as an Wikipedia term. And that company didn't do to their field what Ford did to theirs. You can't just let every company list every product they have, in that case "Doc Johnson" will list 10,000 products that has a unique design, and "California exotics" will add another 15,000, there should be starndards and whatever standard you will make that specific product will not cut it . 14:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, yes, I agree with you there. We should only list products that are <i>notable</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> No I don't suggest to remove all products and companies. I suggest that you leave notable companies, in sex toys i would add Doc Johnson, Fun Factory (Because they are extremely uniqe), California Exotics(or Swedish Erotica) , but i wouldn't include ILF Inc. or whatever their name, since they are just another company in that market, and they only have one hit, and that due to aggressive marketing methods. And about the product, you can't compare it to iPod that became a fashion statement and a huge trend. And furthermore you can't add Fleshlight - a product just like you wouldn't add "Explorer" (Ford's SUV) as a term for a car, even though it's way more popular, notable and worthy for a page then that product.21:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigsexyguide (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigsexyguide_83f1.html" title="User talk:Bigsexyguide">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigsexyguide_eca2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigsexyguide">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>It could (Personal View) be possible to improve this article with concerns to it's history and how it a breakthough design that has influence the 'sex toy' market to avoid the advertising feel it currently has. For example although the iPod is a individual product (part of a music player group,) it's release has a historical value in that it made a huge impact on both music players and futher increased music downloads, plus restored Apples furtunes. It is quite possible that the Fleshlight can be proven to of increased sex toy sales, and maybe improved other sex toy materials, but in this article that isnt clearly shown. Getting the article changed as a historical article and not a statistical would require a request for improvement and not deletion? I suspect that the fleshlight was more a mould of excising technology and ideas then a complete breakthough. Unless someone can improve this article, it would (Personal View) seem far better to simply merge it with the empty looking <b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_vagina.html" title="Artificial vagina">Artificial vagina</a></b> and forward the Fleshlight article to it. It would still be possible to keep most of the information, and even include a link to a Fleshlight related site.</dd>

Going back to the earlier Ford Explorer example, would now be a good time to point out that the Explorer <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Explorer_e5c0.html" title="Ford Explorer">does in fact have an article</a>?

<li><b>Delete</b> I totally agree with Philo, we should also remove Sybian, we should be objective, but sensitive to trends and for that reason i think that the same judgement should go for both sybian and fleshlight, they both should be deleted. However since I am working in that field for so long, let me state the difference between those two&#160;: the sybian has a unique mechanism! and unique functions, on the other hand the Fleshlight took vagina mold, not different from what every other manufacturer selling, and placed it in a flashlight body. So I will refresh a question that was asked here before, what is so notable and what is so special about this product that it should be include as a term in an encyclopedia&#160;?, did it make a difference, did it invovled any kind of invension? if that product goes online, than you should be objective and every product designer should upload all of his / hers unique designs.And if I nerrow it to that field, just imagine what will happend to the integrity of that encyclopedia if DocJohnson will decide to upload tomorrow 5,000 products, each unique in the combination of looks, materials and fanctionality. --Bigsexyguide 08:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, please stop logging multiple votes; it's not that you can't talk, or that we don't want you to, but since bolding a "delete" is similar to ticking your choice on a voter's ballot, it's better to only do it once, if that's alright with you. Also, you may wish to read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, a guideline for notability as regards corporations and related topics, which includes questions of product notability <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html#Criteria_for_products_and_services" title="WP:CORP">here</a>; there've been a few arguments using the guideline, above. In this case, the Fleshlight has been the subject of both non-trivial reviews, and has experienced some degree of trademark genericization. While I can appreciate your arguments, to be sure, my understanding is that notability is more important than uniqueness when it comes to articles (it's not like we'll run out of paper, after all) -- further, attempts by editors to judge the unique merits of a product are unfortunately pretty likely to run afoul of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<li><b>keep</b>. This topic is an important issue for graphics programmers. Due to the nature of its subject, there are going to be few paper-published articles on it; most of this is borne out in newsgroups and the like. Most articles that could be linked to will only compare the two in terms of a particular feature, rather than as a comprehensive overview, and also most of them will be considerably POV. This article is an attempt to introduce an overview of the topic, and when I first came upon it I was impressed at how NPOV is actually managed to be. To summarize, I am saying that there may not be primary sources to draw from, but the information presented here is not a single person's original research; it is a collection of commentary from a variety of incomplete sources, and for being that is has value to wikipedia.

<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>. Flayked's objection seems to be to the article title, not the contents - that it implies an article about the act of comparing Direct3D and OpenGL, rather than an article which itself does so. I doubt that this is a likely source of genuine confusion (articles on the subject of the act of comparing Direct3D with OpenGL are likely to be dull and not useful to anyone). Maybe "Differences between Direct3D and OpenGL" would be less ambiguous, but also less accurate, since the article mentions similarities as well as differences (the "features list" suggestion is equally inaccurate, since it's far from mentioning most of the features of either API); I'd be happy with a title change if a genuinely better title can be conceived, but most obvious changes seem to have problems of their own. This article does not perform research on the APIs in question - there are no novel timing measurements, no proposed changes, and no suggestions about circumstances in which either API might be superior; it merely provides a summary of some publicly known differences and similarities between them, and does so in a commendably unbiased manner - as Rainwarrior says. It's hard to quote public knowledge as a verifiable source, but nobody could interpret this page as a research paper. MaxDZ8: The article is no more or less exhaustive on the subject than other Wikipedia pages; there's more to say, but that's usually the case. The lack of bias distinguishes this from most other treatments, and is fitting with its place in Wikipedia; it is of value over comparisons elsewhere. Removing a useful article, named sensibly at least for search criteria (even if slightly ambiguously as a title), just because of its name would be detrimental. I was looking for specific information on how something was handled in OpenGL when I knew how it was handled in DirectX, and the fact that I found this page (via Google) and that it was useful is a recommendation in itself.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if this isn't merely an example of the difference between Wikipedia and a real encyclopedia. Obviously, real encyclopedias do not have "Comparison of ..." pages, but perhaps this is something that Wikipedia should pursue. I personally don't find the idea very encyclopedic or useful (if I wanted to know the similarites/differences of two items, I would look each one up, or use a different book, and not expect the encyclopedia to have a comparison page for everything that might conceivably be comparable). Flayked 22:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The consensus so far seems to be "keep", so unless anyone else speaks up within a day or two, I will move the deletion notice per the Wikipedia Deletion guidelines. Flayked 22:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b> With the proper adjustments and such, this article should be kept. In it's current state, it should obviously be deleted, due to many false statements. One with experience in and/or on the site should be allowed to edit the page, and only allow that person and perhaps a selection of members of his/her choice to edit the page.

<p>Having looked through the debate on previous list AfDs the concensus seems to be that a list is justified when it contains additional information or does something that a category cannot. Here, the list simply duplicates the category and therefore is redundant. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>I've done a little work on this page including linking it from the parks it lists, and added a park. Fg2, below, has also added a park location. I can see it starting to build into a really useful list, and being so much better than a just a category in that brief descriptions can be included. I don't really fancy going to town on it until this discussion reaches consensus, however, though I may well add a park or two over the next couple of days.

<p>This appears to be a recreation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> by a suspiciously acting "new user". I am alleging that most of the voters in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Constantine_Conspiracy_Archive_56d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Constantine Conspiracy/Archive">previous afd</a> were sockpuppets of <a href="../../../m/e/b/User%7EMeBee_2caa.html" title="User:MeBee">User:MeBee</a>. User:MeBee's whose User:MeBee/Matthaei Authenticum appears to be a recreation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=14377751" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=14377751" rel="nofollow">another previously new user's article</a> that was redirected (without merging). Among the similar points that shout "sockpuppet" are the highly unusual use of boldface text where it wouldn't ordinarily be suspected, and the fact that most of the content is the same. Since I have grounds for suspecting that most of the previous votes were due to sockpuppets, I am re-opening the afd, and requesting a sterner test of sufference (ability to vote).</p>
<p>The article in question, Constantine Conspiracy, appears to be trying to assert the same original research, to wit that the original version of the Gospel of Matthew was the Gospel of the Hebrews and that the latter was historically called <i>Authentic Matthew</i>. This position is, as far as I can tell from reading the talk page <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAuthentic_Matthew_6390.html" title="Talk:Authentic Matthew">Talk:Authentic Matthew</a> total original research with no academic merit whatsoever, that has been supported by an extraordinary large number of sockpuppets in the past.</p>
<p>I also suspect that the previous afd was an incident of <i>gaming the system</i>. The proposer, <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnikk_2f8d.html" title="User:Anikk">User:Anikk</a> appears to be a straw man; they have made absolutely no edits to any article other than those related to Constantine Conspiracy. In effect, I suspect that MeBee created the article, created Anikk to afd it, so that MeBee could game the system by claiming that the article was kept after afd, when in fact the only people voting, or who knew about the article, were sockpuppets of MeBee.</p>
<p>Due to the likelihood of sockpuppet votes, I would like to ask the closing admin to discount votes from any editor with less than 200 edits on 1st April 2006. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 22:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and send to cleanup.</b> Pardon me. I've actually done research on this; an entire half of my graduating thesis from high school was on Constantine's role as leader of Sol Invictus and his motives for convoking the Council of Nicaea. That aside, the article as it exists right now can't be properly described with civil diction. It is, to say the least, terribly off-topic, and in need of a major rewrite.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've already voted in favor of keeping the article. I made some further edits, and I think the article is now free of copyright problems.

<p><b>Jienum</b>: So what if it's all speculation? That's why it's called "Untitled KH Installment". I've said this before: It is a page like "Untitled Batman Begins Sequel" which is also nothing but speculation. But will someone delete that? Oh no, not in a million years! "<i>Let's delete the pages that Jienum created! Let's make a pisshead out of Jienum! Yeah!"</i> You guys don't know what you're speaking about, and you still go ahead and vote for deletion. Why don't you just look at my contributions and delete them all. That'll save you time. Besides, only the rumours are speculation. The parts above are fact, but still it was <i>I</i> who made the page, so it has to go, of course.</p>

<li><del><b>Delete</b></del> Ouuuuch. I was about to say CSD A1 (no context), but then the morning coffee kicked in and I got inspired to research a bit. Good that I'm not an overly hasty person, especially before the morning coffee. =) So it's a <i>Pokemon series episode</i>. Why didn't you say so before? Anyway, individual episodes of the series aren't automatically notable, unless there's something remarkable to say about it, and even then they are often best merged to bigger articles. So either delete the thing, or perhaps merge to an article about the season (or whatever). --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
