<li><b>Revise and rename</b>. The article is not a "hoax" in the sense of consisting of false information deliberately inserted by the creator. The primary author, User:Ericl, really does believe what he has written. Unfortunately, he's wrong; as JasonCNJ has pointed out, there is not and never was an office in the US federal government called "Acting Vice President." However, before nuking the article, it does appear to contain useful content: a laboriously prepared list, in a format that I've never seen before (but compiled from reliable sources and not original research), of the persons who were next-in-line to the Presidency at times when there was no Vice President of the United States. The article should be cleaned up, edited, and renamed to a more appropriate title. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:37, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> While it is correct that the article is not technically a hoax, it is completely inaccurate. As a political scientist with two degrees in American Politics, I can say with complete certainty that there has never been an office called "Acting Vice President". I am also unconvinced that the information included in the table is worth preserving, though I am open to changing that position. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 22:52, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The problem with that "Next in line" list being in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_9331.html" title="Presidential Succession Act">Presidential Succession Act</a> is that the subject of that article is 1947 legislation. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 02:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to something else per Newyorkbrad and Dhartung. The table has some merit as a list of people who were once first in line to the Presidency of the United States, but they did not hold the title "Acting Vice President." --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> this article should be renamed and merged with a vice president page. If you noticed the title directly above the chart does not mention "Acting Vice President". I tried to avoid using that alleged title because it is not a real title. The U.S. Vice President page also shows vacancies. This article basically fills those gaps. Someone even linked those vacancies to the article. The table listed shows how they became "next in line" which is the basic source. Also some of the first several people in the article were mentioned as "Acting Vice President" in their own articles after this one was created. I would say "next in line". Those should be revised as well. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 01:48, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the article per GoodDay. The list already exists. Renaming to List of Presidential Successors would be inappropriate unless its re-written to include every Vice President. List of Successors to the Presidency of the United States in the Absence of a Vice President is an absurdly long title which frankly no one would ever search for. If people are looking for succession, they would likely search for presidential succession and go from there. I had never heard that any of these folks were ever addressed as Mr. Vice President. Is there a source for that? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 06:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Found a source, but I don't know how reliable it is. suite101.com/article.cfm/presidents_and_first_ladies/116788 (apparently suite101.com/ is a blacklisted link) It sounds like it was an unofficial title until 1886 when the line of succession changed. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 07:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just when I get too sure of my own convictions, I surprise even myself. While its true that there is no constitutional office of Acting Vice President, the US Senate web page uses the title Acting Vice President when referring to Samuel Southard and Willie Magnum who were Presidents Pro Tempore under Tyler. I still think the list is better placed under the page I earlier posted, but I guess the term can be used. Regarding jjmillerhistorian's link, I guess its ok. High school teachers don't usually rate high in my list of "experts" but I don't see that the author has any incentive to lie and he is independent. <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 07:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There are additional sources for use of the term as well. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Davis_%28senator%29_50c0.html" title="David Davis (senator)">David Davis</a> (Senate president <i>pro tem</i>) is called "Acting Vice-President" at the Senate memorial service for <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Garfield_49bf.html" title="James Garfield">James Garfield</a>, for example. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC23777105&amp;id=bTUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA115&amp;lpg=RA1-PA115&amp;dq=acting.vice.president+1886" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC23777105&amp;id=bTUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA115&amp;lpg=RA1-PA115&amp;dq=acting.vice.president+1886" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> This 1864 <i>Statesman's Yearbook</i> says the Senate presidents pro tem are known as Acting Vice-President "until their successors can be elected".<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01922437&amp;id=iO_0SmgvBwAC&amp;q=acting.vice.president+1886&amp;dq=acting.vice.president+1886&amp;pgis=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01922437&amp;id=iO_0SmgvBwAC&amp;q=acting.vice.president+1886&amp;dq=acting.vice.president+1886&amp;pgis=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> There are numerous other 19th century sources using the term, so the article is correct that this usage was common even though it is not supported by legislation.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Was the title 'Acting Vice President' used verbally? 'yes'. Does the office lawfully exist? 'no'. The president pro tempore during VP vacancies, can't cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Therefore he wasn't 'truly' Acting VP (couldn't assume ALL duties). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 18:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>But we have sources which verify that it was a <b>real thing</b> -- title, symbolic role, or what have you -- and contemporaries agree that it was considered a solemn responsibility.

<li>We have sources that indicate that on 3 or 4 occasions a significant person used the term. The Senate never "created" this position.

This definitely merits further research, and the article seems to have inaccuracies and some supposition (i.e. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) filling in blanks, but it was indeed a <b>real</b> office albeit not a <b>constitutional</b> office. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The first citation you've given explains the problem in a nutshell, it refers to William Rufus King as being "<i>in effect</i> the acting vice president." It does not say that he <i>was</i> the Acting Vice President, because there is no such office. As <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">User:GoodDay</a> has pointed out, unlike an Acting President (who assumes all of the powers of the Presidency), the "Acting Vice President" is not empowered to break ties in the Senate. At the very least, this article needs to start off with a sentence that acknowledges that this is not an actual position in the United States Government, and instead, is a term that has, in the past, been used to describe a situation where there is no Vice President. <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 15:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. This is a list of people who were at some point in time actually next-in-line for the U.S. Presidency without being V.P. Such a list is well-defined and interesting, and could be a starting point for research into some aspects of American politics. The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Succession_Act_9331.html" title="Presidential Succession Act">Presidential Succession Act</a> has a partial listing of this content in each of the "Potential Implementation" sections. The "Next in line" list in that article does not identify when the V.P. office was actually vacant, which this list does. This list should either be linked from that article or merged to that article. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 05:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It could be renamed Vice Presidential Vacancies or similar for a short title. I just revised the page a little. Maybe this could be merged or mentioned on the Vice Presidents article as well. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 15:49, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but cleanup and verify.

<ul>
<li>I've made some changes which I think address some of the concerns. The list, as it stands, is needlessly long, as it includes people who were next in line to become Acting President, but who, even according to the entry, could not be referred to as "Acting Vice President" because they were not the President Pro Tempore. Perhaps renaming the article would solve that problem. <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 18:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We should mention 'in a revised version' however, that the president pro tempore, can't assume all of the VP duties (a ppt can't cast a tie-breaking vote). This fact, makes the 'Acting VP' title questionable. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 18:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry about that, you've already added the 'tie-breaking vote' duty, which is performed by the VP only. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 18:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I moved the table to the Presidential Succession Act page, and reduced it on this page, such that only Presidents Pro Tempore are included, as they are the only ones who could be referred to as "Acting Vice President." As written, I would change my vote to <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../j/c/o/User%7EJCO312_9c68.html" title="User:JCO312">JCO312</a> 00:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I concur with your interpretation (that the office could only be held by Presidents <i>pro tem</i>), and I believe verification will come in time. The move of the other next-in-line guys helps. The quibble about the AVP being unable to cast a tie-breaking vote actually seems to have been a debated issue in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, by the way.

<li><b>Keep</b> renaming and/or merging may be appropriate, but they don't require an AfD. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article itself says that the title isn't an actual title. The fact that the list in there has the title "List of people who <i>could</i> have been referred to as 'Acting Vice President'" doesn't help as well. The "position" isn't even anything more than being next in line when there is no vice president. It doesn't really matter to me that people used the term once or twice. I'm sure more than one Senator has been called an "asshole" by the President, that doesn't make "asshole" an official title. I wouldn't object to the information being moved, though, maybe to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate_e06d.html" title="List of Presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate">List of Presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 18:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
