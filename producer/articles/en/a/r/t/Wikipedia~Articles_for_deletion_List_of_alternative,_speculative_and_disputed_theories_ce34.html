<p>I created this page in the hopes that it would be useful as a kind of watchlist for pseudoscientific theories, and as a collection of curious crackpottery in the style of <a href="http://crank.net/" class="external free" title="http://crank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://crank.net/</a> . I guess I was forgetting that I was creating the page on a wiki, instead it became a magnet for the kinds of people who support these theories. They would claim that the page is inherently POV, and I'm ashamed to admit that they were probably right. The other thing they have done constantly in the two years since this page was created, is add various mainstream theories to the page, in an effort push the POV that these mainstream theories are just as legitimate as whatever minority theory they support. These efforts have been largely successful, since most Wikipedians are not prepared to argue such a subjective point on such a regular basis. I have copied the page to my user space (<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_List_of_crackpot_theories_f35c.html" title="User:Tim Starling/List of crackpot theories">User:Tim Starling/List of crackpot theories</a>) and modified it to a mainstream POV, for the benefit of Wikipedians who wish to use it for monitoring crackpots. I'm now more than happy for the main namespace copy to be deleted. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 14:12, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It was originally at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_speculative_or_fringe_theories.html" title="List of speculative or fringe theories">List of speculative or fringe theories</a>. It was moved in February 2004 by Eclecticology. This was accepted by consensus. He said at the time "I can accept the change in the title from "sciences" to "theories". I pondered that possibility myself and decided that "science" in some usages was a much broader term. It was "fringe" in the old title that I found unacceptable." -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 16:20, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Alternative, speculative or disputed theories are those that don't (yet) enjoy mainstream support. <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">String theory</a> would be a good example of such a theory, <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenology</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> also, though the latter two have been falsified to the satisfaction of most observers whilst the theorists are still trying to work out how to falsify string theory. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> should be on the list because it doesn't have a scientific framework--it's an inference from ignorance. <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> in its "Young Earth" form is falsified and old-earthers' hypotheses tend to founder on lack of parsimony. Not an article that is without problems, but a very good resource and shouldn't be deleted. Brian's idea of moving could be considered after this VfD, it may have some merit. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:18, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, it may be a better idea to split the article up into sub-articles, or sub-headings, separating "alternative", "pseudoscientific", "disputed", and "speculative" theories. Otherwise, you're giving as much credit to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> as you are to <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>, when the latter is an actual scientific theory. The simpler solution seems to be to go with the original intention of the author and stick to "theories" that don't have the potential to become part of mainstream science. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 15:22, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, some of these theories are fluid, and in any case there may be quite a lot of overlap. I don't have a problem treating astrology as "an actual scientific theory" because if it couldn't be formulated in a scientific manner we couldn't put it on the list. Typically astrology is falsified by examining birth data and testing correlations between independently produced lists of character traits and astrological readings produced independently by individual astrologers from the same data. There are interpretations of astrology which cannot be falsified in this way (for instance, astrological consultation as a kind of counselling), but those are not scientific. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:31, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Almost every scientific theory is disputed by someone. You can't list them all and still be able to make a serious claim to NPOV. Nor is it useful to mix up respectable mainstream proposals such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> with pseudoscience such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, that just causes offence. The problem is, there's no NPOV way to draw a line between the two categories. It's just a troll-magnet. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 16:20, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I agree that "almost every scientific theory is disputed by someone", there are good criteria for determining if a hypothesis is fringe science, is falsified, or of indeterminate status (String theory is close to being a legitimate theory, but currently lacks demonstrable predictive power) etc. If you missed out string theory then it would be POV, and we shouldn't be worried about causing offence (to whom?) Troll magnet? That's Wikipedia. Look, are we making an encyclopedia or trying to win a popularity contest? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:24, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> there is too much crackpottery on wiki; it needs rolling back <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 15:50, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Technically, every theory would fall under speculative and disputed, since if there were no question at all, it would be a law rather than a theory. While I can see the merit in an article like this (by keeping crackpottery out of the other articles), I feel that we should respect the author's wishes to delete it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:58, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two notes: "Scientific theory" and "theory" are two different terms, with different meanings (summarized by another user below). Also, "respecting the author's wishes" isn't really valid on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 19:25, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'm afraid that "Starblind" does not understand what the term "theory" means. A scientific theory is just as factual as a law. And whether the author likes it or not, I think this page is useful and treats of an important topic - not of what is right, but what people consider right even when it is highly delusional. Deleting this page would be blinding ourselves to the facts just as much as they are blinded to the facts. Franc28 18:51, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>, its a fascinating list. I can see that its a dispute magnet, and would need active patrolling. But then, so are many/most articles on religion and politics, and WP has many articles on religion and politics; dispute does not mean 'not a valid article'. Many religion/politics articles have NPOV stickers slapped on them. Note article has categorization problems: <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polywater.html" title="Polywater">polywater</a> was an academic disaster from a highly regarded and respected researcher. Time-cube by contrast is crank, in which only one person on this planet believes in. <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">Luminiferous aether</a> was once a respected theory ... I'd like to see a distinction between "theories that were once taken seriously by academics" and "theories that were never taken seriously" (i.e. crank topics, creationism). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 19:18, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>Ahh, I see the problem. Tim's original list had <i>only</i> crackpot theories on the list. But then someone started adding non-crackpot, highly-speculative-but-academically-acceptable theories to the list. And thus it becomes a complete mess. How about we rename the thing to the pejorative list of crackpot theories? That would clarify the issue a whole lot. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 19:49, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The inclusion of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_carrier.html" title="Force carrier">force carrier</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> was particularly inappropriate. An article becomes unmaintainable when the population of editors wanting to bias the article towards a particular minority view greatly outnumbers the number of editors willing to fight for NPOV.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. Upon further review, I withdraw my vote. I see that this article looks a lot healthier then I remember it being. It looks to be a good intro to the topic of pseudoscience. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 1 July 2005 16:18 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry, Tim, but I will never vote to delete articles on the sole ground that they're hard to maintain, either because they run the risk of POV or because people with dubious ideas start attacking it. If anything, it's a sign that you may need to rethink the list criteria and make them even clearer, to prevent as much debate as possible. Maybe even a move. That is material for the talk page, though, not a deletion debate. Once you've done that, and there's still a lot of heat, you're down to digging the trenches and hoping the community will take care of it.<br />
The article itself is fine. What the others have said: this list itself is <i>not</i> passing judgement on the theories listed (and "theory" needs to be taken in its scientific meaning), it only lists articles in which <i>notable</i> views of the theory as alternative to mainstream, speculative or disputed are discussed. That's verifiable, and not POV.

<li><b>Keep</b> These theories exist, and some of them exist famously. I consider this to be an excellent compilation of contemporary and traditional non-mainstream thought.

Title is fine with me. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:07, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't usually participate in VfD debates, but since Tim mentioned my comments when this list received its present title, I felt that I should. Thanks for mentioning it, and I still agree with what I said then. The consensus at the time was with the intent of finding a term with a broad acceptibility. It had to satisfy the scepticism of mainstream science without descending into the pejorative. It also had to make a home for a wide range of subjects with varying degrees of acceptability, and recognize the fact that the adversaries for any two given subject will vary. If this list is to be abandoned then we will need a better compromise that does all this and more. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> June 28, 2005 09:16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The list is actually useful to me and I would hate to lose it. It is bound to be somewhat POV, given the nature of disputed theories, but it retains its broad interest. It may benefit from a narrower mission, however. Perhaps separating the theory groups would lower the level of wingnuttery.<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillbrand_2ff5.html" title="User:Hillbrand">S.N. Hillbrand</a> 30 June 2005 13:19 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the range is too huge, criteria too broad, and the scope for abuse too big (on either side of the issues) to be useful. What would be useful is an article on how to evaluate the merit of theories. <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> is blatantly POV. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> June 30, 2005 23:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note: Leifern is claiming that the term "pseudoscience" is inherently POV, not that the article is POV. See the article's talk page. While I agree with him, Wikipedia is no place for original research. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 30 June 2005 23:28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>. This is very useful as a place to catalog disputed theories. Even if not presented as fact, such theories need to be presented as ideas for the encyclopedia to be complete. The name is as un-POV as it can get, and although the potential for abuse is high the alternative (of trying to ignore such theories) sweeps a body of human knowledge -- the study of alternative theories in their own right -- under the rug.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> but revise. This is a useful list. Part of the trouble is that this has come to include all kinds of things. For example, <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">luminiferous aether</a> and the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state.html" title="Steady state">steady state</a> theories were widely accepted for quite some time, but now are discredited. Others are new and under active consideration (such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>) or are subject to ongoing debate (such as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>). Perhaps a notation such as:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>* <b><a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">Luminiferous aether</a> (discredited)</b> ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>could be used. Other designations could include
<ul>
<li>"disputed" (for previously accepted theories that are now "on the ropes"),</li>
<li>"alternative" (for newer theories that may be accepted in the future),</li>
<li>"fringe" (for theories with staying power that have only a limited following), and</li>
<li>"unaccepted" (for theories like <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> that have a popular following but are not accepted by the scientific community. Hopefully this will give that entry some needed NPOV.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>["Crackpot" should never be used: Not only is it an insult, but if something is really crackpot (in that it lacks a following) it should not even appear in Wikipedia.]</dd>
<dd>Do realize that in times past, both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_drift.html" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> would have been included here. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 1 July 2005 20:33 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If a better title and criteria can be developed then <i>move</i>. This is a good and useful article. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 1, 2005 21:02 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no solid criteria as to what qualifies as "alternative, speculative and disputed theories". Virtually everything has been disputed at some time or another. I fail to see why creationism is included when it is disputed by evolutionists, yet evolution is not included when it is disputed by creationists. (I'm an evolutionist, by the way). <a href="../../../d/s/h/User%7EDsh34_9700.html" title="User:Dsh34">Dsh34</a> 2 July 2005 23:44 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is just the name of the article. How about you try reading the article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 3 July 2005 00:11 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a shame the alternative theory folks are so determined to prove their idea is right that they risk losing a resource that may actually increase their following (and perhaps attract someone who may eventually prove their ideas correct to the larger scientific community), as well as widens the viewpoint of researchers who don't necessarily believe them, possibly leading to advances on other fronts. This is a great resource for rainy day reading, as well as sparking interest in other areas, such as the history category of Wikipedia. Hopefully, the announcement that there has been trouble will assist with keeping an eye on this page, although I'd suggest mentioning these problems to the larger Wikipedia community, for further help regarding this situation. As far as the "theory acceptance is always changing" argument, we need to keep in mind that Wikipedia is always changing as well, and as such, should continue to reflect those changes as they are made. The important part is the theory's status at the present time.-- Scott_R 13:53, Jul 3, 2005 (EST)</li>
