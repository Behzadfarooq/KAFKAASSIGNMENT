<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it's the fact that playing in the FLT makes a player notable, it's more that these two players represented <i>Football League</i> teams in what is a recognised first-team competition. By the same token, I'd argue that a player who has represnted a League team in an FA Cup match would satisfy the notability guidelines but that doesn't mean that anyone who plays for a team that's eligible to play in the FA Cup is notable.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:00, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>(Declaring an interest as an AFC Wimbledon supporter &amp; authour / contributor to many of these articles)</i>.

<dd>That's merely an indication of how good Soccerbase is (I believe he is listed there as "<i>Bryon</i> Bubb"!), but you are correct the site does not list him as having ever played for Millwall. Conclusive proof, indeed! I stated that he had made <b>around</b> 20 appearances for Millwall because that is what it said in the AFC Wimbledon press release when he was signed and is what is stated in the players <a href="http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/players.php?squad=1&amp;Psection_id=3&amp;Psub_section_id=3&amp;player_id=1030&amp;position=Midfielder" class="external text" title="http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/players.php?squad=1&amp;Psection_id=3&amp;Psub_section_id=3&amp;player_id=1030&amp;position=Midfielder" rel="nofollow">Player profile</a> on the Official Site. However, for further <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, other sources include <a href="http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/millwall/millwall.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/millwall/millwall.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> which lists him as having made 8 league appearances for Millwall, while <a href="http://www.millwall-history.org.uk/Millwall-A2Z-AtoD.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.millwall-history.org.uk/Millwall-A2Z-AtoD.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> says 3+5+7=15. (I read somewhere that I can't immediately locate that he made a total of 15 starts and 5 substitute appearances at Millwall, totalling 20 appearances).

<dd>All in all, I have to say I find it slightly disappointing as someone who has contributed to wikipedia in an attempt to increase the coverage of non-league football (both players and clubs, and organisational structures) that we should be voting to cut much of this out, thereby decreasing the coverage of football.

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> was suggesting that competing in the Football League Trophy was a qualifier for notability.

<li><b>Delete all</b>, with the possible exception of Bubb due to his appearances for Grenada. The nom originally took me by suprise, as there is a different, far more notable footballer called Paul Barnes who scored more than 100 League goals in the 1990s. Many league clubs field reserve teams in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Trophy_51af.html" title="Football League Trophy">Football League Trophy</a>, playing one match as a substitute in that competition, as Lennie has, does not imply notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> - In terms of whether a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Trophy_51af.html" title="Football League Trophy">Football League Trophy</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> or similar first team appearance qualifies as sufficient for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a>, there is clearly an ambiguity here which needs resolving. What <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says is <i>"Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league"</i> however this does not take into account any other first team competitions that are not league-based. I think the statement should be revised to <i>"Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played <b>at senior level for a team that competes</b> in a fully professional league"</i>. --&#160;<b><a href="../../../m/l/d/MLD_b5b6.html" title="MLD">MLD</a></b>&#160;<small><b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../m/l/d/User_talk%7EMLD_aa63.html" title="User talk:MLD">T</a>&#160;<b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MLD_8977.html" title="Special:Contributions/MLD">C</a>&#160;<b>·</b></small>&#160;<font face="Courier">@:</font>&#160; 16:33, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it is necessary to rely on a handful of unremarkable cup matches to make a case for notability, then the chances of being able to craft an article of any length about that professional career using <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources is minimal. Verifiability is more important than <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> criteria, which are guidelines to help a decision rather than rules set in stone. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 18:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Bubb, Lennie, Curley, delete the other 8</b>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> makes the point about being in the squad for a "professional league" as a claim for notability extremely clear. Therefore, by virtue, those who don't reach this level are non-notable. <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">.</a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">Bryant</a></b></span> 10:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>:Scott Curley , Byron Bubb,Josh Lennie and Mark Rooney. Probably delete the rest as they fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> although it is a bit of a mess as it's hard to quickly judge on a large number of players.
