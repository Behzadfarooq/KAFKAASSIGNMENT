<li>sorry, i didn't mean to push out the Nirvana song entry. Can I post the article under Come As You Are (sex toy shop)? Much less significant Cdn sex shops have articles: Good For Her and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_Envy_%28sex_shop%29_3b46.html" title="Venus Envy (sex shop)">Venus Envy (sex shop)</a>.

The article wasn't meant to be an ad. sorry. -- Northleft
<ul>
<li>It might be best for you to move the article to the new location for now. I'm sure it won't hurt the debate to move it, since there is a consensus (so far) to use the current page as a redirect.

<li>I would be ok with just moving it to the new article you've created and redirecting the current article to the Nirvana song. However, the article seems very POV, using positive terminology when neutral terminology should be used. This makes it look like an astroturfing job instead of a legit article. Neutralize the language, cite some sources, and add criticism (if any exists) and it should be ok to stay. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:20, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The deletes seem to be objecting to the way the article has currently been written, not to the viability of such an article in itself. Surely the whole point of a collaborative venture is that other editors will work on an article that needs improvement, not just delete it because it's not good enough. There is an article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_text_editors.html" title="Comparison of text editors">Comparison of text editors</a> which is directly comparable to this one and demonstrates the standard that this article needs to aim for.

<li>In response to <a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnucmo2_ec08.html" title="User:Knucmo2">Knucmo2</a>, the article as it stands is just an exposition of somebody's view of what word processors should be like. That violates NPOV and original research at least. To the people who say that an article on the topic of Comparison of Word processors could be good, if like the existing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_text_editors.html" title="Comparison of text editors">Comparison of text editors</a>, I agree. The question is, since this article as it stands isn't even on that topic, in spite of its title, and has shown no hint of evolving in that direction in over a month of frequent edits, is it better to leave it and hope for a complete replacement, or to get rid of it until someone comes along and starts an article actually devoted to the topic?<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillposer_1189.html" title="User:Billposer">Bill</a> 23:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't agree. It seems to me to be an attempt to define the difference between a text editor and a word processor. That seems a reasonable enough way to introduce the topic. Maybe it could be improved, but that is of course the point of a collaborative project. Then there is a list with some minimal comparisons, again something to be improved. A month is not a long time in the evolution of Wikipedia. I can't see the rush to delete, rather than improve. There seems to be a growing tendency to think that a badly written article is cause for deletion, so all the energy goes into AfD discussions about it, rather than working on it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:58, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I note that the comments have been separated into "delete", "mixed" and "merge" sections. I think this is counterproductive, as it does not show the evolution of the discussion on this topic chronologically. Please note also that this is not a "vote" process: it is a "discussion" process. I therefore request that this is restored to the normal chronological sequence, and the term "vote" is deleted. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:38, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed that this is not a truly democratic <i>voting</i> process. It can more accurately be described as a process to try to generate a consensus. I have seen many AfD's in the past structured this way. In fact, this whole process used to be called <i>Vote for deletion</i>. I think that the name may have been changed to better reflect the greater desire for consensus rather than for division which is the most common outcome of a <i>vote</i>. In my restructuring I have retained all timestamps so the sequential evolution of the dialogue can be noted. Restructuring it this way helped me to follow the commentary structure. In the spirit of the new <i>renaming</i> of this discussion, I will retitle the sections to <i>Suggestions for... this or that</i>. If you want to revert it back to the previously more random structure, that's fine with me. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the offer. I am not going to over-ride the decision for splitting points of view, but I do think it makes it harder to follow the conversation. I think "suggestions" instead of "votes" is a good change, and makes things less rigid. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:56, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your patience with me. The last time I was involved in AfD discussions, roughly a year ago, the format was as I had first refactored it. I see the benefit of the newer format and have since refactored this discussion back to the current norm.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> is <i>not</i> "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a>" and it is not merely "a book." There is nothing in ACIM about crystals, auras, chakras, meditating, incense, UFOs, aliens, etc. ACIM is a self-contained spiritual thought system that blends non-dual views of God (akin to ancient Hindu teachings) with modern day psychological insight in the tradition of Freud and Jung. It was first published in 1975 and has since sold over 1 million copies; its sales show no sign of slowing down, and it has been translated into dozens of languages <a href="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. And it was the basis of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianne_Williamson_28c0.html" title="Marianne Williamson">Marianne Williamson</a>'s book "A Return to Love" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060927488/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060927488/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which sold about four million copies in the US, and millions around the world. "A Course In Miracles" is projected by many to be as widely read as the Bible at some point.</dd>

<dd><b>This issue was the centerpiece of a high profile lawsuit</b>. I'm sure that most of you, who appear largely to be uninterested in this whole genre of non-mainstream spirituality, as you have made snide and unfair comments about it, are completely unaware that this issue of authorship of ACIM became the focalpoint of a very high profile court case between <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endeavor_Academy_b302.html" title="Endeavor Academy">Endeavor Academy</a> <a href="http://www.acim.org/news_items/copyright_news.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acim.org/news_items/copyright_news.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/courtcase/helenauthor.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/courtcase/helenauthor.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Lastly, this article does not contain "original research" as it links directly to comments from other sources. At this point, the article is not fully developed. Not being fully developed doesn't qualify this article as an "idiocyncratic non-issue," but as a <b>stub</b> -- and that's hardly a reason to delete the article.</dd>

<li><b>Mixed</b> I read this article and wanted to nominate it for BJAODN, but ACIM is notable nuttery and the lawsuit over "cannot hold the copyright to a work that was 'channeled from a disembodied entity'" probably makes this a notable topic. The parent article is very large, so I'm not sure whether some material on this topic should be merged into it. As it stands, all the unsourced references to "some people believe" ... "it is claimed that" ... make the majority of this article appear to cross <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The problem with the merge suggestion is that, as someone else noted, the main ACIM article is rather long. And though this article is itself only a stub at the moment, I anticipate it will grow a great deal after some time.

<dd><b>A History of this article: It actually <i>began</i> as a part of the main article</b>: Did you all know that this article actually <i>did</i> begin on the main page ... where it was debated and edited into non-existence? The topic of this article is so controversial that many people within the "Course community" do not want to discuss it, and therefore if it is merged back into the main ACIM article it will just disappear. Are those of you who are voting for it to merge willing to keep an eye on the main page and make sure the whole thing isn't just deleted?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The history of this article has been quite frustrating. First, I introduced it as a brief paragraph in the main article. In the main article, it was debated - rather hotly - until I decided to move it to its own article. Soon, it was suggested (by someone unfamiliar with ACIM) that it be merged <i>back</i> into the main article ... and now someone is suggesting it be deleted, and in response to the deletion request it is being suggested that it be merged again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose we can just go round and round with this one. We can merge it back, it can disappear, and I can start another article on this topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem here is that most of you voting on what to do with this article are not ACIM students and therefore can't grasp that this issue has any importance. The other problem is impatience. Doesn't it take <i>time</i> for a stub to develop into a good article?</dd>

<dd>That's not the case at all. How can this be POV when I present two different opinions? I just don't get where you people are coming from.

You all just don't "get" what the article is about because the topic is out of your league. So frustrating to have people vote on a topic that they don't even understand or care about.

<dd>Such comments are indeed sourced. Read the damned articles I link to.

<dd>To start, the term "original research" as used on Wikipedia is imprecise. I am currently taking a college class on writing research papers, and the bulk of the class is devoted to understanding how to list the sources upon which one's research paper is based. Explicit in this class is the rule that in doing research <i>one must cite one's outside sources</i>. It's odd that on Wikipedia the term "original research" is apparently used to denote an article lacking reference to outside sources. But I'll set that argument aside.</dd>

(In part, it was not well written because I had gotten tired of working on an article that caused so much controversy. I was tired of the battle.) And I realize that to some of you, this article is "notable nuttery." Fine. That's your perspective and you're entitled to it.</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> ACIM seems to me to most certainly be a topic of note. This aspect of ACIM seems to me to so far be a topic that has not yet shown to be of great interest to many, yet there does appear to me to be some potential for future interest. I vote to merge as suggested on the article's discussion page at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_Christ_as_source_of__A_Course_In_Miracles__5eab.html#AfD_discussion" title="Talk:Jesus Christ as source of &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot;">the article's discusison page, AfD section</a>. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:31, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mixed</b> , <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. It's not fair to condemn it as NOR, as there are 7 references given and this is obviously a topic of debate that exists beyond the authorship of this article. Describing it as "BJAODN" and "notable nuttery" is completely POV. Wiki is here to record what other people are saying, not how we see things, and a lot of people take this seriously. Is any "religious" topic "notable nuttery?" Some might think so. Comments such as "some people believe" are weasel words, which may or may not also fall foul of NOR, but do not necessarily do so. They may merely indicate the author is not entirely familiar with writing guidelines. OK, so it needs to be cleaned up. There is no intrinsic bar to solipsism, as far as I know. It does indeed concern a "single new age book", but one which was a best-seller in its field, popular and influential. Negative comments about this topic can also be included in the article, provided they are properly referenced. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy applies to article content, not to project discussions. Nonetheless I apologize for mixing personal opinion with editorial discussion. As a person (not in my role as editor) I consider all religions large and small to be nuttery. As a WP editor I consider those religions which have verifiable notability (regardless of illogicality) to be worth serious attention, including balance against POV editing by adherents. The fact remains that I got a good laugh out of "copyright to a work that was 'channeled from a disembodied entity'", and almost as much from the underlying argument. The improvements in documentation would lead me to change my vote to "neutral, leaning toward Keep" if a partisan editor hadn't refactored this AfD discussion contrary to the AfD norm. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, then you may be interested to find that <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> is not a religion. It is merely a book that you read. Some people have started churches around it, but there is nothing in the book that talks about the need to start churches. The book designates itself as a self-study book intended for the individual to read on his own. Further, the Course has little resemblance to any religion because it denies a creator God; I attended a workshop with Kenneth Wapnick two years ago at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> wherein he referred to A Course In Miracles as being "<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheistic.html" title="Atheistic">atheistic</a>", because the Course says God did not make the physical world and has nothing to do with it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 06:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. This article is not a "POV fork". It caused controversy on the original page because it is a controversial issue, which you and the others would understand if you were to read the links I provide in the article and above. It was later decided that it was <i>too</i> controversial, and therefore too expansive, for the main page. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">Controversy</a> is not the same as a POV fork. There are many controversial issues that are given their own pages. And as this issue (whether Jesus is the source of A Course In Miracles) resulted in a lawsuit between a major publisher (Penguin) and two non-profit organizations (<a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endeavor_Academy_b302.html" title="Endeavor Academy">Endeavor Academy</a>), and is important to tens of thousands of people around the world, it is indeed a notable issue. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 11:40, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> the article described is a real thing. I used to get "Biotechnology Laboratory" which was free and filled with ads that were numbered; you circle the number of the ad you want information on and send the card back. I didn't know they were called Bingo cards, although that makes sense since they are usually a table of numbers to be circled. Not sure if its notable enough. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:36, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

(I searched old AfDs because I thought I remembered it there but didn't search the main article space.) Seems to be an unlikely term for redirect with the oddly-placed hyphen.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This was a self-referential meme where people linked to each other's Zangelding pages, and also intentionally came up with a lot of bogus links (e.g., "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/zangelding/" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/zangelding/" rel="nofollow">President of the United States shows his support to the Zangelding movement</a>"). It was more fun if you read the URLs and link descriptions. I really don't think this got much force behind it, though, or got as much weight to it as some more well-known memes. Even I took my Zangelding page down some time ago. =) As for WP:MEMES, this can't be said to have influenced other memes, created copycats, or been much original ("Link to each other's bogus pages", bah, that happens every day), nor can I remember seeing media mentions. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:24, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is that a delete? If so, please state it explicitly. However, I don't think you're doing the page justice. You left out the part that asserted that he supervised 54 schools in Hong Kong (which creates at least marginal notability, I think) and served on the Council of World Missions. Again, not completely clear that that is sufficient notability to be kept, but you left off two of the most notable parts of his career. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 17:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>First, WP:NOT a crystal ball. Second, the article is completely unsourced. There's casting information, but no links to anywhere that verifies it, not even IMDB. I know of at least 1 fan site that quotes this article on casting Rachel Stevens (Rachel stevens online). So entire article does not meet WP:CITE and WP:V. Claims interviews with tarantino, but I googled and can't find any regarding hostel deux.

<li><b>Comment</b> Upon further investigation, the Hostel Deux thing is a complete hoax. There is evidence for a "Hostel 2" coming out, but not Hostel Deux. In fact, Hostel Deux was added, without sources to wikipedia, and then external sources CITE THE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY as the source for hostel Deux!

<li><b>Keep</b> The article was written out of consideration for other pages involving <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Pearson_8f39.html" title="Justin Pearson">Justin Pearson</a> and all other bands he has been in. Swing Kids are somewhat lesser known than his other bands but are more seminal in nature and referenced on many other Wikipedia entries, including the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_Emo_f618.html" title="Hardcore Emo">Hardcore Emo</a> genre. What's worse is most of the links incorrectly linked to the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_Kids_d44b.html" title="Swing Kids">Swing Kids</a> movement of nazi-era Germany instead of the band before I wrote this article mere hours ago. It is an incomplete stub and I am still in the process of doing research. The patience and understanding of the Wikipedia admin community would be greatly appreciated here. As far as notability is concerned, the Swing Kids feature members of other notable bands and have toured internationally. Their records were released on an independent label alongside other notable bands.<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtyv_318a.html" title="User:Curtyv">Curtyv</a> 04:54, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Speedy Keep</b> They are very notable, and all the members have formed other notable bands afterwards. First off Justin Pearson is in that band. If you don't know who he is, well he's also in this band called the The Locust. According to the guidelines found here <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, this band CANNOT be deleted off of Wikipedia because this group ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or <i>one of the more important indie labels</i> (such as <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_One_G_d1fe.html" title="Three One G">Three One G</a>) (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</li>
</ul>
<p>So based on these grounds, I call for a Speedy Keep - <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseRobotRise_c242.html" title="User:RiseRobotRise">RiseRobotRise</a> 11:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. For one thing, RiseRobotRise may be confused; we're not debating the notability of The Locust, but of Swing Kids. That an unrelated band may register on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s radar might be interesting but is certainly irrelevant. For another, while this Pearson fellow might have his fans, 280 G-hits isn't a lot, and calling <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_One_G_d1fe.html" title="Three One G">Three One G</a> (run, as it happens, by Pearson himself) one of the "more important indie labels" is an enormous stretch.

Justin Pearson who would release their recordings on his own Three One G record label, is in numerous other bands today along with starting and runing his own business.

<dd>Being a support act on a <i>national tour</i> requires proof.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Eric Allen, a member of Unbroken (perhaps one of the most important hardcore punk bands of the mid 1990s), was also in Swing Kids. This alone makes the band of high importance.</li>
<li><b>Comments:</b> (1) This is a VfD on the defunct band Swing Kids, not on its members nor its members' subsequent bands nor a member's independent record label. We're only considering those to the extent that they bear on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) From that guideline: "Many editors also believe that it is (a) fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, without straying into <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (all of which are formal policies). Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included; meeting one or more of these criteria does not mean that a subject must be included." An "audience of hundreds no less" in any country doesn't meet the "audience of 5,000" guideline. Show evidence that SK were widely featured as being so innovative and influential, and we'll have reason to keep this article instead of redirecting it to the more-proven-notable topic <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Pearson_8f39.html" title="Justin Pearson">Justin Pearson</a>. (3) Mystache and Fishal aren't quite correct: The existence of articles on related topics linked to one another doesn't really indicate notability for any of them unless either they've survived AfD, or they contain citations to reliable sources proving notability. A whole bunch of fiction or trivia could be added as a "walled garden" of articles to give WP's credibility; people have tried this. Notable bands/musicians/etc, like notable fiction or religions, can have associated topics that are too minor or just not documented enough to keep as their own article. Some of this information is worth keeping, just in one article instead of five. No change of vote, pending evidence more directly relevant. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we need to do some digging here. This article and Miller's documentary We Become Silent represent the only contributions by the editor. There are only 89 G-hits for the film -- this after excising references to Martin Luther King, who used the phrase in a speech -- but those hits reference a speech Dennis Kucinich made citing it, and one of those hits is from Kucinich's Congressional web site, so it can't be spurious.

Alexandra Shackleton has at least a bit of notability (in WP's terms) established by the NOVA interview, but most of it is "here's the person who knows and cares enough about Ernest S to interview", not stuff that imputes much encyclopedic importance to her. This is right on the edge of my threshold for inclusion, but I'm voting <b>weak keep</b> simply because she was featured (not just interviewed somewhere deep within a documentary) and I'm assuming NOVA had an audience well over 5000.

I'm not sure if the sirbacon.org link is to a copy of the book (it's been over 70 years, it may be in public domain), or what. She's not the most notable person, but she is the semi-notable wife of an extremely notable person, daughter and wife of two other peers (she remarried), and the subject of a historical book.

<dd>A further thought - as debunkers would like to get rid of all astrology pages if they could - they have the avowed intent of wiping astrology off the face of the planet, so their vote, strictly speaking, should be <i>discounted</i>, more so as they are poorly placed to decide on matters affecting astrology because their knowledge of the subject is invariably close to zero (on the grounds: why waste your time when it's all a lot of nonsense anyway?). Frankly I find it quite offensive, considering astrology has a community more than averagely packed with M.A.'s, PhD's and other clever and multi-talented people. Surely common-sense says that they haven't all been hoodwinked? <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 17:41, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Suggest you leave Jeff Mayo &amp; Mayo School on, Lundse, as someone is bound to put them in at some point. Jeff was one of the most famous astrologers of the 20thC - but you wouldn't know that I guess, as you evidently, like Jefffire, know nothing about astrology. Neither Jeff Mayo nor the Mayo School has any connection to me whatsoever (see my comment on my talk page), and clearly the only reason they have been nominated is because they happen to have the same surname as myself. None of the other pages I have edited has been nominated, even though some of them are slighter, so this is clearly the reason. I see how it all works now - very cosy. That tells me more about the influence of the debunkers on this site than I want to know. Please tell me that the three of you who have voted so far are <i>not</i> all skeptics or debunkers desperate for evey inch of advantage you can get for your point of view, and I'll be both surprised and impressed. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 15:32, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks RGT, I appreciate your neutral input. Jeff Mayo and the Mayo School certainly qualify under those guidelines - I'd better leave it to other editors to provide the details to avoid further criticism. As for myself, borderline. I can't cite my famous clients, so that's no use. I have numerous clippings from newspapers but that may not be enough. I have varous other claims to notability which I did not mention, such as being the originator and organiser of the ground-breaking UK Earth Spirit Festival in 1984 and 1985 (which the papers said attracted 6,500 people), and the founder and first Chair of UFORM. However, I suspect that none of this will count a bean for those determined to see me off, therefore like I already said, I'll remove my page. I'm not a vain person, and I only did the entry because a few clients had asked me to. At that point I was not familiar with the Wikipedia tradition (though it should have been obvious not to write my own page, in hindsight). <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 18:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To Mayo - yes, I did find Jeff through you, because I have formerly seen an astrologer put himself on that list and make a page much like yours. So I searched the list for your name and found more people with the same surname and made by you - so I did assume you were related, sorry if I was wrong. I do not know how notable the Mayo school et al is within the astrological community - it is very possible they should stay, as I said in my nomination (I still stand by the fact that more than one astrologer should note them, though). I do not get your argument that skeptics should not edit astrology, who do you mean should be excluded: those with an ideological stake in the matter (including astrologers?), or that only those who disagree with your and/or require evidence before wanting something to be stated as fact in an encyclopedia? And for the record, I am still willing to be convinced. Both with regards to the notability of you and the other Mayo's and about astrology (I lurk in "validity of ast..."). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 07:31, 21 April 2006 (UTC) (a bit late in writing his sig)</p>

But as this "attack" came at a certain point in a fairly unfriendly "discussion" between myself and Jefffire the debunker, I'm sure you can understand that it raised my suspicions that he had orchestrated a campaign to hit at me any way he could, which suspicion proved unfounded as he provided with me with his assurance it was not so, which is good enough for me. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 21:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Either way, I would vote to keep an article about an astrologer, a fundamentalist evangelist, or anyone else whom I disagreed with, as long as the article made plausible claims of notability and met other criteria. (You yourself assess your notability as "borderline" in the discussion above.) Similarly, I would vote to delete an article about a non-notable scientific sceptic. I cast <i>a lot</i> of votes in this forum, and I don't discriminate on whether the subjects of biographical articles share my own world view. And for the record, I have had no dealings whatsoever with the two people who voted before me. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 00:55, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But there's no need for all this - I have already said I shall remove my page, as it does not seem appropriate to maintain it - on that I think we are agreed. In fact I bitterly regret putting up all the pages of notable living astrologers I have started to add. It never occurred to me what a hornets nest I might be exposing them to. I see myself getting into trouble with some of them over this, though my intention was simple and honest - to be helpful and informative. As I know or have at least met most of them (and read their books) I might have been a useful source of info I would have thought. In summary, my vote is to remove my own page, keep Jeff Mayo's (as he is dead) and the Mayo School's. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 08:22, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is quite curious to me that there are clearly very few astrologers editing this website, as most of the arguments I've looked at are either dominated or totally decided by people whose user-pages show them to be not only non-astrologers, but scientists, pseudo-scientists, people whose main interests appear to lean towards science, debunkers and skeptics.

<dd>Well ... come to that, would it surprise you to learn I'm a former CSICOP member? That being said, I see no more reason why I cannot reasonably and dispassionately apply the various rules and guidelines governing the verifiability and notability of articles in this instance than to any others referenced in the the numerous AfD discussions on which I comment; plainly some astrologers satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, regardless of whether I consider their pseudo-science delusion at best.

And that is very honest of you to own up to being a former CSICOP member, and therefore I assume yet another debunker - this place seems to be littered with them. Similarly to you, I would vote for a debunker who satisfied the editorial conditions, even though I do regard them as suffering from the most appalling narrow-mindedness that causes their first victim to be the search for truth.

<dd>Actually, I consider "narrow-mindedness" a virtue in AfD debates. So many rebuttals to nominations focus on how much work the editor put into the article, how invaluable a resource it can be, how it surely could be expanded into something more useful, how one's background unfairly affects voting, how the article is a step in some manner of public outreach, etc. Unfortunately, AfD focuses on only two real issues: is the subject notable? Is the article verifiable? The same applies to skepticism at large, where the only question at hand is whether the claims are verifiably, unambiguously true. For anything beyond that, I imagine we ought to take it to User Talk pages ... <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a></dd>

<p>I hope this is not an argument about whether astrology "belongs" in Wiki. I don't want to join such a discussion. Forgetting whether or not you have any respect for astrology, the study of its history and considerable cultural influence is an important intellectual pursuit. In that context, Jeff Mayo was an important, highly trained British astrologer of noted integrity and influence. I had absolutely no connection with him nor have I ever met or communicated with any of his heirs or students. He wrote several fine books, some of which are still in print. His approach to astrology was singularly schematic, since Mayo was a good astronomer and insisted that astrologers understand the physical, phenomenal basis of what they do to a degree that was singular in his time. I suggest that the decision about the inclusion of such material should be left to those with serious interest in the history and technique of astrology. I have authored at least a dozen good articles in Wiki on the subject--mostly in the history of astrology--and materially revamped dozens of others, and I hope my opinion will have some weight. I see no legitimate reason to delete the article. NaySay 17:24, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Observation</b> -- Above the issue was raised if sceptics should "vote" on astrology articles, and some disagreement emerged on their ability to judge the neutrality of an article's point of view. That, however, was not the issue; the issue was notability. Indeed, people having the opinion that everything involving topic X is hogwash may not be the best positioned to judge notability, and should try to exercise a reasonable amount of restraint. Conversely, people who believe that all X is of the utmost importance might be inclined to ascribe more notability than is warranted. But I think recommendations from all sides are welcome. I'm more bothered by "votes" of people who don't investigate the issues before voting, who fail to consider earlier arguments, or who totally misapply the existing policies. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response:</b> ES2, how can I afford to assume good faith when you immediately cite a perfect example of your bias, by quoting Randi (a successful debunker) and Browne (a fairly well-demolished claimant to be psychic)? Why not quote a successful psychic to balance Randi? It would seem more even-handed. For example, what about Uri Geller, who earned his fortune by charging oil and other prospecting companies 200,000 dollars a throw for saying "x marks the spot to the nearest centimetre. Drill down at 13.52 degrees N5.2degNW for 1231 metres and you'll find the product at this specific rate of flow, this specific quantity, this specific purity"? Perhaps it was because Geller took Randi to court and won that you don't mention him? Or perhaps it is because you just can't help talking from POV, like so many of us. I would like to be able to assume good faith, but at every turn I am given good reason to remain skeptical about debunkers - especially with those that remind me about the need for good faith. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 22:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please, Uri Geller is famous for making the football teams he tries to crystal-psychic-leyline-boost to succes fail miserably. The oil business is based on his own claims and the trial Geller won was for "insulting" him (lets bring up Gellers other trials instead).

<dd>Mm, quite. If there was a <i>single</i> verified citation of Geller's claims of oil prospecting, that might be one thing, but there never has been, other than Geller's naked word. And I admit to being disappointed; I dislike exhortations to show good faith in the same post where you mention Geller winning a lawsuit against Randi (and allowing people to draw the inference it was a suit relating to Geller's claim to psychic powers) without mentioning it concerned an incident where Randi had suggested that Geller had driven a friend to suicide. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 11:38, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lambiam, I totally respect your comments. I went against policy by adding my own page - a stupid thing to do, in hindsight, easily seen as vain. Seeing this by someone else, I would have been just as suspicious (now, with a few weeks experience). It was my very first edit; I did not trouble to read the guidelines or policies, which was clearly a mistake. On this AfD project, my issue was (and remains) that with all but one voter being on either the scientific or debunking side of things, with almost zero knowledge of astrology, even if their neutrality was unquestionable they are poorly placed to know enough about the people within astrology to cast a fair vote. Nobody goes ten weeks into a part-time astrology course without hearing Jeff Mayo's name. Many thousands around the world carry his diploma as their only entitlement to belong to a professional association. To even suggest he is non-notable is crazy. In fact the proposer specifically admitted he had made a mistake, after sparking off my accusations of witch-hunt. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 22:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>RGT: So where has Geller's fortune come from, then, if you know better? I rather thought that (sadly) money talked louder than words in this world; businesses don't pay out big money without big returns, inferring Geller's accuracy. I allowed myself to forget how you debunkers think when I made such an unsupported statement; smack my hand! You misquote me: I made no "exhortations to show good faith". That was ES2. As for Randi, one of us has got muddled. I thought the conviction of Randi was for causing the suicide of a Japanese professor, with Geller simply facilitating the prosecution. I certainly did not intend to mislead in referring to this conviction, as I never imagined that all the debunkers on this page would not know about the case. Last point: as usual the substance of my comment was ignored and brushed aside with this peripheral stuff. You may be able to fool the public with these strawman techniques, RGT, but they are wasted on me. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 19:30, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because Geller has money does not mean his services worked. How do you make that argument? Browne has made more money than Geller, by your argument, she must be the better psychic... And I read through your post, what was the substance? That we are not showing good faith? Would that be good faith towards Geller when he claims he can find oil but has nothing to back up that claim? Towards you? In that case you have plenty of good faith, jst provide somthing more than rehearsing Gellers claims and we (I at least) am all ears. We are skeptic in these matters precisely because we have never seen anything resembling evidence. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 06:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You thought wrong about the Randi case, PM, quite aside from that it was a <i>civil</i> case having nothing to do with "convictions." As far as Geller's "fortune" goes -- although, come to that, he scarcely lives in the style that someone paid vast sums by oil companies would suggest -- he was a professional performer for a couple of decades. And straw man me no straw men; if you're going to cite Geller to back up your argument, you ought to be prepared to defend your selection. So let me ask you again: what verifiable evidence to you have (other than Geller's naked word) that he ever received a dime from any oil company? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>None. Neither am I basing any argument on Geller - I know very little about him, only that he is famous for being "a psychic", whether or not one accepts that appellation. Thanks for correcting me on the Randi-Geller case, RGT. Was what I read about Randi being fined millions of dollars also wrong? As I have no interest in either Geller or Randi, I didn't take the trouble to double-check what I read. The style he lives in is not evidential surely? I know of several extremely wealthy people who live modestly in terraced houses. As for evidence to Geller's earnings source, this is getting into the patently ridiculous because a) I am not his accountant, and b) I have no interest in him, so why would I bother even looking for any such evidence? You're the one who wants to know, not me, so you find the evidence. When you find it, don't bother me with it. The only evidence that impresses me is the evidence of my own senses (as the world is undoubtedly subjective) on things that matter to me, like astrology.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But then, this view will not surprise you, as I make no pretence to be a scientist or even a pseudo-scientist, nor to abide by the rules scientists set themselves. It is safer to abide by those cautious rules, I think, but one has to draw the "evidence" line somewhere, otherwise we'd want every loaf of bread double-checked for mouse-droppings and every organic cabbage for pesticides before we ate it. I know perfectly well that my bed has dust-mites, but if I had the evidence of it I might not sleep so peacefully. Astrology works for me, it doesn't work for you. Fine, I have no problem with that, although it does raise the question of why you and your companions-in-arms hovver around astrology pages. As a matter of polite curiosity, do astrologers ever come onto your debunking pages and tell you what a load of rubbish debunking is? That's a genuine question, not rhetorical. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 16:23, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, whatever you read about Randi being filed millions of dollars is quite wrong; it was a simple defamation suit based around Randi making a crack about Geller driving a friend to suicide, and the jury award was $2,000, which is pathetically small in a case of that kind. As far as evidence goes, as you will find is the near-universal case on Wikipedia, we either require sourced evidence for any assertion or for those assertions not to be made in the first place; any unsourced assertion in an article is liable to quick deletion, unless it is phrased as an unproven claim ("Many claim/hold the belief that X is true."). As far as your last question, you are assuming that I hang around either astrology <i>or</i> debunking pages. Neither is the case. I see no particular purpose to trolling pages devoted to pseudo-science, nor to preach to the converted in the latter instance. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:34, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you report here about Geller/Randi is so different to what I read that it makes me wonder if we are talking about the same case. If we are, and if you are correct, then I have been seriously mislead. However, as I said, I have no real interest in the case, so I shall just keep my eyes open to see if confirmation or evidence surfaces either way, rather than scurrying around to find it. As for your "evidence" statement re wiki policy, I have already been made well aware of that during this past few weeks, and entirely agree with the policy, as it is plain common-sense.

<p>Hope it is okay for me to add a comment - I am a user of Wikipedia but not a contributer, and I thought my perspective might be useful. Quite by chance to the above debate, I did a Google search on Jeff Mayo today (after a conversation I had at the weekend about Astrology). I am unrelated to Jeff Mayo (sic!), and not an ardent Astrology fan, but I did want to know something about Jeff Mayo and his school. The article helped, surely this is the acid-test of wikipedia... so from my perspective... please leave it up! (Rob Machin)</p>

<p>Recent and non-notable neologism, coined by author of one of the two or three works that may be classified under the term. The article is mostly a paraphrase of the essay coining the word, and as such serves as somewhat of an advertisement for the works. The term gets only 330 hits on Google with pages mentioning Wikipedia removed (460 otherwise), and has no verifiable source, with the only source being an essay coining the term (the other source listed doesn't use the term at all, and was written years before the term was coined). Most of the distinctions described in the article are already described in the articles pertaining to the works. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantine_Evans_2b64.html" title="User:Constantine Evans">Constantine Evans</a> 10:29, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>* The entire point behind NSF is that it is a reaction to the pseudo-science technobabble in Star Trek. Once BSG started being promoted as having a "realistic scientific slant" to it, we've constantly been beating back a wave of attacks on it by scientific experts who point out how it isn't *exactly* accurate (it is a tv show)......but they ignore the entire crux of the situation, which is that it is *more* realistic than Star Trek was.---&gt;I notice that Evans is not an Administrator, and moreover, is part of the Wikipedia Physics Project. This is just another attack on NSF by technical experts who had their ire raised when the show claimed to be scientifically realistic. In short, there is amble evidence here due to Evans prominent role in the Physics project that his call for a deletion of this article was a "politically" motivated ploy. One more outburst like this and I'm going to slap a fandom category tag onto this, rendering its criteria for existence far more loose.--Ricimer 09:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please assume good faith here, as I've never actually seen the show. The problem here is with notability (there is hardly any use of the term) and verifiability (there are no reliable sources). The essay coining the term doesn't count as a reliable source under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The text could certainly be incorporated into one of the main BSG articles, and this would make sense, since it is what the show is trying to do. But the term is really just a non-notable neologism, and not a real subgenre, regardless of who created it. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantine_Evans_2b64.html" title="User:Constantine Evans">Constantine Evans</a> 15:33, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I agree with the assessments that the term itself isn't widespread outside of the whole controversy surrounding the reimagined BSG. The essay by Ronald D. Moore in which he coined the term is widely based of his personal frustration regarding his tenure with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> which, admittedly, at the time, was at it's worst point in it's long history regarding scriptwriting. I am not against Moore's naturalistic SF philosophy being mentioned in the article for the reimagined BSG. By all means, it should also be expanded on in Moore's own wiki article. Moore's essay is almost three years old and it hasn't caught on in common usage within the genre, other than referring to Moore and HIS Galactica. The term <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpunk.html" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>, on the other hand, was quietly coined by William Gibson without a lot of bluster. Neverthless, peers and fans still somehow caught on to the term on their own. What Moore has done is simply a variation on an existing theme: Using SF to address contemporary political and social issues. <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Space_Nine_9b3a.html" title="Deep Space Nine">Deep Space Nine</a>, Bablyon 5, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Galactic_Heroes_6cb1.html" title="Legend of the Galactic Heroes">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28novel%29.html" title="Dune (novel)">Dune</a> only to name a few that have come before.

<p>This looks as if it's a real and notable subject, but on closer investigation things might not be all they seem. For example, the books mentioned appear to be either free e-books or published by Philip Communications (i.e. self-published). Google shows under 600 hits, with Wikipedia top of the list. No citations are provided outside the subject's own websites.

<li><b>Delete</b> I am the person who last worked on this article. I notice that some of you who want deletion are not presenting the whole fact. For example, one of you say that bibliography leads to the personal sites of this person. You ignored several regular commercial publishers who are listed there. Similarly none of you is ready to consider the definition of "accredited" other than the American model, though mosts older institutions in India work under a British model and do not come under this classification. Some of our greatest scientists, doctors, lawyers, journalists, and ALL theologians come out of these "older" institutions patterned after the British model that are not listed as "accredited" yet they find no difficulty in getting admitted or appointed in the newer institutions that are pattered after the American system and listed in many places as "accredited". Institutions within India know about the British and American models that work here. Since it it difficult to work against so many people who simply are not willing to consider these points I raised, I too recommend that this article be deleted. If this guy is really of any importance let someone else write about him somewhere else. --Nonikay2k</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> per Englishgirls. So you are saying we should delete it because "too new site to judge any notability yet". I feel you have missed the point. The article is not about any specific web site it is about "WikiPorn". I find it remarkable that one is excluded from Wikipedia because a concept is "too new" despite the fact the are several sources and web sites dedicated to it. Englishgirls--Englishgirls 09:37, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, please do not vote twice. Second, "Do not delete" is not a vote, it's a Mark of a Newbie - please read the AfD instructions. Third, "per &lt;your own name&gt;" is a <i>highly</i> unorthodox vote to say the least. Fourth, please sign your posts properly (use ~~~~ or use the signature button on the toolbar).<br />
Fifth, yes, we actually <i>do</i> delete sites that are brand new and have not proven to be of bigger consequences. Heck, we delete <i>older</i> sites that have not proven to be of bigger consequences. And if your wiki says it has <i>approximately zero articles</i> and three users, I'd say it's rather damning evidence that the site isn't very notable yet, regardless of what hard criteria we have. We <i>might</i> be inclined to keep an article on a new site if it's made by some respected established party and there's some proof that it will stick around and be notable <i>some day</i> (think of <a href="../../../a/j/a/AjaxWrite_762c.html" title="AjaxWrite">ajaxWrite</a>, which was quickly AfD'd). But this site doesn't appear to have any of these merits yet. Also see our <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">notability criteria for websites</a> - it clearly fails these. They're tough rules, but they do make sure we will see the forest for the trees.<br />
While you undoubtedly have noble efforts to defend other small and new sites, <i>this</i> particular AfD is about <i>this</i> particular site.<br />
Just for rhetorical comparison, I can take a look at my own MediaWiki installation (not a public wiki yet): 109 pages, 851 views, and 476 edits, most of these by myself - and I'd <i>still</i> say my own wiki is too small and too obscure, in <i>epic</i> proportions, to be included. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

We are not involved or in cohesion together in any way. I can understand your suspicions of a newbie (weren't we all at some point) however, i have been honest and open to keep this article going. I am not a dishonest person. Also, let me reiterate a point. The article is not about any particular web site. It is about "WikiPorn" --<i>Englishgirls</i> --Englishgirls 08:47, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, if you say so. Just <i>sounded</i> suspicious, that's all, forgive me if I went a bit overboard too early, but please also understand that sockpuppetry is a real problem in AfDs.<br />
Anyway, if this isn't about a specific site, there's still one thing to be decided: Is this supposed to be an article about the two currently existing wikis titled "WikiPorn", or a generic article about discussing use of wikis in documenting pornography? If latter, the term "WikiPorn" is a <i>neologism</i>, and the article has to be moved to some more descriptive title (and I'm not sure if we need this, as our current list of wikis does include the category, or did when I last checked it). If it is an article about wikis <i>titled</i> "WikiPorn", we have two sites are only marginally notable and are better off merged somewhere else, and I believe wikiindex.com is better for that sort of stuff. And I still stand by either deleting the article, or redirecting without merge, because frankly, the current article is better off completely rewritten in any case. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:20, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On the point of neologisms/"too new", I note that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a> is included in Wikipedia. "Here a wiki (IPA: [ˈwiː.kiː] &lt;wee-kee&gt; or [ˈwɪ.kiː] &lt;wick-ey&gt;[1]) is a type of website that allows users to easily add, remove, or otherwise edit all content, very quickly and easily, sometimes without the need for registration."</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely "wiki" in this context is a mere blip even in terms of modern history. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">Pornography</a> or "porn" for short is an ancient concept. So is the problem that "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiporn.html" title="Wikiporn">Wikiporn</a>" is the conjuction of these two words? Even if the article is deleted I would still be interested to know your opinions. "The current article is better off completely rewritten in any case" I totally agree. I was hoping for input from other Wikipedians which is what the ethic of Wikipedia is about. I will take the article on board as my "baby" and improve it over time so that it is more educational than it currently stands. "A generic article about discussing use of wikis in documenting pornography?". I must say that I do like that statement, I couldn't have put it better myself. Yes I am hoping that it is exactly that. Several people have said to me "what's a neologism?" or "what is a wikiporn?". It gives me a great buzz to say "look it up on Wikipedia". --<i>Englishgirls</i> --Englishgirls 08:47, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The problem is two-fold. If the article is assessed on the notability of its websites, it fails: the <i>more heavily trafficked</i> one of the two doesn't break one million on the Alexa meter, which is seriously insignificant (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). If on the "concept" of wikiporn, the name is a neologism (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) and the essay original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). If you are genuinely looking for the input of other Wikipedians on this article, our consensus seems to be that until and unless these websites gain enough traffic and outside notice to become notable, or the concept gains widespread and verifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) media and/or academic attention, this subject does not qualify for an article. I appreciate that you get a kick out of having people see your article on Wikipedia, but I hope you understand that Wikipedia doesn't exist for that purpose. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 10:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, well, remember - please don't take AfDs personally. We're debating the merits of <i>articles</i>, not the people who write them. We have near-infinite patience with people, but very little patience with bad articles. =) AfDs happen to best of us. I assure nothing bad will happen to you personally if the article is deleted (though someone may point you toward the newbie documentation and ask you to read it). I suggest reading <i>other</i> articles to see how they're laid out and what kind of information goes to a good article; also read some of the Wikipedia rules and guidelines, to further understand how the stuff works. I hope this AfD has been an educational experience. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There have been many significant big name 'hackers' posting on BH, including mousepad (of D2 maphack fame), the makers of the prolific d2hackit program, the creator(s) of d2jsp and other 'bots', and other programs that have significantly affected the game. The forum has enough history and has been home to enough various programs and people who had a major impact, for better or worse, on Blizzard's games, that it deserves some mention. If imageboards like <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> and forum sites like <a href="../../../s/o/m/SomethingAwful_0538.html" title="SomethingAwful">SomethingAwful</a> or <a href="../../../l/u/e/LUElinks_3850.html" title="LUElinks">LUElinks</a> get their own articles, certainly a board that has had over 200k registered users should be permitted a mention.

<li><b>Keep</b> Blizzhackers has been around for many years now, and has had a major impact on Blizzard Entertainments games. Many (in)famous diablo 2 hackers have posted on these forums, such as Mousepad, Netter, Rishodi, Darawk, and the like. Whether or not people agree of disgree with game hacking shouldn't really be an issue I think, as, either way, it HAS had a profound effect on the game. It has also gone through many changes, and has faced legal issues with blizzard and still come through. Also, similar groups, such as myg0t have a wiki, although blizzhackers has probably been the home to many more hack releases than it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by KSagle (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KSagle_22cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/KSagle">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>And I don't see how your assertions, assuming you provide adequate sourcing for them, meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. Those say nothing about whether renowned hackers hang out there, or whether it's had an impact on some company's games, or been sued, or had its creator appear on TV, have anything to do with whether it's been written about indepedently, won awards, or hostred independently of the creators. Has it been written about in the gaming press? That would help satisfy the first criterion. If I were you that's what I'd be busy looking for.</dd>
<dd>Now I just Googled on the site name. I was told there were <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Blizzhackers%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Blizzhackers%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">114,000 or so hits</a>, but after a mere <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Blizzhackers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=50h&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Blizzhackers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=50h&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">48 or so</a> I ran out as it told me most of what was left was similar to what I'd already seen.

<li><b>Undecided</b> I believe that if sites like SomethingAwful and LUElinks can have their own Wikipedia entries, that Blizzhackers should as well. However, I'm undecided on the matter. I don't want to say that it should stay without providing any proof, but I do personally believe it should stay. It has been host to some of the greatest and most controversial hacks against Blizzard Entertainment software to-date, including having not only its owner, but more than a few notable members threatened with litigation if they did not do what Blizzard Entertainment wanted them to. As far as Alexa ratings and traffic reports go, please bear in mind that the website was on a 5+ month hiatus when Blizzard attempted to take the site down due to WoW server emulation. Alexa rankings at this point mean next to nothing to the notability of the site. Also to note, if you do a Google search of the website's new name, Edge of Nowhere(using the search query "Edge of Nowhere forum", to remove the invalid results relating to various other things), you come up with 4,720,000 results. As a last note, I realize that I'm not a registered Wikipedia user. This is because I have never seen a need to register. I've never found any serious edits I've wanted to make to any artices, and in fact I still haven't seen a need to register. -lord2800 -- 67.134.133.216 03:43, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Consider Blizzhackers a community that helps develop programs through the help of eachother. Without Blizzhackers, many of the bots, including the Mephbot mentioned, would likely not exist. If anything, we can credit Blizzhackers for the works of it's members since Blizzhackers is where many of these members learned, discussed, and created their bots. An analogy could be a Blizzhacker member making a bot compared to a member or team of a University making an invention. Through the help of the University, they are able to get ideas and create this invention, and owe much credit to the University for thier aid.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalgat_8ece.html" title="User:Salgat">Salgat</a> 23:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undecided</b> I am in agreement with the comments of 'lord2800' above. Throughout Wikipedia, there are several articles relating to Blizzard and their games which mention hacks and programs that have propogated on, and in some cases originated on, BlizzHackers. If you talk to any Blizzard or Vivendi employee, I seriously doubt that they would consider BlizzHackers to be "non-notable"; rather, I imagine that they would respond quite to the contrary. On the other hand, I can see that the current BlizzHackers article does not meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria, and although I have been an active, contributing member of BlizzHackers for several years now, I cannot immediately think of a single incident that would prove its notability. It seems that the media tends to avoid mentioning sites that originated with the purpose of game hacking, and for good reason. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that on the subject of Blizzard games, and specifically hacks for these games, BlizzHackers has been one of the most popular sites, if not the most popular site, for the duration of its existence. I would like to add, before someone else points out this fact for me, that this is indeed my first edit as a registered user. I have been using Wikipedia for a long time, but it had not until now come to my attention that I even had the option to register as a user here. If this article does stay, someone needs to take the time to improve it greatly. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 08:12, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am struck in favor of notability by the lawsuit Blizzard filed against the original site that shut it down for some time, which many of you have pointed to. This does not seem like a common occurrence to me, even though I am not really plugged into the gaming community. Is there coverage of this lawsuit somewhere? Where were the legal papers filed? Are they accessible online? If I get more detail on this and it is reflected in the original article, I might well be persuaded to change my vote and withdraw the nom as long as other veteran editors are satisfied. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:46, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, I have a feeling that legal papers were never filed, as Robert Laverick(the current owner of the site) settled out of court and before any legal procedings were attempted. Lawyers flew over to his home, showed up at his doorstep, threatened to sue, and he cooperated(which lead ultimately, but not directly, to a 5-month downtime). I'll see if I can find any non-trivial information about the potential lawsuit, though. Oh, and thanks for the compliments about the civility, I think the fact that this is Wikipedia has scared away most of the newbies from making edits(or they haven't figured out how, heh). -lord2800 -- 67.134.133.205 18:22, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have read all the above comments and agree with them for the most part. I think Blizzhackers is a very important part of video game culture both online and off. It has had an impact on not only Blizzard Entertainment, but on those who play the games with Blizzard produced. I am willing to bet that a large majority (At least in 2002-2004) of Diablo 2 players have heard and about and maybe even visited Blizzhackers.com. Most everyone has been affected by Blizzhackers' members and their game-altering hacks and bots. This hacking was so widespread that it started to get the attention of real-world companies. The cable network TechTV even aired a edpisode of "The Screensavers" which interviewed the notorious Syadasti, a member of Blizzhackers. On the show, he demonstrates his MephBot, Tetris and other D2Hackit modules and makes reference to Blizzhackers.com. A copy of this clip can be found on TechTV's website: <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/41040/Play_Tetris_Within_Diablo_II.html" class="external free" title="http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/41040/Play_Tetris_Within_Diablo_II.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/41040/Play_Tetris_Within_Diablo_II.html</a> Surley this mention alone constitutes a place on Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClark3934_e24d.html" title="User:Clark3934">Clark3934</a> 00:31, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's the entire text of the abovementioned Slashdot "article" so linked: "Posted by CmdrTaco on Tue Jul 19, '05 11:11 AM from the only-a-matter-of-time dept. Over the course of this morning several people have sent me tidbits talking about an exploit on WoW that allows duping of items. Apparently forum posts are being removed on official channels, but there are a few places where you can <i>learn about the exploit</i> and see screenshot evidence. In equally exciting news, my Rogue on Azjol-nerub is probably 2 hours away from 60 and since Blizzard will undoubtedly fix this bug soon, I'll have to finance my epic mount the old fashioned way!" The italicized section is the link to the Blizzhackers' forum. Several of these psuedononymous tidbits get linked per day. I'll leave it to you folks whether the above, in your opinion, constitutes significant media coverage. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:37, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> In response to the above: You apparently did not read all of the information on this page, or did not believe it. I quote: <i>As far as Alexa ratings and traffic reports go, please bear in mind that the website was on a 5+ month hiatus when Blizzard attempted to take the site down due to WoW server emulation. Alexa rankings at this point mean next to nothing to the notability of the site. Also to note, if you do a Google search of the website's new name, Edge of Nowhere(using the search query "Edge of Nowhere forum", to remove the invalid results relating to various other things), you come up with 4,720,000 results.</i> Blizzhackers reached its peak just before Blizzard threatened legal action and the site was taken offline. Since then, its popularity as the respawned "Edge of Nowhere" has never been close to what it used to be. I encourage you all to look at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;size=large&amp;range=2y&amp;url=www.blizzhackers.com/#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;size=large&amp;range=2y&amp;url=www.blizzhackers.com/#top" rel="nofollow">Alexa's daily traffic rate graph</a> which spans the 5-year existence of the site. As you can clearly see, in early 2005 the site had a peak daily traffic rank of under the 10,000 mark and was on a steady incline. You can also note on the graph the point at which the site was shut down, and the relatively poor traffic rankings after that point. I hope some of you reconsider, or at least make a delete vote based on better criteria than Alexa ratings, as I have shown the current ranking of 149,905 to be a false indicator of lack of notability. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 18:45, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be fair, <i>"Edge of Nowhere" forum</i> gets 75,000, but many many of these are unrelated. it's really hard to tell. it does appear pretty close to googlish notability, which is why I voted "weak delete". "Blizzhackers" is a more unique word, and actually has quite a few hits... I may have to reconsider, although it takes a lot for a gaming forums page to achieve notability in my book. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 19:21, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Decent Alexa traffic suggests that a site is active, but no one who's actually looked at the forum would deny that; they've many registered users and many posts. The problem is that these folks' claim to notability is in significantly impacting the gaming world, and I just haven't seen any genuine evidence of that. I want slightly more than a handful of unique G-hits and a fleeting link on a Slashdot gamers' newswire. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:22, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Unfortunately thus far most of these comments people have made have been because of ignorence or prejudice. The ract remains that Blizzhackers has been referenced by multiple reputable media sources, has over 100,000 members with millions of posts, and has legal history with Blizzard Entertainment. You would think these facts would be suffice for being in Wikipedia. And to all you who state about the Alexa Rating or the importance, please do some research before you post, ignorence doesn't help. And do you have any reason to state why this is "self-aggrandising"? And if even it was for promotional reasons, does that subtract from the fulfilled requirements Blizzhackers has provided(not to state that it is)?. And yes, if you feel that this is a ballot stuffing effort, ignore the amount of posts and just look at the content and reasons of each comment, whic is what really matters.

<p>It really is originally a Portuguese-language webcomic, but has a lot of material in English and German, not only strips, but cartoons and specials. It is more popular in portuguese (Pagando O Pato) then other languages, for sure, but I still consider it as a multi-language webcomic, that is why I listed in the webcomics page. I'm trying to "code" it as Wikipedia way, but it seems to be quite complicated. I did some changes, but if you wanna help me on it, you'll be welcome.

<dd>"For great justice" is right that the stuff on Calton's desk isnot worthy of an article. But Calton does raise a legitimate point.

HistoryBA 19:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two definitions of verifiability here. The common 'folk' definition, of 'everything I can see', and the WP policy definition, which specifically excludes things like Calton's desk coffee maker. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is specific in pointing out that only things that are verified by credible sources are to be included. The 'my coffee maker' agrgument is bogus here because it is not verifiable in the WP policy sense of the word. For great justice. 20:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing my point. I am saying that verifiablity alone does not justify inclusion. There are all sorts facts that are verifiable by Wikipedia standards but do not get included in Wikipedia. Wikipedia policy makes it clear that verifiability is just one thresholds that information must clear before being included. It must also be significant. HistoryBA 20:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I disagree. 'Significance' is a terrible concept for an encyclopedia. Art history is significant to me, but not to others, local history is significant to historians, not to scientists. Nuclear physics is significant to some, not to others. Pop culture is signficant to students of pop culture, not to clasicists. That's why verifiability is the gold standard. For great justice. 21:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rather than <i>significance</i>, how about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? I don't think there can be much argument that Dilbert is notable; the question is if each individual compilation of strips is so notable, <i>on its own merits</i>, as to require an individual entry. Given the stubbiness of the articles in question, I'd hazard a guess that the answer at this point is no. Thus, my vote to merge 'em all into a list. If at some future date, someone discovers the Dilbert Code in one of them, then by all means spin it out into an article. Until then, the fragmentation of our knowledge of Dilbert compilations into twenty-three four-sentence-long pages doesn't serve anyone. <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 22:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Notable' suffers from all the same fatal flaws as 'significance', but I agree that Dilbert should stay, because it is 'verifiable'. Merging to a list is perfectly sane, but does not need AFD permission. For great justice. 22:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Besides the fact that notability is not deletion policy, I don't know what you can possibly mean by that. Pokemon is verifiable, thoroughly referenced, extremely popular, can be written about neutrally etc. What is the difference between you saying that and me saying 'Mozart is not notable'? All you mean is 'I don't like Pokemon'. For great justice. 22:20, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>What is the difference between you saying that and me saying 'Mozart is not notable'?</i> Given the effect of Mozart on the world of music and culture -- and the world in general, I'd call that statement -- and I'm being charitable here -- utterly and objectively wrong. And given that notability is a requirement for GETTING an article in the first place, it's absurd to wikilawyer about their lack of explicit mention in deletion policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:00, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what, apart from 'it's obvious', is the difference? It's the number of fans? The 'effect'? What 'effect?' I'd venture to argue that the number of Mozart fans is not an order of magnitude different to the number of Pokemon fans. Sure, Mozart was a dead white guy, and, as such, has a historical head start, but I'm not sure of your point. And pointing out that your assertion has no support in policy (you're wrong by the way that notability is a policy criteria for articles) is not 'wikilawyering'. For great justice. 17:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>W.A. Mozart was a <i>live</i> white guy when he performed the actions for which he is notable, and he was a <i>live</i> white guy when he first became notable by WP's standards. "Number of fans" of a topic is a measure only of shallow but broad notability. Another inclusion standard worth considering is whether there was a substantial and enduring influence on that field. Hundreds of reputable books cite Mozart as one of the most influential composers in the history of music. Pokemon merely entertained hundreds of millions of kids and led to a few imitators. Is each individual Dilbert collection noted in reliable sources for more than "being popular"? (By comparison, there are citations for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dilbert_Principle_8f14.html" title="The Dilbert Principle">The Dilbert Principle</a> being discussed by major magazines, and being required reading in university courses, as being an unusual source of influence on the business world.) 209.2.145.43 23:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I agree that Mozart was alive, and that he is verifiable, and that it is verifiable that he had a substantial impact on his field. It is also pretty obvious that Pokemon has had a substantial impact on its field. Hundreds of books cite Pokemon as one of the most influential phenomena in computer games and card trading games. Mozart, ultimately, 'merely entertained hundreds of millions' of people and led to a few imitators. It is simply a question of 'what I like'. You like Mozart, but not Pokemon. A lot of people share your point of view, while many do not. The mark of maturity however, is being able to differentiate 'what you like' from 'what should go into an encyclopedia. That's what 'verifiability' is for. For great justice. 23:52, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As far as I can tell, the argument for "keep" goes something like this: Dilbert is well-known, and having separate articles for each book doesn't hurt anything. But does it add anything to Wikipedia? Anything at all? I say it actually does hurt by contributing to Wikipedia's image as a collection of trivial information.

<li>It's not that we neccessarily think the articles enhance Wikipedia; it's more that we think the articles <i>could</i> enhance Wikipedia. Forcing them to be deleted removes that potential, and for what? They're verifiable and NPOV, and this is not a violation of WP:NOT, which are the only relevant policies. These are encyclopedic topics: they're books, some very popular, of a popular series, and people might be interested in learning more about them. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 11:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My question wasn't clear--my fault. How <b>could</b> the articles enhance Wikipedia? In theory, what sort of information still awaits addition? It seems to me the content of each article individually is marginal, but to collect them all in one place would allow readers to see how the series developed over time. I enjoy Dilbert, and that would be useful to me. Right now I would have to go to lots of almost-identical articles for that information. This is not a rhetorical question and I am not trying to cause trouble, I just feel that the "keep" people are seeing something I am missing. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 17:09, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what specifically could be said, but I don't know that much about the books. I dunno, maybe a discussion of the running jokes in each book, or some of the longer-term plots that occur, or reaction from fans, may get them to a point where a list would be ungainly. Let me say that I personally would approve of merging them all into a single article, at least as they stand now, for exactly the reasons you say. However, I have a problem with voting "merge" on AfD unless it's a judgement that the topic doesn't deserve an article: otherwise, we should not be mandating it via process. AfD is a bad way to improve the quality of articles. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> On big-boards.com, Bullshido.net is second only to sherdog.net as a top martial arts site, sherdog being the top website for <a href="../../../m/m/a/MMA_0374.html" title="MMA">MMA</a>-related content, whereas Bullshido is a more comprehensive website that not only has forums, but also generates content, particularly through investigations. This website and this article is written in the same format and is akin to the <a href="../../../s/o/m/SomethingAwful_0538.html" title="SomethingAwful">SomethingAwful</a> article on Wikipedia. The claim to notability has been made above concerning the involvement of a Bullshido.net member (Samuel Browning) in investigating David Race Bannon.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the issue of the bullshido.net article being sufficiently different from the bullshido as a concept article, this is also similar to SA's separate articles on the website and its forums<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Awful_Forums" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Awful_Forums" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. The concept of Bullshido was popularized by the website, but enjoys common usage among other communities and practitioners of martial arts. The article is in response to that already popular concept. The claim by Phr that "Bullshido.net is sufficiently mentioned in the Bullshido article" is not true, as I see it. The website appears only twice in that article: A casual reference on where the term came from in "Origin of the Term/Concept", and an external link.

<dd>It's only slightly a matter of how the article is structured. It's mainly a matter of why anyone wants the article there in the first place.

It also points towards vanity if the main authors of the article are associated with the site (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> for a related concept).

Obviously, if Bullshido.net gets its traffic levels anywhere near Slashdot's, the question will become different and can be revisited at that time.

<li><b>Response to MangoJuice</b> Wikipedia has an article on both the website Slashdot and the "Slashdot Effect."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Despite the fact that the general phenomenon of a popular site linking to and overloading another website is called "traffic overload", Wikipedia maintains an article page on the specific phenomenon of Slashdot overloading pages - "Slashdot Effect." I believe that this is similar to what Bullshido and Bullshido.net exemplifies: A notable website, and a concept that may have been popularized by the website, but is notable enough to stand on its own. --<a href="../../../s/c/b/User%7EScb_steve_9822.html" title="User:Scb steve">Scb steve</a> 17:13, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are also multiple articles related to Google and Microsoft. When bullshido.net has as much traffic as those sites, then it, too, will probably have multiple articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> How seriously should this big-boards.com stuff be taken? Should <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> be updated to mention it? Right now, it's not mentioned there; I'm far from convinced that it should be, but am at least slightly open to the idea. Per Rgtraynor above, there are a fair number (about 60k) of Google hits on "bullshido.net", which is probably more significant than the very low number of in-links. Whether that number reaches notability, I don't know. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 08:40, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per ranks at bigboards, and DRV comments. The site also seems pretty lively, so this isn't your neighbour's 10-user forum. And I think the article is pretty good - though it may need some cleanup, but AfD isn't the place for cleanup anyway. (Full disclosure: I'm a member of the forum, though I don't think I have made more than 10-20 posts there, mostly Wikipedia-related, I think...

<li><b>Comment</b> Based on 60k Google hits that appear fairly well distributed for "bullshido.com" or "bullshido.net", but only 18k for "bullshido" <i>without</i> "bullshido.com" or "bullshido.net", changed vote to <b>merge</b>. The total number of hits is reasonable but the term "bullshido" appears closely connected with the web site. I'm ok with Mangojuice's suggestion of merging <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshido.html" title="Bullshido">Bullshido</a> into this article rather than the other way around. 60k ghits doesn't indicate notability all by itself, but it's a respectable number. Similarly, Google search for "martial arts" gets over 65 million hits of which bullshido.net is about #80, again not a slam-dunk for notability, but certainly not too shabby. (It bothers me that two of the top 5 hits for bullshido.net are to Wikipedia). I've been studying the big-boards rankings for various sites and currently am of the opinion that they should not be considered relevant in general for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> purposes, since they're mostly limited to sites running particular types of software. I think Google rank (per above) is somewhat more informative. I'll put some more analysis of big-boards.com here or over at the WP:WEB talk page later. Here are a couple pages critical of bullshido.net: <a href="http://www.fightingarts.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/15826017/an/0/page/1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fightingarts.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/15826017/an/0/page/1" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://www.themartialist.com/bullshidofaq.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themartialist.com/bullshidofaq.htm" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. While not flattering to the site, the existence of such reactions is evidence of notability. I'd like to ask that one or both of those links be inserted into the article in the NPOV spirit, but I'm probably not the best person to add them under the circumstances. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 19:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> - the article these support is already too long to provide more quotes and source material within the article proper. Because there is so much debate on this particular topic, it is helpful to have as many available sources as possible readily available for readers to see and to make their own judgements. It helps with wiki civility - and it serves the purpose of Wikipedia to educate. Perhaps it could be cleaned up, but it <i>is</i> helpful and should have been merged with the recently deleted Official Statements of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In both cases, the information needs to be kept, but perhaps in another format. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 19:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</strike> Can see the point about text per RGTraynor below.

<li><b>Keep</b> it needs a clean up and editing not deletion. A discussion of its relevance may aid editors in their views. As best I understand it, the LDS had an affirmative policy of debarring non-whites from the ministry (which is otherwise incumbent on LDS males aged 18 or so). The teachings that led to this discrimination are what this article discusses. As the basis of racism, these teachings deserve to be analyzed and discussed; however, the material itself needs to be available to the searcher to understand the phenomenon. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 23:11, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete or Redirect</b>. Simply because there are a large number of MUN conferences on Wikipedia, it does not mean that MUNCH should not be allowed to represent itself. It is the spirit of Wikipedia, and also the United Nations, to be inclusive and representative. By deleting this page on the basis that there are other similar pages is not fair, nor in the spirit of wikipedia!</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, the content in no way shape or form advertises the event. The content simply informs any reader of the inner workings of the conference and what occurs. It is honest and accurate. It does not encourage attendance and provides the official web site address, as other organisations and pages do. If this is advertising then the entirety of Wikipedia is advertising things! As for notability, Collins dictionary defines notability as 'the quality of being notable'. If MUNCH is notable to the several hundred annual attendees, the hundred plus people involved in organising and running the event, the thousands of pervious attendees, and the countless others who are in some respect aware of the event, then this event is notable and, as such, has notability. Indeed, it is very notable and should certainly be maintained on these grounds. As for the fact that is summarises MUN; this is correct. However, attendees of MUNCH may not be fully aware of how MUN works and the limited, brief and accurate description of the working of MUN is suitable and acceptable to satisfy this need for information. Further, this page should be maintained as it is useful to many hundreds, if not thousands of people who in some respect are or have been involved in MUNCH and who would look for references about it. Further more, the article is informative and interesting and, as a main organiser of MUNCH and the author of the most recent editing of the page, I can certify that the information is accurate, honest and useful! I would politely suggest that you spend your time on more beneficial activities than trying to delete an article that is inoffensive, accurate and useful! Thank You. --81.155.139.196 22:44, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Leave Alone</b>. One of the previuos entries to this discussion mentioned that the MUNCH page was advertising and there was no sign of notability, well in under two minutes after reading this page I found a page for <a href="../../../s/a/s/SAS_Shoemakers_4b6a.html" title="SAS Shoemakers">SAS Shoemakers</a>. This page not only advertises the company but gives no reason why the company is notable and advertises the opportunity to take a tour of the companies factory. In my oppinion the MUNCH page acts to inform people about the event and in no way serves to advertise it because in no way does it mention how to participate in the event or encouage people to participate.</li>

<p>Kax Lamer's biography page really helped me on a paper I had been working on dealing with the origins of hip-hop and experimental music in the late 1980s. I appreciate that wikipedia has sources on rare and underappreciated artists such as Lamer that are disregarded on other sites. The internet seems to write some people out of history and I'm just glad that this page respects an important part of history.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.30.101.16 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.30.101.16_283c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.30.101.16">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> it needs a clean up and editing not deletion. A discussion of its relevance may aid editors in their views. As best I understand it, the LDS had an affirmative policy of debarring non-whites from the ministry (which is otherwise incumbent on LDS males aged 18 or so). The teachings that led to this discrimination are what this article discusses. As the basis of racism, these teachings deserve to be analyzed and discussed; however, the material itself needs to be available to the searcher to understand the phenomenon. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 23:11, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Temple of the Vampire is not a complete unknown. They seem to be one of the more stable vampire groups. (Just for the record, I do not consider myself a vampire.) I found a description of a book on Amazon that mentions the Temple as one of its topics. That might be a verifiable source, but I am not buying it just for the sake of writing up this article. This subject might be better placed as a section in a larger article on vampire groups or goth religions or similar.

<p>This article, which does not reflect the historical truths that are regarded as facts by hundreds of hisotrians worldwide, should not be kept as a part of Wikipedia. The article, which now stands as the sole representation of the Armenian thesis for the Armenian Allegations, is not allowed to be changed to reflect both opinions on the issue equally. Many users supporting the Armenian thesis constantly delete the parts written by supporters of the anti-thesis. In other words, the article is only a propaganda material. As the debate on this issue continues, it will probably be impossible to stop both sides of the issue from creating an article that truly reflects the past, but not the views of politicians or terrorist organizations. Therefore this article should be deleted; however, instead of it a page with only "REFERENCES" as books, websites, etc. could stay so that both sides arguments would be presented and substantiated ideas could be in place for researchers on the issue. <a href="../../../k/a/y/User%7EKayaakyuz_2adf.html" title="User:Kayaakyuz">Kayaakyuz</a> 18:25, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Look man, i have a lot of armenian friends in Istanbul, and believe me, if this is something that is kept out of our eyes or anything, i wouldnt be talking like this. But i have seen the Ottoman documents by Talat paşa and many others about it. Its not something the turkish government is imposing me. Believe me i agree with the suffering and pain the Ottomans gave to Armenians and even if i could, i would turn back time without thinking about my life about it. But i think if we did that, i wouldnt be here with you writing these things coz there wouldnt be a republic of Turkey. Dont get me wrong we are with you in each pain that you suffered, but putting it as a genocide would not be true as i saw the last documents about the issue.

<dd>And having friends who are Armenian translates to exactly what? And since when were Ottoman documents to be regarded as solid proof? The Ottoman Empire's archives were up until the early 1990s closed and allowed to be seen by a select few. If anything, the articles pertaining to the Genocide were purged from the archives. If all the other countries' archives attest to the fact that there was an ongoing act of extermination in 1915 and only the Ottoman government's archives said otherwise, wouldn't you regard this discrepancy with just a little suspicion?--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 22:28, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This man fled from Turkey before the war ended and resided in Germany while the Ottoman Army trials were condemning him and other leaders to death because of their crimes. Unlike Adolf Hitler, who was so frank and shameless on his treatment of the Jews and other races, Talaat was simply attempting to exonerate himself from any wrongdoing just as Saddam Hussein is attempting doing do so, going so far as to justify their actions. Don't kid yourself, his correspondence contribute little into the Turkish argument and only help solidify the genocide argument. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 22:45, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b> without prejedice to recreation. This article is not translated - and there appears to have been an OTRS complaint #2006042610007088 by the subject - concerning the content.

<li><b>Comment/answer</b>: Mr Voconi wrote to info-it@wikimedia.org asking for the article about himself to be deleted. The ticket number reported refers to where his request is archived in the OTRS desk (where all the mail sent to @wikimedia.org is delivered). As far as I can read, the article is actually a biography, therefore (if kept) it should be moved under a more proper title. I opened this AfD beacuse I'm not aware in details of the policies of en.wiki about such a request. On it.wiki we used to delete few biographies after requests such (decision related to our laws about privacy protection). Hope this helps in making a decision.

I would <b>oppose</b> deletion of the category. I just started this category this afternoon, and had been working to add funeral homes to Wikipedia, and to this category.

<p>Contested prod. Prod was taken off with no comment or further edits to the article. This looks like a vanity article on a non-notable college basketball player to me. While I agree that articles on some college basketball players may be appropriate, I don't believe this person is notable enough. No real claims to notability that would distinguish himself among other college basketball players. Are we to have articles on every college basketball player? I think not. It can be remade if he ever makes it to the NBA. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi there. I am writing in rebuttal to the possible removal of my article specifically for notability reasons. Ronald Ramon is cureently a spohomore at the University of Pittsurgh and obviously has already made a name for himself. I already presented evidence that he has received several awards within the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_Conference_f830.html" title="Big East Conference">Big East Conference</a> which should justify his placement as a notable individual. He has already found success on an elite basketball squad and has already been to the NCAA Tournament on two occasions. A major point I feel we must look at is the fact that team leader <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Krauser_c536.html" title="Carl Krauser">Carl Krauser</a> has graduated and Ronal Ramon will step into his place. Ramon has been able to play at an elite level despite getting little or not as many minutes as he should under Carl Krauser and obviously battling with the fact that he has had his two young and least productive college years. Ramon has been a very influential player on the Pitt squad and in the Big East and for this he deserves to stay. College basketball analysists such as <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Vitale_6152.html" title="Dick Vitale">Dick Vitale</a> have broadcasted for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> and have been impressed with his long ball and general athletic and basketball ability. I see Ramon as having enough importance to be on Wikipedia and his importance will only improve. If we were to remove the Ronal Ramon article we should remove any and all college basketballa rticles for the simple fact that they are worth no monetary value for their basketball at this point. To say that, well players like J.J. Redick have better records would be illogical ecause at that point we would have to set some reasonable standard for what record a player would have to set for admittance into this encyclopedia. For eample do they have to be a stat leader for 1 year against their peers, several years, all time? Obviously to have to set a standard for what an award is worth and more importantly what award is needed for entry is completely and totally absurd. I feel Ronald Ramon's performance which has been renowned by his peers and experts proves that his name deserves to be included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeps2009_cb7b.html" title="User:Jeeps2009">Jeeps2009</a> 20:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The extent of his notability is earning "All Big East Rookie Team Honors", and it doesn't even specify if it was first team or not. If we used this for criteria for inclusion we would be adding hundreds of basketball players throughout history that were all-conference freshmen who's careers never progressed past that. My personal standards for not nominating a college athlete's article for deletion is at MINIMUM earning first team NCAA All-American honors. I wouldn't create an article on one unless they won an NCAA award for being the best in their position, or did something equally notable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 21:31, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The point I was making through his Big East hiors as well as interteam honors it the fact that the young Ronald Ramon is regarded as a great young player. When one tries to place a standard on the requirments for a college basketball player, I feel the general rule of thumb should be does that person deserve to have an article. At this point I have already written the entire article so there is no other real "labor" if you could call writing that left. The aticle could use some cleanup using the AWS or whatever. Back to the argument about placing a standard, there are many great players who do not win the player of the year or an NCAA award. Also, why do we have pages for "newer" coaches who have not yet won an NCAA award. What makes Pitt's coach <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Dixon_6134.html" title="Jamie Dixon">Jamie Dixon</a> notable. It is that he belongs to one of the most elite college basketball programs in the country. So what has Ramon accomplished:</li>

<li>National reconition in respected basketball talk programing</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> – I'm sorry, as big an NBA fan I am, I fail to see why this type of information warrants its own article. What happens if, say, Paul Pierce is traded? Then what? Considering not many players last "six or seven years with one team", it can never be that large of a list, therefore, I'm sure this information can be incorporated into the individuals' own articles. --Downwards 03:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This article is in the works - give it a chance. Right now, it is not close to completion. I hope people can incorporate a list of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team. And yes, this list will change, but I and others will be here to update it when it does so I dont see how that is a problem.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, "<i>Considering not many players last "six or seven years with one team", it can never be that large of a list</i>" is exactly a very good reason for keeping. We vote delete for possibly-<i>infinitely big</i> lists. If what you say is correct, it'd be significant enough if one player manages to stay in his team for his entire career. Note that if kept, this should be moved to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_former_NBA_players_who_have_spent_their_entire_career_with_one_team_50a6.html" title="List of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team">List of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> | <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">talk</a> 20:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator. Too speculative and a wee bit of crystal ball gazing. Besides, if you're an "active" player, it's not your entire career - it's your entire career <i>to date</i>. Such contradictory criteria will naturally result in a list of all rookies, a lot of sophomores, and a few players who buck the current long-term trend. A list of former NBA players who have been with one team sounds like a good idea, but it may well end up including everyone who played back in the day when this was a common thing. The same thing would apply to NHL players. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 21:41, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Rookies, Sophomores, etc. would not apply here. This is a list of players who have played at least eight years with only one team. It is a solid list that will probably always hover around 5 to 15 players.

It is easily maintainable and there is hardly a "severe" limitation of those interested in the list. Also, im not sure why this harmless, innocent, uncontroversial, and factual list is causing so much grief? If people feel that it is unverifiable, I can easily explain the rather simple process of producing this accurate list. Also, since this is a quality list, why do those in favor of a delete wish to LIMIT Wikipedia by not including this article? - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick81aku_221b.html" title="User:Nick81aku">User:Nick81aku</a></li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Since you put it like that I have to agree. However, it is not original research - the figures have come from somewhere, although no source is cited, and were simply pulled together (which is a permissable necessity). Most historical articles are oversimplified, impossible to verify or could be seen to be subjective if you hold a contrary opinion like Slowmover here. But... on its own this is not encyclopaedic. I may look at the idea again in the future if I can find a reputable source and an article that would benefit from graphs like this. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 09:19, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear anonymous IP. We're working on an encyclopedia. Please help us improve this arcticle by providing <i>relevant</i> and <i>verifiable</i> sources. It's great that Greek online-media wrote about Dimitris P. Kraniotis. These links might be useful for readers of <b>gr</b>.wikipedia.org. But I'd appreciate more substantial evidence that the article <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitris_P._Kraniotis_0b8b.html" title="Dimitris P. Kraniotis">Dimitris P.

<li>And just for the fun of it, I <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babelfish.html" title="Babelfish">babelfished</a> the 4 references above. The only content: DPK is nominated for "Muses Prize". Interesting. But what is this Muses Prize? Here we go: <a href="http://www.musesreview.org/dimitriskraniotispoetrywinter2006.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.musesreview.org/dimitriskraniotispoetrywinter2006.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> <a href="http://www.musesreview.org/musesprize2nd_nominees.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.musesreview.org/musesprize2nd_nominees.html" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. Is this prize significant enough to justify an article in Wikipedia? In encyclopedical language it boils down to:<br />
"<i>In 2005 DPK entered four poems into the</i> Muses Prize - Best Poem of Year 2005 <i>contest, organized by <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">amateur</a> writers' online-magazine</i> Muses Review<i>. The poem</i> Fictitious Line <i>(2005) was shortlisted with 12 other nominees.</i>"<br />
OK, this might be interesting for some readers. But really important information is missing on the web page, like how many writers took part? 13?

Especially one of them was published by the country's main poetry publishing house ("Ikaros"); it's the same house that has published all the major Greek poets, including the two Greek Nobel Literature laureates, G. Seferis and O. Elytis. His last two books have been published by a smaller house which is sort of a fringe culture specialist but well known and still respectable."

Dimitris Varos produces only poor results: wikipedia entries, webrings, homepage, all the typical self-promotional stuff -- and a deleted WikiQuote entry <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Votes_for_deletion_archive/Dimitris_Varos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Votes_for_deletion_archive/Dimitris_Varos" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. Thanks for pointing him out, I'll file an AfD.&#160;:-) By the way, we're writing an encyclopedia (you might want to read the Help section to learn more about Wikipedia). If the <i>Hellenic Literary Society</i> appreciates Kraniotis, you should be able to point us to a website with an article that explains the appreciation.

<li>Dear anonymous IP (or may I call you Dimitris?), please sign your comments (it's done with four tildes), preferably with a username. It is so much friendlier... — I find the article <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitris_Lyacos_25ed.html" title="Dimitris Lyacos">Dimitris Lyacos</a> well written and I like the photo. Perfect for a personal homepage, but not for an encyclopedia. It lacks external references. However, I was able to quickly google the German edition of his poems (and added the reference), so at least the bibliographical data seems to be correct. What I miss most in this article are some links to third party reviews of him and his poetry. — The link to EEL is new, thank you! However, it looks to me just like any other bulletin board. As someone who doesn't understand Greek I was only able to find out that it was founded in 1936. And it doesn't solve my problem: I need external references <i>about</i> you and your work. (I assume you're DPK hiding behind the IP and ignoring what <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> says about <i>notable Wikipedians</i>). It's great that you are a full member of EEL, but unless I know the requirements for membership this doesn't say a thing about your relevance as a poet. I'm a full member of an automobile association but don't even own a car.&#160;:-) — I noticed an interesting detail. You say you're editor of <i>Hippocrates</i>. Then you mention a prize you were awarded by <i>Hippocrates</i>. Strange coincidence... — Regarding all the other prices, I'm very well aware of the list in musesreview. Here's the problem verifiabiliy. For example: what is <i>Hippocrates</i>? Is it just a monthly brochure published by some doctors (you and maybe a friend of yours) in some small Larissian hospital? Is it an international journal on pathology? I don't know and I have no way of finding out. (I tried, but failed, because Hippocrates is a rather popular name for medical magazines). — The award list sounds to me like: Anna gave me a <i>gold medal</i>, Bob a <i>first price</i>, and Charlie a <i>special award</i>. Those names by itself mean nothing. — But if you tell me that Anna has written a bestseller on the New York Times list, Bob has won a Nobel Prize for literature and Charlie runs the weekly literature review show on Greeces biggest TV channel and you published the book with London's most prestigious publishing company, I'd take it seriously. So far I was only able to verify Muses Review (very disapointing). I tried <i>Académie Internationale de Lutèce</i> but found only a postal adress. — You are a doctor (at least you claim to be one), so you should be familiar with scientific standards. They apply also to Wikipedia. This includes citations aka references. Prove your claims. --<a href="../../../-/z/z/User%7E-zzz.html" title="User:-zzz">-zzz</a> 00:18, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Dimitris, just in case you haven't noticed, I <i>do</i> check references.&#160;;-) All I found on EEL is the user <i>dkran</i> <a href="http://www.eel.org.gr/modules.php?name=Your_Account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;uname=dkran" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eel.org.gr/modules.php?name=Your_Account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;uname=dkran" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, who claims to have published three books, be a doctor and a member of various organizations. I found a poem posted by dkran and some unfriendly responses to it (but this might be a misunderstanding because babelfish translates Greek poorly). Does EEL's bulletin board improve my opinion on DPK's qualities as poet? No. Is this the reason why you are so afraid of references? Because they don't stand up to your claims? (I think of the vandalisms of <a href="../../../../de/d/i/m/Dimitris_P._Kraniotis_0b8b.html" class="extiw" title="de:Dimitris_P._Kraniotis">de:Dimitris P. Kraniotis</a> where you, or another 195.97.50.* IP, tries again and again to remove references.) --<a href="../../../-/z/z/User%7E-zzz.html" title="User:-zzz">-zzz</a> 01:10, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I changed my mind.&#160;:-) I think the best way to deal with Dimitris P. Kraniotis is to do what a encyclopedia does best: <i>compile available knowledge</i>. I replaced the article with a version that tells the reader <i>exactly</i> what is verifiable knowledge about him. So if he is notorious enough that "serious" newspapers write about him, it might as well justify an article about him in Wikipedia. Not for his (still unproven) merits as <i>great new poet</i>, but as a future reference for journalists and literary critics who don't have the resources to double-check Mr. Kraniotis public relation claims themselves. The english-language version of this article has the benefit of being most accessible to international readers (unlike the 20 or so other languages where DPK posted his vanity spam). So let's keep this article, but apply Wikipedia quality standards. --<a href="../../../-/z/z/User%7E-zzz.html" title="User:-zzz">-zzz</a> 11:05, 1 May 2006 (UTC) -- In the meantime I received and verified various references. Kraniotis has received only few external reviews for his poetry (just some minor awards) and definitely has an ego-problem. But his publications are for real (National Library of Greece is confirmation enough for me). And there's enough material accessible in English. In my opinion he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but just so. The one-line article spam in 19 other Wikipedias is a different story, but I think <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimitris_P._Kraniotis_0b8b.html" title="Dimitris P. Kraniotis">en:Dimitris P. Kraniotis</a> has improved enough to stay. --<a href="../../../-/z/z/User%7E-zzz.html" title="User:-zzz">-zzz</a> 14:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - seems like an issue that is only speculation and not notable at this point in time. Unless this turns into a big media issue at some later time, this article would most likely consist of original research and hypothetical questions.
