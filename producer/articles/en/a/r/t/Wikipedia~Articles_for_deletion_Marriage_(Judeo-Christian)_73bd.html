<p>From <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>: "A <b>POV fork</b> is a content fork deliberately created to avoid <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> guidelines.... POV forks usually arise when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus. This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. This is generally considered unacceptable. The generally accepted policy is that all facts and major Points of View on a certain subject should be treated in one article. As Wikipedia does <i>not</i> view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, such forks may be nominated for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">deletion</a>."</p>
<p>And, in fact, this article was created at the same time as Marriage (post modern), about 15 hours ago, out of a content dispute at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a>, and the content needs no separate coverage besides that main article. The article author has said: "To re-iterate, the article <i>is</i> NPOV within it's own context.... I will edit the article to protect it's credibility, and will remove any edits that are attempts to push a POV and violate the NPOV of the subject matter."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWJBscribe&amp;diff=105477056&amp;oldid=105473788" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWJBscribe&amp;diff=105477056&amp;oldid=105473788" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Apparently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is going to be <i>different</i> inside of this article, and the article author will enforce this.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike the situation in the Marriage (post modern) AfD, "traditional marriage" as a phrase and a concept has a lot of notability, particular in legal writings in conservative jurisdictions and legal authorities. See, for example <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/michiganstatecases/appeals/0207/20070201_c265870_104_265870.opn.pdf" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/michiganstatecases/appeals/0207/20070201_c265870_104_265870.opn.pdf" rel="nofollow">National Pride at Work v. Governor of Michigan, Mich. App. February 1, 2007</a>] ("We begin by noting the relatively significant public attention this case has received...The people, in an act of self-government, could rationally conclude that the welfare and morals of society benefit from protecting and strengthening traditional marriages, and this act of the people constitutes a legitimate governmental interest.") It is less clear, however that this traditional marriage concept deserves a separate article rather than being included in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article along with other perspectives. Furthermore, since the views of traditional Judaism and Christianity are not the only views involved in the concept of marriage, traditional or otherwise, it is unclear that the traditional concept, if presented in a separate article, should focus exclusively on the perspective of these religions particularly given that each religion already has its own article on marriage. Nonetheless, it's reasonable to argue that "traditional marriage" represents a distinct subject rather than a POV fork in "marriage", and Wikipedia could present things if the articles (and other articles with different approaches) were appropriately named and sourced, and if the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article linked to each appropriately. While I agree the article shouldn't stand alone, I believe the issue here is more one of pragmatism and avoiding reader confusion than strict policy. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 20:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the problem here is that across the world different cultures have different views on what constitutes <i>traditional marriage</i>. Writing an article to encompass all traditions would be problematic. A series of articles on <i>Traditional marriage in culture X</i> might be possible, but I'm not they will add much to the <i>Religious views of marriage</i> articles. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 20:46, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(Edit conflict) There's no need for a separate <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> article unless and until the coverage in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> article becomes so large it needs a subarticle, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. As <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> noted in the previous AFD, such an article "<i>would involve same-race only, 10 year old brides, spouses meeting each other only on their wedding days, no divorce, kidnapping, spousal parents paying off the other, etc.</i>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FTraditional_Marriage&amp;diff=98033856&amp;oldid=97917026" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FTraditional_Marriage&amp;diff=98033856&amp;oldid=97917026" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> We have barely begun to approach such coverage, so a subarticle is far too premature. If such coverage does eventually need separate articles, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> is still the wrong title, as it's a neologistic POV-loaded term. There's no reason to give a neologistic term like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> undue weight by pretending it addresses a clearly defined concept throughout history. A (set of) timeline(s) of marriage practices in different regions would probably be much more encyclopedic, and an appropriate title for one of these might be marriage practices in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I agree with Shirahadasha about the "Richard Dawkins Foundation" example, and accordingly I'm changing the redirects back to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> for now. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 21:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> - poor POV-ish article at this point but both Jewish and Christian marriage and its ceremonies are rich in unique symbolisms and philosophies. Arguments for this article's coverage in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> are very problematic. Traditional according to which culture and tradition? Early Jewish and Christian marriage traditions were radically anti-traditional. And the traditional marriage article is about a modern political movement whereas Marriage (Judeo-Christian) should be about ancient histories and philosophies thereof.</s> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a>
