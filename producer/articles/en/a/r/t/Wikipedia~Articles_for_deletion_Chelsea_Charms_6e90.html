<p>Hay everyone! Im new here and new to this deletion stuff. I think this page should be deleted because it is just nasty! I mean, what kind of woman does that to herself? She is SO ugly. Also she is very non-notable, she is just here so sicko-nerds who dont like to surf out of wiki can come here and masturbate I think. Also we shouldnt promote this kinda harm, she probably has back problems, what if some woman comes here and thinks "id like to be like that" and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia? Also, what if kids come here, they will be shocked and traumatized by those sick breasts. I also heard that a lot of libraries and stuff block Wikipedia (which is a great tool!) from there computers because it has porn on it like this "lady". Delete her! She is no good!

<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree with the comment of Lectonar and Tregoweth. Wikipedia is not censored for anyone's protection and if you don't want to see it, simply don't click it and stay away from sex-related article. No reason in deletion policy to delete this. A doubt much other women have breasts that size, so only that would make her notable enough. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:28, August 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the "random article" feature, which is very prominent on the main page? If people need to avoid it, perhaps it should be taken down. Just because Wikipedia was started by groovy permissives it doesn't have to stay that way. Providing free publicity for porn merchants isn't one of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia, so it is negotiable. I doubt it is a core principal of Britannica or Encarta either. <a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhoeble_b9b2.html" title="User:Bhoeble">Bhoeble</a> 14:59, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The issue of deletion of a page is notability and she is notable. The picture is an appropriate version of her as a person, not in any sex act. Many of us do believe that Wiki needs standards, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Wikipedians_for_Decency_ad34.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedians for Decency">Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedians for Decency</a>, but there is nothing here to cause the deletion of anything on this page. One more important point: nothing in this article or picture was done specifically to get on Wiki--she did it on her own to promote herself and her career. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 13:17, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Inclination to keep on principle (the deletion arguments from "nastiness" or "self-mutilation" should be strongly opposed), but I really wonder about the subject's actual notability. Realistically, will we try to cover every adult entertainer? Everyone with a breast size over N inches/mm? Does breast size (or, conversely, penis size for a male performer) confer notability? (That's a serious question, not rhetoric.) <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:45, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In fact there does seem to be a major push on to accomplish just that - there are literally dozens if not hundreds of porn stars listed on wikipedia already. As for As for size and notability, I say the answer is certainly yes. There *are* porn stars who are famous mostly because of the size of their attributes.-<a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPirate2000_9343.html" title="User:Pirate2000">Pirate2000</a>
<ul>
<li>Dozens or hundreds is not unreasonable, considering that there are undoubtedly tens of thousands of adult performers. Separating out the actual "porn stars" from the universe of "porn actors/actresses" is worth doing to some extent. In past decades most people -- well, most people who pay attention to such things -- could name the dozen or so top porn stars. I don't know if that's still the case. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 07:22, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. <i>Just because you do not like someone, it doesn't mean that you can just delete her from an encyclopedia!!</i> Just because you don't promote something doesn't mean it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. One of the rules on Wikipedia is to submit neutral, non-biased entries, and as far as I can tell, this entry meets those guidelines. Just because there is an entry here on something, doesn't mean that that is a promotion for it. There are entries on Hitler and Stalin here too! Should we just get rid of those?!?! <i>"what if some woman comes here and thinks 'id like to be like that' and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia?"</i> I honestly don't think that seeing an enry about someone or something on Wikipedia will influence someone to do something a drastic as that unless they are already considering it, and besides, if seeing an image of something like that on the internet will influence someone to do that, than they will be influenced to do a lot of things during any single simple search or click on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> or any part of the web. <i>I also heard that a lot of libraries and stuff block Wikipedia (which is a great tool!) from there computers because it has porn on it like this "lady"</i>. The picture accompanying the entry hardly pornographic. Unless you consider <i>un</i>exposed breasts pornographic, and that would make your views seem slightly paradoxical. Honestly, you come across as a naive, selfish, zealot who thinks that just because they have any sort of power or influence, that they can just take advantage of it for superfluous, selfish and spontanious things. It took a lot of effort not to simply type "<b>YOU'RE STUPID</b>" in all caps and continue a short response with an excessive amount of exclamation points and personal attacks, which I only could resist because i am better than that, which you evidently aren't, judjing by your entry. "<i>She is SO ugly.</i>" Please, also, a reccomendation, if I were you, I would keep the amount of spelling and gramatical errors in my entry to a minimum, so that no one will draw conclusions about your level of intelligence. Which I know I did. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe9file_cfc8.html" title="User:The9file">the9file</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The reason for nomination does not appear to be based on Wikipedia content/deletion policy, and moreover, it has been <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_Decency_2bc1.html#User:DavidsCrusader" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/WikiProject Wikipedians for Decency">suggested</a> that these edits have been made merely to make a sock puppet account appear to have some legitimacy. --<a href="../../../i/b/y/User%7EIByte_f0c6.html" title="User:IByte">IByte</a> 23:58, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
