The Spanish Wikipedia doesn't have an article for him, and I'm not about to write one (I don't understand Spanish), neither is there anything about him on Wikimedia Commons. "Oscar Braun + Mexico" gets about 260 Google hits, which I think is not quite enough.

<p>James Truitt was a journalist, born in Chicago, IL and raised in Baltimore, MD. He served as a Naval officer in the Pacific theatre of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, then returned to work for the US State Department. He married his first wife, Anne, in September 1947 in Washington, DC. In spring of 1948 he went to work for <i>Life Magazine</i> in New York, then became <i>Life'</i>s Washington correspondent. He spent 3 years with <i>Life</i> in San Francisco, then he returned to Washington, DC in May 1960 to become the personal assistant to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_Graham_4d6c.html" title="Phillip Graham">Phillip Graham</a> at the <i>Washington Post,</i> where he rose to become vice president. He also worked for <i>Time</i>, served as publisher of <i>Art News,</i> and became vice president of <i>Newsweek</i> in 1964.</p>
<p>In 1962 <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pinchot_Meyer_e4fd.html" title="Mary Pinchot Meyer">Mary Pinchot Meyer</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cord_Meyer_ec31.html" title="Cord Meyer">Cord Meyer</a>'s ex-wife) told Truitt that she was having an affair with President Kennedy. Truitt made notes of the conversation, which years later he showed to journalist Jay Gourley. The notes recorded an episode in July 1962 when Mary Pinchot and President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> smoked marijuana.</p>
<p>In early 1963, Truitt helped extricate <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_Graham_4d6c.html" title="Phillip Graham">Phillip Graham</a> from a drunken appearance at a publishers' conference in Arizona. {Deborah Davis, 3rd ed. 1991, p. 154} Graham committed suicide on August 3, 1963. Katharine Graham assumed ownership of the <i>Washington Post.</i></p>
<p>Later in 1963 the Truitt left the <i>Post</i> and moved to Tokyo as the Japan bureau chief for <i>Newsweek</i>. There, Ann Truitt got news that her Vassar classmate and friend, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pinchot_Meyer_e4fd.html" title="Mary Pinchot Meyer">Mary Pinchot Meyer</a>, had been murdered. Ann called <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Angleton_8885.html" title="James Angleton">James Angleton</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Bradlee_dc19.html" title="Ben Bradlee">Ben Bradlee</a> to see that Mary's diary was taken care of, per her wishes.</p>
<p>In a few years, the Truitt's returned to Washington and to the <i>Post</i>.</p>
<p>James Truitt's mental health declined, and in 1969 he was declared insane. Bill Bradlee fired him. The settlement included $35,000 for him in exchange for a signed statement that he would not write anything that was "in any way derogatory" of the <i>Washington Post</i>. He divorced and moved to Mexico, where he was re-married to Evelyn Patterson (Truitt).</p>
<p>In March, 1976, Truitt granted an interview to the <i>National Enquirer.</i> He revealed that Mary Pinchot Meyer had an affair with President Kennedy. Mary told him that she was keeping an account of this relationship in her diary. Truitt correctly noted that the diary had been removed by Ben Bradlee and James Angleton after her murder. Initially, Bradlee and Angleton denied the story, but it was soon confirmed by Mary's friends, who spoke to reporters at <i>Time Magazine</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i>, and by others.</p>
<p>James Truitt committed suicide on November 18, 1981, at San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Evelyn later claimed that her husband's papers, including copies of Mary's diary, were stolen by a CIA agent named Herbert Burrows.</p>
<p>His first wife, Anne Truitt, wrote the book <i>Daybook: The Journal of an Artist</i> (1984).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-10_8ec4.html" title="Edit section: Rabbi Gedalia Schorr">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rabbi Gedalia Schorr</span></h2>
<p>Rabbi Gedalia Schorr (1910-1979) was a great Talmudic scholar, original and innovative thinker, and a beloved teacher to thousands of students of Torah Vodaath. Many who have never met him learn Or Gedalyahu, a posthumous work which contains only a sample of the lectures he delivered on issues of Jewish thought for over forty years. Attempts have been made to collect his lectures on Talmud. But this has been met without much success. Some of this is because his thought was so profound that few students were able to fully understand him. Moreover, Rabbi Schorr rarely recorded his own thoughts because he was apparently gifted with total recall. Rabbi Nosson Scherman, a scholar in his own right, and a student of Rabbi Schorr, relates that Rabbi Schorr remarked in a casual conversation to a nephew that he had not seen a certain sefer since he had learned it through at the age of nineteen, shortly before his passing at the age of sixty-nine.</p>
<p>Rabbi Nosson Scherman, a student of Rabbi Schorr's, writes: What was so unique about him? One major figure in the Torah world, a person who has been at the center of decision making for decades, put it this way: "He was a gaon in both Nigleh (revealed Torah) and in Nistar (the hidden Torah). What is more, he had a wealth of stories about, and insights into, the great Torah leaders of past generations. He scrutinized a situation through the eyes of Torah and its perspective of history. To say that he was a genius is to tell only part of the story. He was a Torah genius who combined everything that was needed to make life and death decisions."</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr was well regarded for his brilliance at a young age. Rabbi Meir Shapiro, the famed Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin, remarked that Rabbi Schorr had the most brilliant mind he encountered in America, and one of the most brilliant in the entire world. This was when Rabbi Schorr was only nineteen years old. Later, Rabbi Ahron Kotler, the Rosh Yeshiva who Rabbi Schorr venerated as his teacher, remarked that Rabbi Schorr was the "first American gadol." Rabbi Schorr's son notes that his father completed Shas twice before he was married.</p>
<p>He is the only contemporary quoted by Rabbi Shlomo Heiman. Rabbi Schorr was asked to take over Rabbi Heiman's shiur when he was only twenty seven.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr was able to lecture on several tractates simultaneously. He was also very keen on teaching tractates and subjects that were not commonly studied in Yeshiva. An important aspect of his worldview was that one must constantly strive for excellence and higher levels of understanding in his learning and understanding of Talmud, machshava, his relationship with God, and personal refinement.</p>
<p>Typically he would say:</p>
<p>G-d says, I have separated you from the nations to be Mine (Vayikra 20:26), to which Rashi comments that if Jews are separate from the nations, they are G-d's people; but if they do not hold themselves unique, they will be prey to Nevuchadnezzar and his ilk. Our essential goal cannot be only to avoid the massacres of Nevuchadnezzar. Rather, it is to fulfill the mission for which we were chosen. The question is not whether the world requires doctors, lawyers, accountants, bricklayers, and mechanics. It does. But we were designated to be G-d's nation - the nation of the Torah. And each individual yeshivah student must recognize that it is his privilege as well as his responsibility to live up to his role as one of those whom G-d wishes to be His.</p>
<p>Such was his emphasis. Students should elevate their own sights, not denigrate others. The goal of the yeshivah was to instill a dedication to Torah study because it made its adherents closer to G-d, not because it is impossible to be a Torah Jew in the professions or business. He was pained by the polarization that began to cause a cleavage between those who chose to be exclusively in G-d's service, and those who sought to keep a foot in the outside world even while maintaining their primary allegiance to the beis midrash. The result of his efforts was imbuing some with heightened aspirations based on a perception of the greatness of Torah, while causing others not to feel alienated despite their choices of careers in other areas.</p>
<p>In the same elevating manner, he urged talmidim to study with all their strength and concentration as well as with all available time: "Learning half the time with full concentration is better than learning all the time with half concentration, because the latter is not truly learning." And: "How can a bachur yawn? Torah study demands interest and enthusiasm; then, there can be no yawning boredom." He would cite the Talmudic passage interpreting the Scriptural verse that describes Benayahu ben Yehoyada as having killed a lion on a snowy day. The Talmud comments homiletically that Benayahu studied all of Toras Kohanim in a short, wintry day. Rabbi Schorr noted the comparison between a man in battle and a scholar taking on a difficult study. "Just as a man fighting a lion, especially in the cold, slippery winter, must give the fray his total concentration, so must a Torah scholar dedicate himself totally in order to emerge victorious in his struggle to master Torah."</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr did not rely on his genius, alone. He studied Talmud and all areas of Jewish scholarship very deeply and intensively for many years. He was one of the best rounded Gedolim among his peers.</p>
<p>Some of the stories Rabbi Scherman uses to illustrate Rabbi Schorr's character include:</p>
<p>As teacher, Rabbi Schorr went with impoverished students to purchase Pesach outfits for them. He often expressed surprised disappointment at the idea that a rebbe had no obligation to tend to the personal needs of his students.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years before his passing, he secretly arranged for a successful professional man to "happen to pass by" the store owned by people whose son was a promising high school senior in Torah Vodaath. The boy hoped to remain in the yeshivah, but his parents wanted him to leave for college. Rabbi Schorr felt that a layman could more effectively influence the parents than a Rosh Yeshivah. The visit was successful, but, because he had promised to remain silent, the emissary told no one of his mission until after Rabbi Schorr died. Only then did the former student, now a noted Torah educator, learn of the incident.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr was traveling with a professor who had no yeshivah background but who attended a Daf Yomi session every morning. The professor had not been able to attend his shiur, and was attempting to learn the daf on the train. Rabbi 'Schorr asked, "Would you mind if we learned together? I didn't learn today's daf yet, either." Recalling the trip, the professor says, "He surely didn't need me, but he knew I was struggling, so he gave up his time to teach me a blatt Gemara, and made me feel that I was doing him a favor."</p>
<p>Students often needed help in arranging suitable matches, finding positions, and solving myriad other problems - professional, personal, emotional, and financial. He was always ready to help with advice, a telephone call, and personal intervention. Many of those who eulogized him were former students who are now at the top of their professions. A common thread in their appreciations, and in the private conversations of many hundred others, was that he was like a father. One distinguished rabbi, who lost his own mother shortly after Rabbi Schorr's passing, likened the two in terms of his sense of personal loss.</p>
<p>When the beloved cook of Bais Medrash Elyon, Reb Leib Apfeldorfer, passed away, Rabbi Schorr was one of those who escorted the niftar to Kennedy Airport to be taken to Eretz Yisrael for burial. Rabbi Schorr was shocked to learn that the niftar was to remain on a cargo truck unattended until loaded onto the plane by non-Jews. He asked for permission to stay in the truck but was told that El Al security guards ran flashlights across the truck bed when it reached the plane and were authorized to shoot if they came across anyone without clearance, For a suitable "consideration," however, the driver would park the truck so that people with the coffin would not be seen - provided they lie flat on the floor, So the elderly Rosh Yeshivah climbed into the truck with three students, and set aside his dignity for the more glorious task of paying a final honor to a man who had served the yeshiva with loyalty and dedication.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr would weave so many allusions and commentaries into his speeches, that only the most erudite talmid chochom could have understood all that he was attempting to say. Rabbi Scherman notes: His regular weekly and pre-holiday shmuessen were dazzling. The reaction of any seasoned scholar who heard him for the first time was invariably one of awe that so much could be compressed into so brief a time: "There is enough content in one shmuess to provide someone else with material for five difficult one-hour lectures." Scriptural verses, Midrash, Ramban, Maharal, Sfas Emes, Reb Tzadok - commentator after commentator, with one verbatim quote after another, streamed forth.</p>
<p>So casual was his style and so involved was he with the ideas he was developing, that the uninitiated thought he spoke without preparation. No, the preparation was there - not only a lifetime of intense study, but forethought for the particular talk. But as he spoke, new flashes of brilliance came to mind. He would often smile at a new thought, sometimes share the thoughts with his audience, sometimes not - and always punctuate his remarks with a touch of wry humor.</p>
<p>He was a perfect illustration of one of his major themes. He often cited Mabit, Reb Tzadok, and others who explain that the reason it was forbidden the commit the Oral Law to writing was because paper cannot capture the living process of a teacher transmitting knowledge through the agency of his personality. The essence of a human being cannot be put on paper; the transcription of his words can never adequately capture the soul which is part of the teaching process. For those who lived through a learning experience with Rabbi Schorr, the best illustration of the concept is the mere thought of seeing his words on paper robbed of the sight and sound of his unique delivery, the total sincerity of his demand that b'nei Torah not be satisfied with "getting by," the eloquent expression that the study of Torah is the utmost privilege...To those who had the wisdom to hear him rather than merely sit before him, those memories are an Oral Torah to which no pen can do justice.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr was performed much of the good he did for others in secret. He once said to his family that Hashem is the zocher nishkachos--i.e., one who remembers that which is forgotten (quote usually attributed to Rabbi Elimelekh of Lizhensk, the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i>). In this vein, he would say that one must remember his sins and forget his good deeds.</p>
<p>Rabbi Scherman writes: An examination of his public career reveals one characteristic that was at once a stamp of greatness and its mask. Call it modesty, call it self-effacement, call it disinterest in fame - whatever its name, he displayed a total disregard for the minimal marks of status with apparent indifference to his position on a program or at a dais, the honor accorded him at a wedding or a bris; what did it matter whether or not he received personal credit, as long as G-d was served, the community benefited, and an individual uplifted? It was thus all too easy to think that because he put his friendly arm around a shoulder and was a friend, that he need be treated merely as a friend. Indeed, such was his wish; but it often resulted in many of us not recognizing his greatness, and as a result we may well have deprived ourselves and our communities of the benefits of his greatness.</p>
<p>It was said of the Chofetz Chaim that his piety was so great that it obscured his scholarship. And it was said of Reb Chaim Brisker that his scholarship was so great that it obscured his piety. Of Rabbi Schorr we may justly say that his brilliance was so dazzling that it obscured his dedication to study; and his humility was so profound that it obscured his greatness.</p>
<p>Perhaps he wrote his own epitaph. Many years ago, he made the one and only notation he ever wrote in his copy of Sfas Emes. It was on one of the last pieces of Chukas, the sidrah of his passing. All he wrote were the words <i>haflei vafele</i> - truly amazing with reference to this thought:</p>
<p>Zos HaTorah: Adam ki yamus ba'ohel - the Torah associates dedicated Torah study with purity from the contamination of death. Just as Torah brings purity, so each Jewish soul - which is a microcosmic part of Torah - brings life, and hence purity, to the otherwise lifeless and impure clod which is the body. Every word and letter of the Torah has within it the capacity to give life to the dead - but we do not know how to utilize that capacity.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schorr's life gave added purity to a continent. It provided a precedent and set a standard. If we take for granted America's capacity to produce Torah greatness, if Chassidic youths study Lithuanian lomdus in machshavos haTorah, in good measure it is because the Divine plan placed him in America to bequeath it his capacity for life.</p>

<p><b>Twisted Hair</b> is a Native American term of honour given to a storyteller. He would carry the news from village to village and supply the women with gossip. To be a story teller you must first be acknowledged by the elder storytellers. You could not take on this title for yourself. His main purpose was to keep the history of the peoples and pass it down to later generations. They travelled light, carrying only clothing, a pipe and a bag. When they arrived at a village they were fed and sheltered by the people.</p>
<p>When the storytelling was over, they would feast. He would stay in the village for a couple of weeks before moving on.</p>

<p>Miami Lakes Technical Educational Center (as it was known back then) opened in February of 1976, serving approximately 400 students. Since then, the school has grown and is known locally to be one of the best Adult Education centers in Miami-Dade County.

<p>In 1998, construction began on a secondary high school that would serve students locally and give them the opportunity to study in one of the many career choices that the school offered. When it was opened, it was known as "New High School 2," and after going through a few name changes was identified as Miami Lakes Educational Center.</p>
<p>To attend, one must apply to the high school and pick one of the "academies" and "strands" the high school offers. Some qualifications one must meet to enter the high school are good attendance in your previous school, a GPA of at least 2.0, and good behavior.</p>
<p>MLEC has a membership of approximately 1500 students and is one of the smallest high schools in the Miami Dade Public Schools System. The high school colors are Teal and Black and the mascot is the Jaguar, although the high schools have no official sports teams.</p>
<p>In the 2005-2006 school year, the high school was officially approved to include another academy, which was the Cambridge Academy. This academy offers much more advanced career strands than the rest, and the qualifications for it are higher than for the other academies.</p>

<p>Nukak take the sweet resin from "mupabuat" (<i>Lacunal sp.</i>) and the rattan water (<i>Doliocarpus sp</i>.). They collect vegetal materials like the elements necessary to cover their encampments "wopyi" (witn leaves of <i>Phenakospermum guyanense</i> and palms); to make its hammocks (with fiber of the palm of cumare <i>Astrocaryum sp.</i>), moorings (<i>Heteropsis tenuispadix</i>, <i>Eschweilera sp.</i>, <i>Anthurium sp.</i>), blowguns (<i>Iriartella stigera</i>, <i>Bactris maraja</i>), arcs (<i>Duguetia quitarensis</i>), axe ends (<i>Aspidosperma sp.</i>), darts (thorns of <i>Oneocarpus sp</i>.), founds for the darts (leaves of <i>Calathea sp.</i>), milkweed to assure the darts (<i>Pachira nukakika</i>, <i>Ceiba sp.</i>, <i>Pseudobombax sp.</i>), loinclothes for men (<i>Couratari guianensis</i>), baskets (<i>Heteropsis spp</i>.), disposable bags (<i>Ischnosiphon arouma</i>, <i>Heliconia sp.</i>), soap (<i>Cedrelinga sp.</i>), perfumes (<i>Myroxylon sp.</i>, <i>Justice pectoralis</i>) and diverse objects.</p>
<p>They made blades with the teeth of piranha, but they use the metallic ones. Also small pots practiced until 1990 the pottery in small scale, making to take in their routes and other great ones to leave in key sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When they do not have matches or lighters, they use special woods (<i>Pausandra trianae</i>) to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of <i>Trattinickia glaziovii</i> nor stone axes like the past times.</p>

<p>The Nukak have already suffered the devastation of their population by malaria and flu since their contact with outsiders in 1988; now their lands have been occupied by coca growers, left-wing guerillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the Colombian army. The Indians have therefore become embroiled in Colombia's quasi-civil war.</p>

<p>The Yale Center for Media Initiatives (CMI) develops leading-edge educational media and courseware for Yale faculty, and oversees the deployment of Yale's next-generation online learning environment Classes*v2. Through its central and medical campus studios, the CMI also provides state-of-the-art broadcast, distribution and media production solutions to the Yale community.</p>
<p>The idea for an innovative media center at Yale, first arose from recommendations by the Cooke Committee in 1997-98, which explored how Yale could use information technologies to enhance its curriculum, and develop its own innovation capabilities through incubation. That innovation could then be shared with constituents outside Yale.</p>
<p>The media center concept evolved thanks to the foresight of then Provost Alison F. Richard, who in 1998 called upon Diana EE Kleiner, Deputy Provost for the Arts, to lead the effort to create a facility where "faculty can find the encouragement and support they need to experiment with the use of information technology to enhance teaching and learning both at and from Yale."</p>
<p>In 1999, a new committee was created to oversee the creation of this new center and to devise ways to encourage and guide faculty to experiment with interactive methods of instruction. After careful research and exploration, the mandate for this new media center was formalized, and in the autumn of 2000 the CMI was born.</p>

<p>Sorry About The Ruse is a 3 track 7" vinyl single (later CD single) by Australian punk band Frenzal Rhomb. It featured the track 'F*ck the System' which parodies Duran Duran's 'Just Can't Get Enough'. This track was to be released on the Dick Sandwhich EP in 1994 but was left off the CD due to copyright clearance for the parody not being obtained before the CD's were pressed. The vinyl also contained the tracks 'Can't Trust A Redneck' and version of 'Why Aren't You Dead?' from Frenzal Rhomb's first demo, recorded in 1992.</p>
<p>The vinyl single is arguably Frenzal Rhomb's rarest release, with only about 500 copies existing. Most copies have damaged covers due to the inserts' tendency to stick to the cover. In 1997, the single was re-released on CD and sold through the Frenzal Rhomb website and Shock Records website.</p>

<p>Konica Minolta's ADI(<b>Advanced Distance Integration</b>) flash metering works in combination with the DYNAX 7, D lenses, Program Flash 5600HS(D) and Program Flash 3600HS(D), as well as the built-in flash. When used with these flash units, the camera calculates a guide number to control TTL flash metering. This guide number is calculated according to distance from subject, ambient light and pre-flash reflectivity of the subject and the background. It allows the ADI Flash Metering System to offer optimum flash metering regardless of the background conditions or subject's reflectance characteristics.</p>

<p>The Rules is short for The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right. This was a 1996 best-selling book that was co-authored by <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Fein_bec0.html" title="Ellen Fein">Ellen Fein</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherrie_Schneider_ecc2.html" title="Sherrie Schneider">Sherrie Schneider</a>.</p>
<p>The book's basic theme is that in order for a woman to land the man of her dreams, she should play hard to get. It then lays down what exactly these specifics are--i.e. "the rules" of the book's title. A woman who followed the book's "rules" was called a "Rules Girl." Its underlying philosophy was that women should not aggressively pursue men, but rather, get men to pursue them.</p>
<p>The book generated much discussion when it came out. Some considered the book to be very useful, while others panned it as being outdated, trash, or nothing more than a how-to guide showing women to play games and manipulate men. Others pointed out that the book's authors were not professional counselors or had any other professional background that one would expect an author of a book of this nature to have. In particular, reviewer Maureen Corrigan on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Public_Radio_8b7c.html" title="National Public Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s program <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresh_Air_deea.html" title="Fresh Air">Fresh Air</a> sarcastically asked "And what are the authors' credentials?

<p>Shay Daniel Smith (born June 30, 1987) was born and raised in Waco, Texas. Though he has many passions, his most notable are his love of music, photography, philosophy, and religion. None of this is relevant to the purpose of this article though. Recently, Shay has been caught up in the midst of what he has called "Prama." This is a combination of "Prom" and "drama." For the most part, Shay is avoiding the Prama by not asking anyone his friends may like. The individual he currently wants to go with is Shelby Littlewood. There is nothing else significant to say.

<p>Un-Rock is a genre of music based on an indie music philosophy that started to just emerge in 2006. It is based on irregular chord progressions, minimal FX, heavy distortion, clean guitar, live and driving drums and guitar. It is based on minimalism borrowed from the Miles Davis school of "cool" and uses a lot of layering of sounds. The kick drum is toned to more of a hip-hop sound rather that a flat rock sound.</p>
<p>Un-Rock bands are independent, meaning they usually are not signed on a major label and rely on touring and underground word of mouth. The music promotes equality and is charged with energy, yet it can be played fast or slow. There are no real song formulas to be followed. Most of the formulas used are violated to draw out a certain feelings. It was first founded by Sam Oak, the vocalist/guitarist for a band out of Southern California called the UnFamiliar Occurrence.</p>

<p>CJLO was formed in 1998 in a merger between the two existing radio stations at Concordia, CRSG (Sir George Radio) and CFLI (formerly radio Loyola). In the next few years, the station attempted to attain a broadcast license several times. Because of a constantly changing staff and difficulties in organization, the application to the CRTC was never made. During this time the station continued to broadcast through cable-FM and also in the residence building on 650 AM. As time progressed, the staff was completely shuffled once again and the station was reworked. Broadcasting online since 2003, CJLO has been slowly working towards an AM broadcast license, while at the same time allowing over 70 volunteers to participate as disc-jockeys, production staff, and in promotions. We are currently a music station which reflects the musical interests of all Concordia students (rock/alt, hiphop, RPM, metal, punk, and world) with some talk content as well.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones is a student at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia of the gradauting class of 2008. He is the one of the only people without an actual birthdate. He eats gefilte fish for every meal of the day and for a midnight snack. Surprisingly his younger brother was born black, even though a DNA test proved that his white parents were the biological parents. One time, on a camping trip, his family was forced to eat their dog seeing as they had run out of gefilte fish. This was the first time Daniel had ever eaten anything besides gefilte fish. In his other escapades in life, he enjoys making clam chowda on warm summer days. He also enjoys writing the biography of Thomas Lenihan (aka The Beava Masta).</p>

<p>Note: This article refers to WMIT-FM, a radio station based in Black Mountain, North Carolina. Apparently, the call letters were at one time used by a station licensed to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There should be a disambiguation page for WMIT-FM to distinguish the two separate stations that have both used the call letters WMIT-FM.</p>
<p><b>WMIT-FM</b> is a radio station based in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_9bfd.html" title="Black Mountain">Black Mountain</a>, North Carolina, a small town in the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ridge_Mountains_e511.html" title="Blue Ridge Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> 15 miles east of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asheville.html" title="Asheville">Asheville</a>. It identifies itself as "106.9, The Light", and uses a multiple city identifier of Black Mountain-Asheville-Charlotte to disclose its location. It has a very powerful signal that reaches about a third of North Carolina, as well as portions of bordering states. It is a noncommericial listener supported station, whose programming consists of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Christian_music_2946.html" title="Contemporary Christian music">contemporary Christian music</a> and interview and discussion shows that focus on Christianity and the Bible, as well as lifestyle features and current events seen from a Christian perspective.</p>
<p>Its music rotation is somewhat diverse, encompassing both current releases and songs that were popular in earlier years as well. It tends to play a diverse range of styles as well, featuring not just music that appeals largely to teenagers as many CCM stations do, but more sophisticated styles that appeal to adults as well.</p>
<p>It has a very comprehensive website, that includes links to events of interest to the Christian community, prayers, devotions, Bible verses. One very noteworthy feature is its archive of music playlists that list not just the song, performer, and CD, but the time it was played as well, thus enabling listeners the ability to track down music they hear on the station.</p>

<p>The bottle (or can) cooler is often made of foam and has two major uses. It acts as a coaster, and it keeps your beverage (most often beer) cool. The device is often called by the wrong name. People tend to call it a "cozy"; whereas it should be called a koozie. The origins or the proper spelling for the foam bottle cooler are unknown to me. Alternative spellings include: "coozie, koozy, and coozy."</p>

<p><b>WNCW</b> is a public radio station operated by Isothermal Community College in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spindale.html" title="Spindale">Spindale</a>, North Carolina. Unlike most other public radio stations, it does not air the <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> newsmagazines, but devotes most of its broadcast time to various musical genres. The station is especially noteworthy for being one of only a handful of stations that features musical styles that are almost totally absent from commercial radio, such as folk, alt-country, Americana, blues, jam-band, Celtic, world beat music, etc. It features these styles on both its own in-house programming, as well as syndicated programs such as <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cafe_f856.html" title="World Cafe">World Cafe</a>, Acoustic Cafe, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afropop_Worldwide_1817.html" title="Afropop Worldwide">Afropop Worldwide</a>, the Grateful Dead Radio Hour, etc.</p>
<p>The station also features in-studio interviews with musicians who either live or are performing live in the area. This is especially noteworthy when WNCW is compared to similar stations, in that most of its peers that air similar interviews are in much larger cities, whereas WNCW is in a small town 60 miles from the nearest major airport.</p>

<p><b>The Benefits</b> Taking piano lessons can be beneficial to an individual in many ways. With any music lesson a sense of responsibility is taught through practicing and the completion of piano theory. It has been proven that reading music can inadvertently improve the mathematical skills of a person. As well as success in many different parts of life. The enjoyment and sense of accomplishment when a piece that could have once appeared impossible is completed is also a benefit to the time and effort put into taking lessons.</p>
<p><b>Type of Lesson</b> Often a piano lesson is a private lesson that way the student can learn at a faster pace with the one-on-one instruction, refer to lesson. The student and teacher can develop a closer relationship and the focus is entirely on that one student.</p>
<p><b>Piano Theory</b> Along with teaching how to play the piano there is piano theory. Piano theory, if generally speaking can be referred to as music theory. There are many different levels of piano theory. It improves the playing ability of the student and also the comprehension of the music by the student. The theory is assigned during the lesson and is to be completed by the next lesson.</p>
<p><b>Lesson Composition</b> Often the piano teacher and the student will only meet once a week. It is essential in the improvement of the piano student to practice often and on their own time at home. The suggested time is usually 30 minutes a day. During most piano lessons the teacher will have the student go over the previous weeks assigned music pieces. For those who do not take lessons over the summer months their time with the teacher culminates with a piano recital. The pieces played by the students at the piano recital are pieces that they have been working on for many months. It shows their improvement as a pianist and is also enjoyable for parents to attend and see what their children have accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Progression of the Student</b> Piano students all must begin at the beginner level, which is self-evident. If the student shows the interest and determination required to successfully complete a piano piece then they can move on. There are no real concrete examinations when taking piano lessons. Each week is its own examination when the student plays the piece from the previous week. If the student plays skillfully they in a sense “pass” and can move on to another piece.</p>

<p><i>Frogger</i> is a recreatation of a well-known <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade_game.html" title="Arcade game">arcade game</a> published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> by <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a>. While the arcade version of the game only featured a single highway area, Frogger added 9 new worlds to explore and over twenty new levels to the game. The game preserved the arcade version by incorporating five retro levels. These levels were a recreatation of the arcade game's levels, with minor changes, such as, a snake added in the third retro level to increase the difficulty. Yet, many of the original game's features exist in Frogger, such as a timer and car and trucks which could flatten the player.</p>
<p><a name="Objectives" id="Objectives"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-10_8ec4.html" title="Edit section: Objectives">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Objectives</span></h3>
<p>Unlike the original arcade game, Frogger changed its objectives to make the game more enjoyable. Instead of bringing the frog to a "frog home", the player would have to search through the level to find the five run away frogs, who are most likely to be the main frog's children. These five frogs, one red, one green, one orange, one purple, and one light blue, would be scattered through out the level. Not only were the run away frogs added, but bull dogs, snakes, lawnmowers, spiders, and even helicopters were added as things than could prevent the main frog from collecting all the run away frogs. Luckily, the main frog has five lifes to achieve his objectives.</p>

<p>With all the chaos, the main frog had to have some way to collect all his children before the time expired. So, the main frog was given a tongue. With this tongue, the main frog could eat bugs he found along the way to add time to the timer or give the main frog an extra life. Some bugs took away time, making the tongue feature less of an advantage. The main frog was also given the ability to "superjump". When the player commanded the frog to superjump, the frog would jump very high into the air. This ability enabled the frog to cliff steps and hop on birds from the ground, if a bird was near enough.</p>

<p>The creaters added several new worlds to Frogger, such as a dessert, a large group of islands, a sewer, and more. These new world, all having at least one level, gave the player a whole new experience. It also allowed for more ways for the frog to die. From bugs to birds to beasts, the frog had many perils to traverse before seening the run away frogs again.</p>
