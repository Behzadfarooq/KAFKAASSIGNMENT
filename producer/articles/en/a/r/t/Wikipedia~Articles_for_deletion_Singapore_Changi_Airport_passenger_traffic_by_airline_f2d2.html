<ul>
<li>Firstly, there has been a VfD for a related article 4 months ago, and the result was a keep. Is there any good reason to AfD this again now? I hope admins may take note of this.</li>
<li>Secondly, as proven by just how many updates this article got since 4 months ago, no, it didnt need alot of maintanence as I have said earlier.</li>
<li>Thirdly, yes, the information is original from CAAS, because wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not meant to be an avenue for original research</a>. I canot be churning up my own numbers from thin air (although I do my own simple maths in coming up with obvious data, for eg, mannually counting the number of flights per week). At the same time, it is not a <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">wholesale reproduction of original data</a>, because this table combines information found in the Airport site, CAAS's monthly and annual reports (which is not available free online and required a trip to its library, which is not open to the general public), plus counter-referenced data from publications by the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines and the<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Air_Transport_Association_09c3.html" title="International Air Transport Association">International Air Transport Association</a>, again from sources not neccesarily available to everyone for free.</li>
<li>Fourth, please explain "<i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information", when the sources and the work committed to compiling the above data has been explained.</li>
<li>Fifth, I do not see how people can decide for themselves what would be considered "usefull" or "interesting" topics for users of wikipedia. Do we have a policy in only writting articles which people will be assumed to be interested in? Not really, because we only do have one for writing <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_articles_useful_for_readers_25cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Make articles useful for readers">useful articles</a>. How would removing data make this site any more useful? When someone just wants to know the number of passengers flown between Singapore and Sydney per year, and how that compares with other city pairs out of Singapore, why should we deny this person the chance to see this information in wikipedia instead of turning to another source?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 12:04, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>why should we deny this person the chance to see this information in wikipedia instead of turning to another source?</i><br />
Because recording every verifiable piece of data in human knowledge is not Wikipedia's mission. Instead, the parent article article needs to better <i>summarize</i> the subject, rather than including every associated number and piece of data. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 06:57, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This information is too specific for Wikipedia.

<li>I would be surprised if someone starts saying information should be deleted from wikipedia for being <i>too specific</i>. Based on that theory, we should all abstain from being specific in the articles we write and strive for murkiness?

<li><b>Delete</b> as a noncontributory list. This is a clear example of an indiscriminate collection of data, something <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. These raw numbers don't help illuminate the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> article; instead of making a list of raw numbers, instead rewrite <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> to be a summary of the major airlines that serve the airport and the sort and amount of service they provide). People who want to get this info will go directly to the primary source, rather than going to an obscure list on Wikipedia (which may be out of date, depending on when someone last updated it).<br />
Additionally, the majority of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> belongs on Wikitravel or Yellowikis and not Wikipedia.

<dd>If we may look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, there is non of those categories of information this particular falls into and hence is deemed as an "indiscriminate collection of information". Lists like these combine information from several sources to present in table form the traffic flow into and out of this airport, which is an important <b>starting</b> reference for anyone involved in international transport study, for example. May I remind that if it looks like a mess of "detailed" data to the less initiated, it looks elimentary to those who are more familiar with it, and that is the way it is designed to be. Unfamiliar with it? Let this be the intiation. Not enough info? Pay and get detailed info from the relevant authorities unless others are kind enough to add to this one.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>You claim that "people who want to get this info will go directly to the primary source". The trouble is...could these people get it? I got some of these data by visiting the only aviation-themed library in my country, and only because my professor wrote in on a personal basis to the librarian to allow me in as part of my academic study. Sure, you could write in and subscribe for this kind of primary data directly from the publishers, but not before paying thousands of US dollars for them. Anyone can get this info? I doubt so. Wikipedia has a mission of providing and sharing knowledge for free, and I fail to see the rationale of asking these people who could otherwise be relying their research on wikipedia to look elsewhere?</dd>

<dd>It appears the only argument for its deletion is that the information is "not important enough". Who are we to judge? Yes, this article could outline the more significant flight routes out of this country. So when someone comes along and asks....how many flights and passengers from Africa are connected via this airport, and we tell them....sorry, that info is just not important enough for wikipedia?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:03, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
