<dd>So you are saying it should be deleted for not differentiation between " hardcore opponents to people who have questioned small areas "? That is a editorial issue, not grounds for deletion. Further, that is alomst impossible to do, where should the line be drawn? When are you not enough "hardcore" to be listed among them?

<p><s>:<b>Comment:</b> Well, that was sort of my point. If we can't draw the line maybe we shouldn't have the list. As much as I try continually to seek a justification for having articles on various topics, this seems like something that needs a lot more editorial explanation to have any real value. Otherwise, to me, it looks like a blatant attempt to create a long list of personalities/activists/nutjobs who may have questioned, at one time or another, aspects of 9/11, or signed a petition, or supported someone who did. Anyway, the future participants here will decide. I don't have a particularly strong feeling and could move to neutral depending on the arguments. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:39, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>And upon further consideration, those lists are useless. To shoehorn people into a category is the opposite of what an encyclopedia should be doing, which is explain the nuances of their position. Particularly with respect to political ideas. All it will do is produce nonesense debate over "does X fit into Y category" It's a bit more clear-cut with religion, but still, what's the use of a list of Christians? It'd be uselessly large. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 20:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll second that. A walled garden is an isolated section of a Wiki where pages link only to each other and don't link outside. Really, Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> content, with its legions of interlinking minor character articles, could be seen as a walled garden. The 9/11 Truth Movement articles, on the other hand, link to current events and to people notable for reasons having nothing to do with 9/11: the content is not isolated. I'll also add that, if anything, Striver has been working to make the topic *less* of a walled garden, linking it to as many outside sources, such as <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Jong_ec49.html" title="Erica Jong">Erica Jong</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> and <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Hammer_0ce6.html" title="A.J.

If we allow this article and others on the subject to be deleted by government agents, we are allowing Wikipedia as a whole to be owned by the government. "MONGO", just one of the government agents editing WP, selectively deletes portions of discussions on related subjects to discredit editors who don't hold to the account put out by the 9/11 commission. Within this very discussion, he has deleted portions of the discussion. And MONGO is just ONE of the people here trying to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">prove a point</a> by using controlling discussion to slant things to fit whatever agenda he is working from.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 18:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't like the title because there are more entities to disagree with than simply the 9/11 Commission Report's findings, i.e., Rice said they never imagined planes could be used as weapons but an FBI official said the opposite in the Moussaoui trial, that they'd known for years planes could be used as weapons. Many other documents also support that position, such as the war games official documents which played out those scenarios. But the content of this page is excellent - thanks, Striver.

I'm sorry, it was a mistake, I was confused, and maybe becoming senile. I sincerely apologise for the mistake... However, MONGO actually does appear to me to be censoring me by selective archival: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47037340" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47037340" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>,. I am trying to point out that if I have shown bias it is towards the conspiracy theorists... it can be amply shown that there was a conspiracy, and any explanation of that conspiracy that includes conjecture and unproven 'facts' is also a theory, so in fact the 9/11 commision's findings are a conspiracy theory. I'm not disputing facts but theories. It is a <i><b>fact</b></i> that WTC 1,2, and 7 collapsed to dust at freefall speeds after being struck by aircraft. Do you dispute that? It is a <i><b>theory</b></i> that the collapse of all 3 buildings was caused by the aircraft. <b>You</b> hold that to be fact, therefore you are biased toward accepting that particular conspiracy theory as a fact. I do not accept as fact anything that is not provable, and I object to the inclusion <i><b>as fact</b></i> of unproven theories. I am biased AGAINST conspiracy theories, at least I do not think that theories are Neutral in their point of view, or merit inclusion in an encyclopedic text, unless they are represented not as facts but as theories. I wish you could understand that. The mere fact that you assume that Striver contacted me because he thought I might weigh in 'on his side' of this issue does not make me biased.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 23:10, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt;&gt;<i>"If a researcher isn't an engineer, their view does not carry authority."</i> Like I said before, in the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 the person who figured out what actually caused the crash was <i>not an engineer, he was a metallurgist, working in a research setting</i>. The NTSB started off saying it was a single bolt failure and was going to leave it at that, was busy replacing all the bolts on other DC10s, and had it's engineers backing that story up. That story was wrong. It wasn't just the bolt, it was a mistaken procedure for engine maintenance that stressed the bolt beyond capacity. But it took a metallurgist examining the fractures on the pylon on a microscopic level, and then through a process of deduction, concluding that it could not possibly have been the bolts alone, to determine that.</p>

But it's useful to have a list rather than a category because e.g. a category can't tell me that <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiri_Baraka_5316.html" title="Amiri Baraka">Amiri Baraka</a> wrote and performed "someone blew up America" then refused to apologise, but wasn't active in the "research" movement as such. A brief description like that, though, would be excellent: informative, useful, and encyclopedic. At present, unlike what this AFD nomination claims, this article is <i>not</i> redundant because there is nowhere for non-researchers to be listed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 15:44, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> People who are not "researchers" but are instead "activists" or "politicians" or otherwise notable figures are included in the topic of the article. Therefore, it would be more suitable to merge the <b>Researchers</b> article to this one, rather that disqualifying content which is otherwise of interest by restricting the topic.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> 18:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. "Researchers" are generally considered to be academics. A list of academics may have no room for, say, politicians, movie stars, or other notable people <i>"questioning the official account of 9/11"</i>. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 17:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. A merge the other way around could work. Researchers fit in the broader list of "people". But, still this list needs to be really well cited and verified. It would be really unfortunate for Wikipedia, if someone was mistakenly listed here and led to another <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a></small>) 17:08, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. This is an emotionally charged issue. So I agree that extra care should be taken to verify that the people on this list really do belong on it. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 18:01, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> "Researchers" include some academics, but "academics" do not include all researchers, according to normal English use.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminorex_1d55.html" title="User:Aminorex">Aminorex</a> 18:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
