<p>This is part of a walled garden of almost a hundred articles that I proposed for deletion. All PROD tags have been removed, so they come here. I'll nominate them one at a time or in small groups to avoid problems like those seen with the mass nomination of Polynesian mythology articles. This is obviously fancruft, highly specific material about a fictional world. These articles go into excrutiating detail on the specifications of fictional giant robots from a Japanese cartoon. It's not of general or encyclopedic appeal, and this series already has a Wiki at WikiCities anyway. It needs to go. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Declaring your intention to mass-nominate articles relating to a massively popular, genre-defining franchise seems like bad faith to me. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 06:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While I don't like SEED much, it's worth to keep. No general interest? Gundam is consider to be largest mecha franchise in Japan. Delete these article would be like delete all <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>'s article like <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-AT_3fef.html" title="AT-AT">AT-AT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-ST</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-PT_191c.html" title="AT-PT">AT-PT</a>(and there are TWO wiki web for Star Wars already as well). Not that I don't like Star Wars, but Japaneese anime is a form of art too.

Obviously without all the detailed in depth articles on a robot that appeared for three seconds in a Japanese anime in 1997, there's no point.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> into Weapons in Gundam universe or somesuch -- there are two or three orders of magnitude in terms of cultural notability between SW/ST and even the world's most popular manga, and even the SW cruft should be merged into less nerdily completist articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Do you have any idea how bloated an article that would create? You're talking about merging hundreds of articles together, not just the four that were chose for this particular AfD session.

There's no reason we can't have "nerdily completist articles", as you put it, for these subjects.

<li>Okay, I'll admit I wasn't that clear, but yes, I do.

There's a lot of specific, authoritatively-presented information here. Is it okay to mass-reproduce the stats and critical data of these robots from an official source? It goes beyond fair use, so that's not okay. On the other hand, it may not come from anything published... in which case it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Mangojuice - as the numbers and 'facts' involved are a work of fiction rather than a measurement of reality, they do indeed come under copyright.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 04:02, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I think the deletion requests that I've seen in most of the entries are a bit ridiculous. Be more reasonable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First and foremost, I agree with Mangojuice on the subject of the process involved in the AfD. Furthermore, I don't see any problem with including an article about a fictional vehicle in Wikipedia. Wikipedia would be far better served by attempts to improve existing articles than crusades against articles that some see as too detailed or irrelevant. One of Wikipedia's greatest strengths is the breadth of its coverage. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 12:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> as explained above Lone Jobber 06:34, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<dd>Usefulness has no bearing on notability (WP:N) and verifiability (WP:N). Please read these policies before commenting on deletions - this is not a question of whether the articles are important to some editors, but is instead a question as to whether the articles conform to policies for inclusion.
