<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFiftythree_fcb4.html" title="User:Fiftythree">Fiftythree</a> 13:51, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity page, Advertising and self promotion. The article was 90% written by the girls mother and fellow administrator of the site. Hongkongdongle 20:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no idea why this page was nominated. Notable, verifiable. From the site: <i>My site has been featured recently in the Washington Post, and several other large newspapers here in the United States including the Chicago Tribune and the Wall Street Journal. It has also been featured in several newspapers all over the world, most recently (May, 2004) in the Malaysia Star.</i> Ifnord 14:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I'm puzzled by the nomination. The web site clearly meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia guidelines for website notability</a> as evidenced by high Alexa rank plus media attention by national newspapers. I note the nominator and several of the delete votes have only edits on this specific AfD which makes me suspicious of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">puppetry</a>. Ifnord 17:55, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In what way do you assert this article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines? Nowhere is Alexa rank mentioned. If this site's Alexa rank qualifies it for Wikipedia inclusion, then you, Ifnord, have a lot of work to do - there are 29,999 other sites to be added. You'd better get cracking. And then, at the end of that process, you will have made Wikipedia into a Web directory, <i><b>in direct contravention of the guideline you cited.</b></i> -Ikkyu2 09:28, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aside from Alexa rank, the article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines. Media attention suggests notability (CNN, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post). Thomas 9:17 AM 28 January 2006
<ul>
<li>Disagree. The media attention was likely trivial puff pieces about a trivial, non-notable site. -Ikkyu2 23:27, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You don't need to hypothesize what the articles are "likely" to be. They are linked to from the article, and you can read them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Note from Lissa at Lissaexplains.com</b> One requesting deletion is actually a moderator that I removed from my forum considering his heinous behavior - the site was created by me alone, and the article was written by members of my forum. Relative is no longer a moderator, and really has as much to do with the Web site as all moderators do. I, personally, have never touched the article, and only recently noticed a slanderous comment within the article posted by two members who left my forum. I ran an IP search within my forum, and four users here are ex-forum members. This is an obvious case of trolling. 3:58 PM EST 27 January 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would also like to note that my above comment was deleted, and please, I do not want this immaturity to play out on the Wikipedia Web site.

<li>This one is easier than most. Usually a lengthy search involving some effort is required to find the non-trivial published works from independent sources. In this case, <i>they are handily linked to at the bottom of the article</i>. (The article could be improved further by citing the initial article in the Australian newspaper, as well.) I've read the subset of the news articles that are actually legible, and they are not mere incidental mentions or web directory listings. The primary <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion is satisfied. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Owner of the site tries to influence the voting. User Jessily that voted for delete received a per direct ip ban on her site:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia1.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia1.jpg</a> Another user that editted the article was punished also: <a href="http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia2.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuinslak.be/tmp/leia2.jpg</a> Site owner admits it on the second screen. Two more users that either voted for delete or editted the article also went in problems. I think that the voting will be disturbed by these actions. If her site was good enough there was no need for these actions. This plus the other reasons stated above are clear enough for me.</p>
<p>Site owner banned my ip since she discovered my ip while i was editting my vote without being logged in. What a democratic voting proces! Dave83 16:23, 29 January 2006 (CET)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Agree with Englishrose per above comment, bad faith nomination. Above user, please stick to the issue, which is the article in question.Jason 1128, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have heard of this website, and it clearly meets notability guidelines. Dave83, there is nothing wrong with banning a person who vandalized the site article from the site forums. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos"><font color="#000000" face="Quake">SYCTHOS</font></a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><font color="#660033" face="Quake"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 23:07, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It wasn't vandalism. The article was updated to reflect the current state of the forum, and was factually accurate. Lissa is definately trying to influence the outcome of the vote by retaliating against those that vote against the article. I resonded to her first comment, but it was deleted. I pointed out that she was lying in her comments here, and since it was deleted, I feel as though she is being allowed to say what she wants (whether accurate or not), and nobody else is allowed to provide the truth- either because it will be removed or we will be retaliated against. If that's not "disrupting the credibility of the AfD process", I don't know what is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.49.0.178 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.49.0.178_459f.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.49.0.178">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
