<dd>AfD is not a vote, it's a discussion based on weight of opinion, not raw numbers, so all comments will be taken into account by the closing admin. You cannot simply discount opinions with reasons you regard as invalid, or else you will end up with a situation where a simple "Delete." would have more influence than "Delete because X". The latter is more useful, as if the result is keep, editors interested in that article will know what its perceived shortcomings are.

When people advocate an article should be deleted <i>because it is POV</i> that certainly contradicts <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#What_to_do_with_a_problem_page.2Fimage.2Fcategory" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">wikipedia policy</a>.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 15:25, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It depends a bit on what they meant by "delete because it is POV". Articles which fail to live up to the NPOV standards should be repaired <i>if possible</i>. However, we've also discovered that some article titles and/or topics irredeemably violate the policy of NPOV. Those irredeemable articles may require deletion regardless.<br />
MartinRe is absolutely correct that deletion discussion are discussions, not votes. I would modify his reply a bit with the observation that users whose comments contradict standing policy or our traditions are given less weight than comments which are well-grounded in our policies and standards. Making that judgment call can be difficult and is one of the reasons we ask administrators to close controversial decisions - they've been here long enough to understand the traditions and policies. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 15:42, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, thank you for your comment. What they meant by POV as reason to delete can be seen in the AfD regarding <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationales_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_0227.html" title="Rationales to impeach George W. Bush">Rationales to impeach George W. Bush</a>. Since I fail to be objective I was interested in an objective view on how this would be judged (what is AfD exactly?).

<dd>I've reformatted your request a bit to show the links to the images rather than pulling the images in themselves. I hope I haven't changed your intent. But I also want to confirm your request. You are not asking that the image be entirely deleted, merely that the prior versions be deleted. The Abbesses stairs request makes sense given the size of the first version. I'll take care of that for you. On the Paris map image, are you sure that there is no value to the history that led up to the latest version?

<dd>Well first off, AFD isn't a strict vote, it's a <i>discussion</i> — the closing administrator should interpret all the comments (as well as the votes) and come up with the most acceptable solution. In this case, the key point from the discussion is that nobody thinks Yaxley should have a standalone article. Both a redirect and deletion achieve this, but deletion is more appropriate when the article content is being removed from Wikipedia completely. In this case nobody was advocating removing <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter</a> as far as I can tell. Redirects are more transparent than deletion — only administrators can see deleted histories, but anybody can see the history of a redirect. Also, even though it is fairly unlikely that this redirect will actually be used, it does discourage anybody from recreating a page at this title in the future. Finally, as Mailer Diablo said, redirects are cheap — they take minimal server resources and database space, so it doesn't really matter if we have more than we need. — <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford"><small>(talk)</small></a> 09:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, merge does not result in deletion. When merged, and article can not be deleted, in order to retain attribution history. It's also a useful reference, in case somebody does a redirect, without fully merging the pertinent information (this is after all a wiki, and one's edits are subject to change). In the case you describe, after the AFD, anybody (not just the closing admin) can and should perform a merge/redirect. We have AFDs for deletes, because it's permanent, and only an admin can do it. Admins often don't perform merges after AFDs where they are requested. They may if they wish, but that's not really their "obligation".

<dd>To elaborate a bit, remember that we are required to retain attribution history of kept content. It's a condition of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>. If the content is merged into another article, we have to retain tracability of the people who contributed to the content. The easiest way to do that is to merge the content and redirect the old article to the new one. (There are some other techniques that can be used if the situation demands it, but they are more complex and time-consuming and have proven to be error-prone.) The result is that even though a "merge" opinion generally means that the user thinks the article should not exist independently, it is very different from a "delete" opinion. In deletion, the page and content go away. We have no obligation to maintain the attribution history. In "merge", we have to keep the attribution history. That's why "merge" opinions are generally interpreted as a flavor of "keep" even though, as you say, there may be a consensus that an independent article should not exist. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 18:41, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps because anyone can propose a merge at any time. One typically places {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}} tags on the candidate articles, waits a few days to see if there is discussion, and carries it out. It's not a formal community process the way AfD is, because it can be reversed, but there is still a consensus gathering phase, at least in most cases. An editor who just merges without prior notice often is reverted, which then spurs the discussion... That's what I've seen in the past anyway. (a similar argument applies to "move", since it too is reversable, usually). <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:20, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Do we necessarily need a list of all of these warez groups? Why can't the article be merged into something that talks about warez groups, but doesn't necessarily lists them off. Maybe add a different section to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a> or possibly merge this list into a different article?

Just as you don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> an article you start, you can't own a deletion discussion. Others may agree with your logic and deserve the chance to have their say. Just because you've changed your mind doesn't mean that they have yet changed theirs.</dd>
<dd>If you do change your mind, the preferred practice is to strike through the nomination (using &lt;s&gt; <s>nomination text</s> &lt;/s&gt;) and explain your revised opinion. The community tends to give that revised opinion great weight during the decision-making process.</dd>
<dd>I'll also mention that there are some cases where nominations can be speedy-closed. However, that decision should be left to an impartial party. The nominator should not attempt to do so.

<dd>First, are you saying that you've seem this template on the top of the <i>article</i> page? If so, that was a mistake. This template should only be used on Talk pages. But to answer the core of your question, I think that it can go into the archives eventually in most cases but I don't argue if someone pulls it back out. It can be useful in some situations but if the last deletion discussion was several years ago, its relevance is dubious at best.

Obviously, speedies should still be speedy, and some stuff (like blatant spam / ads) shouldn't have a time window.

Another possibility to what you suggest is another kind of prod, say, called "new-prod" or something: it's officially sort of like a strong {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}, but an additional comment would say that if the problems are not fixed by "date", then the article will go AfD.

<p>There are two articles written on Bibi Shahrbanu. One is titled Shahr Banu and the other is titled Shahrbanu binte Yazdgerd III. So if there any way you can delete the article Shahr Banu because the other article has more information about her in a neutral style. And if you can, can you also provide me with step on how I can merge or delete articles. Thank You <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">Salman</a></p>

<dd>I think what you really want to do is merge and redirect. To merge the two articles, I recommend opening two browser windows and copy-pasting the material you want from one article into the other article. You should pick the article with the best name to be the destination, not necessarily the article that is currently most complete. When you are done, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirect</a> the other article to the main article. You make something a redirect by replacing the article contents with <tt>#redirect <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo.html" title="Foo">foo</a></tt>. Redirects serve two purposes in this case and are far better than deletion. 1) A redirect points users who had been editing the other article to the new, merged article so you can all work together to improve it further. 2) Redirects preserve the article's attribution history. This is a requirement under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Can the nominator of an AFD article suspend the nomination in lue of a presented alternative(s), or does an article placed on the AFD list have to reach a consensus first? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 03:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. Once a good faith discussion has been started, it should be allowed to run its course. You may have been convinced to change your mind but others may not have. We've learned the hard way that closing a discussion early just creates dissent and the appearance of impropriety. The discussion will close in few days regardless.</dd>
<dd>What you <i>can</i> do is to strike through your nomination (using &lt;s&gt;<s>foo</s>&lt;/s&gt;) and revise your opinion in the discussion. Subsequent participants tend to give it significant weight when the nominator changes his/her mind. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 03:40, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There does exist a <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">speedy keep</a> guideline, if the nominator withdraws the request and there are <i>no</i> delete votes so far, the nomination can be closed early. This is not official policy, and it is not a fully integrated part of the deletion process, but I don't think many will complain if people make decisions based upon it. Usually such closes happen because the nominator realiszes that the nomination was based on a misunderstanding of deletion policy (e.g. didn't realize that all villages, no matter how small or remote, are always unanimously kept) or something like that. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:06, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Supposing that a motion has been made to keep the page for a certain amount of time, and that proposal has been seconded by members of the keep side of the debate with blessings from the AFD nominator. Could we then keep the page in accordance with the agreement reached on the AFD page, or would this be a majority rule situation? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 20:16, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Majority rule has no relevance because <a href="../../../v/i/e/WP%7EVIE_cf5b.html" title="WP:VIE">we are not voting</a>. Good deletion discussions result in consensus decisions which are often very nuanced and have which have been crafted to the specific situation and facts at hand. But that decision has to weigh the opinions and evidence offered by <i>all</i> the participants. Mere concurrence by the "members of the keep side" should not automatically decide anything.<br />
You are asking about an exception process, not the normal course of a deletion discussion. Exceptions are, by definition, handled on a case-by-case basis. That's not something we should try to systematize.<br />
Is there a specific case that is driving your questions? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the moment I am asking primarily in regard to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Structures_of_the_GLA_5e81.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Structures of the GLA">this request</a>; however, this is also a "for future reference" kind of discussion so that I can get a better idea of how pages here can be spared. In the specific case, I would like more time to do research for the page to see if I can expand the individual entry’s, but that would take time that I do not have right now, as I am currently studying rather intensly for finals, and the time alloted by an AFD tag for R&amp;D work on the page would be insufficient <i>unless</i> the agreement that <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakhim_a991.html" title="User:Lakhim">User:Lakhim</a> and myself reached, in which case I would have a month to buckle down and really dig into it. Alternatively, he has also suggest a merge option for the page to combine it with the other building pages. This AFD has been hard on both sides because we lack a wiki-recognized concept of a "game manual"; for games like Kingdom Hearts and Rainbow Six this is not as big a deal since the primary units are characters, but in rts and tbs games the entire game play revolves around units and strucutures which, when listed here in an effort to be encyclopedic, can give the impression of a game manual without really intending to. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 01:49, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think administrators have discretion to ignore sockpuppet contributions or close AfDs if they were made in bad faith (which one from an abusive puppet would probably be). Sometimes I think the obsession with sockpuppetry gets out of hand (especially since it isn't a vote), as though the important point was to root out sockpuppetry and not establish the substantive merit of the article itself. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:49, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<div style="padding:1em;border:1px solid black">
<dl>
<dd>Shalom to everyone: There is presently a very serious phenomenon on Wikipedia that effects all articles. Let's call it "The New Deletionism". There are editors on Wikipedia who want to cut back the number of "low quality" articles EVEN IF THEY ARE ABOUT NOTABLE TOPICS AND SUBJECTS by skipping the normal procedures of placing {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} tags on the articles' pages and instead wish to skip that process altogether and nominate the articles for a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">vote for deletion (VfD)</a>. This can be done by <i>any</i> editor, even one not familiar with the subject. The implication/s for all articles related to Jews, Judaism, and Israel are very serious because many of these articles are of a specilaized nature that may or may not be poorly written yet have important connections to the general subjects of Jews, Judaism, and Israel, as any expert in that subject would know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Two recent examples will illustrate this problem:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Zichron_Kedoshim%2C_Congregation_4d2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zichron Kedoshim, Congregation">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zichron Kedoshim, Congregation</a> where a notable Orthodox synagogue was deleted from Wikipedia. The nominator gave as his reason: "Scarce material available on Google, nor any evidence in those results of notability nor any notable size." Very few people voted and only one person objected correctly that: "I've visited this synagogue, know members, and know that it is a well established institution" which was ignored and the article was deleted. (I was unaware of the vote).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Berel_Wein_cbec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Berel Wein">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Berel Wein</a> where the nominator sought to delete the article about Rabbi <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berel_Wein_8718.html" title="Berel Wein">Berel Wein</a> because: "It looks like a vanity project to me. While he does come up with many Google hits, they are all commercial in nature. The article is poorly written and reads like a commercial to me." In the course of a strong debate the nominator defended his METHOD: "... what better way to do that than put it on an <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> where people who might know more about the subject might actually see it and comment rather than slapping a {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">NPOV</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} template on and waiting for someone to perhaps come across it." But what if no-one noticed it in time and it would have gone the same way as "Congregation Zichron Kedoshim"? Fortunately, people noticed it, no-one agreed with the nominator and the article was kept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As we all know Googling for/about a subject can determine its fate as an article, but this too is not always a clear-cut solution. Thus for example, in the first case, the nominator saw almost nothing about "Congregation Zichron Kedoshim" on Google (and assumed it was unimportant) whereas in the second case the nominator admitted that Berel Wein "does come up with many Google hits" but dismissed them as "all commercial in nature". So in one case too few Google hits was the <i>rationale</i> for wanting to delete it and in the other it was <i>too many</i> hits (which were dismissed as "too commercial" and interpreted as insignificant), all depending on the nominators' <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> of course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This problem is compounded because when nominators don't know <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> or know nothing about Judaism and its rituals then they are at a loss, they don't know variant <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterated</a> spellings, and compounding the problem even more Google may not have any good material or sources on many subjects important to Jewish, Judaic, and Israeli subjects. Often Judaica stores may be cluttering up the search with their tactics to sell products or non-Jewish sites decide to link up to Biblical topics that <i>appear</i> "Jewish" but are actually missionary sites luring people into misinformation about the Torah and the Tanakh, so while Googling may yield lots of hits they may mostly be Christian-oriented and even be hostile to the Judaic perspective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Therefore, all editors and contributors are requested to be aware of any such attempts to delete articles that have a genuine connection to any aspect of Jews, Judaism and Israel, and to notify other editors</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Please, most importantly, place alerts here in particular so that other editors can be notified</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for all your help and awareness. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</div>
<dl>
<dd>As for the congregation, while you might think it's important, if there is no other evidence for it and not many Google hits, it's tough to not delete it. Know what I mean? Otherwise, people might not delete things that really should be deleted because somebody says it's notable. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 16:42, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is there an WP:AFC equivalent for deletion?</span></h2>
<p>I've been editing without registering for a few years now, and I used to be able to nominate articles for deletion. I now see that's impossible (yet another privilege lost by unregistered users since the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>). IMHO, Andre Ruette fails to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, something I attempted to rectify via <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> when I was editing as 66.167.137.56 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.167.137.56_50f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.167.137.56">contribs</a>). <a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.9.0.25.html" title="User:149.9.0.25">149.9.0.25</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/9/User_talk%7E149.9.0.25.html" title="User talk:149.9.0.25">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_149.9.0.25_8018.html" title="Special:Contributions/149.9.0.25">contribs</a>) disagreed with my assessment, leaving me no choice but to try some other process. Rather than giving up I am hoping to find an alternate process if one is available. Failing that, perhaps I can convince someone to do the AfD nomination, by pointing out that a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Andre+Ruette%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Andre+Ruette%22" rel="nofollow">google search for Andre Ruette</a> yields no evidence of notability.

<dd>I'd strongly suggest you create an account instead. Users who are involved this deeply in the project usually benefit from having a consistent identity. Also, last I checked votes by anonymous IPs don't count. Also, using a registered account hides your IP, which protects your privacy (I wouldn't want some bitter article writer hunting me down&#160;:-). <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 09:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Votes from anonymous IPs do "count" if they provide a good reason, from <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a>: <i>"...verifiable facts and evidence are welcome from anybody and will be considered during the closing process."</i>. But yes, getting an account makes the process of editing Wikipedia much easier. Apart from the ability to create pages you get a move-button, the ability to watchlist, and people tend to treat you with much more respect (you should be treated with respect anyway of course). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As Crazynas says, it isn't a vote and good ideas will be picked up. I'd leave anon IPs to the vandals - it makes them much easier to spot.

<p>If a page with information arranged either in an article form or in a list form is deleted can it be recreated for the purpose of redirecting the page? For example, if a page title "ships operated by White Star lines" is deleted could it be recreated as a redirect to the article "White Star lines"? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 22:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but I would think hard about it. If it obviously could have been converted to a redirect, the proposer should have just done that instead of sending it for AfD. Sometimes voters will suggest "redirect", which provides support for such an action. Most of the time, if the topic isn't suitable for Wikipedia, people probably aren't going to search for it either. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:44, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For unclear reasons many nominators, as well as "voters", don't seem to consider the possibility of a redirect, and if the arguments in the deletion debate, unlike e.g. like "POV title", clearly don't reflect on a redirect page, I don't see a problem. Recreating to make a redirect page may make sense if there are a lot of incoming links that are now redlinked, which sometimes happens (see <a href="#Who_removes_red_links" title="">#Who removes red links</a> above). Otherwise, it only makes sense if it also would have been a good idea if that page had never existed, which requires that the title is a plausible search term. Creating a new redirect page with a title like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_%28Prince_of_Wales%27s%29_North_Staffordshire_Regiment_9c24.html" title="The (Prince of Wales's) North Staffordshire Regiment">The (Prince of Wales's) North Staffordshire Regiment</a> would be pointless; no-one would ever come up with that search time. I'm not too sure about "ships operated by White Star lines" either, but I guess that was just by way of example. In the end: just use your common sense. There <s>is no spoon</s> are no rules. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
