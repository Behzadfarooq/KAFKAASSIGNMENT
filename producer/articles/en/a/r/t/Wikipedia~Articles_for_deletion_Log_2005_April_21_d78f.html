<li>Both the pages you mention have some interesting prose -- but what's interesting about a long list of names? The US list has over a thousand names on it!

<li>Lists are indexes, not articles to "sit down and read" - propose deleting all the lists in WP and see how far you get! These lists serve several purposes - "is Bing Crosby on a US stamp?" (yes, in 1994); "who is Percy Crosby, and what did he do to be stampworthy?"; they are a reminder that each person's bio should consider mentioning stamp appearance, and philatelists use lists like these to find a stamp in catalogs when they don't remember its year of issue (which happens a lot).

<li>Assuming that the list of countries exist and everybody can contribute, I don't understand why such discussion about this page.This page is no diferent from the <a href="../../../o/l/t/Oltre_Giuba_3690.html" title="Oltre Giuba">Oltre Giuba</a> list which is on Wikipedia a long ago.If it is trivial is because <a href="../../../k/i/o/Kionga.html" title="Kionga">Kionga</a> issued only 4 stamps with the same figure. With this I can do nothing more then list the content of the country in the same principals of other existing lists.And sometimes what is trivial for someone is important for another one.As for merge this list on Portuguese colonies category in the same way of Australia, I don't see any logical reason for that.French colonies and British colonies are listed separately.Why not the same for Portuguese colonies?Are they different from the others?Most of French ,British and Portuguese colonies are now independent countries.Should them be listed under the colonizer country list?The context of <a href="../../../k/i/o/Kionga_Triangle_5918.html" title="Kionga Triangle">Kionga Triangle</a> page is quite different from this lists.Is it correct to mix different contexts just because a single "trivial" line on a page?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, I'm the guy who nominated the VfD in the first place. I still don't agree that Wikipedia should have hundreds of lists of stamps as articles. But the consensus is clearly against me on that point. And if we're going to have all these stamp lists, there's no reason Kionga shouldn't have a list too, just because it's a forgotten German colony that only issued one stamp. There's no reason not to have a list with one entry, even if it looks strange. And Kionga was a unique entity, so merging its list elsewhere makes no sense. --<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:04, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Marsh may not have done anything "notworthy" by your standards, but have you? If we google you, would anything other than "wikipedia posting addict" appear? He had done alot, i'm from south of toronto and i've heard of Marsh. I've actually seen a film, so hows the for notable. If he has his film playing basially at different ends of the province, i think thats something. He's ran them at film fextivals, just because they are world renouned ones doesnt mean they arnt something. everyone has to start somewhere and he is notable for doing so. Also, dont you think he deserves something for getting all this talk about him by everyone here? He is far more notable than you,and until you can prove you've done something remotely close to his success, why woulud you care so much if he's deleted?--<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESades1313_23fd.html" title="User:Sades1313">sades1313</a> 01:23, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>He has become quite well known as part of an emergent sub-culture. Certainly the magazine for which he writes exists, and they mention him on their site.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This borders on silly. The teams are entirely distinct, and the histories of the two teams will be entirely divergent. Fans of the former team are not fans of the new team, and fans of the new team don't care about or likely know much about the history of the old team. One team died and the other inherited its players (not its name or logo or mascot or anything else), that's all. The LA Dodgers kept the same name and had the same owner, there's a certain sense of continuity, a sense that the Brooklyn Dodgers history is part of the LA Dodgers history. There is no such continuity here, the Nationals are starting fresh, in every aspect except their starting lineup they are effectively an expansion franchise. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:58, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do your research more closely. The franchise chose to change its name. Franchises sometimes change their names (Browns to Orioles, Senators to Twins) and sometimes they don't (Lakers, Jazz, Dodgers). The Nats could have kept their name, their logo, their mascot...those were business decisions. The Nats are not starting fresh. They use the same spring training facility, they take the same history of statistics, and the same retired numbers (Carter, Dawson, Staub). The same contracts are continued. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 17:30, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The only reason there is a <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Senators_11ed.html" title="Washington Senators">Washington Senators</a> article is because there were two MLB teams called that.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Teams that move cities and change names are effecively different. Consider the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>. They moved to Baltimore, became the Ravens, and a few years later a NEW franchise called the Browns was put in place in Cleveland as a CONTINUATION of the old franchise. We need to keep articles like this. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket"><font color="#337147"><strong>&amp;#151 FoodMarket&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp</strong></font></a><sup><a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoodmarket_3251.html" title="User talk:Foodmarket"><font color="#0000C0">talk!</font></a></sup> 06:04, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a>, that is technically not true. Yes, the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Ravens_9241.html" title="Baltimore Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> have separate articles, but only because the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> considers them two different teams.

<li>When the Browns expansion franchise was created, a significant part of the agreement was that the NFL would take the unprecedented step of reverting the Cleveland history of the former franchise to the new team; previously, records of all franchises went with them when a team relocated. The Cleveland Browns have to be regarded as a departure from the norm in this case. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 20:38, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Just because we have the franchise now (I live near DC) doesn't mean we can completely ignore the fact that the team had a home in Montral for a long time. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 06:28, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>These discussions would be futile. Official NHL sources split their franchises to individual teams, with a separate section on the Dallas Stars and the Minnesota North Stars (the major exception is the Seals). Even official NBA sources (last time I checked) do the same. To not do the same in Wikipedia is ludicrous. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 03:15, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Better check your sources more closely. For example, in the Warriors' media guide they list Wilt Chamberlain as holding the team record for points in a game, even though he did it when the team called Philadelphia home. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 04:41, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The general rule in Wikipedia is to split off even closely related topics or subtopics when there's enough material for two articles. Thus, for instance, we have <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Italy_8cd5.html" title="History of Italy">History of Italy</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Italy_c5fa.html" title="Geography of Italy">Geography of Italy</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_in_fiction.html" title="Mars in fiction">Mars in fiction</a>. So arguments that the Nationals and Expos ought to be considered the same franchise would be irrelevant even if they were true... Expos information should still be split off into its own article. There is enough material for two articles, and people looking for information about one will rarely be interested in the other. Technicalities aside, they are two distinct topics. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 17:30, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is moot. Even if you considered them to be the same team (and fans in both cities most certainly don't), there is ample precedent for splitting off sections of a too-large article into a separate page, even if they were on the same topic (or one is a sub-topic of the other). And how would you integrate the "Players of note" and "Retired numbers" sections of the two pages?

Finally, is it helpful to Nationals fans to make them wade through an entire article's worth of material on the Expos in chronological order (which could be expanded even further) to get to material about the team they're actually interested in?

<li>What do you mean the point is moot? You mean that it's a <i>fait accompli</i> and therefore we can't fix it? We then need to split the Brooklyn Dodgers out of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the New York Giants out of the San Francisco Giants, ad nauseum.

<li>What I mean is simply that even if we accepted the argument that this was the same franchise or team, there would still be plenty of precedent in Wikipedia for splitting off the Montreal Expos history into its own article (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_in_fiction.html" title="Mars in fiction">Mars in fiction</a> is split from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a>, etc) on grounds of length alone. In arguing over supposed precedents, I think you're losing sight of the core issue: what is the most helpful presentation for readers? In cases where fans of the new team have no interest in the history or traditions of the old team, readers looking for information about the new team will likewise very likely not be interested in (lengthy!) information about the old team (but if they want it, it's just a wikilink click away). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 22:04, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Kingturtle the Expos and the Nationals are the same franchise. Wikipedia should have the same policy for all sport teams when a team moves unless there is some special or unqiue circumstances ie Cleveland Browns, where the NFL clearly made it a spereate team. I am from Minnesota and would not support a seprate Minnesota North Stars or Minneapolis Lakers article, thoses teams moved and their history becomes part of the new club ie Dallas Stars and Los Angeles Lakers.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> NHL teams have their own defunct franchise page, why not MLB? Whether MLB considers the Expos as a distinct franchise or not should be irrelevant: MLB played the principle role in killing baseball in Montreal through picking cronies of Bud Selig who would gut the team after the city refused to pay for a new baseball stadium. Using MLB's opinion as a crutch to support an argument against a seperate Montreal page is ludicrous. MLB wants Expos history to be brushed over, because it highlights their sins and incompetence in running baseball. -- Flynn

<li>Flynn, you're now bringing conspiracy theory into the mix. wikipedia should not cowtow to such emotions and to such inventions of conspiracies. the bottomline is that the expos and the nats are the same franchise, and all other MLB franchises carry with them their place and name histories. As for their time in Montreal, they finished last in NL attendance for seven years running (1998 - 2004) - and that streak started long before MLB took the franchise over. Furthermore, between 1984 and 2004, Montreal only twice finished as high as 8th in NL attendance, and those years were '84 and '85. So one can argue that the principle role in killing baseball in Montreal was lack of fan support. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 07:25, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Bud Selig's own Milwaukee Brewers have an even more pitiful attendance record than Montreal. Your own ignorance about what happened with the Expos should not be used against the team. Read 'la Defense de Montreal' before you talk. What happened with the Expos was a travesty - no other sports team's fanbase has suffered through such a consistent effort by ownership and the league itself to poison enthusiasm in the insatiable quest for publicly funded stadiums, especially the Loria tenure that had some moves that bordered on racketeering. Flynnie
<ul>
<li>The Bud Selig saga with the Brewers is a completely different story. Selig LIED that the Brewers were financially ruined, but they weren't. he used the lie to get a stadium - and that is disgusting. Although Milwaukee's attendance has been weak, it is not "more pitiful" than the Expos. The Brewers outdrew the Expos in each of the last seven seasons.</li>

<p><b>PROPOSAL</b>: While debate is still open and I don't want to seem presumptuous, it does seem that a consensus is forming to keep the Montreal Expos page. Therefore, I offer the following suggestion. Because the Expos' history (records, retired numbers, &amp;c.) has transferred to the Nationals, the Nationals' article should still address the franchise's history as the Montreal Expos, albeit in brief. A link would direct the reader to the "main article" on the franchise's history in Montreal (see <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> for an example). I don't think there's any reason to exclude the history of the franchise from when it played in a different city. That would only confuse the informed reader who knows of the team's history and would give a false impression of the team's youth to the ignorant one. I agree with Smith03 that there should be a uniform policy, and the consensus that's building seems to be that if there is enough information to warrant an article under a franchise's old name, then it should exist. So, in the case of the Angels, if there is enough history for each individual incarnation of the franchise (i.e., <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Angels_8a3e.html" title="Los Angeles Angels">Los Angeles Angels</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Angels_dc4b.html" title="California Angels">California Angels</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim_Angels_3751.html" title="Anaheim Angels">Anaheim Angels</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim_8ace.html" title="Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a>), then each page should exist, but the page with the team's current name should be comprehensive. In other words, it should address the franchise's entire history, from 1961 to present. The other pages would address the team's history only under that name, and then link to the franchise's other articles.--<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanoeguy81_3202.html" title="User:Canoeguy81">Canoeguy81</a> 22:16, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Only the organization of the information will be affected. Either way, the kids will be alright. <b>I do think old-time Expo fans would prefer to have the pages seperate, though.</b> When baseball franchises move to another city and change their name, they do become a different entity. The whole concept of a baseball franchise "moving" is a bit of a lie. They only move in the most technical sense of the word. For all intents and purposes, the old franchise dies, and a new one is built elsewhere using it's bones and ashes. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 13:23, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>That franchises move is not a lie. *ALL* contracts of the Expos are now with the Nats. *ALL* records of the Expos are now with the Nats. *ALL* retired numbers of the Expos are now retired numbers of the Nats.

<li>Then why did they move away from their hometown, their stadium, and their fans? Why did they abandon their name? They even left their <i>country</i>. Players are traded to different teams all the time. The Nationals may have some of the bones and ashes, but the <i>Montreal Expos</i> are dead. The Nationals should just admit it. It's not like many Expo fans are gonna to travel to Washington anyway. It is a sad day for baseball. Now that I think about it, it is clearly better to have these as two seperate pages.

<ul>
<li>There is no call for "special treatment". Every team with a history that moves and changes it's name should get a seperate entry for the previous name. If other teams don't have them, that's only because they haven't been created yet. Even if you don't think the old team is a seperate entity, it still deserves it's own page as a "major chapter" in the history of the current team. (It is not uncommon to split long, detailed histories into multiple pages.) Thus, whatever your personal beliefs about franchise reincarnation, there is no reason to deny this page. Also, merging the pages will create confusion. <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Carter_fefb.html" title="Gary Carter">Gary Carter</a> was an Expo and a Hall of Famer.

<p>As for hockey I am looking at page 101 of the NHL official record book 2005 an it refers to Phoenix Coyotes franchise date as June 22 1979, than transferred to phx July 1 1996.

<li><b>Redirect</b>. It should redirect as all of the other franchise moves do. The fact is, the Expos are NOT a defunct franchise. I think people are getting confused as to what defunct means. Example: The Milwaukee Braves are not defunct. All of their records and everything else transferred to Atlanta along with the team. Folding a team makes it defunct...not moving it. This is a long standing principle. I mean my favorite baseball team, the Milwaukee Brewers, spent one year in Seattle as the Pilots before moving to Milwaukee and yet all of the Pilots records are considered Brewers records. It's the same team. NOT defunct. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 18:00, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. Major League Baseball and the National League regard these as the same franchise, just as they regard the St. Louis Browns and Baltimore Orioles as the same franchise. Officially, the Expos' records now belong to the Nationals. Keep in mind that Hank Aaron is recognized as the Atlanta Braves' career leader in home runs, even though he hit most of them in Milwaukee. I <i>would</i> support an offshoot article on the franchise's years in Montreal, though it shouldn't simply be under the title <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Expos_1ed2.html" title="Montreal Expos">Montreal Expos</a>; perhaps titled History of the Montreal Expos? Suggest moving the existing article to some such title, and then revising the redirects from this current pair to the Nationals rather than the new article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 20:38, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. I think consistency is the most important thing. God knows Wikipedia is not internally consistent, but it is a goal that should be strived for. Given the precedent for other teams which have moved, I think that redirection is a no-brainer. Of course, the case could be made that there exists a precedent for keeping the pages of <i>Canadian</i> teams which are stolen by, er, moved to the US (e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg_Jets_a34d.html" title="Winnipeg Jets">Winnipeg Jets</a> and my beloved <a href="../../../q/u/%C3%A9/Qu%C3%A9bec_Nordiques_747a.html" title="Qu√©bec Nordiques">Qu√©bec Nordiques</a>). However, the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Grizzlies_7f56.html" title="Vancouver Grizzlies">Vancouver Grizzlies</a> are redirected, so it appears that keeping separate pages applies to NHL teams alone. So be it. Keeping the page thus violates consistency. Now, if someone wants to incite a revolution, starting separate pages for <i>all</i> the moved teams, then sign me up. That's not what we're talking about here, however. And I say this as someone who will never, as long as I live, recognize the validity of the Washington Nationals. -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenLocust_30e1.html" title="User:GreenLocust">GreenLocust</a> 21:48, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>can we get a list of thoses who support keeping two pages who are not upset Expo fans.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm pretty much agnostic as to the redirect/keep brouhaha; I see both sides as having valid points. However, I had a thought of my own. What about a "History of baseball in Montr√©al" article? This article could incorporate both the Expos and the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Royals_813f.html" title="Montreal Royals">Montreal Royals</a>, the city's former minor-league team. The Nationals article could have a link to the new Montr√©al baseball history article for those who have a specific interest in Expos history. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDale_Arnett_0a47.html" title="User:Dale Arnett">Dale Arnett</a> 22:09, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> conditionally. Both sides have valid points, but we should be consistent. I think a good policy is redirect for name changes without a location change (Los Angeles/California/Anaheim angels) and city changes without name changes (Brooklyn/LA Dodgers). However, it may be acceptable to have distinct articles for teams which change <b>both</b> cities and names. Until <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Pilots_038f.html" title="Seattle Pilots">Seattle Pilots</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Senators_11ed.html" title="Washington Senators">Washington Senators</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Browns_f5db.html" title="St. Louis Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, etc. have their own article, we should be consistent.

<li>I like this idea. Though I vote for redirect, for the sake of consistency, emotionally I'm with the keepers on this one. It just makes me sad to think that typing in "Montreal Expos" will lead me to the page of the Washington Nationals abomination. Clearly, there a lot of people who feel similarly, and I think this idea is a good compromise between the two camps. Creating a new page for every name change (without a move) would be silly, but I support a separate page for a team identity which no longer exists. If it's done for the Expos, however, it should be done for the rest - all or none. If it can be done for the NHL, why not for MLB? -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenLocust_30e1.html" title="User:GreenLocust">GreenLocust</a> 23:02, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The Expos should have a separate article. Though they are the same franchise, for all purpose the Expos and Nationals are pretty much separate entities.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I was asked to come in here and give my opinion and after reading the above arguments, here it is. If they hadn't changed fan-base, I would certainly vote to redirect (like LAA moving from Anaheim to Los Angeles market (even though not really, what a joke that is) or SD moving to Petco or MIL moving to the NL). I would like to see separate articles for NY Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, Boston Braves, etc <b>unless</b> there isn't much info to put in them in which case they should be footnotes in SF, LAD, and ATL. I think there is enough substance in this case to warrant MON having its own article. I know this is not how the other article are currently done, but this is how <i>I think</i> they should be done. The reason my vote is weak is because I think all the stats/feats/retired numbers/etc should be on the Nats page even though they happened in Montreal, but I'm a little confused on that part. The Expos page should only contain a historical account of the era and it certainly should not have that snazzy franchise box. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikreykja_795a.html" title="User talk:Vikreykja">‚Üí</a><i><a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikreykja_0ecb.html" title="User:Vikreykja">Vik&#160;Reykja</a></i> 23:38, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect eventually</b> - The main concern seems to be that 99% of the Nationals' franchise history is as the Montreal Expos. A decade or two from now, when things are more balanced and the "Expos" are unknown to a new generation of baseball fans, the Expos history should be folded into the Nationals history, since it IS the Nationals history. If Wikipedia had been founded in 1957, we'd be hearing a chorus of arguments in favor of keeping team articles at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Dodgers_1ffe.html" title="Brooklyn Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> rather than their new California locations. Those arguments would have had some weight then. Now, fifty years later, they make more sense as part of the franchise history incorporated into the article with the franchise's current name. I think it should be redirected now, but people's sentimental feelings seem to be prohibiting that. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinesweeper_5696.html" title="User:Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> 06:36, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - precedent can and should be overturned when the situation warrants. The Expos are one of the first teams to move since the inception of wikipedia, and hence have a good article, unlike the dodgers and others. Many more people have an interest in it than in those older teams, hence the article. I guarantee that if wikipedia had been around 50 years ago those others would have articles as well. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine981_72a6.html" title="User:Peregrine981">Peregrine981</a> 12:13, May 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes but the "owners" of the Expos in 04 are the same as the "owners" of Nats in 05.

<p><b>Keep</b></p>
<p><i><b>I think that it is too soon to be making this decision.</b></i></p>
<p>Right now the Nationals are claiming the history of the Expos, just as the Minnesota Twins claim the history of the first incarnation of the Washington Senators and the Texas Rangers claim the history of the second incarnation of the Washington Senators. But now that Washington has a team, you see people like Frank Howard, who played for the Senators, participating in Nationals events. I think that eventually, the fans in Washington, DC, will want the Senators history, and since the Twins and the Rangers are not really doing anything with the Senators history, I think that having a real, live baseball team in DC will eventually lead to the Washington franchise getting back the Senators' history, in a way that is different from franchises that existed for one year or in the 19th century. The DC fans undoubtedly care more about the Senators than about the Expos and I think the Expos history will eventually end up like Youppi!, the Expos mascot, the rights to which has been bought by a Canadian company. Let what was done in Montreal stay in Montreal, and what was done in Washington, DC, stay in Washington, DC. - --Mretalli 00:27, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>To say there is enough content to support two pages is an understatement. The Montreal Expos existed as a successful Major League Baseball franchise for 36 seasons. The 2005 Washington Nationals are both a new team and a very very old team. Many people forget that the first incarnation of the Washington Senators, the team that eventually moved to Minnesota, was originally called the Washington Nationals. The Washington Nationals won the 1924 World Series. The name has also been traced as far back as the Civil War when the Washington Nationals baseball club was defeated by a team from the 71st New York Regiment in a game played on the Ellipse in Washington, DC on July 2, 1861. To categorize the 2005 Washington Nationals as a mere extension of the Montreal Expos is to deny both cities their unique places in the history of Baseball. Rubennyc 01:38, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Washington Nationals in this incarnation are the same team as the Expos. Therefore, this is this Washington Nationals' 37th season. The other Washington teams were different franchises. They have nothing to do with this Washington Nationals. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 01:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"this is this Washington Nationals' 37th season" -- What a charming and bizarre fiction. Two years ago, there was no such thing as the Washington nationals, and now they are in their 37th season. MLB may decide that, for its own record-keeping purposes, it is going to create fictions like this, but that doesn't mean that Wikipedia has to parallel that. Professional sports teams exist because of fans. No fans - no money - no team. The Expos fans (and I am not one) are, for the most part, not the Nats' fans. )That was the problem - there weren't enough of them. If that continues in Washington, then the team will soon enough become the San Jose Chili Fingers or something like that. In the minds of most people, the two teams are separate entities. there is no harm then in having two articles that are linked to each other and that indicate the connection (including MLB's view of the situation) between the two teams. Wikipedia need not follow the dictates of MLB. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 22:19, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't understand. It is the same franchise. For example, the Yankees are in their 105th year - even though the first two years were played in BALTIMORE! The Twins are in their 105th year, even though the first 60 years were played in WASHINGTON! The Nats and the Expos are the same franchise - the same contracts - the same payrolls - the same records - the same retired numbers - the same minor league affiliates - the same spring training facility - the same retired numbers. And this is not some unique situation designed just for the Nat/Expos. The exact same carry over has happened dozens of times in MLB, starting over 100 years ago. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 22:34, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

The fans and team good will do not carry over to any great extent, and it isn't like this happens in MLB often enough that keeping separate articles becomes problematic. Obviously the Expos article will conclude by saying that the team became the Nationals, and the Nationals team will begin by saying the team was formerly the Expos, and I don't see why that's a problem.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Resources concerned primarily by statistics have absolutely no reason to maintain an Expos page. The teams in Washington and Montr√©al are continuous. However, Wikipedia should be much more than a sports almanac listing team records. It should be a record of the culture of the organisation far beyond the simple legalistic definition of the organisation. Within a couple of years the Washington Nationals will have nothing to do with the Montr√©al Expos beyond the dusty old record books. I doubt if many Montr√©al fans will follow Washington particularly avidly. Nor will Washington fans look back fondly on the days in Montr√©al. In a strict sense their histories are the same, but in a human sense they are completely and totally different.</li>
</ul>
<p>One example of this, the old Ottawa Senators of the early 20th century, including their records and Stanely Cups, are claimed by the modern franchise (at least they hang their banners) even though, in a legal sense, the two organisations have nothing whatsoever to do with one another.

<p><b>STRONG KEEP FOR 50 YEARS. Then, maybe.</b></p>
<p>Spare me the personal attacks and one line throaway quips which are meaningless in this encyclopedia context. If you have a strong essay stating your position that would be welcome and in line with the policies of Wikipedia. If you cannot do so, please skip. Don't bother chopping up my essay into parsed segments and then twisting the meaning into your favor. This is not the John Stewart Show. Thank you.</p>
<p>Dear Wikipedians,</p>
<p>I have lived in both the Western U.S., Montreal and the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. I have worked for the Senate in the legal arena in D.C. I am privileged to have a unique view of this subject. More importantly, I would like too see Wikipedia become an encyclopedia of record.</p>
<p>The very nature of an encyclopedia is at issue here, in my humble opinion. I grew up a big fan of encyclopedia of various kinds.</p>
<p>1. The socio-economic-cultural reasons of each sports franchises are separate and distinct. Here, we have the 1st major professional international franchise in another language and culture. The city was so unique that Branch Rickey decided to send Jackie Robinson to Montreal in 1947 to break the colour barrier.</p>
<pre>
Why? Bucky Rogers, Hall of Famer from the legendary Negro League, Kansas City Monarchs, said of the French city "it was cosmopolitan. He couldn't play in Alabama." To this day, Mrs. Robinson recalls the kindness of her white French neighbours, who were concerned over her pregancy. You can find transcripts of this. 
</pre>
<p>2. Moreover, the rise and fall of the Expos have nothing to with the rise and falls of the Washington Senators either emotionally nor factually nor the Nationals in the future. D.C. has its own rich history of baseball. Montreal's date back to 1910 in minor league professional circles. Former Prime Minister Trudeau's father owned such a team.</p>
<p>3. This entry however plays pivotal role in the history of Major League Baseball during the turn of 21th century. The historical judgment of this commissioner has yet to be settled and judged well into the next 50 years. Think of the 1919 Black Sox and the creation of a new commissioner. Commissioner Selig's legacy is rife with contraversies from the 1994 stike, to the contraction of the small market teams, to a Congressionally "mandated" or "pressured" steroid policy which threatens to make home-run records statistically meaningless. The sports has fallen from America's pastime to maybe third pastime behind the NFL and maybe the NBA. The Expos is also part of his legacy, like it or not.</p>
<p>MLB wants to sell this franchise's assets. The Expos are now legally dissolved as a company or inactive. MLB's future sale of the Nationals to an owner and his deal with Peter Angelos are also part of that history. However, they are separate from its Montreal existence. <b>Any redirection into Washington would curtail and snuff out any historical analysis of Selig's actions and his job as commissioner. This would make Wikipedia less useful for such an historical examination. It would, however, be very useful in finding a buyer with deep pockets. In other words the very nature of an encyclopedia would be in part sacrificed at the altar of greed and profit completely unrelated to Wikipedia.</b><i>Italic text</i></p>
<p>For example, a month ago, I added a section about the 2003 "conflict of interests" between the Expos and its 29 owners. Did they really want the franchise to win the Wild Card over one of the non-MLB owned teams ? Now just a few days ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer had an article over the 2003 lack of September call-ups. MLB and the owners did not allow the calling up on minor leagues in its wild card race. This legacy is still being questioned. I like to think if a writer were to just glance at the Wikipedia, a writer would be inspired to examine an issue or two. Did the writer do so? We may never know. But the resource would be there for anyone either new or experienced in any field of endeavor without prejudice. The Vietnam War,ended in 1973, and is still being discussed and argued even as the <i>sub rosa</i> issue of the 2003 U.S. election ( recall "Swift Boat", CBS' and Bush 's war record in Vietnam).</p>
<p>4. MLB's position is clear. They have erased and expunged most if not all references to the Montreal franchise. If you go to RFK, there will be no Expos logos. The announcer, Elliott Price, who had some 14 years of experience and knowledge of the Expos was let go, the mascot replaced and the logo shelved. The staff replaced by and large. And news reports say the former Expos players, bless their souls, "have moved on".</p>
<p>A real encylopedia should remain free and independant and not react instinctively to short-term commercial or emotional interests. <i><b>In this same vein, the Nationals should have a separate entry into the creation of its team and the successes and problems with such an association. Any such infringement of such analyses would also short-change that team. There should be entries on the Mayor's role, the burgeoning middle class and suburbs and the dissenting voices from the urban core. The tv deal etc...(BTW, I also enjoyed the time I lived in DC.) Information is power. That is the function of a real encyclopedia. The lack of information is control by those who have the means of creation, production and distribution. The very nature of the encylopedia is at stake here in my opinion. I don‚Äôt think dissenting Wikidpedians really has this in mind but the results are the same. There are whole governments and societies that run away from their pasts. Japan is running away from its World War II atrocities. While China is running away and commiting genocide of its minorities. In fact, North America wishes to forget the decimation of its aborinals. Wikipedia should not fall under this same historical amnesia. I'm not saying that MLB is a corrupt government but it is a private, self-interested, multi-billionaire dollar company or if you wish a "corporate welfare collector". And it is rife with inequities between small teams and big teams. Nevertheless, Wikipedia's independance from those market forces, MLB's "leadership" and its Commissioner Selig's plans or any other influences is crucial.</b></i>Keeping this entry and mentioning the Nationals in this concluson is one important step towards that scholastic neutrality.</p>

<p>This is a collection of some strange stories that, as of the time I am writing this, involve chickens and a sausage.

<li><b>Keep</b>- the author of the infamous article here - admittedly it needs some work - but I don't see why with some work it can't evolve into something more interesting and useful. Jumping on the article within seconds of its creation doesn't really give it much of a change to breath and have exposure to the Wiki community who will no doubt be able to expand on it. The subject of the bizarre - which at the moment isn't represented is a bona fide subject and could do with some exposure. The topic is no more ridiculous than many of the other unusual articles on WIki especially as on the Unusual articles section.

<li>This isn't an encyclopaedia article, it's a collection of news summaries (with a reference to <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_the_headless_chicken.html" title="Mike the headless chicken">Mike the headless chicken</a> added for flavour). Maybe there's an encyclopaedia article to be had on <i>the bizarre</i> as a concept, although I suspect that it will be tremendously difficult to pin down what the concept actually is.

As it stands, this is just <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Wackynews" class="extiw" title="wikinews:Category:Wackynews">Wackynews</a> stories in the encyclopaedia, rather than in the newspaper where they belong.

<li>From your article here, it looks like <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Wackynews" class="extiw" title="wikinews:Category:Wackynews">Wackynews</a> will be right up your street. As for the latter question: <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_the_Headless_Chicken_e970.html" title="Mike the Headless Chicken">Mike the Headless Chicken</a>, which you've done a lot of work on, <i>is already listed in <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a></i>, and <i>hasn't</i> been deleted.

<p><s>**Firstly, the article contains several factual inaccuracies, for example, in India, collectivization of the farm sector was never introduced as the term is understood in the context of former USSR. Please also note the concluding sentence of this article: ‚ÄúIn Soviet Union, Stalin made himself all powerful and honored himself by naming Stalingrad after himself during his lifetime. In India, Jawaharlal Nehru came under criticism for the proposal to name Jawaharlal Nehru University after himself during his lifetime.‚Äù It is interesting to note that Jawahar Lal Nehru has died on 27th May, 1964(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru</a>) where as Jawahar Lal University (JNU) was opened in early 70s (<a href="http://www.jnu.ac.in/main.asp?sendval=Introduction" class="external free" title="http://www.jnu.ac.in/main.asp?sendval=Introduction" rel="nofollow">http://www.jnu.ac.in/main.asp?sendval=Introduction</a>)</s><s>**Secondly, comparison between <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_c40c.html" title="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> is highly absurd ‚Äì Nehru led a democratically elected government of India, whereas Joseph Stalin led a centrally controlled economy.</s> <s>**Thirdly, the term Nehruvian-Stalinism has been used only in two articles in the wikipedia, one in this article, and then in another article <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawahar_Lal_Nehru_4acc.html" title="Jawahar Lal Nehru">Jawahar Lal Nehru</a>. The context in which the term Nehruvian-Stalinism has been used in the article <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_c40c.html" title="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> smacks of extreme misinformation and biased understanding of the reality of time, when Nehru lived and managed the affairs of India. I presume good faith on behalf of the creator of the article Nehruvian-Stalinism, but the possibility of using the wikipedia to float the term cannot be ruled out, though I am not sure of this, except that a pattern in the use of the term Nehruvian-Stalinism is visible in both the articles.</s> <s>**Fourthly, <i>wikipedia is neither an experiment in anarchy</i> nor <i>it is an experiment in democracy</i>; it is not a place to write about and float new ideas, it is an encyclopedia and not a place for <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo.html" title="Pseudo">pseudo</a>-academicians to circulate their dogmas.</s> <s>**Fifthly, as a relatively new wikipedian, I may be inexperienced, but I simply marvel at the conceited views of some anonymous editors who write article like this, as well as pick up unnecessary arguments - specimen of which one can find on the Talk page of article <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawahar_Lal_Nehru_4acc.html" title="Jawahar Lal Nehru">Jawahar Lal Nehru</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jawaharlal_Nehru" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jawaharlal_Nehru" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jawaharlal_Nehru</a>) - the article, where the term Nehruvian-Stalinism finds mention twice.</s></p>
<p>All above comments <s>are</s> were without hurting anyone‚Äôs feeling and anyone's academic credentials - my comments have been made with an intention to make wikipedia a reliable online encyclopedia. My personal thanks to all above wikipedians, to all other fellow wikipedians, particularly <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">User:Pjacobi</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">User:Megan1967</a> for their initiative in this matter to maintain the quality of wikipedia.--<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 16:56, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC) (comments crossed by me in view of certain wiki-users's feeling that I had some vendetta, etc. etc. <b>My vote for Delete stands</b> --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 09:27, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC))</p>

<li>I have seen some more comments which have appeared after my comments above. It looks fine that the term has created a lot of attention among wikipedia users and I feel very nice that some of them have just registered and come to this page to register their VOTE for KEEP. It reminds me of capturing the polling booth, which happens sometimes, when same person may be voting again and again - this is a general comment of the reality of situation, and not personal comments. I welcome all new comers who registered and did their first ever edit on wikipedia for this issue. Cheers! I also feel the correct and neutral term would be, may be "Nehruvian socialism" or something like that - but, I am stepping aside so that some one with better credentials may write a better article. I am also sure that all those who have come here in support of the term Nehruvian-Stalinism to contribute some inputs to improve the article, if they have time and the inclination. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 07:18, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - I am shocked at the callous manner in which people bring their politics to the table. This article is accurate and as an Indologist, I can testify that India is an unfortunate country. It is true that India has imposed a Stalinist economy complete with a Planning Commission and the term "commanding heights" is very accurate. My jaw dropped at people doing a web search to determine whether a term is legitimate. Nehruvian-Stalinism is a common term in economics. In fact, many indian economists of the 1960s and 1970s were proud to identify themselves as such! Are we now doubting the reports of Transparency International that considers India to be a corrupt country? What about all the poverty? You do injustice to millions of people who have suffered under the system by deleting an article that is very accurate and to the point. Deletion of this article would be similar to giving in to a lynch-mob that supports Communism. Victoria Primus</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Victoria here again - Another point is that collectivization *was* introduced in India in the 1950s. It failed and after the war against China, the people of India trashed it as a Chinese method and gave it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also add that the Congress Party (party of Jawaharlal Nehru) has now formed a government in India with the Communists! ************No way! Do not DELETE******** This word is very much in use by the people in the know! The communists are in control in India are fast moving towards stalinism by finding and obliterating anything that shows them poor light......Wikipedia being a distinguished source of information, should be secular in nature and not give into any political lobbying.

<li><b>Do not delete</b>. I did a Google search too and it seems to have sufficient use to justify its inclusion in wikipedia. As a frequent visitor to India, I have been struck by the personality cult of Nehru there too, very Soviet style.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The argument that the existence of a factual inaccuracy should be grounds to delete the article goes against the spirit of Wikipedia. You just have to edit the article and remove the factual inaccuracy. Haing said that, I have noticed that a lot of internet users belong to the young crowd and do not know much of the cold war era. The article is factually correct and even the point about Jawaharlal Nehru University is correct. The proposal came about in early 60s and it was passed in parliament soon after Nehru's death and then the foundation stone was laid and it took a few years to build it. No university is built overnight.</li>

In a 6000-word report to the AICC, on relinquishing office as Congress President, Mr. Nehru said the establishment of a socialistic pattern of society had been implicit all along in the Congress objective and "it is right that we should make this perfectly clear now and keep this picture in view at all stages of our planning.</b></p>
<p>Economically, Indian economy is still Stalinist in nature. Why are we trying to cover this up? Wikipedia should not be covering up stuff, but should propagate insights from experts wherever possible.

From the deletion policy page, I also see that you can sign with four ~ (tildes) places next to each other. Victoria Primus 05:14, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't know what all this fuss is about. The original article is highly informative, accurate and factual. Anyone who has lived in India or experienced it first-hand would attest to this. Besides being chummy with Josef Stalin, Nehru did copy a lot of things from the Soviet model: central planning, 5-year plans, large dams, etc. Even waiting periods for telephone connections and ration shops are direct 'inspirations' from USSR. I am afraid somebody with a political axe to grind is out to delete this article, their action is in the true spirit of Communism: that is, muffle all dissenting voices.

<li>Dear Eersj welcome to wikipedia - I am sure that the wikipedia community will benefit from your other edits also, particulary on Indian economy of Nehru's time - it appears that you have very good personal experience of those time. By the way, please improve the present article to conform to wiki-standard, it is my personal appeal to you. By the way, it may be other way round - somebody with a political axe to grind is out to keep this article -you are sure of your opinion, but I am not: because I beleive that several persons have registered in a day or two to vote to keep this article for academic reasons, and not for political reasons. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 07:33, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

In a country with millions of very poor people, some suffering from malnutrition, the loss of a few hundred dollars in annual income meant far more than it would have meant to the average American.</p>
<p>Like so many socialistic policies around the world, those in India were not relaxed or ended because of better understanding but because of bitter experience. When these policies had the Indian government on the verge of bankruptcy, its leaders had no choice but to make fundamental changes in the economy, in order to qualify for help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>

<p>Contrary to what the original poster claims, this article and the term "Nehruvian-Stalinism" is an excellent summary of an important period in world history. There is absolutely no insignifance (sic) about this article. I appeal to Wikipedia not to cravenly cave in to these bullies. Drjayaraman 05:53, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Before it is held against me as a way to dilute my vote -- yes this is my first edit. But that does not mean I do not understand <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>. Similarities between Nehruism and Stalinism have always been a hot topic of discussion in Indian economics arena and this term has been standardised to refer to this system. This term is gaining usage on internet and Wikipedia is a perfect reference to explain what the meaning and connotation of Nehruvian-Stalinism is for the uninitiated. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAalu.paneer_6f9d.html" title="User:Aalu.paneer">Aalu.paneer</a>

Your first edit on this site was to a deletion discussion, which is often considered suspicious due to the amount of abuse that has been committed on past discussions of this nature. By the way, deletion is not a straight vote; it is an attempt to reach consensus. I'm curious as to how you came across Wikipedia, and in particular, how you came across this deletion discussion.

<li>All I can say is that is not my first edit on Wikipedia (although first under an ID). I understand the attempt at reaching concesus via discussion and that is why so many have joined it. The idea of cooling off for a while and then coming back sounds good. Though it seems the page has already been deleted. Sadly, Wikipedia seems to be turning into yabb where a archive loses out to editor's politics!

<p><b>Keep</b> - This term refers to a number of blunders committed by Nehru, which caused a lot of famines, unemployment, wide-scale poverty, desertification of a lot of rural villages with no water for drinking and state monopoly in a number of industries. These blunders are the reasons why there is a huge migration of people from rural villages and towns towards cities, where the state created all the new jobs. In a way, this causes the creation of slums in most of the major cities, also leading to a lot of crime and anti-social behaviour. Indian media is controlled by a lot of communists and monority communities with their own <i>vested interests</i> in not letting the masses know about the ill effects of the state planning and the <i><b>licence-permit-quota-raj</b></i> and the creation of personality based politics. This is the reason why the Nehruvian-Stalinism term is not so widely referenced in a number of web sites and publications. By deleting this article, wikipedia will inadvertently side with these Vested Interests and endanger the suppression of the causes of millions of indians are still poor, from being popularised with the Indian masses. Only when the people know what they are suffering from, can they think and find a solution on how to eradicate those diseases that affect them and return to good health, literally, economically and philosophically. -- ksriram</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. However, there is a need for balance and a more nuanced analysis to get beyond the usual Left-Right politics (which, imo is not enough to understand India). It is important that this article include concepts such as <b>modernization</b> &amp; <b>industrialization</b> since these are unquestionably the most powerful &amp; irresitable drivers of global societal change in the past 500 years; these concepts is crucial to understanding independent india since is is undeniable that indian modernization started in earnest post colonialism. Next, this article needs to explore how various societies/ civilizations around the world navigated through and coped with modernization/ industrialization. For example, Western Europe's modernization is associated with colonialism/ imperialism, massive migration to and subsequent genocide in the new world, slavery, apartheid, world wars, capitalist control economies. By contrast, Eastern Europe &amp; China did not have the luxury or ability for large scale outbound emigrations, colonialism, imperialism etc. Therefore, in contrast to Western Europe, Eastern Europe and china turned inwards, adopted communism and ended up genociding their own people (those deemed unfit for modernization by some criteria). India's path to modernization was different (one that wanted every Indian to get on the modernization train, even if it meant that any indian could set up a paan shop in a hole in the wall or become a rickshaw puller) &amp; Nehru should be seen as someone who represents a change agent for the modernization of india. If these changes cannot be made, then my suggestion would be to <b>delete</b> the article.

<li><b>Note a vote, but a humble observation.</b> I have already voted above. I have been posting anonymously on Wikipedia for a long time, and from multiple IP addresses (as I travel a lot). This is the first time I have seen such a remarkable tussle about deleting an article. To the extent that I felt some pressure to create an id just so that I would be taken seriously here (although my personal preference would be to remain anonymous). If I were to summarize what I see here, it seems as though editor Bhadani has a clear personal axe to grind, for reasons that are not clear to me. A number of other responsible editors seem to have got caught up in what looks like an orchestrated campaign by Bhadani, clues to which show up in his fulsome thanks and praise of various editors who support his perspective. In response to this, it looks like a number of editors with the opposite perspective have jumped in, perhaps as first-time voters. Both sides are in the wrong. In other words, this looks like one of those sad tales of voting fraud you hear about in oh... India, the US (remember 'hanging chads'?), etc. I think the whole voting process has been compromised here. I would suggest a cooling-off period and a deferral of this vote. Why on earth is this such an earth-shakingly important issue? Socialism, Stalinism, Leninism, Maoism, all of them have been shown to be frauds. All good for marketing purposes, but not for reality.

<li>By the way, I was seventh to vote for delete - before me all have voted for delete. After, me most of the users have voted for Keep, only few have voted for delete: the normal conclusion should be, may be, my delete created more votes for keeps. I also do agree that a cooling period should be there so that the issue can be resolved in keeping with the highest wiki traditions. I can assure every one that I donot have any axe to grind. My edits numbering around 900 plus within five weeks may be seen to verify my inclinations. As regards travelling job -for years, I have been travelling also. Do travelling folks donot keep email IDs? What is wrong if one keeps a Wiki ID as well? To be nice to fellow wikipedians - is a wiki tradition, I have praised someone when there was not even a single keep vote, so that remark is out of context, perhaps. I have also welcomed all other new comers, who at least took the trouble to register to vote here. Bye and thanks.

<li>As the criteria for deletion in CfD is weaker for empty categories whose information has laready been put elsewhere, if it passes deletion on VfD and is empty, it can be speedy deleted from Cfd.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

Not only that, but this article is poorly written and unencyclopedic in tone and form. <b>"WORD OF WARNING! Many of these hacks will contain malware, steal your cd keys, passwords, credit card information, abuse your webcam and destroy your computer! Anti-virus software cannot protect you from this!

<li><b>Keep</b> I am well aware of this. The problem is that an article like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_Counter-Strike_d6ff.html" title="Cheating in Counter-Strike">Cheating in Counter-Strike</a> tends to attract kiddies. The article is merely there to channel the urges of the kiddies into something productive, instead of vandalizing the main article with links. Leave it, eventually it'll become something better looking than this current, ugly linkspam. I don't like it either but I prefer this over having people (kiddies) lay waste on the main article.

<li>While I understand what you're saying, I'm not sure that is a valid reason for keeping this article. It seems to me a bit too much like capitulating to vandals. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 21:31, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> (predictably, I'm sure, since I nominated). Fear of vandalism on the main article is a poor justification for keeping a non-notable offshoot written in a wholly unencyclopedic manner.

<li>I understand that the article isn't a nice sight, but I'm pretty sure it can be made to look more encyclopedic and professional if I / someone else finds time to update it. Originally someone updated the main article with this content, and I didn't want to erase it since somebody told me he found it valuable. On the other hand, it already has been vandalized, which probably took off some destructive energy from the main article? The section vandalized is interesting: Most cheaters don't realize the most common reason public cheats are released are to get passwords. Dabljuh 20:39, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not supposed to. Representing the typical is the job of general articles. An article on American High Schools could contain such information, or an article on American eduction could. Furthermore, unremarkable schools could be mentioned on a town page or even perhaps a school district page. It is just plain silly to claim that not having an article on every single school in the world would mean that no information on typical schools could exist on wikipedia.

<li>In my opinion, a better parallel is the inclusion of every city, town, village and Census Designated Place on Wikipedia. There are far more of those than there are high schools, plus there is no debate about whether <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Cave%2C_Texas_0f38.html" title="Bee Cave, Texas">Bee Cave, Texas</a> is notable.

<li>If people are so obsessed with notability then just merge the damn high school page into the local town page. Towns are unquestionably notable, and high schools are unquestionably significant in terms of their local town. However, this page has so much information that it deserves it's own page as a "subpage" of the city of Lakewood. So after you merge it, you are gonna have to unmerge it.&#160;:-) In other words, just keep the page. Incidentally, I think I've just proven the inherent significance of any school page that is larger then a stub. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 19:06, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Topic is notable: data interesting (because having more than 50% minorities means well, the majority isn't really present, is it?) How do you expect it to grow out of non notability if you keep pressing to delete it? It has the capacity to grow out of non notability. Plus, I disagree with the notion that it is not distinguished from the countless other schools around the world, because you realise, that in China, the student mindset would be different, there is no reduced lunch, the syllabus would be different, or in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, having much more different sets of characteristics than US schools, or even within the US itself. If I made an article about some relatively unknown species just discovered in the Amazon Rainforest, much of detail yet to be discovered, its report printed in a small section of some scientific journal among thousands of others, in the same family as another species, are you what, going to delete it for having non notable information? Even before the article has a chance to evolve?...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yet according to the Tree of Life project, Wikipedia doesn't mind documenting each and every species. Because notability can be established, can become notable research information, when networked, overviewed in conjunction with other articles, if you let it live. Its genome would be different, there would be lessons to learn, no matter how small, and then its important for say, genetic statistics, research, confirmation, checking for codon exceptions, etc. In the same way, schools are an important part of demographics, no matter how non notable it is now. Would you object to Wikipedia storing the genome (taken from DNA databases) of every species if it had people bothered? Isn't the record of such evolution of the individual nucleotides and its analyses valuable, even though it seems small? Should we omit a point from a circle in our mathematical drawings because its only one point out of an infinite number? Yet we don't. Why then object to having this article exist for demographical purposes? The NPOV problems can be fixed. It has a chance to be proliferate into something of note. Why do have articles every day of the year, even into the future, or documentation of every possible enzyme there is in life? Isn't it possible that a string of non notable things can be used in analysis into something of note? And isn't it true that the patterns can be so diverse they need their own individual articles? Isn't it possible, that gasp, something event might happen that links two relatively minor things into a big one? And if the article existed beforehand, it would have been easier to correlate when something did happen. One article about a seemingly insignificant thing, when linked and correlated with other articles to show similar concepts, or trends, patterns, for cross reference and such, then extending this depth to possibly many others because of the links? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:46, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Amen. This article enhances the information value of every page that links to it, and every page that will link to it in the future. I think that: if a topic is a common link between two or more notable topics, then that topic becomes notable as a result of it's association with those topics, and that a page should probably exist for that mutually shared topic. Ergo, if two significant people go to a school, then that school becomes notable as a common link, a shared bond. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 08:31, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In Australia the brand and all models vanished from the new car market at the end of 2004, but there are still plenty of Daewoo Nubiras on the road here, while the only Chevs of any sort are personal imports, unlikely for this model IMO.

<li>Daewoo (and Chevrolet) don't sell all models in all markets.

<dd>Comment: It seems to me that, despite some mentions of other markets, this article is now very US-centric. This model was originally sold as a Daewoo, worldwide, and in some markets has no other name. The Daewoo factory remains its source, while the Chevrolet connection is pure badging. IMO, for the article to now be headed by the current US model name is embarrassing, and I would move it back. If the Chevrolet model deserves its own article, write one. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 21:14, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Chevrolet Nubira</i> is not an US name (<i>Suzuki Forenza</i> is), and I wouldn't want to see dozen one-string articles of <i>XXX is what Daewoo Nubira is called in YYY</i> pattern when Daewoo brand is dropped everywhere but Korea. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 16:08, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Of course not. The correct thing is to have redirects from any other significant names for the model. And if it's also still called a <i>Daewoo</i> in Korea, ISTM even more that this is the best name for the article, but see <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7EChevrolet_Nubira_45be.html" title="Talk:Chevrolet Nubira">talk:Chevrolet Nubira</a>.

<li>Isn't that like writing an article about how many believe there was a second JFK gunman? You see my point. Ideally this wouldn't exist even when rewritten. Him being called the Antichrist is a matter of opinion (although not as narrow and reduced as a truly POV article by one or two people is) but similarly it's potentially a <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:WWIN">crysal-ball</a> article. By the time we truly find out if he's the Antichrist or not, the world will have fallen into chaos as the Four Horsemen ride across the battlefields etc. by which point Wikipedia won't exactly be very important any more. Or if he dies first. Whichever. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 12:47, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>One other possibility is to merge into a "List of famous people whose names add up to 666" or some such thing. Individually, 50+ famous Jewish-descended people could have their names coincidentally add up to 666, and I don't think each and every one deserves his (or her, let's not be sexist here, Jesus might return as a Jessica!) own article. Heck, people *still* think <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissinger.html" title="Kissinger">Kissinger</a>'s the Antichrist, and yet the Bible says that the Antichrist will "emerge", indicating that before that point he is an unknown/non-noteworthy.

<li><b>weak keep</b> -- the article was <i>meant</i> as a neutral portrayal of an insane belief, and it can do that job still.

The question is not, is the belief insane, but is it notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The English town is hardly more notable than the heraldic depiction of an African. Perhaps <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackamoor.html" title="Blackamoor">blackamoor</a> should be a disambig page. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 17:04, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I felt a little guilty about removing the one sentence about Sardinia from here. So I went and expanded <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maure.html" title="Maure">Maure</a> from sources. It turns out that there's quite a bit to say about the heraldic figure. So whilst what you say might be true, it's not as damning as you may have thought. ‚ò∫ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:28, 2005 Apr 22 (UTC)</li>

(BTW, I get 45 Google hits for the exact phrase <i>"melsondorph the powerful"</i>. Some search options will alter the total number.

<li>Verifiability? You verified it yourself-- there's a newspaper article about it! We can have a Wiki page for Bart McQueary, who few people outside of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, have heard about, just because he sucks up to Fred Phelps, yet a band that has performed at festivals in such large cities as Tulsa and Oklahoma City is ineligible?

<li>By the way, what makes something like Grand Theftendo eligible but not this group? They have newspaper articles. They have albums. Just because people at Wiki haven't heard of them, that makes them ineligible? Isn't that a bit counter-productive?
