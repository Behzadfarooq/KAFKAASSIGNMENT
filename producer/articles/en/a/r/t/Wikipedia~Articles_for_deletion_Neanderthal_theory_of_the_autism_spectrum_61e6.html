<li>It will not break Wikipedia policy. If I reintroduce an article that cannot be considered original research, because it is published in a peer-reviewed journal, it cannot be deleted or speedy deleted. I suggest you familiarize yourself with WP policy. Besides, the decision to launch a new AfD on this article only two weeks after the first one was closed, clearly is a violation of policy. Somebody that is good at statistics probably can confirm that if you AfD an article every three weeks, it will inevitably be deleted sooner or later. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:58, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep:</b></s> This article is in need of a massive rewrite (which I'm just gearing up to start on), but despite it's scant scientific weight there's 650 results for a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neanderthal+theory%22+autism&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neanderthal+theory%22+autism&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">google search for "neanderthal theory" and "autism"</a> (a rather unlikely combination outside the context of this theory).

<li>It is likely not. Most of the links that FCYTravis deleted a couple of days ago were independent sources. Also, there are two distinct web-pages about it, and a number of indepedent articles. The whole concept of "aliens" and the "wrong planet" site, aspergia has associations with this theory --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ninety-nine percent of those results have absolutely nothing to do with any purported theory. Get past the first two pages of search results and Neanderthal and autism are common enough words that they'll pop up in a search like this: "Democrats.com Archive: Bill Frist Frist is a Prime Suspect in Autism Lawsuit Exemption for Eli Lilly ...

<li>I think not. On the 9:th page (of 9730 for autism neanderthal on yahoo), I found Neanderthal - free encyclopedia, Wrongplanet.net, <a href="http://www.masterliness.com/a/Aspies.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.masterliness.com/a/Aspies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.masterliness.com/a/Aspies.htm</a> .

</li>
<li>Yes, now please look closer at your results Laura - the first result from google is what looks like a mailing list thread, with neanderthal first being mentioned by "Leif Ekblad ", a.k.a. Rdos, a.k.a. the creator of this "theory". Pretty much every site there is either something like this or a wikipedia mirror. This has been a travesty on wikipedia for a while now and it needs to go.

<li>What Ryan means is that he is defending the non-NPOV in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article. At the talk page I've challenged why historical and illogical autism theories are still kept there. I've also challenged why the opinion of many people in the autistic community has been placed in the sociology section, and isn't mentioned at all in central parts like causes, models etc. Obviously, Ryan wants this article to go so he can continue the POV in the autism article without any challenges. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 09:26, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That sounds more like it. 650 results, most of which are Wikimirrors with this guy's personal Web page link everywhere. It boils down to this: there is not a single shred of actual scientific research that the author can present to support his purported theory. One man's original research, no matter how well-intentioned, is not encyclopedic and so does not belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As stated by <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> when this this list was presented in the previous AFD discussion, this is a very misleading set of links. Of those 10 sites: 5 are bare link directories that simply link to your rdos.net web page, 1 is non-existent page, 1 is a web log posting that comments upon a restatement of your rdos.net web page but does not provide any real scientific peer review of the hypothesis, 1 makes no mention of autism at all, and 1 mentions the hypothesis tangentially in a footnote and similarly provides no peer review. Only 1 site even touches upon Neanderthals and autism directly, and even then does not propound the hypothesis described in the article under discussion here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:02, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>In that case a bad example. The article clearly doesn't agree with the stereotypical picture of Neanderthals. It in fact sees Neanderthals as superior to modern humans on various accounts.

<li>The social system is only privileged if there is <i>something it can spread</i>. Innovations and creativity is the domain of Neanderthals and autistics. Without these traits, 'modern humans' wouldn't be very modern at all. So, with your reasoning, all the social types would also be deficient in innovative &amp; persistence abilities, no?

<li><b>Delete</b>. See also my comments on the article’s talkpage. As far as Wikipedia protocol goes: this is classic OR, and sets a dangerous precedent: one passionate individual attempting to use Wikipedia and its various mirrors, and private newsgroups, in order to create an illusory buzz about a personal theory. This theory is unknown in the scientific community, it is unknown to anyone who has not come across Rdos' own writing on the topic here on Wikipedia, on his webpage or on newsgroups. Rdos has all but admitted that he is trying to use wikipedia to propogate his personal theory. Perhaps he hopes that if he continues stirring things up on wikipedia and the mirrors, his theory will no longer be unknown. If Rdos can cite the buzz he himself has created as support for his claim that this is a significant theory, what's to stop any other devoted individual from promoting their pet theory in likewise fashion? Also please note that at the same time Rdos has been attempting to eliminate a well-established theory on Autism that he personally disagrees with; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sensory_Integration_Dysfunction_f2e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sensory Integration Dysfunction">Rdos’ RfD for Sensory Integration Dysfunction</a>, and his attempted changes to the main article on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a>.

<li>So Sensory Integration Disorder is a well established theory? Among whom, and who supports it? In the VfD discussion nobody could prove it was "well-established". It wasn't part of DSM, it had no support in MEDLINE and so on. It did have some backing up in a book by a professional. However, the question is if we should accept that professionals with a clear agenda to make money on drugs, treatments and group-homes should be allowed to monopolize the truhth about autism? --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:41, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Given the substantial amount of discussion and acceptance of the Neanderthal theory (especially within the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_community.html" title="Autism community">autism community</a>), it is impossible to conclude the article is irrelevant or unworthy. The real question begging to be answered here is just why is there so much visceral antipathy toward the subject? Perhaps it is because, for generations, the term Neanderthal has been used deliberately (often by the media) to promote bigotry, intolerance and hostility? Or perhaps the VfD process has attracted a disproportionate number of deletionists, bent on advancing thought stopping objectives? A new article stub was being prepared for the Neanderthal theory of autism, which then seemed unnecessary with a redirect to this article; in light of the above, however, perhaps it'd be best to submit it anyhow, rather than leaving a redirect to this mess. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 23:17, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
