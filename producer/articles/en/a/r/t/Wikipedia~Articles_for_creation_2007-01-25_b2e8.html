<p>Robert McCurry, a former exec with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler_Corporation_347c.html" title="Chrysler Corporation">Chrysler Corporation</a>, died November 13, 2006, at his home it Rehobeth Beach, DE. His death was a result of complications with prosrtate cancer. He bagn his career with Chrysler as a Green Bay, WI area sales manager, and went on to become one of the chief executives at Chrysler during the muscle car era. He retired from <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html" title="Chrysler">Chryslerin</a> 1978. His life was not, however, all Chrysler automobiles. He was head of the Chrysler MarineDivision, and pioneered the use of <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemi.html" title="Hemi">Hemi</a>-head engines in unlimited hydroplane racing, placing two in-line engines in a boat which eventually captured the Gold Cup in Unlimited Hydroplane Racing. He earned the nickname "Captain Crunch" for these feats of engineering. But the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle_car.html" title="Muscle car">muscle car</a> era was when his genius came to full light- without him, engines like the 426 Street Hemi, and cars like the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Charger_6a89.html" title="Dodge Charger">Dodge Charger</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Challenger_58c4.html" title="Dodge Challenger">Dodge Challenger</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Super_Bee_fa12.html" title="Dodge Super Bee">Dodge Super Bee</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Coronet_6214.html" title="Dodge Coronet">Dodge Coronet</a> R/T would never have been produced. He was, as well, the father of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>'s "winged car" program, which spawned the 1969 <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Charger_Daytona_8c48.html" title="Dodge Charger Daytona">Dodge Charger Daytona</a> and the <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Superbird_2682.html" title="Plymouth Superbird">Plymouth Superbird</a>. His attitude when shown the final design was "Will it win"?, When the answer was yes, he said, "Build it, and if anyone gets in your way, let me know." These car went on to run at over 200 miles per hour at Talladega Motor Speedway in Alabama, and the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonneville_Salt_Flats_499b.html" title="Bonneville Salt Flats">Bonneville Salt Flats</a> in <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>.</p>
<p>He also worked with Toyota starting in 1979, which led, largely due to his influence, to <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexus.html" title="Lexus">Lexus</a>, the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Camry_3979.html" title="Toyota Camry">Toyota Camry</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Tundra_b19b.html" title="Toyota Tundra">Toyota Tundra</a>. After retirement, he remained a technical advisor to <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a>.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Jane McCurry.</p>

<p>The SS 454 truck came about in the 1990 model year, 20 years after the introduction of the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevelle.html" title="Chevelle">Chevelle</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Camino_0214.html" title="El Camino">El Camino</a> <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_d53a.html" title="SS">SS</a> 454's of the early 70's. This basically made this truck the spiritual successor to those aforementioned vehicles. The truck was based off of the Chevrolet C-1500 and featured the 454 V8 (7.4 Liter V8) engine which produced 230 horsepower and a whopping (for 1990) 385 ft-lbs of torque and a four speed automatic transmission (no manual was available). This huge engine was usually reserved for work in heavy duty trucks (C/K 2500 and C/K 3500 trucks) for fuel economy reasons but it was unleashed exclusively for this truck. It was painted only Onyx Black and was only available with the regular cab/short bed layout. A performance handling package with Bilstein shocks and other suspension performance parts was avialable. The truck had large crome wheels and was shod with 275/60R15 tires and the interior was plush with available comfort options.<br /></p>

<p>Many improvements were made for the 1991 model year. Tighter combustion chamber tolerances and a revamped oil pan gasket material boosted output to 255 horsepower and an incredible 405 lb-ft. of torque. The new 4L80-E four speed automatic tranny was new to the heavy duty trucks with the capacity to withstand 440 ft-lbs of torque and the SS 454 was most definately a beneficiary.<br /></p>

<p>No changes were made. The truck was cancelled for the 1994 model year after a four year run. It probably succumbed to fuel economy and emissions regulations. The truck was most likely intended for limited production.<br /></p>

<p>Earl de Blonville FRGS was born in 1950 in Melbourne, Australia. He lived in a remote bush environment in Victoria, without running water or electricity, and later moved to an isolated coastal settlement where explorers Matthew Flinders and John Batman had their bases in 1802 and 1834 respectively. He attended Ballaarat Grammar School and the Australian Outward Bound School and worked as an Instructor at the Moray Sea School in Scotland and as Senior Instructor at the Lakeside Outdoor Education Centre in Cumbria, England, training to MIC level at Glenmore Lodge, Scotland, and Plas y Brenin National Mountaineering Centre, Wales. During this time he made several sea kayak expeditions off the Scottish coast and white water descents in Wales, Scotland and the French Dauphin Alps.</p>
<p>In 1979 he launched Australia’s first modern sea kayak expedition, a 1,000nm. circumnavigation of Tasmania. Later he made the first northerly sea kayak crossing of Bass Strait. In 1980 he was a founding member of Himalayan adventure operator, Peregrine Expeditions, and led the first commercial white water rafting expedition on the Sun Kosi river, Nepal. In 1981 he was Chief Leader of the Australian &amp; New Zealand Scientific Exploration Society’s Expedition to Granite Mountain which discovered 12 new insect species. He was founding President of the Mansfield Chamber of Commerce, director of the Mountain Country Festival and created the Great Mountain Race, one of the world’s richest and toughest bush horse races.</p>
<p>Inspired by British polar explorer Gino Watkins, in 1986 he created and led Australia’s first Arctic expedition, a 600nm. sea kayak exploration of the East Greenland coast. Advisors included Lord Shackleton, Sir Vivian Fuchs, Dame Elizabeth Murdoch and Dr Philip Law. The expedition patron was HRH The Prince of Wales and a television documentary film of the expedition was released internationally. Over the following three years he explored the West Greenland coast aboard his 50’ steel yacht ‘Eleanor Rymill’. During 1985 he conducted reconnaissance in the Kimberley region for the Royal Geographical Society’s Kimberley Research Project of 1988.</p>
<p>In 1988 he was Director of the Tall Ships spectacular that officially launched Australia’s Bicentenary celebrations. From 1990 he was managing director of Explorers UK creating large scale commando-style adventure ropes courses for schools and local authorities across the UK and in 1998 returned to Australia to work in corporate consulting as a leadership mentor, founding Ursus International. His expedition leadership book, Seventh Journey, will be published in 2007.</p>
<p>In 2007 he established ArcticExplorer.net and in August will lead an expedition of young Australians to East Greenland to promote greater awareness of the threat of global climate change and help create a new generation of young Australian eco-leaders. His work of climate change survival awareness continues.</p>

<p>A great man, with a lot of ambitions. He found himself in the world of strange people, who proceeded to fight for things they didn't believe in. Nonetheless, the was never turned off by the challenges, never boring, never crushed by the facade the corporate America tried so hard to project.</p>

<p>It is half an hour's journey from Tatana­gar and can be reached from the latter by the Steel Exp leaving at 6-00, Titlagarh-Howrah Exp at 23-55, the Hatia-Howrah Exp at 1-30, the Ispat Exp at 17-30, the Bombay (Kurla)-Howrah Exp at 10-30, the Ahmedabad-Howrah Exp at 0-45, the Tata-Kharagpur passenger at 14-50 and the Kalinga-Utkal Exp at 22-05 hr. The distance is 36 km only. Bus and trekkers also ply from Tatanagar to Ghat­sila. Calcuttans may go to Ghatsila in more or less 3j hours by the Ispat Exp leaving Howrah at 6-15, the Bombay (Kurla)-Exp at 11-20, the Ahmedabad Exp at 20-40, the Steel Exp at 17-30, the Hatia Exp at 21-40 and the Titlagarh Exp at 20-55 hr. The distance is 215 km. The Kalinga-Utkal Exp and passenger trains for Tata leaving Kharagpur at 5-25, 10-15, 14-40, 17-45 via Ghatsila/Galudi. The Calcutta-Ranchi bus also run via Ghatsila.</p>
<p>It is claimed that gold is still found on the banks of the Suvarnarekha. It is said to become obvious in the mornings and in the afternoons, when the sunrays fall on the banks. The name Suvarnarekha itself is said to be an indication. There are innumerable stones strewn on the banks of the river and from this the place derives its name Ghatsila. These big stones seem to be large elephants in moonlight. Far away stand the series of hills. On the left bank the chimneys of the Hindustan Coppers rise up to the sky. The copper ores are bought from many copper mines including Mosaboni. Copper and other metals are separated from stones. The factory may be visited on Saturday only, after signing the indemnity bond. The surroundings seem to be painted on a canvas. Let us go to Ghatsila for about a week in winter for rest. The place is healthy and the water here helps digestion.</p>
<p>The Suvarnarekha flows parallel alongwith the rail line, and between the rail line and the Suvarnarekha lying the road. The spread of the town is dependent on the river. The resi­dence of Bibhuti Bhusan Bandyopadhyay, the great Bengali novelist, is on the Apu's Road to Dahijora. Nearby is the Pancha Pandava hill where the Pandavas, it is said, lived for some time. The surroundings of Dahijora and- Mosaboni, shedded with sal and amlaki trees, are beautiful. Far far away are the hillocks. The Suvarnarekha slowly flows on the foot; the water of the river is reddish blue. Passing the town and Dahijora/ Mosaboni and crossing the Mohan Kumar-arnangalam bridge on the Suvarnarekha is the Ratmohana hillock, a km ahead. View of the sunset from it is wonderful. But the shed of the hillock becomes the den of the antiso-cials at night, for the place in lonely. 2 km on the left is the court housed in the palace of the Ghatsila Zamindars.</p>
<p>East of the railway station near the police station is the temple of the tribal deity Ranakini. The image is an unusual form. The altar of the deity was earlier in Galudi in pre-British days. In those days children used to be sacrificed at the altar. In order to put an end to the practice, the British brought the deity here and installed the goddess in the present temple. In course of time the goddess became the protector of children than the devourer. Special pujas are held in the month of Aswina. A buffalow is sacrificed 15 days before the Durga Puja. A shrine of Shri Ramakrishna has also been built at Dahijora. There is also the Bibhuti Sanskriti Parishad associated with the name of the great novelist Bibhuti Bhusan. 2 km away is Phuldunguri hillock, famed for fulfilling the desire of baffled lovers. The natural view of Ghatsila is beautiful from the shed on the hillock.</p>
<p>An artificial lake was built at Burudi, 9 km away from the town. The water from the natural spring that falls into it is utilised for agriculture.</p>
<p>The lake is surrounded by hills on all sides. Autos can take you to the lake and return you to the town at Rs 75.00. In the same way, you may visit the Dharagiri Falls, 14 km from the towh by jeep, tempo or cart. On the way to the Falls, chance meeting with wild elephants are not unlikely. Dharagiri is surrounded by hills on all sides. A visit would be some sort of adventures. Tourists may hire bullock cart for a whole day programme and arrange picnic amidst the wild. It costs you Rs 100 or so. A guide should be taken from the village, so that you may not lone the way.</p>
<p><br />
Another health resort is Galudi in Singhbhum district. It is only 8 km away from Ghatsila. Health-seekers from far and near throng to Galudi for a few days in winter for its healthy climate. There are hills and hills all around-the lonely Suvarnarekha flowing by slowly among them. A little away on the west is the Jadugora mines. Galudi is next station to Ghatsila.</p>

<p>The South Tenth Street Gang of Sheboygan was created by three founders, Martin Zuniga, Jamie Zuniga, and Tim Contreras. It came from the street that they lived on. Other members are Sebastian Maxey, Travis Messer, Thomas Glasgow, and Victor Ramierez ( Martin and Jamie's Stepbrother). Their colors are red and black. They are affiliated with the Gangster Disciples. They have many enemies being such a small gang. They have had issues with the Surenos and the Kings in the area which they have called fakes, but somehow have gotten along with other Kings that the have credited with being "real".They have had many accomplishments. Their three leaders have had many fights for respect. They have not lost any fights. Even being outnumbered they have an uncanny fight ability. The brothers and Tim have had great leadership. Not getting caught too many times for gang related activity. Some consider them a gang other consider them a group of friends with a name.</p>

<p>Ever heard of salsa dura? (hard-core salsa)? La Excelencia's sound fits right into the Golden Age of the genre, back in the 70's. The percussionists José Vázquez-Cofresi and Julian Silva are vying to put an end to what they consider "salsa monga" (bland). With an enthralling swing, well-crafted harmonies, powerful horn arrangements and lively percussion. La Excelencia's lyrics reflect the life in the barrio and every day situations. Drug deals, high-speed car chases and an array of urban topics make this a rather unique salsa band particularly appealing to the younger generations of Latinos.</p>

<p>Mark the words, feel them flow. Yes, quite amazing, right? "Be Quiet and Die" is a horde guild on the realm of Shattered Halls. But not only is it a horde guild; it is so much more! In here, the members experience ultimate comfort, at prices EVERYONE could afford: They're free! So far, Be Quiet and Die is known as many, as the first and probably only guild raiding Azuremyst Isle for hats, and creating a video about it. Oh, btw. This article is PURELY objective.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-25_b2e8.html" title="Edit section: Insulated Foam Board (IFB) a.k.a Koolduct">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insulated Foam Board (IFB) a.k.a Koolduct</span></h2>
<p><b>What is Insulated Foam Board?</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Insulated Foam Board</b> is a thick, ridged, closed cell foam used to fabricate pre-insulated air ducting. Marketed under the name "Koolduct", it is constructed with CFC-free phenolic foam and covered with a skin of Aluminum foil and fiberglass. The initial price of IFB (Insulated Foam Board) duct is comparable with sheet metal duct. The full life cycle cost of IFB is lower and the advantages surpass that of Sheet Metal.</p>
<p><b>Some Advantages of IFB</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Low thermal conductivity<br />
-Lightweight: 15% of galvanized insulated duct, saves installation time and money, able to suspend from ceiling.<br />
-Installation is much faster than sheet metal: Two men can install a 26' duct run<br />
-Meets SMACNA's Leakage Class 6 Standard: Reduces electrical consumption 10%-20%, due to lower leakage<br />
-Saves plenum space beyond insulated sheet metal duct<br />
-Non fibrous material: No moisture, rot or mold problems.<br />
-No exposed fiberglass<br />
-Anti-microbial construction<br />
-Easy to clean: smooth wall duct interior<br />
-Sound Reuction<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>IFB over Fiberglass Alternative</b></p>
<p>Fiberglass, as history suggests, is going the way of asbestos. The American Society of Microbiology concludes that the porous nature of fiberglass promotes the growth of fungi that cause poor air quality and the Center for Engineering and Environmental Services concludes that fiberglass duct treatments may not provide adequate prevention of fungi growth. Congress has also taken note, current legislation is pushing for the use of fiberglass. <a name="Sources_20" id="Sources_20"></a></p>
