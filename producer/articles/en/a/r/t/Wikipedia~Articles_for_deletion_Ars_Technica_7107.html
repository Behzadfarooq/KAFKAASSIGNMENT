<li><b>Comment, Possible Delete</b> Being the person who recommended this be checked for COI, I am not looking for deletion. However, I wonder if deletion is the only way to keep this article from being fluff, as there are too many Ars members, writers, and staff who are willing to take all negative information out of the article in the interest of promoting the site. As for Ars being notable due to postings on Slashdot, that makes no sense. Slashdot posts a lot of garbage from anyone willing to submit stories summaried from other sites. For the record, Warrens is taking this opportunity to claim that I am a sock puppet. Considering the manner of my edits, which are far different than the edits of other people, no less talented (of course), I find it hard to believe that he actually believes that. Of course, when much of your life has been spent protecting an article, you may lose perspective. I would be happy to identify any and all edits that I made to the article, ending sometime last summer (I gave up).--216.227.57.119 11:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Umm, hello? "Anon editors" weren't the only ones trying to restore the criticism section (a section of similar sort is in the Slashdot article, and doesn't get attacked all the time). In fact, there was maybe only one other "anon" editor besides me that I can remember. And it wasn't bad mouthing. It was sourced criticism, mostly not added by me (though I did try to add sources for those who demanded it). BTW, offtopic, but is that an MST3K nick?

<dd>Since all the "criticism" was totally retarded (insofar as it was substantially fabricated and consistently unsupported) it was not unreasonable to remove it. Articles about extant web pages are in any case generally worthless; if you want to know what Ars Technica's about, stick the frigging URL into your web browser and take a look. You don't need an "encyclopaedia" entry about it. Articles like this one seem only to cater to those lunatics who believe that if it's not on Wikipedia <i>it doesn't exist</i>. Such articles can only ever be fluff, because there's nothing substantive to say. At least Slashdot is somewhat notable, due to the way it functions as a DoS tool. <a href="../../../d/r/p/User%7EDrPizza_7344.html" title="User:DrPizza">DrPizza</a> 11:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> A walk through the article's history since April 2005 reveals what its main problem was all along: the propensity of Ars Technica partisans to treat an encyclopedia article as if Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">a webspace provider</a>. Several <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> editors have it on their watchlists now, so those few who still try to revert it to its former corrupted condition find their intentions frustrated very quickly. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthaenara_c5c7.html" title="User:Athaenara"><span style="font-family: Edwardian Script ITC; font-size: 14pt">— Athænara</span></a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthaenara_36d9.html" title="User talk:Athaenara"><small>✉</small></a> 10:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While it probably would have been ideal for delldot to do a bit of research before listing the article for AFD I'm of the opinion it was a fair move. Articles should establish the notability of their topic indepedently of anything else. Articles which fail completely to do so are the ones at fault when they are listed for deletion, not the editors who list them. Editors IMHO should not be expected to do independent research on the subject of an article outside of what is already in the article when listing an article for deletion (even if it is usually wise). This is doubly the case when the article is of a resonable size and has existed for a resonable period of time. If a clearly noteable topic is listed for deletion because the editor was unaware it was a noteable topic because the article failed completely to establish that; it usually has the beneficial effect of making people aware that an article is in dire straits (although this should definitely never be even of slightest consideration in listing an article for deletion). Point being, this is the way wikipedia is supposed to work... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
