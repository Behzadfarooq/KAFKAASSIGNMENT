<p>This page violates all the guidelines for a BIO article. The majority of the article isn't even about the subject, but rather what happened to her. The Google results initially used to prevent AFD reveals no other stories outside of the ones just after the accident in March. There have been no substantial changes in content for over five months, and the subject hasn't been newsworthy since three days after the accident. The article was justified then by others because she was on the news and <i>The Today Show</i>, and she has since faded back into obscurity. The apparently important NCAA meeting that was also cited as upcoming also failed to make the news, and the results also failed to make this article. Thus, there were no real repercussions from the event, and what we are left with is a vanity article about a person who is noteworthy because of what happened to her rather than because of something she did that was of any real substance. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:21, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You should expect a biographical article about a person to focus on what makes them newsworthy, encyclopaedic, whatever. That's not a flaw in thsi case, just indicates that the article isn't "complete". Lack of completeness is not a criterion for deletion. Saying she's <i>noteworthy because of what happened to here rather than what she did</i> reeks so strongly of POV I'll just disregard it entirely. The article is sourced, and vaguely encyclopaedic. "Encyclopaedic value" isn't something you lose, so the <i>failure to develop</i> argument is one I also find unconvincing. Thus, I'm relucktantly forced to conclude we should <b>keep</b> the article, even though it's a real Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>My comments from the first nomination</b>: "Plenty of people with considerably less fame have articles on them in Wikipedia. In Yamaoka's case, shes' been the subject of media attention from a broad range of major media outlets, including <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> and hundreds more. She received a call from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">President Bush</a> and also appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Show_8f75.html" title="The Today Show">The Today Show</a>. It isn't just the accident that made her famous, it's her actions afterwards that made her famous. The ban that you note may be overturned <i><b>is</b></i> in effect for the NCAA tournament, not just the MVC women's tourney (which is not over, it's still going on). Try searching for "Kristi Yamaoka" at <a href="http://news.google.com/" class="external free" title="http://news.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://news.google.com/</a>. This generates more than 500 news article hits. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> specifically states as a test for inclusion in Wikipedia, "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Having nationwide news attention, getting on The Today Show, getting a call from the President, etc., well exceeds that criteria. "</dd>
<dd><b>My comments from the second nomination</b>:"<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> clearly states "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Given all of the press attention, appearance on a number of TV shows, a call from the President of the United States, and ONGOING press coverage, the article clearly passes this requirement. The above statement that there is no news of her since March 11th is false as she's been mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> and been on the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Degeneres_c40a.html" title="Ellen Degeneres">Ellen Degeneres</a> Show of late.

<dd>Nothing has changed regarding this person's notability to possibly conclude the invalidity of the prior AfDs. People can and are notable for singular events in their lives. If she just fell and was hurt, no big deal. Lots of cheerleaders fall. Injuries are commonplace. What made <i>this</i> person notable was the fact that she continued to perform her cheerleading duties from the stretcher. <b>THAT</b> is what drew all the media attention. That is what made her notable. Not her fall. Much less the fact that her fall caused a nation-wide temporary suspension of similar moves is plenty enough on its own to make it notable. MSJapan has made no convincing argument that this person is any less notable now than she was at the time of the event. How many AfDs does this article have to endure? Enough is enough already. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do think that notability can have a shelf life, although I think it's more on the order of 5 to 10 years than six months. On the other hand, clearly every person who is mentioned by name by major news media due to an accident does not pass the notability test. If this article passes into the realm of notability it is due only to the novelty of her injury.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Shortly after the fall, The American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators declared a temporary ban on basket tosses and 2 1/2 high pyramids (the same type of stunt Yamaoka was involved in that precipitated her fall). This temporary ban was to extend for the rest of the season for all cheerleading events, including the NCAA tourney. See <a href="http://www.aacca.org/news20060307.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aacca.org/news20060307.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Following AACCA's July meeting on updating safety rules, they issued a press release modifying the rules regarding these same types of stunts requiring the presence of mats if on a hard surface and may only be done during half time or following a game. See <a href="http://www.aacca.org/CollegePressRelease.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.aacca.org/CollegePressRelease.doc" rel="nofollow">press release in MS-Word format</a>. Thus, MSJapan's assertion that there were no repercussions from the event is incorrect. Regardless, the larger reason for Yamaoka's fame is not the fall; plenty of cheerleaders fall. The reason for her fame is her actions after the fall, in continuing to cheer when strapped to a stretcher. That's what prompted all the press coverage, appearance on media outlets, call from the President of the United States, etc., not the fall. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:23, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b>I still frankly think that too much stock is being put in certain events - for example, I know someone who was personally at a Presidential bill signing, made the local news as a result, and received numerous phone calls from the President at the time. They don't have a WP article, nor do they deserve one. It also concerns me that available information was not added to the article in a timely fashion. If the meeting took place in July (it was stated as April in the article, and that meeting not having occurred yet was a key reason AfD #2 did not pass), why did it take until AfD #3 in September to find and add the relevant information, thus undermining this AfD as well? How can someone be notable enough for WP when the article doesn't even have a DOB for her (which is because it wasn't mentioned in the whopping three days of media coverage)? How notable can she be when no substantial changes have been made to the article since a week after the accident? While I suppose at this point there is no reason to continue with the AfD, these are questions that I think really need to be considered when thinking about the appropriateness of this article for WP. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We do not base deletion policy on whether or not all available information is added in a timely fashion. It simply isn't a criteria. Not having a date of birth is also not a criteria for deletion, and not a criteria for determining notability either.

The issues you raise here have no bearing on how notable she is. The issues you raise have to do with the completeness of the article.
