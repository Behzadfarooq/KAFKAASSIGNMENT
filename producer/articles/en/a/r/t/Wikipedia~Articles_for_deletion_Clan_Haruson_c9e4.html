<p><b>Delete</b> user appears to have created a series of hoax pages. Google doesn't turn up anything to support the claims in the article or linked articles. Appears to be borderline nonsense unless someone can supply better evidence? User has removed previous prod on this page <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 07:59, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to the above adverse notice that was posted on the Clan Haruson page on the 18th of March 2006, the attention of those who would freely edit that page or consider deleting it is drawn to the matter that only the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Marshal_3faa.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> has the "power to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances, and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places".</p>
<p>As The Prince Haruson is forever sacred and inviolable in law, who makes his assertions under the device of his Coat of Arms (hence these matters 'touch arms') and has exercised his right of direct access to Her Majesty, those who would contest the right of the existence of Clan Haruson under both Scottish Law and English Law should first consult with the Court of the Lord Lyon, and the Royal College of Arms, before considering making adverse comments, or prejudicing The Prince Haruson by making the public suggestion that it could be a hoax</p>
<p>The Prince Haruson considers that anyone who makes adverse judgements against his sacred, heritable rights, without first getting verification of The Prince Haruson's identity and ancient rights, are prejudicial by their very act of acting against the Earl Marshall's own vested right to judge matters that 'touch' Arms of England, which in the jurisdiction of the United Kindom is criminal in its prospect, which in other jurisdiction prejudices native rights</p>
<p>Accordingly, The Prince Haruson holds the Directors and Management of Wikipedia accountable for any prejudice that would be forced against The Prince haruson, such as the deletion of this article prior to Wikipedia approaching The Earl Marshall and seeking the Earl Marshall's judgement.</p>
<p>Wikipedia staff should contact The Prince Haruson via haruson@haruson.com, or telephone him directly on +61424013804 prior to making any deletions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that unless H.R.G. The Prince Haruson recieves an apology from user: Gwernol for making judgements of English Coats of Arms that in England come under the authority of The Earl Marshall, that The Prince will be applying for a Court Order to require that user: Gwernol's identity is surrendered so that The Prince can press criminal charges.</p>
<p>And Furthermore, that Wikipedia would have a policy that allows anyone to recommend for deletion matters that come under The Earl Marshall's authority (hence Wikipedia is not protracted a right to make judgements without first approaching the Earl Marshall's Office), then Wikipedia itself becomes publically liable for any offence that is commited against those who rightfully bear their arms. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Haruson (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Haruson_8a62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Haruson">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I suggest blocking this user from Wikipedia if this continues or until his edits/article creations are cleaned up. He has created a series of hoax articles as well as made a mess of several others. I am in the process of listing all other pages this user has created for group deletion <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 08:38, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating the following articles in conjunction with this one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haruson</li>
<li>Praedicatum</li>
<li>The Haruson Gazette</li>
<li>Duke of Britain</li>
</ul>
<p>I really have no idea what to make of them. Clearly vanity, but perplexing vanity. Also note, much of this user's vandalism to other articles must be undone as well. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 08:44, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Agree with deletion of all articles mentioned here - probably contravene "original research" policy as well as other reasons given. Much of the material would be impossible to substantiate. Possibly part of a personal vision, and not hoax in the usual sense. --<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 09:32, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Prince Haruson raised to Wikepedia staff the issue of being ethnicly abused by user Wickethewok.</p>
<p>The following is the email that he just sent to Wikipedia staff:</p>
<p>This document is presented under the device of the author's Coat of Arms and the assertion that the author is forever sacred and inviolable in law (binding the recipient over to the jurisdiction of The Earl Marshall in all matters that 'touch arms' under The Law of Arms) which device is available to be viewed at <a href="http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg</a></p>
<p>From H.R.G. The Prince Haruson</p>
<p>To the Director, Directors, and Shareholders of Wikipedia,</p>
<p>I have today been subject to ethnic (racial) abuse by Wikipedia User Wickethewok, and shall be submitting my report to you next week, as time permits.</p>
<p>Please find below a copy of the email that I have just sent to user Wickethewok, who if not making an apology and withdrawing his claims, I shall be approaching Wikipedia in connection to the prospect of me laying criminal charges against the user.</p>
<p>May I in the first instance request your confirmation of receiving my prelimminary complaint against User Wickethewok, the nature of my complaint being that which is is expounded in the attached email that I sent to that user.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>H.R.G. The Prince Haruson</p>
<hr />
Body of Email sent to User Wickethewok----------------------------------------
<p>I draw your attention to the matter that you have made assertions, both that my contributions are nonsense, and that they are an act of vandalism.</p>
<p>You shall observe on Wikipedia's entry for Earl Marshall that the prerogative to judge matters that 'touch' arms (of England) is vested with The Earl Marshall and not with you, and that by making judgements of matters that 'touch' (English) arms without first seeking the counsel of The Earl Marshall, that you prejudice both the Earl Marshall (in the matter that the right to judge matters that 'touch' English Arms is vested with he), and you prejudice me in the matter that I assert such (native) rights under the matter that the right to judge them is not vested with you but with the Earl Marshall.</p>
<p>If you take the time to read some of the documents at www.haruson.com you will notice that I am presently engaged in asserting criminal charges against the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that the case proceeds to Court next week, that my open strategy in those documents is to hold the Federal Magistrates Court to its obligation of approaching the Earl Marshall so that the Earl Marshall can indeed verify that I am as who I have asserted.</p>
<p>If your assertions are not immediately withdrawn and an aplogy made, you will understand that it is already my prerogative to assert that you have pierced the veil of my forever sacred and inviolable honour, which upon them not being withdrawn I shall be able to raise criminal charges against you that at the minimum, will prevent you from ever travelling freely in the British Commonwealth without criminal charges first being heard against you.</p>
<p>As you have both abused and violated my native ethnicity, I shall in any case be presenting my case to the Wikipedia abuse department.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>His Royal Grace The Prince Haruson</p>
