Ian is a very respectable person. Ian was born on August 27, 1969.. aka the summer of '69. He grew up on a farm outside the town of nicknamed "Chocolate." He is responsible for inventing the fork knife. He always wanted to be able to use one untensil for every food eating need. So, one sunny afternoon, while sunbathing, Ian used his Power Team strength to bend his steel shaft into a fork shaped object. He then used a razor to make the side of the fork into a sharp material that could cut into almost any kind of meat, even T-bone steak. So without this invention, we would all starve before we could set the table with all the unneedy silverware. Setting the table is easier then ever now.</p>

<p>David Dineen-Porter began doing comedy in the group Someone and the Somethings out of university. He was quickly introduced to Tom Middleditch (currently of Chicago's <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improv_Olympic_6ffc.html" title="Improv Olympic">improv Olympic</a>) by Leslie Gottleib, the current organizer of Laugh Sabbath (one of Toronto's most noted alternative comedy shows).</p>
<p>Together, they formed The Iliads, a sketch troupe, which ultimately superceded Someone and the somethings.</p>
<p>During this time, he began to experiment with solo performances, helping organize Rad Maneuvers along with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gurg_7268.html" title="The Gurg">The Gurg</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Locke_311c.html" title="Chris Locke">Chris Locke</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Barlow_a5e8.html" title="Brian Barlow">Brian Barlow</a>).</p>
<p>Also during this time, he was considered, but ultimately rejected, for a Tim Sims Encouragement Award, for new and unique comedic performers. (2003) The performance considered (and rejected) contained several sketches, performed solo, with the use of multimedia and extensive use of pre-recorded audio, which were to become central features of current alternative comedy.</p>

<p>Through Catch 23, David developed a presence in the Improv community, and was simultaneously loved and hated for his extremely bizzare of sometimes confrontational performance style.</p>
<p>During 2004, David organized a marathon 3 night sketch show called Yay, Stepdad!, which included himself, his partner Tom, Levi MacDougall, Tim Polley, Paul Schuck (collectively, The Distractions, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Locke_311c.html" title="Chris Locke">Chris Locke</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Barlow_a5e8.html" title="Brian Barlow">Brian Barlow</a> (collectively <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gurg_7268.html" title="The Gurg">The Gurg</a>).</p>
<p>He followed this up with a "birthday" show (5 months before his birthday) entitled Hexiquest (<a href="http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.26.04/arts/meet.php" class="external free" title="http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.26.04/arts/meet.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.26.04/arts/meet.php</a> there is an article in Eye magazine about it).</p>
<p>The Iliads went on Hiatus in January of 2005, as Tom MIddleditch moved to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> in order to study at the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_City_2c36.html" title="Second City">Second City</a> school there.</p>
<p>David began performing solo, as without the Iliads, and having alienated the improv community with his angry and perhaps selfish performances, he was without partners.</p>

<p>After beginning to do standup, David was rapidly a hot item at many of the alternative standup nights, including but not limited to The Joke Club run by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Flanagan_a10f.html" title="Nick Flanagan">Nick Flanagan</a> at the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drake_Hotel_3fdc.html" title="Drake Hotel">Drake Hotel</a>. Moving into all-audio performance, and maintaining a steady stream of standup performances, David is now considered one of the central figures in Toronto's alternative comedy scene, though he remains a controversial figure among his contemporaries who appear to hold very strong positive or negative opinions of him and his work.</p>
<p>He has performed extensively with the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Village_066a.html" title="East Village">East Village</a> alternative comedy scene (at <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invite_Them_Up_7e5f.html" title="Invite Them Up">Invite Them Up</a>, Gabe and Jenny, Greg Johnson Show, Mo Pitkins).</p>

<p>David runs the successful standup comedy night Circular Laughing Breads (formerly at the Toronto venue "the Bagel" hence the name) with <a href="../../../n/o/w/Now_Magazine_9ea3.html" title="Now Magazine">Now Magazine</a> music reviewer <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Richards_6bb8.html" title="Jason Richards">Jason Richards</a> (who recently was embroiled in major controversy following a virulent and racist exchange between himself and musician <a href="../../../k/-/o/K-os.html" title="K-os">K-os</a> <a href="http://canada.com.dose.ca/music/story.html?id=1f70bd7c-35fa-46b9-bb9f-a55cb29c5ace&amp;k=97556" class="external free" title="http://canada.com.dose.ca/music/story.html?id=1f70bd7c-35fa-46b9-bb9f-a55cb29c5ace&amp;k=97556" rel="nofollow">http://canada.com.dose.ca/music/story.html?id=1f70bd7c-35fa-46b9-bb9f-a55cb29c5ace&amp;k=97556</a> , <a href="http://www.torontoist.com/archives/2006/10/hiphop_artist_a.php" class="external free" title="http://www.torontoist.com/archives/2006/10/hiphop_artist_a.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.torontoist.com/archives/2006/10/hiphop_artist_a.php</a>)).</p>
<p>David's very controversial, vitriolic, and exhaustive defense of Jason Richards against K-os allegations that he was a "<a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambo.html" title="Sambo">Sambo</a>" controlled by his white masters at the Magazine (who he alleged ordered Jason to review his album with a 3/5) on the highly influential toronto music scene message board Stillepost.ca proved a major catalyst for schism in the toronto arts community on the topic of race in music (<a href="http://www.stillepost.ca/boards/index.php?topic=61571.0" class="external free" title="http://www.stillepost.ca/boards/index.php?topic=61571.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.stillepost.ca/boards/index.php?topic=61571.0</a> ) perhaps sparking the recent Toronto Star articles on Race Stereotypes and their impact on minorities' participation in music.</p>
<p>Also, David Dineen-Porter was awarded (in 2006, October) an artist's residency at The Drake Hotel to complete the composition of a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Opera_8dd5.html" title="Rock Opera">Rock Opera</a>, for the duration of February 2007, to be perfomred in March 2008. However, this project is in development, and it is possible this is a <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">Hoax</a> perpetrated by David, as he is fond of tricking people into believing things that are not true.</p>

<p>David is reported (by himself) to have <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspergers_Syndrome_42d9.html" title="Aspergers Syndrome">Aspergers Syndrome</a> and Attention Defficit Disorder, which could explain his controversial standing in the comedy community, and why he is easily dispised as arrogant or crazy. It may also explain why he sometimes exhibits paranoid behaviour or appears not to adequately predict how severely his actions will affect people's emotions.</p>
<p>Some see this as a <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a> used as an excuse to "get away" with actions that some are annoyed by.</p>
<p>David also suffered for 6 years from Muscular (or functional) <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysphonia.html" title="Dysphonia">Dysphonia</a>, a habitual condition affecting Vocal Onset, leading to etnsion and swelling in the Vocal Chords. The inability to freely use his voice is one possible reason why David has favoured, until recently, quiet performances, and heavily logical content, which does not require him to shout, or perform characters.</p>
<p>David claims to suffer from every minor physical malady known to mankind, including <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allergies.html" title="Allergies">allergies</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactose_intolerance.html" title="Lactose intolerance">lactose intolerance</a>, chronic back-ache, TMJ disorder, and so on, but there is no way to substantiate these claims.</p>

<p>David has been published multiple times for his writings, including a collection of his rejected radio and television proposals where were intentionally horrible.</p>
<p>One such proposal, for a book, was published by McSweeney's literary review.</p>
<p>Since that time, david has been published two more times in McSweeney's, once for a "Letter to the President" following a <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tie-in.html" title="Tie-in">tie-in</a> with Gabe Hudson's novel of correspondences <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_to_the_President_4e95.html" title="Letters to the President">Letters to the President</a>, and once reviewing a McSweeney's Publishing Wing promotional event at The Drake Hotel.</p>
<p>He has had a comic strip entitled trust the government published variously in independant newspapers and websites, including The Fat Clam (a satirical website akin to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a>)</p>

<p>The Wise Woman Tradition is an approach to health. The term began with Susun Weed through her teachings and books.</p>
<p>The Wise Woman Tradition is contrasted with two other Traditions of Healing - the Heroic Tradition that sees people as dirty and in need of cleaning, and the Scientific Tradition that sees people as parts and machines to fix. In the Wise Woman Tradition health is viewed as a spiral, ever-evolving, always returning to itself, but never at the same place. It shows health as flexibility, never static, never balanced, and always whole. Health is nourished in the Wise Woman Tradition.</p>
<p>The Wise Woman Tradition draws from the wisdom that has been passed down for generations. While perhaps a relatively new phrase, the approach to health is old and resembles that of nealers of many cultures, such as shamans, witches, and lay midwives. It is a term and an approach now used amongst many who practice herbalism, as well as other other fields such as midwifery and life counseling.</p>
<p>The Wise Woman Tradition puts the responsibiliy and power of health into the hands of people. Though some use it in their approach to helping others, at its core is the idea that we are all healers inside, and have at our doorstep all we need to care for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>

<p>A bureaucrat third-class machine, whoose occupation was that of population control on Kattalox Island. He was awaked by MegaMan Volnut, after entering the Main Gate. Upon his awakening, he was apalled at the sheer number of 'carbons' inhabiting the island, and began to re-initalize the population growth, by killing everything on the island. Juno, upon discovering MegaMan Trigger had lost his memories, put him in a trap which the Bonnes soon freed him from. Juno was defeated at the hands of MegaMan Volnut, and the computer program to re-initialize population was ended by MegaMan Trigger.</p>

<p>Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov is the father of the title characters, brothers Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov (nicknamed Mitya), Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov, and Alexei Fyodorovitch Karamazov (nicknamed Alyosha) in the novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brothers_Karamazov_f032.html" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a> by <a href="../../../f/y/o/Fyodor_Dostoevsky_0fbb.html" title="Fyodor Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>. The novel is centered around the events surrounding Fyodor Pavlovitch's murder. Dmitri, the eldest son, is accused of the murder because of an ongoing squabble between the two over Dmitri's inheiretance and a woman, Agrafena Alexandrovna Svetlova, often called Grushenka. Dmitri, however, accused Fyodor Pavlovitch's eppilectic servant <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smerdyakov.html" title="Smerdyakov">Smerdyakov</a> of the crime. Smerdyakov was also rumored in the novel to be Fyodor Pavlovitch's illegitimate son. This has lead to the literary debate as to whether there were actually four, not three, "Brothers Karamazov"; Smerdyakov being the fourth in addition to Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha. Smerdyakov later confesses his guilt of the murder to Ivan before commititng suicide.</p>

<p>William Robert Consuegra was nominated by Governor Bill Richardson and former Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera to the Term Member program with the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Consuegra has been a State Bar Summer Clerk with the New Mexico Risk Management Division in Santa Fe, a business process analyst with Accenture, an International Student Advisor at Trinity University, and an intern with the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>Mr. Consuegra is currently a second year law student at the University of New Mexico School of Law. He is also currently a National Program Review Facilitator with the Corporation for National and Community Service, and a national member of the Trinity University alumni association. In recent years he has also been a reviewer for the David L. Boren/Fulbright Scholarship Fund Committee (Houston, TX), a Program Review Board member with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, and a Funds Allocation Board member with the United Way of South Texas (San Antonio).</p>
<p>Mr. Consuegra’s area of expertise is international education and commerce. His work has been supported by several grants from organizations including the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors and the Accenture Foundation, and his research has included border conflicts, religion and politics, and international students as ambassadors for democracy. Articles and research by Mr. Consuegra have been published in various industry newsletters and presented to regional conferences, as well as utilized by Fortune 100 corporations.</p>
<p>Mr. Consuegra’s international experience began in 1998, when served as a trade specialist for the U.S. Department of Commerce in the United States Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From 1999 - 2001, while a Business Process analyst for Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), Mr. Consuegra worked with two major petrochemical companies in Frankfurt, Germany and Houston, Texas, advising on international trade strategy and technological innovations in the area of risk management. From 2002 – 2004, Mr. Consuegra created the international student office at Trinity University, increasing international student enrollment from 18 to over 100 students and establishing programs with the city of San Antonio. Mr. Consuegra traveled to various Asian nations to recruit students and to foster relationships with alumni in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Beijing. In addition to numerous presentations at academic conferences and seminars, in recent years Mr. Consuegra has spoken to many non-specialist audiences regarding the topics of national and community service, international trade, the history of foreign students in the United States, and Islam as a political tool in the third world. He has also been involved with individual companies and industry associations interested in fostering dialogue on issues of international trade and education. Mr. Consuegra’s community service work began in 1994, when he was a member of the inaugural class of the AmeriCorps national service program. As one of the few high school seniors to serve in AmeriCorps while a high school student, Mr. Consuegra spoke to Teach for America programs in the southwest on potential partnering possibilities between the two organizations. In 2003 he returned to AmeriCorps, this time as a reviewer for national program applications. He has since led or supervised seven national review sessions in Washington D.C., reviewing nearly 40 program applications requesting over $15 million. Mr. Consuegra received his bachelor’s degree from Trinity University in 1999, and will receive his juris doctorate from the University of New Mexico School of Law in 2008.</p>

<p>Joshua (Haberman) Gabriel Bouaziz, (b. 2/20/88) was a very important figure of the student body in his 4 years in The Frisch Yeshiva High School. Located in Paramus, NJ, The Frisch Yeshiva provides a warm learning experience for all its Orhtodox community based students. During his four years at the Jewish School, Josh thrived on the varsity basketball team and was very influencial in the student body government. Although Josh had no official title, he was often referred to as the school's "lucky charm." He caused then President of the Student Body, Kevin Eis, to start songs chanting "Bouaziz" to all different Jewish tunes. Also, it wasn't the home mascot "Cougar" who would pump up the losing teams, rather chants of BOU-A-ZIZ turned into the teams motivator. Other chants of Haberman were also started in honor of Josh's yiddish name. Almost every time those infamous chants were started, the home Frisch Cougars would start filling up the scoreboard. Throughout Josh Bouaziz's four years in high school, he truly depicted what the model student should act like. He provided unpreccedented leadership and a will to win. The Frisch Family will truly miss their hero, Joshua (Haberman) Gabriel Bouaziz.</p>

<p>Shintaro Sugiyama was the bassist from 1981-1983 for the japanese punk rock band the stalin. He was reluctant at first to join the band but was persuaded by the singer Michiro Endo. He joined the band in time to play on their stalinism ep, their second release. He stayed with the band until 1983, making him one of the longest lasting members of the stalin besides Michiro who never left the band. After he left he became involved with the noise band hijokaidan who shared a friendship with the stalin. He married a girl from the band called yuka and joined them himself around 1986. He performed live with them and contributed bass and guitar to their tapes Lp and also drew the picture of the back. He was planning a solo LP and created it around 1986, it was called newton's oblige and was on jojo from hijokaidans alchemy records record label. Shintaro and his wife Yuka decided to leave Hijokaidan after an incident where he threw a drumcase into the audience at a concert and managed to hit a fan in their face and injure them quite badly, Shintaro took full responsibility and settled it with the fan out of court. Sometime later Shintaro left music and moved into a mountain hut where he became an alcoholic due to depression, it is believed this is because his wife divorced him. He was unheard of till 1996, when he was asked to return and play bass for the stalin in a 1996 reunion concert but he refused saying that he could not play bass anymore and all he had was his hut. Soon after this he unfortunately passed away when he fell down his staircase drunk. The Stalin 1996 concerts were then in tribute to him and there is an EP that contains a few songs from these concerts. In 2006 his solo album Newton's Oblige was reissued.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">tesco</a> Clubcard was introduced during 1995 for several reasons. One of these reasons is that they can see what items people wish to buy, this allowed them to reduce prices on specific stock inorder to increase sales. It also allowed them, to see what items a specific individual bought on a regular basis, this allowed tesco to send out vouchers thus allowing the person to have a reduction on cost of what they normally buy. The idea behind this was to increase sales and the return rate of customers to a particular store, over time this allowed them to create a map of popular items in the area and showed them what people in that area are more likely to buy.</p>
<p>The clubcard also distrabutes clubcard points which allows people to reduce the cost of their shopping and also to buy and recive gifts from the store. Tis forms a good bond with the store which meant that it increased the customer return rate. Clubcard points are taking up a new style now because "Green Clubcard" points are distrabuted when people recyle carrier bags.</p>
<p>The Tesco clubcard also allows the company to see a specific stores sphere of influnce and in turn its productivity this allows them to execute and manage decisions better, for instance if a super store attracts enough current customers it may be viable to build an Tesco Extra store. It also creates a bond between customers and the store which in time makes the customer feel welcome and apprecate thus increasing profits by increasing store return rates.</p>
<p>The clubcard also allows suppliers such as <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinz.html" title="Heinz">Heinz</a> or Unilver to hold private promontions in store because Tesco can target sopecific customers and give them a deal through there Clubcard inorder to make them buy goods, E.G double clubcard points when you spend five pounds or more on dove soap or triple points on weightwatcher products.</p>

<p>Crossfire was formed by guitarist Kaya Sevinc in 1999 spending 3 years to constrain it's original line up and it's sound which has slowly emerged of the greatest hope for Heavy Metal in Turkey. Crossfire honed their sound by combining power and thrash metal with the classical metal approach. Their Decisions of Hate (2002) demo was an underground favorite that lead them to hit the road for a massive tour including 2003 Metal Bash Festival in Hamburg, Germany. The band's performance in Germany lead them to contributing to The Revivalry - A Tribute To Running Wild released by Remedy Records in 2005 with Beggars' Night. In 2005 after the Besli Brothers had left the band, Crossfire decided to continue their vision for more creative and multi-faceted metal sound with the new line-Up: Kaya Sevinc, Ugur Aksoy, Kemal Sozer and Cem Saydam.</p>

<p>There are several issues with identifying Entheogenic drugs within an ancient society.</p>
<p>1. Identification of an Entheogenic substance. Was the substance smoked? Ingested?</p>
<p>2. Evidence of Entheogenic Inspiration within Artifacts. Does the artifact give direct evidence of drug use for Entheogenic purposes?</p>
<p>3. Artifact interpretation. As an observer of art that is 20,000 years old, are we seeing patterns that the original creator did not mean to create? In other words, do our own personal interests and biases alter the way we perceive artwork that may have not been intended by the author?</p>

<p>Entheogenic Drugs have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous historical reports as well as modern contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens.

<p>Mesoamerican Entheogenic drug use is the most iconic in popular consciousness. The Mayans, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well documented Entheogenic complexes. North American cultures, too, have long established traditions of entheogens.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../o/l/m/Olmec.html" title="Olmec">Olmec</a> (12,000 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Mayans. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based off of interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists are lead to believe that the Olmecs used entheogens for 3 reasons. 1. Burials of Bufo Toads with priests 2. The use of entheogens in later olmec inspired cultures 3. Sculptures of Shamans and other figures have strong Therianthropic imagery.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayans.html" title="Mayans">Mayans</a> (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even till the arrival of the Spanish. The Mayan religious tradition is extremely complex and very well developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Mayans have religious texts that have survived to this day. The Mayan religion displays characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 700 CE, give evidence that Mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way. The most direct evidence of Mayan entheogen use comes from modern descendents of the Maya, whom use entheogenic drugs today.</p>

<p>The Aztec Entheogen Complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of pshycoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Tenonacatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods, a Psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogen use of the Aztecs come from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the use of entheogenic drugs within Aztec culture and society.</p>

<p>There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of south western United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as Peyote in order to achieve visions and religious experiences.</p>

<p>During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars suggest that the Shanidar Cave (a Paleolithic site in Iraq) Flower Burial shows evidence of Shamanistic Death Ritual, but these claims are still being debated. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of artwork comes from Tassili, Algeria. From this region, there are several <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropic.html" title="Therianthropic">therianthropic</a> images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited affect of many hallucinatory drugs, Ego death). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom.</p>
<p>There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired.</p>

<p>Some researchers speculate that <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manna.html" title="Manna">Manna</a>, the food that which the Israeli tribes harvest, was actually an entheogenic drug. The Bible as quoted in Exodus 16:14 reads:</p>
<p>“And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.”</p>
<p>Some point to the similarities of Psilocybe and the biblical Description of Manna as evidence.</p>

<p>In the Vedas, the religious texts of the Hindu religion, the has been a lot of speculation on the nature of what <a href="../../../s/o/m/Soma.html" title="Soma">Soma</a>, the food of the gods, actually was. Below is a passage from the Vedas "Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truth speaking, truthful in thy works, Enouncing faith, King Soma!... O [Soma] Pavāmana, place me in that deathless, undecaying world wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.... Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where joy and felicities combine..." Scholars like R.G. Wasson and Terrence McKenna suggest that Soma is Fly Agaric, a mushroom commonly used by Siberian Shamans.</p>

<p><a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> refers to the movement led by various Nazi leaders, archaeologist, and other scholars, such as <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, to recreate the German past in order to strengthen nationalism. This movement was based on ideas of Tacitus’ Germania, which set out to bring the glory of the Roman Empire to the Germany. The start of the search for a strong founded national prehistory began after the humiliating loss of World War I in 1918 and was worsened by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. During this time period the country was in a financial and economical crisis and it was also the same time when Adolf Hitler began to rise to power. Although Hitler was behind the parties funding for German prehistorical research, the first inflectional prehistorian is said to be Gustaf Kossinna. The theories and ideas of Kossinna were also picked by the Nazi organization Amt Rosenberg and Germanen-Erbe. With the goal of findind proof of Germany as the start of civilization the Nazi Party were able to use psuedoarchaeology to manipulate the German people and past.</p>

<p>Gustav Kossinna was the main person responsible for the misuse of pre-history in Nazi ideology. Trained as a linguist at university in Gottingen, Leipzig, Berlin, and Strasbourg but eventually earned the chair for Germanic Archeology at the University of Berlin. Kossinna laid the ground theories for an ethnocentric German prehistory. One of his theories, Kulturkreis theory, stated that recognition of an ethnic region is based on the material culture excavated from a site. This theory gave the Nazi’s justification to try to take over of foreign lands such as the Poland and the Chez Republic. For example, in his article ‘The German Ostmark, home territory of the Germanen’ Kossinna argued that Poland should be a part of the German empire. This is because any land were an artifact was titled “Germanic” was declared to be ancient Germanic territory. Kossinna also made distribution that were useful tools for German territory expansion. In one of his most popular books Die deutsche Vorgeschichte-eine hervorragend nationale Wissenschaft (German Prehistory: a Pre-eminently National Discipline) Kossinna brings forward the idea of an Aryan superior to all peoples, the Germani, and shows Germany as the key to an unwritten history. The point of the novel is clear from the beginning as the dedication reads, “To the German people, as a building block in the reconstruction of the externally as well as internally disintegrated fatherland.” Kossinna also stated that cultural diffusion occurred from a “process whereby influences, ideas and models were passed on by more advanced peoples to the less advanced which they can into contact.” Kossinna’s Germanic ethnocentric theories aimed to present a history of Germany equivalent to that of the Roman Empire. As he points out, “Germanic people never destroyers of culture- not like the Romans- and the French in recent times.” Combined with Nazi ideology, this theory gave the perfect foundation for the belief of Germany occurring the leading position in world civilization. Kossinna died at in 1931, 13 months before Hitler seized power. This was the beginning for the prehistoric theories brought by the Third Reich.</p>

<p>This was an organization that dealt chiefly with excavation and the study of provincial Roman Germany. It was led by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Rosenberg_3df4.html" title="Alfred Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a> a Nazi Party ideologist who stated,“An individual to whom the tradition of his people and the honor of his people is not a supreme value, has forfeited the right to be protected by that people.” Rosenberg’s prospective on German prehistory led mainly to racist distortion of data, which did not directly apply to the Germanic people. Rosenberg’s book Der Mythos des 20. Jahrhunderts( The Myth of the 20th Century) gave Hitler the material he needed to move the public to the concept of a new Germanic religion. Rosenberg’s theory, Weltanschauungswissenschaften, stated it’s goal “...to transmit to the living essence of of the people of race-inherent values and, in the renaissance of German culture being carried out by National Socialism, to renew the growth of ancient branches on the tree of German-ness.” To do this he wanted to, “to this end the guiding principle in Germany must be to emphasize the high cultural level and the cultural self-sufficiency of the Germanic people.” His also tried to prove the existence of Atlantis and that Jesus was not a Jew. Another well know member of the group was Hans Reinerth who was the main archaeologist Resenberg used. Reinerth is famous for his excavations at the Federsee and he saw the Nazi Party a tool he could use to work his way up in society. This is just what occurred, in 1934 Rosenberg appointed him to the position of “Reich Deputy of German Prehistory.” This made him the spokesman for the “purification and Germanisations of the German prehistory. Reinert followed Hitler’s theory that Refered to the Greeks as Germans who had survived a northern natural catastrophe and evolved a highly developed culture in southern context by claiming to have found new evidence in Greece of Indogermanic migration to Greece during the Neolithic.Though, his theory never really came into full effect. This group along with the Ahnenerbe organization was used to the Nazi’s full advantage although Hitler himself criticized the group saying Rosenberg was a, “crack pot over world apostles’ who formulated ‘homemade Germanic myths.” Hitler also at his teatime conversations referred to Rosenberg’s novel as, “a narrow-minded Baltic German who tins in horribly complicated terms.”</p>

<p>Romlinge is the term used by the extremist in the 1930’s to refer to those who specialized in provincial Roman archaeology. These people were considered anti-German. They were also attacked by Alfred Rosenberg and the Amt Rosenberg. The Romisch Germanische Kommission in Mainz was the main object of ridicule by those following Kossinna and Rosenberg’s ideology.</p>

<p>This was an organization started as the Research Institute for the Prehistory of Mind and was forts connected to the SS in 1935 by Walther Darre. In 1936 is was attached to Hitler’s Reichsfuhere-SS and led by chief of police <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>. The main goals of the organization were: “1.to study the space, ideas and achievements of the Indo-Germanic people;2. to bring the research findings to life and present them to the German people; 3. to encourage every German to get involved in the organization.” Although the organization claimed to have a goal in research, Himmler had no official training in archaeology and was known for having interest I mysticism and the occult. Himmler defined the organization as working toward a prehistory that demonstrates the pre-eminent position occupied by the Germans and their Germanic predecessors since the beginning of civilization. He is quoted as saying, “A people lives happily in the present and the future so long as it aware of its part and the greatness of its ancestors.” The Ahnenerbe had a large problem in finding scientist to work on the projects and was run by mainly scholars from branches of humanities, which made their research more amateurish. The group went on to be responsible for psuedo-archaeology such as open-air displays of Germanic idolatry such as the Externsteine, a sandstone formation that was thought ot have been a key Germanic cult site. Another example is the Sachsenhain were allegedly 4500 Saxons were executed as a punishment for Widukind’s uprising. This site was used as an ideal shrine to the sacred Germanic people and their readiness for self-sacrefice. Many other cases were censored from the public since they did not have the correct Germanic interpretations. The sites choosen to excavate were limited to those of Germanic superiority such as Erdenburg were the Ahnenerbe claimed to have clear evidence of the victorious campaign of the Germani against the Romans. Just like the Amt Rosenberg the Ahnenerbe Organization was also utilized yet criticized by Hitler. As he stated,</p>
<p>“Why do we call the whole world’s attention to the fact that we have no past? It’s bad enough that the Romans were erecting great buildings when our forefathers were still living in mud huts; now Himmler is starting to dig up these villages of mud huts and enthusing over every potsherd and stone axe he finds. Ass we prove by that is that we were stil throwing stone hatchets and crouching around open fires when Greece and Rome had already reached the highest stage of culture. Instead Himmler makes a great fuss about it all. The present-day Romans must be having a laugh at these revelations.”</p>
<p>This is just another contradiction Hitler makes in his trip to prove German supremacy he seems to not even agree with the people he has put in charge.</p>

<p>The German people were drawn into the idea of the Germany as the origins of civilization through several things. For one there was a major video series put out by Lothar Zotz with titles like Threatened by the Steam Plow, Germany’s Bronze Age, The Flames of Prehistory, and On the Trail of the Eastern Germans. Also public journals gained popularity such as Die Kunde (The Message) and Germanen-Erbe (Germanic Heritage) proliferated. With the journals and videos the citizens thought they were being given good visuals and interpretations of different archaeological sites and the German prehistory. The Nazi’s also pushed the public to get involved in the search for the past. The Nazi’s used the appeal of patriotism as a tool to get the public involved in the prehistory hunt. For example, one amateur organizations membership flyer of the Amt Rosenberg stated, “Responsibility with respect to our indigenous prehistory must again fill every German with pride!” The goal of the organization was also stated as, “the interpretation and dissemination of unflasified knowledge regarding the history and cultural achievements of our northern Germanic ancestors on German and foreign soil.” Along with appealing to public patriotism there were open-air museums that reconstructed Neolithic and Bronze Age lake settlements at Unteruhldigen. This public musems also gained emense popularity and pushed the people to believe and search for there Germanic past.</p>

<p>Before the funding and push of Nazi Archaeology there was little knowledge of the subject and German prehistory. This made it even easier for the Nazi’s to push there ethnocentric views onto the uninformed public. Although the Nazi organization’s search appealed to the public it also appealed to the scholars. Scholars for archaeology had long been envious of the advancements in archaeology their neighbors to the near east had made. Before the Nazi rise to power there was little funding contributed to the study and with Hitler the funds were made available for scholars to make great advancements beyond their neighboring countries. Under the Nazi rule archaeology went from having one chair in prehistory in Marburg in 1933to having nine chairs in 1935. Once archaeology started gaining popularity scholars were also able to take out old ruins and display them in museums. The Romisch Germanisches Zentral Museum in Mainz became the Zentral Museum fur Deutsche Vor und Fruhgeschichte in 1939.Though it is ironic that once archaeology finally got reconiztion the archaeologists ended up doing more harm than good to the sites and the people. For example at the prehistoric site Biskupin, in Poland the Nazi destroyed the entire site.</p>

<p>Archeologist during the Nazi reign can be divided into three groups: the party-liners, the Mitlaufer, and the opposition.</p>

<p>The Party-liners or acquiescent used the Nazi reign to further their own careers by conducting “politically correct” research. These people are referred to as Germanomanen or Germanonmaniacs. These included people like Herman Weirt, co-founder of the Ahnernerbe Organization, who attempted to prove that northern Europs was the cradle of Western Civilization. Also, Hans Reinerth and Oswald Meghin who became high-ranking party officials due to their cooperation. Though most of this group was composed by second hand or untrained scientist backed up by amateur equivalents.</p>
<p><a name="The_Mitaufer" id="The_Mitaufer"></a></p>

<p>The Mitaufer was the group the majority of archaeologist fit into. This group was know as the group of passive fellow-travelers. These people taught what they were told to teach and accepted Nazi funds with no questions.By taking inaction this group allowed the Nazi party to gain more power.</p>
<p><a name="The_Opposition" id="The_Opposition"></a></p>

<p>The Opposition was the third party and these are those who had critical opposition of the regime. This group was a minority and most wree persecuted for race or political views. For example Gerhard Bersu an archaeologist was prematurely retired for not following NS ideology. Jewish prehistorians and other scholars were also forced to leave.</p>

<p>The affect of the false nationalism created by Nazi archaeology was a paralysis on the study of archaeology that continued decades past the war. As described by Wilhelm Unverzagt: “After Germany’s collapse it initially seemed virtually impossible to begin rebuilding the discipline with any hope of success. The new wielders of political power viewed prehistory with deep mistrust, an attitude which seemed understandable in view of the abuse of the results of prehistoric research on the part of National Socialist leaders with regard to questions of education and politics.” The surviving older generation was faced with a reduced student population after the war. Those students at universities were burdened with: “a humiliating defeat and the disorientation experience of being methodologically ‘deprogrammed’. There was neither time nor desire to examine the reasons for the ‘German prostitution of archaeology’”</p>

<p>Before C Money &amp; P Gunna started P.A both of these crooners were in a heavy fueled rivalry droping off cd's at each others mail boxes and passing cd's thru classmights filled with jabs at one another until the audience not only asked but demanded that the pair squash the beef and do a colaboration but instead they created one of the most successfull independent record labels in the game and still going strong today. When the dust was settled they knew they needed a 3rd member and in came Imax a friend of the 2 which had a huge role in getting the 2 crooners to barry the hatchet and start this unstoppable force. Today a Sublabel also exsist "P.A Music Group"</p>

<p>What makes seperates P.A from all other acts is they're way of aquiring and treatment of fresh new young talent refferd to as "Developmental Talent" or "D-Talent". Although most New/young talent dont sign to Pimp Audio records right away a sublabel was created in order to produce mixtape type albums which developmental talent can be heavily featured on or have they're own full length mixtape all to themselves. Past D-Talent were Prize, Marx, Brock, Druels, &amp; Beers. In September of 05 P.A made a change in the roster releasing all of the developmental talents from they're contracts a move that shocked many if not all of the talent signed. The only D-talent released that was contacted about a deal was Prize.</p>

<p>Through Pimp Audio Records P Gunna, C money ,Imax, and any other act signed at the time release they're official albums via website (now shutdown and moved to myspace). In early 2005 a Sublabel named "P.A Music Group" was created in order to release mixtapes from signed talent and D-Talent</p>

<p>Rumors were flying across messege boards and were confirmed that Pimp Audio was ready to sign another unknown artist known as Don P, but there was a twist with this deal because Don P and P Gunna are one in the same as both are alter egos and 2 different personas By Paul Delgado. A very strange and contraversial move by the label as they wanted Don P and P Gunna to be 2 different artist but be the same person. None the less the move proved to be a hit with fans as everyone is waiting in anticipation for Don P's 1st album "The R$B in Me"</p>

<p>MAID (Massive Array of Idle Disks) technology was first introduced in 2002 and, since 2003, has been gaining interest for both data protection and archive data storage. MAID operates on the principle that when long-term data is stored on disk, all disks don’t need to spin all the time. Instead, only those disks that contain data that is requested by a specific application are powered on, and then are powered off when they are not needed. Because MAID storage systems are “energy efficient,” they significantly reduce the power consumed by a storage array.</p>
<p>A MAID is usually constructed with low-cost Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) drives, which have shorter mean time between failures (MTBF) ratings than more expensive drives. To increase data availability, MAID can also provide traditional levels of RAID data protection – just like current disk arrays – giving the advantage of data protection that tape systems do not.</p>

<p>The Panamap (originally Dynamap, but name was changed) is a handleld map that uses a unique printing technique. Sometimes called a 'poor man's GIS,' the product make an impact in the design community, winning six awards in its first year. The New York City product shows different layers of thematic imagery depending on how it is viewed--subways, streets and neighborhoods are visible at different angles.</p>
<p>The product's wide appeal is due to the company's focus on information design and usability. Although it was sold in many high-end retailers (including MoMA in New York), rumors of the map's demise have spread.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is an artist and Flash designer famous for making impossible fictional creatures whose bodily structure and behaviour frequently reference death and sex. He produces fluid animation for both Flash movies and games, as well as illustrations and writing for on-line comics. Before making games, Edmund was an Animal Control Officer.</p>
<p><br />
He began his entertainment career through comics, cartoons and Flash games based around his fictional universe "The Badlands". Popular games in this series included "Carious Weltling" (which has enjoyed a sequel), the platform game "Clubby The Seal", his most recent release "Viviparous Dumpling" and various dress-up titles, mostly in his Dead Baby canon.</p>
<p><br />
His first major commercial breakthrough was Gish, a unique platforming game which won awards at the Independent Games Festival and paved the way for other Flash artists to get their games made into commercial products such as Tom Fulp and Dan Paladin's Alien Hominid (of Newgrounds fame) and Ryan Khatam's Johnny Rocketfingers.</p>
<p><br />
He has two websites: Thisisacryforhelp.com, which is his main homepage and hosts much of his work (it also used to host the forums, which now operate under the name of Elsewhere Forums), and Diverge.ws, a site he and Caulder Bradford (A.K.A. Riftmaster) run together which documents their most recent work.</p>
<p><br />
Thisisacryforhelp.com was taken down due to its association with 2 recent deaths linked to the suicide and serial killer quizzes that were once hosted on the site. the website now links to edmunds portfolio website coldstoragedesigns.com.</p>
<p><br />
His next up-coming projects are "Cereus Peashy", a game about a homicidal cactus who goes on a ritual killing spree and Blast miner an "action puzzle" game where you blow stuff up.</p>

<p>Alan Hill was a founding member of the legendary biker gang, The Dudes. Alan became the most well known of this gang due to his excessive wearing of leather outfits and red indian head gear</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://myspace-485.vo.llnwd.net/00076/58/40/76250485 l.jpg">Image:Http://myspace-485.vo.llnwd.net/00076/58/40/76250485 l.jpg</a></p>
<p>After Alan left The Dudes, he turned to his 3 favourite hobbys, flying planes, driving trains and authoring DVDs</p>
<p>The latter proved to be the most successful, as he could not fly a plane or drive a train without breakig his glasses, thus making him blind and a dangerous pilot.</p>
<p>Nowadays alan has retired to either his home in Nottingham, or his cardboard box outside Cherrys house in Norwich. He has repeatedly been spotted staring at Cherry through a peekhole in his box.</p>
<p>His Red Indian look is known to scare many people, however cherry finds it highly arousing, and has been quoted as saying 'Id love to see Alans gogglyfied eyes staring me in the face as he sticks his willy in my belly button'</p>
