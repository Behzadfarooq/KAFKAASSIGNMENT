<li><b>Keep</b>, though the definition originally in FOLDOC is indeed in jest, and describes a circumstance which cannot actually exist, the term is in common industry use as it shorthands an underlying truth to the nature of programming, and I've edited the article to (hopefully) more fully elucidate the use of the term, added a general example of usage, and provided an external link with a more concrete, real life example 146.115.56.101 08:31, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But you have to consider, Uncle G, that the word is taxonimic, though admittedly "shop talk". The related taxonomy, heisenbug, isn't up for deletion, arguably because heisenbugs are much more frequent, and (as some online usage reflects) people sometimes miscategorize schroedinbugs as heisenbugs. The word still labels a legit concept whose explanation requires encyclopedic depth. Alternative spellings "schrodinbug" and "shroedinbug" also get a dozen hits each (with the arguably more proper "schr√∂dinbug" also in contention), suggesting this is more a concept which gets thrown over the cubicle wall, not simply discovered from FOLDOC, even if its intepretation should remain for our purposes a primary source. Of course, what FOLDOC describes is much more like a unicorn (a very rarified taxonomy), though, to paraphrase Tom Stoppard, everyone who knows what's really being talked about here is a horse with an arrow through its head. 146.115.56.101 08:11, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>So, in case you genuinely don't understand, and not just playing dumb</i> I've noticed that bad writers often try to shift the blame for the confusion, ambiguity, and mystery they cause by insulting their readers. But you wouldn't know about that, would you?</dd>
<dd><i>Do you understand how this is can be interpreted as malice?</i> Sure -- if you <i>start off</i> assuming malice.</dd>
<dd>Quitting in disgust and coming back is proof of what? Well, that he got over it. If this is suspicious behaviour, I'll work up a (long) list for you of shady characters for you to watch, including <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">User:Ta bu shi da yu</a></dd>
<dd>I like the reasoning, though: he's nominating this for deletion for a <s>third</s> fourth time because he has a vendetta. The proof he has a vendetta? The fact that he's nominating it for a third time. Why is he nominating it for a <s>third</s> fourth time? Because he has a vendetta. Rinse, lather, repeat.</dd>
<dd>And the fact that he nominated this and not others proves what, exactly? It's a slight variation of the bogus rationale offered by hundreds of voters in past AfDs: namely, the whine "if the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>/one-horse town/trivial-in-my-opinion-subject article stays, so should mine": the appropriateness of this nomination has bugger all to do with other lack of nominations. If this (in your view) double standard upsets you, give me a list of other candidate articles, those running on the No-Hope Party ticket in the Riding of BFN that, gosh darn it, Spinboy <i>should</i> have nominated for deletion and I'll do the job myself: I've got some time to kill right and I can get right on it. Though be quick, I'm leaving in half-an-hour.</dd>
<dd>Maybe Spinboy has nominated this article for deletion because he thinks Neufeld doesn't rate an encyclopedia article? Yes, standards in an encyclopedia -- that's just crazy talk! As far as I'm concerned, if Mr. Neufeld wants free publicity for himself, he ought to check out MySpace or Geocities.</dd>

<li>It's obvious that I disagree with that view. I think that folks with direct knowledge of a subject should be contributing to the articles here. I'd see a serious problem if they were the only ones working on the articles, but the presence of "many eyes" on Wikipedia balances off any POV issues that such contributors may create. I've contributed to a lot of articles on Wikipedia where I'm not "at arms length" (such as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Alberta_41f1.html" title="Green Party of Alberta">Green Party of Alberta</a>), and provided detailed references when questions have been raised (such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html#Documenting_References_-_Not_Original_Research" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">on the article</a> being debated here). In any case, the previous two votes on this article have not found my auto-biographical contributions to be sufficient cause for deletion. As to the imposibility of auto-biographical NPOV, I encourage you to review the comments from Earl Andrew, Kevintoronto and gord on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">the article's talk page</a> as counterpoints to that view. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 07:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>It's obvious that I disagree with that view.</i> Whether you disagree with it is utterly immaterial, since this isn't your website, and your blatant self-interest/vanity/self-promotion/whichever doesn't trump long-standing policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:08, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is because there is no such policy. In fact during the recent debacle regarding Mr. Seigenthaler many people were critical of him because he did not simply change the innaccuracy himself and instead made a big deal out of it. It seems people desire to have it both ways on the autobiographical issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <i>President of Alberta Greens, candidate in Alberta general election, 2004) and founder (in 2000) of the first Revolutionary Knitting Circle (now an international activist movement).</i> are claims which make this individual notable in my view. People are allowed to edit articles about themselves as long as they remain neutral and while starting your own article is frowned upon, there's nothing forbidding you to do so.

<li><b>Delete</b>. That this has survived earlier discussion is astonishing: execrable self-promoting vanity page of an insignificant that heavily exaggerates asserted notbaility.

"President" is a position within the political party's <i>internal</i> structure, who's responsible for running the organization.

<li><b>Keep'</b> I don't see it as POV (although it is a bit heavy on the vanity front). I also think that the repeated nominations for deletion will eventually cause it to be deleted, if only because the ones seeking to have it deleted will keep coming back, but the people voting keep will eventually move on assuming that once the vote was settled, it was settled. I don't see how an article can be nominated for deletion after passing an AfD vote and the article not changing significantly.

<li>I have revised the article to remove the vanity aspect and make it more encyclopedic. In previous communications that I have had with Grant Neufeld, he has indicated that he understands and accepts that other editors will revise the article. This is no longer a "vanity article". As far as future attempts to delete this, if this attempt fails, it will be clear that future attempts will be bad faith nominations. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Mildly notable politician. The last AFD was a keep, and the precident stands. The only time a keep should be overturned, is if it was based on information that turned out to be false and/or unverifiable; or else if there was some kind of failure in process. The nominator shouldn't just keep redoing AFD's till they get what they want. Far to many articles and AFDs go without attention, because AFDs are clogged with these unfounded nominations. Note: if this article hadn't survived a prior AFD, it would have been entirely justified to nominate as this is a "week keep" level person. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sean Kelly and I worked our rear ends off on this. NC was the first sprite comic, and it is a neglected one (bad pun intended). 8-Bit Theater, Bob and George, PennyArcade, VGCats etc. have lots of stuff on the Wiki, and they do not see any deletion. To delete this would not only be an insult to those who worked on it, but to Jay Resop, Lord Reid, CodieKitty, and everyone else who put their time and efforts into making something that deserves far more attention than it gets. Brian Clevinger and other spriters get lots of praise and even appear at conventions. Jay doesn't get this kind of praise (in fact all he ever seems to get from something other than fans is ridicule). If someone were to make a list of Family Guy references (which are very similar to these), it wouldn't get deleted at all. Please save this page!

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've nothing against documenting cultural references to stuff in principle, and someone's obviously gone to a lot of effort over this, but I can't help feeling that this list is... well... useless. Webcomics, by their nature, tend to be full of pop-culture references, and a list of them is rather like a list of joke punchlines with the questions left out. The difference between this list and a list of cultural references on Family Guy is that Family Guy humour is mainly situational and surreal, not pop-culture-based, and therefore a list of cultural references is more manageable. Basically, I can't think why someone would read this list instead of reading the webcomic, which is, after all, free. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 14:46, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the difference lies in the difference between "characters" and "cultural references." Characters are easily verifiable and it is easy to decide what is significant enough for an article. Also, I would argue that they are more the "heart" of the webcomic. Cultural references, on the other hand, are generally going to form a boundless list of unrelated things, which probably aren't of interest to many people outside of the initial creator. It's impossible to decide which are verifiably significant enough to warrant consideration. Also, they seem more tangential to any discussion of "What is Neglected Mario Characters?" If the characters section on the main article got too big, I don't think many would argue with spinning that off as has been done with Bob and George.

<dd>Google doesn't support the idea that "Straight community" is used to label this distinct subset of the population. People who believe that usually term themselves "pro-family" or whatnot. The "straight community" hits I find on Google are all being used by gay organizations to talk about a general gulf in understanding between gays and straights - i.e., "educating the straight community" -"the straight community's views."

<li><b>Comment</b>. What do you suggest for a notability guideline for memes? "All Your Base" received broad coverage in the MSM, including an article in the <i>LA Times</i>.

<li>I hate to take the "I know it when I see it" route, but when I see otherwise notable memes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Prime_Number_Shitting_Bear" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Prime_Number_Shitting_Bear" rel="nofollow">Prime Number Shitting Bear</a> get deleted, it makes me wonder what happens. The delete votes come mostly from "Well, *I* haven't heard of it" or comparing it to the most popular memes like All Your Base. Much like you wouldn't judge the notability of, say, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apples_in_Stereo_2422.html" title="The Apples in Stereo">The Apples in Stereo</a> via a comparison with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a>, it's tough to compare internet memes with their better-known counterparts. So, in a situation such as this, the 13k Google hits alone should raise a few eyebrows as to why we're deleting it. In a situation like the Prime Number Shitting Bear, the Google test doesn't work as well as it's an older meme. Some sort of guidelines should possibly be put into place, but I'm not sure if there's an easy way to quantify them, either. It doesn't excuse misguided delete votes on notable memes, however. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 15:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wasn't advocating using "All Your Base" as the standard. I'd just like to know where others might draw the line. I hadn't heard of this meme, I haven't seen any MSM coverage of it, and for a leet phrase it doesn't seem to be all that widespread. Nor do I think that Wikipedia needs to include many memes; leave that stuff to urbandictionary. | Klaw <small>¬°digame!</small> 15:25, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

It's been on the web for almost a decade, it has a really large community and I believe that the site's subject is rather unique. I can see your guys' point in deleting it to prevent vandalism..but we can also protect pages..if it goes out of hand (I got this article protected once). So just to make sure, I'm not a big fan of the constant adding of non-notable descriptions (for example, thorough descriptions of its moderators), and I don't like the high rate of vandalism either..but for every vandal there's a vandalfighter.

<dd>This article is not solely informational due to its large collection of textfiles. It is informational for being a popular website and forum that is (for all intensive purposes) unique; for example, an article on your downtown Blockbuster might be not notable, but an article on the company <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blockbuster_Video_31b0.html" title="Blockbuster Video">Blockbuster</a> which rents DVDs <em>is</em> notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> The difference between the Blockbuster in question and this site is that the many things in this collection are people, which are also the primary viewers of Wikipedia. If there were to be a wiki for DVDs to look up information, then they would probably like to have your Blockbuster on their site. That didn't make any sense, but that's beside the point.

<li><b>WITHDRAWN</b>. OK, looks better now. But, when that original article looked like it took more than 13 minutes to create in the first place, I would ask those who submit articles to not just dump website bios on the screen and start working from there. Or put in some sort of edit summary notice that it's a work in progress and you will establish notability later on. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:37, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ideally, people should do what you are saying, but often they are first-time editors who don't have a clue about how things work here or the supposed notability requirements. You might want to try starting a dialogue when you see rapid editing going on rather than immediately tagging for AfD. The general standard, I've been told, is to wait at least 30 minutes from article creation before AfD.

<p>This article is very well written, but I don't think it merits a place on Wikipedia. It's mostly OR/speculation, and it's pretty generic as well, since there's bound to be some small-scale 'rivalry' between any cities that are close to one another.

<p>Page was created because of the small controversy generated by the ad mentioned in the article (certainly for no other reason).

<ul>
<li>No desire on my part to suppress anything. But not every little blurb of hyperbole or event that makes it to the fifth story on a twenty-four-hour news blotter deserves an article in an encycolpedia, even one as expansive as Wikipedia. The "controversy" generated by the ad was simply not a notable event, nor does it make the Club a notable organization. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 05:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point, but can not agree. The event happened. It was covered nationwide, maybe around the world. Like the Palm Beach ballot, it is now part of history and thus must remain here. I also strongly oppose the proposed merge below, because I don't think we can saddle the State party with the actions of this club. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your point of view, but I do not think your comparison is relevant. This event, which received ephemeral and unsubstantial attention, was nowhere near as notable, important, and indeed historic as the Palm Beach ballot controversy. I also oppose the merge below for reasons I outline there. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 05:26, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't think you mean <i>unsubstantial</i> as the event was covered by USA Today, CNN, MSNBC, The Associated Press, The Guardian newspaper in the UK and countless other media. A check on Newsbank, also shows that the club has been a longtime player in Saint Petersburg politics. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do indeed mean unsubstantial, as the substance of the thing should not be measured by how many news organizations picked it up on the AP wire. As Last Malthusian's writes below, "it was blown out of proportion when it created a brief media storm and we're blowing it out ten times more by recording it in an 'encyclopaedia' article for posterity. Basically, this wasn't a notable incident, this club has no other claim to fame, therefore it's non-notable." <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 20:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition, while I have not searched on Newsbank, I did go to the <i><a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_Times_88c3.html" title="St. Petersburg Times">St. Petersburg Times</a></i> website and executed an archives search (covering 1987-2005). The <i>Times</i>, Florida's largest daily, is <i>the</i> authority on St. Petersburg politics, and would have reported on the club repeatedly if it were a player (the way it reports on, for example, the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club, which is the biggest political organization in the city). The archives search, however, returned only two articles not related to this "controversy," both mentioning the club in passing in brief candidate bios in a voter's guide the Times produces before elections. The club is definitely not a "player." <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 20:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I can see that you are virulently opposed to this article. However, as the Guardian called this event- <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/comment/story/0,14259,1194121,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/comment/story/0,14259,1194121,00.html" rel="nofollow">the <b>biggest political story in America</b></a>, it deserves full explanation here. Even if the story only lasted five minutes on a slow news day. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:26, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would not call my opposition to the article "virulent," and I hope that our give-and-take in the discussion of its merits hasn't come off that way to you. I certainly don't want this to descend into ad-hominem remarks. As far as the characterization of the event in the <i>Guardian</i>, however, its suggestion that this was for "one brief moment... the biggest political story in America" must be taken in context. The suggestion was written up in a British broadsheet's "Observer" column as part of a general commentary on the early nastiness of American campaigns. In fact, it does not actually provide much evidence for the main arguments of the <i>Guardian</i> if you consider the column as a whole. Also, that the <i>Guardian</i> preoccupied itself beyond reason with a suggestion by one small independent group in the United States that Secretary Rumsfeld be assassinated should surprise no one familiar with the paper's openly acknowledged biases on the left. There are no hard feelings or vested interests on my side. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 22:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A discussion of the media spin given the event- from both the left and the right- would be a perfectly valid way of expanding the article. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:37, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with the article on the Florida Democratic Party. At the very least change the name to avoid confusion with the other Saint Petersburg (y'know, that place in Russia). <i>Dodging accusations of Anglo-American bias and fleeing before things get hot...</i> <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we read the newspaper article that JJay supplied to substantiate the event's importance, we would note that the Club received a Charter from the FDP, but nothing else. I live in Florida, and these clubs operate fairly independently. It wouldn't really be relevant to the FDP organization. At any rate, if the vote really is to keep, then changing the name to "St. Petersburg Democratic Club" (after all the official and full formal name of the city and the club) would be my first priority. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EALC_Washington_9b31.html" title="User:ALC Washington">ALC Washington</a> 05:26, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>New addition, I see. It's enough to make me think. Your suggested change is not sufficient. The state of Florida should be in the title because Wikipedia has a global audience. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:38, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alas, life is not a caring matron. Nor is Wikipedia, as evidenced by countless deletions of not notable band articles. (Or are you to argue that we should coodle those people for being ever so kind enough to let us be aware of their worthless bands or geekish knowledge of the obscure?) I am well-qualified at determining the place of "Ghost Gaunlets", though. It only appears for fifteen seconds in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Enemy_5158.html" title="The Ultimate Enemy">The Ultimate Enemy</a>".

<li>I do not doubt for one second your <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Phantom_2f41.html" title="Danny Phantom">Danny Phantom</a> qualifications and expertise regarding <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Enemy_5158.html" title="The Ultimate Enemy">The Ultimate Enemy</a>, which would probably be an excellent final resting place for Ghost Gaunlets. Think of how much time would have been saved, though, had you pursued that course, a merge and redirect, rather than AfD. We have now discussed the issue far longer than the entire lifespan of said Ghost Gaunlets, a fact that I find somewhat ironic. In any case, the issue is now out of our hands, as it will be decided by future voters, some of whom may be members of worthless bands or devotees of geekishly obscure knowledge. Furthermore, I do not believe we should <i>coodle</i> any of life's uncaring matrons, just the really nice ones who greet you with a warm cup of tea when they invite you in for a spot of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Phantom_2f41.html" title="Danny Phantom">Danny Phantom</a> -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:52, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This game is currently patent pending in the United States. I am indeed both the creator of the article and the game. I wrote the article with the intent of allowing abstract gaming enthusiasts the chance to learn the game without having to wait for the patent. I am awaiting the patent before I create a website to promote the game. Once the website is created Google will have a listsing for the game. I should stress that I am not using wikipedia as an advertisement for the game as I will not be selling the game. As an abstract gaming enthusiast I am more than willing to share any game I create with world. - JeremiahClayton</p>
<p>I sort of feel bad saying this, but Wikipedia also is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball, and your game may not achieve the notability worthy of Wikipedian webspace (which, in my experience, must cost a lot of money), so I have to say that as it currently stands, the article should be <b>delete</b>d. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson">CorbinSimpson</a> 09:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You can patent a game design (for example, if you were the first person to invent chess). So if it's new, useful and nonobvious; you could probably get a patent on a game you invented.

<p>I am not sure if you can patent a video game but in that this is a board game.. that question is not important for this discussion. If the article must be deleted.. it happens. I disagree however with the idea that a board game must achieve some level of notability to be included on Wikipedia. There are countless articles that pertain to relatively unknown topics.. which to me.. is what makes Wikipedia better than the average encyclopedia. I also believe that a patent alone is enough to warrant an article in that it is a reliable source of information. Especially in a circumstance where the game will not be manufactured and was copyrighted only for the purpose of preventing others from profiting on what should remain a free game. I understand that as of now the article must be deleted.. but I have no doubt that it will one day again takes it's place along side other abstract game articles. - Jeremiah Clayton</p>

<p>User:Wjkellpro replied: Hi <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a>! Thanks for clarifying your opposition to my article <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_logic.html" title="Progressive logic">Progressive Logic</a>. But I think you give me way too much credit for original research and thinking. This article does not breach the limits on original research for several reasons. First, it follows to the ‚Äút‚Äù the established meaning of ‚Äúvalues,‚Äù ‚Äúvalue reasoning,‚Äù and ‚Äúlogic‚Äù as these are explained in wikipedia under <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_S._Hartman_e27d.html" title="Robert S. Hartman">Robert S. Hartman</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_science.html" title="Value science">value science</a>.</p>
<p>Second, I‚Äôm not refering to a ‚Äúconcept,‚Äù such as ‚Äújustice,‚Äù or ‚Äúgood,‚Äù or ‚Äúevil,‚Äù but to the process of reasoning that progressives use in the course of weighing the relative importance of public policy options and proposals. I have used the term ‚Äúprogressive logic‚Äù merely to summarize this process of value reasoning, which is as old as the hills.</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressivism</a> gives some indication of the value reasoning of progressives. Also such historians as Richard Hofstadter, Gabriel Kolko, and Howard Zinn provide books full of examples of the way progressives have reasoned about their policy choices. Progressive social critics, like Erich Fromm and Charles A. Reich also follow ‚Äúprogressive logic,‚Äù but without using that exact term (as far as I know).</p>
<p>I can see now that I should have included a selected bibliography to give the reader a clearer sense that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_logic.html" title="Progressive logic">Progressive Logic</a> simply describes a reasoning process followed by progressives. I‚Äôm sure the writers above (who are still alive) would agree that there is no debate among social critics and social scientists about the existence of this reasoning process, because its existence is so obvious to all who have studied progressive politics.</p>
<p>After I put in a more complete ‚Äúreferences‚Äù section, I‚Äôm sure your objection will be met, and that you‚Äôll withdraw your opposition. Just wait and see.Wjkellpro 01:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Shrink to paragraph and Merge into Progressivism</b>, I've changed the framing of the first few paragraphs to reflect this as a thesis, and not a peer-reviewed political theory. Dr. Kelleher, I'm intrigued by your ideas, but I think they need a little more support before something this large has a place on this site. I consider myself to be a very strong progressive, and much of this article is duplicated in your book, so doesn't really need to be added to Wikipedia on its own. A single paragraph referencing your thesis on the Progressivism page would be more appropriate.

But, in many California cities, there is a city council that rules the city, and some hire a city manager to deal with internal affairs. In that situation, you usually draw straws to see who is "mayor of the month," since it is mainly a title that has little meaning.

<li><b>Comment</b> He's 35 years old. He graduated from one of the world's leading classical music conservatoires 11 years ago, and undertook advanced studies at another of them back in the late 1990s (I think), so "just a student" is incorrect. If he has really given a recital at St John's Smith Square, which is one of the main concert halls in London, appeared as the solo violinist in concerto performances, and recorded CDs, then he is notable.

<li>I'm really unsure about that; and also, honestly, how much worth is to this list? Who's going to look at it and go "oh wow, I had no idea Chris Farley was fat! you learn something every day!" A person's weight is immediatley apparent, and this kind of list would mostly be based on public perception, not fact. As such, what's its value, if all the contents are already in the public's mind? Finally, why the hell does this even matter? Save for a handful of comedians, these people's weight is of absolutely no consequence to their notability. Also, what do we do about people like, say, Kristie Allie? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 08:51, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look, I'm not saying that I have all the answers, but while we know that Farley was fat without the list, isn't the same true for height, race and many other criteria listed at Wikipedia? Yet, editors find these lists very useful and appealing. From the intellectual standpoint, the list is achievable within wikipedia policy guidelines. Therefore, I can't vote against it. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have no problem with the term "overweight" which is not necessarily defamatory. However, I think that it should be careful of inclusion.

<p>No, it is in fact complete nonsense. On the one hand, the article is incoherent -- his claim is that the attack is caused by an ICMP packet, but his examples use flags which are only applicable to TCP packets. He also claims that you can introduce crippling latency on a remote network using TCP packets sent to a LAN broadcast address. Both claims are laughable to anyone with even a passing knowledge of TCP/IP networking. On the other hand, even if you fixed the terminology issues in the article, the simple fact is that the exploit he claims, does not work.

<p>Hello, I am the original author of the Wikipedia entry. I am also the original author of the write up, Justin M. Wray, and I am the one who did all the research. I laugh at the fact that you guys claim "its not original research". Are you claiming I stole the information? I am claiming it as my own? Well the research is all original. I did do it all myself. And the tests were all conducted by me, with the help of a few others mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>The article is as "wikiworthy" as the original LAND post, which is also on wiki I might add. I was going to contact someone from the defacing team (or whatever the name may be). As some users from digg.com continue to deface the site. They claim they can not get the exploit to work, which I am not disputing, however I have been receiving endless emails from people claiming they got it to work. I had help testing it both from my employer and a College professor in the Networking/InfoSec field. The exploit is far from "bogus".</p>
<p>ICMP vs TCP. Both work, I 'was' planing to make that a bit more clear, yet every time I go to edit the wikipage, I have to fix the SPAM people are leaving. The flags are for the TCP packet but if you send enough ICMP packets it will do the same, it takes about 30 seconds longer or so, so it seems.</p>
<p>This is not a normal "Ping of Death"</p>
<p>Yes I edited the LAND entry to add a link to the new discovery. Its important, home consumers are vulnerable, and its big news in the Security field. If you take a look at the links on the current wiki page about RLA, you will see many big names are talking about it. One is Dave, from the ICANN security counsel. (ICANN is in charge of giving out IP address).</p>
<p>Someone said to merge with the original LAND attack. I am not adverse to that over deletion, but the attacks are only similar in nature, the original could not be done over the Internet, where the Remote LAND Attack can. To me this means they should be separated, but linked to one and other.</p>
<p>I thought wikipedia was an encyclopedia, for the sharing if information and knowledge. I have seen far less important articles. I am shocked to see wikipedia take such actions, this is only hindering education. I know for a fact, if the page stays, it will be used in many college classes, and even training at work. This is an important part of Internet history, even if its inter works are foreign to the average users, the end results are not.</p>
<p>I have more to say, but I will allow you to read and refute the above first.</p>
<p>BTW: Its not "super-nerdy computer-attack thing", its a network perimeter devices exploit. And the sad part is, your "router" is most likely susceptible to attack. Hope the vendors take this more serious then some of you have.</p>
<p>Its funny how hundreds of kids can play in a pool, but let one pee in it and all the funs over. Remember, a lot of people have recreated this attack, and only a handful are saying its bogus...</p>

<p>Okay, ive just about had it with all of the stupid comments left by the people who have no clue what they are talking about. They may THINK they do, but they really dont. Im Matthew Wines, i helped with the testings of this exploit and i verify that it works. The very first object tested was my Westell VersaLink 327W (the one Verizon sent me with DSL). When we first tested the exploit it worked, this was to our surprise. We then tested a couple different things and couldnt re-create the exploit and were very discouraged. Then we adjusted some other settings and tried again, it worked. So we moved on to test others to see if it would only work with my VersaLink. However, it worked with Synisters Atlanta DPX2100. That is when he released the exploit information to his college professor, who allowed him to test it on a couple other things. It worked each time. We did lots of tests and would not release or makeup a stroy like this. If you notice, when i was talking about my VersaLink, we DID NOT get it to work every time for the first time. However, once we found the perfect settings, we could reacreate it just about every time. So please dont post your stupid immature spam garbage and accusations, if you would do a better part to society and play World Of Warcraft for 3 days straight then jump out of a 29 story window when someone "Ninjas" your Trinket.... Thank You to everyone who gets this exploit to work, who actually tries it, and does not display themselves as a complete and total fool.</p>

<li><b>"Keep It"</b> by TAB - This show is on TLC, on a special called "I Am My Own Twin". I am watching it right now, on TLC which happens to be a division of the Discovery Channel networks - <b>yes, TLC</b>, and it was on a month or two ago as well. I would think that TLC tries hard to validate the stories that they show. Lydia was not the only person featured on the show. There was another woman named Karen Keegan who had the same Chimera DNA issue, as well as the case of a baby born as a hermaphrodite. I've never known TLC to be a National Enquirer type network that shows false things. As for the google search, there are two other links on the results page that bring her up under the topic of chimera. So, she is out there in the search engine. The TLC show doesn't list the people featured on their show, otherwise her name would probably show up there if they listed names. I'm sure you could simply contact the TLC network to verify this story. I don't see what the big deal is with verifying this when it's already been featured on a major cable network such as TLC. <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC" class="external free" title="http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC" rel="nofollow">http://tlc.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=111185&amp;gid=0&amp;channel=TLC</a> <small>‚Äî<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 24.17.20.143 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.17.20.143_aaa6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.17.20.143">contribs</a>) 07:59, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>Original research ("This page was started by me"). I can't find verification online - if someone more knowledgeable can rewrite that'd be great but I don't think there's anything salvageable here.

<p>The reference to Gyalpo can be found. On the Dorje Shugden page, you have to go to the discussion and there you find at the bottom of the page, a long article that explains in scholarly manner that "(in Tibetan 'gyalpo' meaning king, a type of ghost)" on line five of the article. The article is the last one on the page. It starts with "Jeff Watt, the Webmaster for Sakya Resource..." and is entitled "Do Shakyas rely on Dorje Shugden?" This takes you to the page&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kelsangpagpa" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kelsangpagpa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kelsangpagpa</a></p>
<p>Anyways, I'll refer to the people who are interested in this subject over there and among Tibetan-following folks, and see what approach would be best to break down the subject for Wiki. All the best to you, and also thinks for the advice about Gyalpo. Geir Smith. It's funny, I just sent this same message a few minutes ago but it didn't seem to register right now.</p>

<li>Gasp&#160;! What's that link I just sent&#160;!!! Noooo&#160;! the links must have mixed up.

<p>The page is now formatted for new edition along the start-up lines. The new format will be worked out with various people who can work out a collegial manner of writing the article. It's thoguht to become a non-sectarian approach but along the lines the people themselves choose. It's just in the project stage now. Renaming the project as Gyalpo enables to get out of the check-mate that the originally named project is mired in. Things are thus back at step one.</p>
<p>Thanks to you for understanding the difficulty of entering an encyclopedic work. Advice taken and appreciated. Geir Smith.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll start reediting the page according to encyclopedia norms. The page should thus probably define the verifiable sources behind it's title first and then move on to support that verifiable source with a developped research on it.I'll go slowly on this rather than do things backwards - which is to first put a lot of material online and then hope for correcting later, from others, as I was more or less expecting. I'll thus spruce up the existing links to the first bit there to start out slowly and go from there. G.S.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Listcruft" is a neat way to summarise "an indiscriminate collection of information", in the same way you see the terms gamecruft, moviecruft and any other cruft being used. In this regard it <i>is</i> a reason for deletion. p.s. I'm not arguing from a standpoint of usefulness. Perhaps someone somewhere out there would find the potentially useful, I don't know. What I <i>am</i> saying is that it isn't encyclopedic. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 11:25, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Zunaid. I also think that a useful guideline for lists is that there should be at least a reasonable chance that they will be largely complete at some point. With this list, there is no chance whatever of that happening. That's why the term 'indiscriminate' is applicable in this case. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> 11:38, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Various good reasons which are not listed under Wikipedia rules: there is consens among cavers to be very carefull when publishing about wild caves. It is not a good idea to have random wild caves listed on a platform as popular as Wikipedia. The two main reasons are to protect natural resources and animals living in the cave, and second to protect the readers from getting harmed in dangerous wild caves.</p>
<p>The article is a stub, there is too much to do, which will most likely not be done by a caver (if they are serious). But others are not qualified to write this article.</p>
<p>Vanity: the article is not of use to anybody. The reader will not be able to visit the cave and it has nothing special, why it should be listed. If it had something special (eg geologic or biologic) this specialty should be listed on Wikipedia, not the cave.</p>
<p>And finally: there are probably half a million wild caves on earth. There is no reason why this one should be listed and others not. But on the other hand there is no sense in listing all the wild caves in Wikipedia, there are other institutions which do this, they are called cave registries.

<li><b>Comment</b>‚ÄîI think only the last two rationales have merit. The first argument in particular is utterly against Wikipedia purpose and policy, because we do not censor information to "protect" people from it. It's a good idea to have <i>notable</i> wild caves listed on Wikipedia...but is this one notable? Are all named caves notable? I would like to hear an explanation as to why this cave should be documented in an individual article rather than just merged back into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_caves_in_Australia_1ce0.html" title="List of caves in Australia">List of caves in Australia</a>‚Äîis there anything special about it, or can it only be justified if <i>all</i> named caves are documented? And what is the source of the name? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 14:36, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>‚ÄîI agree, but I guess I did not make it clear enough: there are cavers who try to hide any information about wild caves which is definitely censoring. And a desaster from the scientific point of view. However, the idea is not to protect people from information, but to protect nature, to save our heritage for future generations. I would very much appreciate articles on wild caves which are of historic/geologic/... interest, allready published, famous, or especially if they are protected by other means: a solid gate for example. This is not the case here. AFAIK this cave is only protected by its remote location. And to make it clear: it is useless to list arbitrary cave names in lists like the above mentioned. --Jduckeck 15:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<li>I just checked, and apparently the relevant school district operates only two schools. After completing grade 8, the students have to go to a school operated by a different district, or a private one, in order to go to high school.

<li><b>Delete</b> This entry is (in my opinion) one of the most egregious examples of <b>self promotion</b> I've ever come across in Wikipedia. The tenuous connection to the Wang family is ludicrous. Does the daughter of John D. Rockefeller's attorney also have an entry? Article has <b>NO SOURCES</b> and fails to establish any degree of relevance. The two links that were posted don't even reference the subject. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.239.255.248 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.239.255.248_edce.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.239.255.248">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I know for a fact that Ms. Carkhuff was present as a guest at the Emmy's, the VMA's, and on Howard Stern. I have recently submitted these to IMBD and they should be updated soon. I think it is best to wait and see if this verifiable source can be added to the page before it is subject to deletion. I also believe the above comment (the source claiming to be Ms. Carkhuff is false and is just someone who is either jealous or doesn't know how to create a valid argument and wants this article deleted). I agree with the person who said this article might as well remain, for the same reason there is a Kimberly Stewart article or articles about the younger boy Hilton siblings who have never done anything except been born priveleged. There is a new generation of celebrities arising, and that is of people who are rich and have high class family ties; and even if it is unfortunate, there are people want to know about these people. Ms. Carkhuff appears to be one of these people, so I would not consider this self-promotion, but an article about yet another socialite who is not as well known as socialites like Kimberly Stewart, etc. yet. So I vote for Don't Delete on these grounds. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Thesocialite (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesocialite_142a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesocialite">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> As a regular wiki surfer, I came across this page through the American Socialites category. I understand the argument about no references and few hits using different internet searches, but there are many models, socialites, etc. that it would be difficult to come across internet sources for. Not every event, public appearance at a nightclub/benefit or even the event itself will turn up in your internet searches. I personally know a high-fashion runway model, who could possibly be considered a "socialite" even though he has no family ties, who has worked with many reputable agencies such as DNA, etc. that does not produce any internet hits. I tend to agree with the person above me. "Celebutaunte," "socialite," and being famous just for the family you were born into or the people you know is a generally new concept that has been brought to light by Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, etc. Previously you would have said, why should Nicole Richie get her own page, she is merely the daughter of Lionel Richie; there are other examples of people who are in this category simply because of there family. Instead of trying to delete people that could belong to this "American socialites" category, I would like to see it expanded. This is a rising new concept that deserves merit in its own right. I, and I'm sure other users, would like to know who is out there living these life styles, knowing these people, etc.; of course, there will also be people that are jealous or find no interest and want such pages deleted. I wouldn't say that this is a page of self-promotion; why would a person of status waste time and create their own wikipedia page? They obviously caught the interest of someone else, and the page has been edited by several different people. As for "tenuous connections" and "famous neighbors," I think that is merely explaining the source of wealth (Hilton from Hilton hotels) and the area Ms. Carkhuff is from, respectively. As for sources, some verifable sources are bound to come up eventually. So my verdict, don't delete.

<p>Looking back at the original article, it seems to be circulated around cover bands and ‚ÄúBigg Trouble‚Äú, which when entered into google "Bigg Trouble cj marsicano" only returns results from posts cj marsicano has made on various sites and indeed his own personal websites.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the subject of this article, but certainly not its creator. As a matter of fact, it was my discovery of this when I googled my name (just my name - none of my old bands obviously have sites online) that led to my getting involved with Wikipedia as a contributor. I had some notoriety as part of the informational part of the dot-com boom, mainly with bigger and/or early sites related to sports entertainment, which is, I am guessing, what led to the article being created. I did add to some of my article at some point (somehow managing to keep an NPOV, thank you very much) but that's about it. I didn't link to any of my techno CD releases or create articles about them in order to avoid possible non-NPOV issues. I am flattered that this article was created about little old me, so honestly I would be quite offended if the article about me was deleted.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>All that aside, I have reason to believe that this article is being nominated for deletion out of some sort of grudge. I questioned some of the heavyhanded recategorizing of sites I was monitoring by the person bringing up the article about me for deletion, <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">User:Deathrocker</a>, with an administrator that he had tangled with, as a cursory look at the individual's talk history, which he conveniently whites out on a regular basis, reveals that he has tangled in the past rather vehemently with those that disagree with him. I did choose not to bring anything up on his talk page given that fact, and chose to contact an admin in semi-private instead. I am not surprised, therefore, that Mr. Deathrocker, rather than contact me in private, chose to attack me in virtual public. I should think that there is some sort of Wikipedia guideline against this sort of thing (suggesting an item for deletion based on a grudge). --<a href="../../../c/j/m/User%7ECjmarsicano_e47e.html" title="User:Cjmarsicano">Cjmarsicano</a> 16:30, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This one's a close call. Had this been written by a third party and referenced, it probably would have been kept as the subject barely makes the notability bar with his ECW activities alone. But the original author of the article Downwiththebass seems to be the same person as <a href="../../../c/j/m/User%7ECjmarsicano_e47e.html" title="User:Cjmarsicano">Cjmarsicano</a> as the former's sole contributions are this article and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francine_Fournier_fa11.html" title="Francine Fournier">Francine Fournier</a>, and two deletion votes. This makes it a vanity article. Lack of referencing hurts here, too. <b>Weak delete</b> and hope that it's recreated by a third party who will reference the stuffing out of it and keep the focus on the ECW activities as the later sections would indicate less notability, not more. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 19:45, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also for the record, as for further notablilty, that will probably be coming next year as I have two EPs and a single, all in the same techno vein as my first EP (which is out of print as a physical album but may be reissued.). I am well aware that Wikipedia isn't meant for promotional purposes, so I hope it's becoming more obvious that I am respecting what this site is for.

<dd>"A third party to recreate..." Any volunteers? Is that possible? I don't want to feel like I'm comissioning an authorized biography or anything.</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>: This is an unwikified list that could potentially reach ridiculous length. The title is grammatically incorrect. Real names are already available within specific articles, rendering this list unnecessary. The list also fails to cite sources, and is already erroneous - "The Undertaker" is said to have the real name "Mark Callaway", when extensive research has indicated that his name is actually <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Calaway_8822.html" title="Mark Calaway">Mark Calaway</a>. There are also some privacy concerns where particular wrestlers are involved. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 16:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Move</b> to List of real names of professional wrestlers, cleanup. Most lists would be unnecessary if the mention of the information on individual pages was sufficient (see, e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_21e5.html" title="List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States">List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States</a>; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Presidents_by_time_as_former_president_f187.html" title="List of U.S. Presidents by time as former president">List of U.S. Presidents by time as former president</a>); errors can be corrected; professional wrestlers are public figures, so privacy concerns are far down the list (besides, we're not listing addresses and social security numbers here!). <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 16:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The NEW page "Hex (board game) (Buy a rollup vinyl Hex board)" is now linked to from the page "Hex (board game)" in the "Physical sets" section. This new page contains no link or reference to any retailer.</p>
<p>This new page is not to be confused with the page under discussion, which has one fewer set of parentheses.</p>
<p>Whichever page you use, if you merge it with the main Hex (board game) page, that's a large image which many users are sure to complain about. They complained about (and removed) my POV-Ray Hex board image (see the discussion page for Hex (board game)), so someone is sure to complain about this image which is less relevant.</p>
<p>Maybe this new page is considered to have an even more awkward title? What other title should I use? It is intended as a side note for the "Physical sets" section. It doesn't take up much room.

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s> It doesn't belong at MA - that's for onscreen factoids only - as Bravo Fleet extrapolates and contains non-canon elements (such as ship designs), it would be deleted at MA. As for its position on WP... It's true that it appears to fail to meet the targets you specify, but I believe that it is seen by many as the most notable group in Star Trek RPG (and I am not a gushing fan and member in case you were wondering&#160;:) ). The group creator has been interviewed by About.com, appeared on I-SciFi and the group was featured in the book, "The Incredible Internet Guide for Trekkers." Given these references, plus others and the fact that Wikipedia is (as always, it seems) reviewing what constitutes "noteworthiness," I'd just lean over towards keeping. This is clearly not Microsoft visability level, but I feel it is notable to the online &amp; Trek community, both of which are large groups of people. - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 17:38, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I've just finished looking at some similar afd's (one of which was nominated by myself), have checked the Bravo Fleet site and forums and have reconsidered my position. First, Bravo Fleet (the website) merely serves as a hub for the simming group itself. The majority of 'business' conducted concerning the group is not seen here. I don't mean the emails that relay back and forth with any co-maintained website, but this. Bravo Fleet rules state that every individual game must have its own website. Looking at the group's posted stats, that's 186 websites. Add to this forums and posting groups and the numbers suddenly shoot up. We can't measure the combined visibility of these websites and they probably don't deserve their own articles, but there's no denying they add to the totals presented for Bravo Fleet, given that they are subserviant to it. As well as this, on Wikipedia's notability page for websites, it is stated that with regards to (sign up &amp; read) forums, that a total post count totalling three times the user count is 'good.' The BF forums have a post count that is 64 times the member count. Now I feel this method of judgement is somewhat lacking, but Wikipedia adheres to it and so it should be considered. The page also cites <i>An established comic or site which has set a trend eg. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a>, while not the first sprite comic, did inspire many others.</i> This seems to fit Bravo Fleet rather accurately. It was not the first Star Trek RPG group (its own history confirms that "Tango Fleet" is at least a year older) but many ST RPG groups seek to mould themselves in Bravo Fleet's image i.e. a large 'fleet' containing multiple 'task forces' and games. The closest written example to hand I have is taken from Expansion Fleet,</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>A Feedback/Suggestions forum is opened for all members to discuss freely their ideas and suggestions. This initiative proves succesfull and the idea is born to turn Expansion into something bigger and creating various divisions, similar to the style of Bravo Fleet and Tango Fleet.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Also note that the Wikipedia guidelines regarding website notability are often ignored in individual cases. I have no intention of extensively debating the suitability of these guidelines (as I find them to be largely unobjectionable) or defending this article, but given that the above strengthened my mind on the issue, it may be that it affects others. Clearly piece by piece these 'loopholes' if you want to call them that, don't seem much and don't warrant inclusion by themselves, but there are clearly a number of them in this case making this (I feel) an exception to the general rules. - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 14:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I'm a senior member of BF, to be honest, but this group has been around for 8 years, and is a strong member of the Star Trek on-line gaming community. Using <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, We're not a paper encyclopedia, so, why can't we have a topic like this. Is it hurting anyone by keeping it there?

Its not slanderous, its verifiable, and we have kept sites that are just as non-notable before.

<li>I agree that if <i>any</i> website like this deserves an article on WP it would be Bravofleet but it still doesn't imho. No, it won't hurt anyone if it is kept but neither would it hurt anyone if I put up an article about myself or my own website (which has quite a few number of visitors from around the wordl) yet it still wouldn't be right and is not a reason to keep. Also, the fact that other non-notable sites have articles is not a reason to keep this non-notable site. Two "wrongs" do not make a right. ("Wrongs" is probably not the right word but you know what I mean hopefully.) I just don't see how Bravofleet is encyclopedic and how it has made any impact on anyone not directly involved with it.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a>, you're entitled to your opinion and I am to mine. If we remove BF, then we should start removing articles about a whole bunch of websites. You're right, 2 "wrongs" do not make a "right", so, by your logic, we should be combing all over Wikipedia and AfD'ing a whole bunch of articles on various websites that don't meet your criteria for worthiness in Wikipedia, but may meet some one else's. Granted, that is the point of all this, to gain a consensus, but still, it's better to keep an article then delete one.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 18:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, we should not "comb all over Wikipedia" but when I come across a similar article I will nominate it for AfD. AfD discussions are done on the merits of each nomination if and when they come up and should never be based on what other articles might or might not be out there that may or may not be less worthy of inclusion if the article under consideration is deleted. Compare it loosely with a judge who presides over a traffic offence hearing when it is brought before his court and who does not stand on an intersection seeing who else might be doing the same thing and not be ticketed and thus meriting not fining the case he presides over.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 20:49, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that this group has attracted attention of about.com and a book about Trekkers on the Web (per Hayter) seems to be enough to give it notability.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The strict "vote count" argues for deletion but <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a> is correct in his assertion that we are required to preserve the attribution history of anything that contributes to an article. This is a requirement of <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. At least one edit to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article appears to me to have been made with material from this version. Of course, we can not be sure without interviewing every editor - a tactic which is not feasible given the number of anonymous editors to the article.</p>
<p>Comparing the two article histories, I strongly argue against a history-only merger as a way of preserving the attribution history. It would badly confuse the edit history. In this case, I must agree that this sub-page can not be deleted. That brings the "vote count" to 3 to 2 and fails to reach the necessary consensus for deletion. I am going to exercise my discretion, though, and close this discussion as a <b>redirect</b> back to the original article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 08:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I cannot believe an editor of a national newspaper is an AFD. If the article reads POV as a press release or a resum√© then this can be rectified through the editing process. (I have already begun the process by removing a bit of the yay-for-the-Herald language, but if anyone else can do more, that would be much appreciated. I have done the same to the article on The Herald.) I'd also like to ask, since when did a Google search on a *print publication* demarcate notability?

<p>I originally created this page believing that the Albanian minority in Macedonia was exceptional, or unique, or notable, but since then I have found I was incorrect. They are a small percentage of the population and do not face second class citizen status. I highly doubt that they ever did. The information on this page comes from, almost exclusively, the badly written, highly dubious UNPO website. Every obscure ethnicity in a particular country does not deserve its own page. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 17:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

It further contains definitions of the word that I cannot verify. <i>The term is also used to describe those who value <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameplay.html" title="Gameplay">gameplay</a> over <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphics.html" title="Graphics">Graphics</a>.</i> Even if the term is used frequently in the industry, a fact I doubt as I have worked in and arround the industry for a number of years and while a person may be described as <b>hardcore</b> I have not encountered the phrase in this form, this article is clearly a dictionary definition. While I might support a merge to <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamers.html" title="Gamers">Gamers</a> or a Transwiki to wiktionary if cleaned up, as it currently stands my vote must be <b>Delete</b> ‚Äî <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a><sup>&lt;<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalerin_31b4.html" title="User talk:Falerin"><b>talk</b></a>&gt;,&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falerin_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falerin"><b>contrib</b></a>&gt;</sup> 17:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm astounded that somebody who has worked in the industry has never heard the term "hardcore gamer". Oh well. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 18:27, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Though I agree that the gameplay/graphics definition is incorrect. If anything, the opposite is true: casual gamers often buy products with fairly poor graphics (like Bejeweled or the Deer Hunter series), while hardcore gamers often spring for very expensive video cards to get maximum graphic effects from the latest glossy FPS. By the most accepted definition, hardcore gaming has more to do with amount of time played than specific game or feature preferences. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:44, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'd love to know what industry you have worked in ..because it can't be the gaming industry if you have never heard of this term...unless, perhaps you are making learning software for grade-school age children - they typically are not "hardcore" yet. Hardcore gaming is a community, a society, a way of thinking ..its its own little world. I OFTEN hear people who are very hardcore making the comment about preferring content over graphics, but they are also the same people who have (or want) really nice gaming systems. I can see it go both ways. This may need multiple definitions. --<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Naha</a>|<sup><a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_c8bb.html" title="User talk:Nahallac Silverwinds">(talk)</a></sup> 20:50, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said I have heard the term "Hardcore" I have never seen it constructed as a phrase to refer to people as a group. I.e. A gamer may be Hardcore but I do not recall ever before hearing of "Hardcore Gamers" And even lacking that problem the article is still nothing more then a dictdef. ‚Äî <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a><sup>&lt;<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalerin_31b4.html" title="User talk:Falerin"><b>talk</b></a>&gt;,&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falerin_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falerin"><b>contrib</b></a>&gt;</sup> 19:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hardcore gamers tend to seek each other out in many games like <a href="../../../e/v/e/EverQuest_5a5e.html" title="EverQuest">EverQuest</a> and form large raiding guilds where dozens to a few hundred of them are together at any given time. Birds of a feather flock together hehehe. While they are not always groups, they do tend to manifest as such in many games. That is not to say that the title of this article has to be or needs to be plural ..but I don't see a problem with it, unless it is violating wikistyle. --<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Naha</a>|<sup><a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_c8bb.html" title="User talk:Nahallac Silverwinds">(talk)</a></sup> 20:47, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. In addition, why can we not just add the adjective of "hardcore" to a variety of things? E.g. hardcore student, hardcore golfer, hardcore driver. Since "hardcore" is a fairly common adjective to use to describe someone more serious than others about something, keeping this article just opens the door to creating more dictionary articles on the previously mentioned articles. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 11:07, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nobody is saying that every entry is going to be turned into a blue link but the important streets will (and should) have their own entries. Even the red links have some value as a data source. The of lists itself is a clear keep as method of organisation. The sublist commencing with Z for example is now complete. Seeing as this reorganisation has only happened over the last couple of days I suggest giving it some time to see how it works out before deleting it. Also, its not really correct to say that this is a recreation of Paris streets-list - it's a reorganisation which is proposed on that Afd talk page and to which nobody objected.

<p><b>Comment</b> I think there's a danger of confusing two separate issues here - the question of the size of these lists/their possibly unencyclopedaic content and the separate question of how to organise a list of streets. Most of the negartive comment above seem to be driven by an understandable wish not to have large lists of unencyclopedaic streets. I suggest the way to achieve that is open to any editor - just go into a list and delete some/all of the entries. Other editors can later recreate articles from scratch for any streets that are notable enough. Alternatively, we can leave some/all the red links as an encouragement for people to turn the important ones blue and that was my motivation for reformatting the original list. There seem to be only about 20 live street links which is too few for a major city like Paris - we should try to encourage creation of others. I think is useful to have the structure of a master list and sublists and I feel it would be a pity to remove that - that would be the result of this Afd as currently formulated. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 08:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, once it becomes an indiscriminate collection of information it gets reverted. I don't think they're heading in that direction, given the "Here is a partial list" disclaimer. It's incomplete because they haven't included every single <i>notable</i> street, not because they haven't included every single back alley and cul-de-sac. And if this list is unfinished, then as I've said time and again, it can be worked on somewhere else and recreated when it doesn't contravene <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, at which point it won't be eligible for speedy deletion.

<dd>Yes, verifiability is a major concern. Imagine the havoc that could result if a non-existent street snuck on to one of these lists. Therefore, I guess we should set up a project to source all our road lists such as List_of_roads_and_expressways_in_Singapore, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nova_Scotia_provincial_highways_b91c.html" title="List of Nova Scotia provincial highways">List of Nova Scotia provincial highways</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbered_routes_in_Massachusetts_0284.html" title="List of numbered routes in Massachusetts">List of numbered routes in Massachusetts</a>. I prefer individual footnotes for each street, but am open to suggestions. The project could run for some time, though, given that there are at least 75 more of these lists <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_roads_2128.html" title="Category:Lists of roads">Category:Lists of roads</a>. Of course, the better route might be a blanket nom on AfD, particularly if maps such as Paris A-Z are the only available source. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Sorry guys, but, as it is, it must go, as it lacks any context. Had I known it would make such a fuss I wouldn't have uploaded it in the first place - true that that kind of data is not easy to come by (and it <i>was</i> a lot of work to compile) but I had second thoughts (Encyclopaedic?) almost right after I saw it in place, and tended to agree with its (almost immediate) nomination for deletion. By the way, this list is in no way "part of" the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Portal%7EParis_2a63.html" title="Portal:Paris">Portal:Paris</a> project - I uploaded this on a completely different whim. There is still much work to do on the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Portal%7EParis_2a63.html" title="Portal:Paris">Portal:Paris</a> page so if you would like turn your attention there and take this "data" to a personal page to fill it out somewhat (all those redlinks!) at a more liesurely pace, maybe we can do something with it later.

<p><b>Comment</b> I've now created <a href="../../../r/u/e/Rue_de_l%27Abbaye_94e3.html" title="Rue de l'Abbaye">Rue de l'Abbaye</a> - a notable street.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's unencyclopedic to have these useless lists of unnotable streets - it just slows down access to notable ones.

<p><b>Comment</b> - You know what rings a bell for me? The <i>category</i> "Streets of Paris". If every street in Paris had an article with a "Category:Streets of Paris" tag at the bottom of it, the "Streets of Paris" <i>category page</i> would end up looking like the list of streets. And in alphabetical order to boot. That way the list wouldn't be an article in itself. Articles on every Paris street - WikiProject? The list of streets as it is could be a Talk page "to do" list.

<dd>You're wrong. By using the " " operators, you limit the search to the specific term at Google. A broad search (without the " " operators) yields 5,340,000 hits as you say. But the 284,000 hits for the narrow search for "intelligent designer" shows it's a well-established concept worthy of its own article. I mean really, if you're going to AFD articles, you should at least know how to Google properly and check the topic on Google properly first.

Whether or not there is an "intelligent designer" or not, is irrelavent. It would appear that who ever submitted this artical for deletion is extremely controlling, not wanting to allow others the freedom of thought. I posted a small highly relevant addition to the page and it was deleted almost immediately, I would suspect by the person who wants this page deleted. A person into thought control of that sort, should be considered for banning, if there is a process to ban people. I'm sure this is not an isolated incident for this person.</li>

<li>If the articles really need to be written, then a properly stubbed article does more to advance it than a red link. It is extremely easy to create a properly stubbed article and it is even easier to include it in the right category. Then, if someone adds a <i>category:whatever</i> to the stubbed article, that user is also creating/expanding a list which is kept automatically and doesn't need any maintenance. So, a list article with red links not only doesn't facilitate the creation of new content but it also, compared with category pages, needs a lot more care and maintenance than a category page. Therefore, the list articles which are made redundant by category pages should be deleted in favour of the category pages, which is exactly this case and that is why the AFD should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 00:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article does not conform to the Wikipedia NPOV policy. It is not a scientific point of view that these events are prophesied, and an argument can be made that the article suggests that these prophesies and their results are seen as cause and effect, or having a pro-Christian bias.

The inclusion of "prophecies" by individuals who specifically claim that they are not making prophecies (<a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Lindsey_bd93.html" title="Hal Lindsey">Hal Lindsey</a> for example) is just one case of this. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 22:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>To make my objection clearer, the article‚Äôs title is in conflict with its content. The inclusion of any cult, splinter sect, or other group at all associated with Christianity is not what the average reader is going to think they are coming to read about when they see the phrase ‚Äò‚ÄôChristian Prophecy‚Äô‚Äô. Most people expect that this term is going to apply to ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôbiblical prophecy‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, or at the very minimum conform to some academic standard of what is and what is not (A) Christian and (B) A prophecy. The primary author of this article has stated on the talk page that pretty much any statement of opinion about the future by anyone who says that are Christian or any member of a religion derived form Christianity (even if the person also say they are not making prophecy) is worthy of inclusion.
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. When I came here I was expecting any prophesy made by Christian leaders since the Old testament... and that's what has been placed here.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>comment</b> Who is the arbiter of who is a Real Christian or not? I didn't read through every single link on the page, but the several of which I did appear to be statements made by people who professed to be christian. I think that pretty much anyone who professes to be a christian, and has Jesus Christ somewhere in their doctrinal belief system in some form or fashion is indeed a christian. If someone is listed where an argument can be made that no one considers them even a fringe christian, that argument should be played out in editing the article. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrich_e5dc.html" title="User:Krich">Krich</a> <a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrich_4a36.html" title="User talk:Krich">(talk)</a> 23:21, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem comes in when including predictions which got the people who made them labled heritics by the church of their day. Or by groups that even the author of the article charcterizes as cults. I understand the argument that anyone who wants to be called <b>X</b> should be allowed to be called <b>X</b> but at the same time others who also call themselves <b>X</b> may not want to be grouped with the others. In this case considering what the general populas will anticipate when encounted with <b>X</b> is important. A real example is the use of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic.html" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> on wikipedia inorder to maintain NPOV. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 08:11, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I take your point - however, whether or not some members of group <b>X</b> (christians) like it when others with different doctrinal beliefs identify themselves as christians doesn't matter. One person's "sect" or "cult" is another person's Truth. If a person or group makes a religiously-based prediction of the future, and they self-identify as christians - I don't see how they could be excluded from this article. Some entries perhaps should be removed, others edited. However, again, I feel these issues are best worked out in discussion at the article itself, not at a deletion vote. Yes, the article has flaws... it should be fixed, not deleted (in my opinion, of course).

<dd>Ok, as you like, so long as by doing so you are not under the illusion that we are somehow avoiding decideing "what christianity is or is not" by doing so. Either way you step on someone. I do agree that a lot of the content of the article is worht keeping, I just thinking a more NPOV title would be approprate. A title that would give the article somewhat less vauge and less offensive context.

<dd>The nomination is a bit, rough but the fact that the critera for inclusion on the page is not acceptable rigiorus or NPOV is pretty easy to understand. I think an article about the history of predictions of christs return (or the end of the earth) is worthwhile, I do not think the current title is approprate for it however. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 08:06, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. POV is only a basis for deletion if the problem cannot be corrected within the article. Nominator makes no claim that this is the case. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 23:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While I can see how some may want to interpret this article as non-NPOV (as any religiously themed article invariably is by some), fundamentally the article is simply a collection of facts and makes no attempt to lend interpretation to the failed prophecies (nor should it) and therefore is relatively immune to POV encroachment. Although I think that all the claims should be properly documented as it could be very easy to insert out of context statements and complete fabrications. The topic is worthy of an article and any POV issues within the ariticle can be corrected within the article (eg. inclusion of a broader Christian history). <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunter1084_3a05.html" title="User:Hunter1084">mhunter</a> 07:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting and NPOV in my view (per Hunter). Needs a clean up and perhaps a change of title, <b>unfulfilled</b> ambiguously connotes both <b>failed</b> (as the article means) or <b>not yet come to pass, but still may</b> such as a prediction that the Dallas Cowboys may win the 2006 Superbowl. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:31, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I suspect the nomination for deletion has more to do with the nominator's POV than any perceived POV in the timeline. These prophesies were made and didn't pan out. That's historical fact.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As the original author of the article I naturally want it to stay. I was inspired to create this article by the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Barton_ccd8.html" title="Elizabeth Barton">Elizabeth Barton</a> article which appeared on 23 September 2004 on the "Wikipedia's new articles" section of the front page. I then realised that many people within the Christian church have prophesied all sorts of things that have not come to pass, and that it would be important to have a record of it. I am an evangelical Christian myself (see my user page) and I do not find it POV to have a record of wrongs from the Christian church that I am part of. In fact, I think it is actually of great service to the church for this page to exist. I need to point out that <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> and I have discussed this article on its talk page and we have very different opinions as to what is defined here. Dalf takes the pov that prophecies by Jehovah's Witnesses (for example) shouldn't be included since he does not regard the JWs as part of the Christian Faith. I actually agree with this sentiment, being the conservative evangelical that I am - but because this is an encyclopedia, people who have made specific prophecies as part of the "visible" church should be included here. Putting Pat Robertson here would only be pov if he had made some vague opinion about Bush winning by a landslide and for others to descide that it was a prophecy. The fact is that Pat DID in fact tell his television audience that God had given him the message that W would win by a landslide - so his inclusion in the article cannot be pov since his actually did make a prophecy and it did not come to pass. A change in title is okay, but needs to be discussed. If the title is misleading, then surely the opening paragraphs make it clear what it is about. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 00:35, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete. It's non-notable under WP:Music for one thing. The band has only been around since June. Secondly, it's written by a musician for the band, who kept on removing the delete notice. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a> 19:23 21 December 2005</p>

<dd>Thanks for telling me about that one, Zzzzz. I had originally put this up for Speedy Delete-- in fact, I put this and an EP of theirs up for it around thirty times each -- and on each occasion, they kept taking it down. I was told to stop trying and move it to AFD, but clearly the new wikipolicy covers this. On the talk page, the author is trying to justify their inclusion in Wikipedia because they were involved in a minor show that they organised themselves. It's madness what some people will do. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a> 20:17 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> but not speedy as they have released a record albeit not a particularly successful one which is an assertion of notability.

<li>I will confess (at the obvious and critical! detriment of the AfD) to know very little about Dopefish. I would guess it's a cold-blooded animal off of which one can get high. While I can't close the AfD, I'd ask an admin to do so, and would gently suggest the notability be stressed more sharply in the article for those of us who have not browsed across those 73,000 hits.

<li><b>Delete</b>, <b>recreate</b> with a NPOV title, and heavily <b>edit</b>. The current title implies a pro-conspiracy-theory POV, and may be taken to imply "look, all these conspiracies were proven, thus <i>my</i> conspiracy is valid". This should be something like "list of historical conspiracies" or "list of successful plots".

<dd>By that logic, a "facial wipe" can mean the back of my hand or my sleeve; and an "action figure" is any figure capable of any action. The "proven conspiracy" to me in the list title has a very strong air of a "conspiracy theory", in its actual accepted definition. A list of proven conspiracy theories is very, very different from a list of conspiracies as in plots. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 22:09, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, with no enthusiasm; I think Flyboy Will is right about the intent of the page. I would prefer to see all the <i>list of conspiracies</i> pages merged and drastically edited. I don't see that happening. If we delete this page, the same motivation will result in the same content reappearing elsewhere. The same motivation leads people to edit-war for a favorable definition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>, to try to get <i>conspiracy theory</i> removed from article titles, and to put up <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coincidence_theory.html" title="Coincidence theory">Coincidence theory</a>. In List of proven conspiracies, the desire is to have a page that says, "They laughed at Wilbur and Orville" without having it say, "and they laughed at Bozo the Clown." Not actually being able to find a Wilbur and Orville, the page has become a rather bland list of events that involved secret plans. As such, I think it's useful enough to keep. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 21:21, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. This debate is difficult to interpret since there are clear concerns about the article that have been denied rather than addressed. The final comment suggests it may be original research, but opts to keep it: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is not negotiable, and you cannot couple it with a recommendation to 'keep'.

This is a kind of vanity which Wikipedia defines as "the excessive belief in one's own abilities". At worst it cn also be called a kind ofnarcissism, which Wikipedia defines as "a pattern of thinking and behaving in adolescence and adulthood, which involves infatuation and obsession with one's self to the exclusion of others". Not that self-respect is bad, but as far as Korean pride is concerned, it is a kind of extraverted pride that is not really different than something like white pride which believes in the inherent superiority of oneself or one's race over others. The issue of Korean pride is also a valid complaint by foreigners who deal in the academic and business worlds in Korea." <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 21:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Your Korean Pride article is in effect just a continuation of your endless theorizing on the Hwang Woo-Suk talk page. It is, in fact, <b>original research</b>.

Korean inventions and discoveries exist. Korean pop culture exists. Seoul's economic and cultural dominance in Korea exists.

<li>This is NOT a racist article. Anyone can check over my user history and see that I have made many and deep contributions on the topics of Korean culture, food, and history, all of them factual and neutral. If anyone calls this article racist, they should stop making the fallacy of such a general comment and precisely point out which part or parts it is that they are referring to. As it now stands, it has a balanced structure, exploring both positive and negative aspects of the very real topic of "Korean pride", which people who have had dealings in Korea and/or with Koreans end up talking about, because it can be a source of consternation for them and at times even ends up affecting international relations. For people who need a reference, there may be comments like these in internet cafes where foreign English teachers in Korea frequently make them, though they may be deleted rather quickly. I suggest people explore such forums to get a taste of what this phenomenon is all about. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 03:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>The final domino to fall will be "Korean Pride," when Koreans fully confront Hwang's fraud.</i></p>
<p><i>But in the words of Joseph Steinberg, "South Koreans have to learn to . . . replace pride . . . [with] confidence. "</i></p>
<p><i>How do they do that? Cho Se-mi suggests that (among other things) Koreans should "pursue excellence." I'd add that they should strive to be honest in, e.g., their pursuit of a university degree, where honesty would entail actually doing the work required rather than plagiarizing so much. The problem lies not just in academics, of course, but also in the Korean business world, whose level of dishonesty foreigners constantly complain about.</i></p>
<p><i>I also think that Korea needs to develop a culture of discussion, and that would entail a flattening of the hierarchical social system to enable juniors to openly question their seniors.</i></p>

<li>This topic may be <b>controversial</b> but strictly speaking it is no more "racist" than Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> for example. Moreover, people who try to compare the inherent national pride of X country with Korean pride are making a generalization which is inherently illogical. What this article does is try to point out the special characteristics of a phenomenon that both Koreans and foreigners consistently refer to and has big impacts on Korean society, and to delete it would mean the censors win, which is against the spirit of wiki as well as free and progressive thinking for that matter. Moreover, denying the existence of the phenomenon does not do the Korean people any good either, because the next step in the evolution of Korean consciousness and society is to confront this problem and discuss it and perhaps even find ways to deal with it, which presumably would end up with the betterment of all. It has especially come to the forefront because of the Hwang affair, a situation (if you think about it deeply) many say was brought about by Korean pride on the part of Hwang (his desire to make Korea a research hub and also Nobel Prize considerations) and even him using it to keep all of his underlings silent. Remember, it was the head of the Mizmedi hospital, Roh Sung-Il, who first blew the whistle, and not any of Hwang's underlings. In a free and open society, for soemthing like this you would think there would have been a whistle-blower from within the research team ranks, at least anonymously. And yet there wasn't. The interesting question is, what kind of a hold does one have to have on his subordinates to commit such a fraud? There is the hierarchical power structure to be sure, but motivations of national pride had to have come into play as well. This is why discussions of Hwang will inevitably bring up the issue of Korean pride, which makes the topic not only real but also relevant these days. It is only logical to begin discussing it. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 06:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I say it should be <b>Kept</b> for now. If it is to be preserved as its own page, more external links (such as the ones you, Atrahasis, just mentioned) should be added. Or could it possibly be put as part of a different <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Pride_271a.html" title="Asian Pride">Asian Pride</a> article? The current Asian Pride article seems more focused on Asian-American culture. Perhaps a broader focus or seperate article could be established, like Asian Pride(global), or something? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysterius_8358.html" title="User:Mysterius">Mysterius</a> 24 December 2005</li>

<dd>Thank you, and the probelm with finding links for this kind of thing is that it's not something that English speakers will speak about often with any great depth of knowledge because it's probably a tad politically incorrect to do so and can be miscontrued as some kind of hate ranting. Thanks for pointing out the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_pride.html" title="Asian pride">Asian pride</a> link, this lends quite a bit of support to the existence and nature of the topic at hand. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 08:14, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is <b>not</b> the same as Korean nationalism, because it's possible to not really care about the country of Korea per se but at the same time have pride in being Korean or thinking that Koreans are superior in some way. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 08:19, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Korean Nationalism" and "Korean Pride" are two different ideas. For example, in many Chinatown, Chinese who does not have Chinese nationality and does not endorse the current Chinese government still have high regards in the culture he or she passes down. I don't think this is "nationalism" but "pride". Right now, most Koreans do live in Korea, but for those living outside and not having Korean nationality, is it improbable for them to not to have the same mentality? If Korean immediately becomes "un-Korean" once he or she loses nationality and leaves Korea, then we have to argue whether the only thing binding them together is "nationalism" and that Korean entirely lacks "pride". Certainly Korean has to have both "nationalism" and "pride" and both has to be distinct. -- <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 05:03, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable game. Looks like a dozen Google hits, the rest refer to random people with Farahad as a proper name. Ifnord 21:18, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it is a notable game, there is an entire community of people behind this, and it has been around for over 4 years! Games like Utopia have large articles, and I think that this encyclopedia would be a perfect place for the community (built around farahad) to contribute information for it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you google farahad (which SHOULD NOT BY ANY MEANS be a factor in deciding if it exists, as you're basically letting google decide what stays and what goes) the first thing that pops up _is_ this game.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article will expand fast, I and others are currently working on it. This game has just a right to be here as Utopia has, as Utopia just has a much larger playerbase. Many people have played farahad, and right now it's playerbase is kinda low due to some circumstances, but again, many have played before. (Probably over a thousand, easily)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hell, I figure, if this article is deleted, you may as well delete small townships of 100-300 people in Northern Ontario. Those townships aren't notable, and come up with tons of hits when you throw their name in google, yet these townships have the right to have an article exist about them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Give this article a chance, it will develop and be widely used as a reference amongst the community. Not to mention, it's much easier to explain to (wiki)people who wanna know wtf I'm doing if I just paste them the link for this article about the game hehe--Cheevz 21:26, 21 December 2005 (UTC)Cheevz</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, Cheevz, let me try to exmplain the problem here from my perspective. In the case of small towns in wherever, the information is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> in the Wikipedian sense of being verifiable from <i>trusted secondary sources</i> (census data etc.). Minor games, especially online ones, are not verifiable by these criteria: they are generally written about only by fans (who are not neutral) and mainly in the blogsphere (which is not a trusted authority). So "non-notable" in these cases is a shorthand for subjects which, due to their limited currency, cannot be verified as being covered in a neutral and factual way. Plus we don't allow every stone to have an article, there is a threshold below which the "who would care?" test applies. Finally, <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> either a promotional vehicle or a crystal ball. Adding articles for games which are not, as yet, widely played, looks like an attepmt to drum up interest based on speculations of future success - a sort of Wiki bootstrap. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:34, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok, keep in mind I'm new but again, I don't want to put work into this unless it stays.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A lot of the people working on the article are new, give them and I (I am new) a chance to write this and make it more professional. I think it's important to get player numbers published, and more statistics about this game: Atm there are two users who put their comments, which doesn't seem to wiki to me, what does everyone else think? Is it too subjective? Maybe we should have a link to player reviews and just add a fact that 'there are many players who believe this is a great game' (then throw in... but, there are also many criticisms about... &lt;insert what I'm inserting tomorrow about it's criticisms&gt;) etc... Nomme sayin'?----</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Btw, I read the last note left previous, and I agree about neutrality/sources, and this game can get past that, with a little time for me to get sources from online game review sources. As for the "who would care" argument, I don't think it applies because there is a positive - more than a few interested getting satisfaction - and very little negative - a small amount of wikipedia article storage that is giving this article a run to see if it turns out successful, if not, I agree it should be deleted. And again, this is not a promotional tool (or crystal ball? whatever that may be)... there are better mediums for that. I sincerely believe this game does need an article explaining it, and I think it would be productive not only for the farahad-gaming community to create this article, but also for those interested in knowing what Farahad is for finding it out. If the players who thus far commented on it seemed like they're promoting it, then agian, this can be fixed (I'll coolaborate with them). Not everyone is used to the concept of wiki, so again, a little time for us/them to figure it out would be greatly appreciated (especially more than the 5 days or so granted by the deletion process)----</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comments without "vote"</b> - 1) Player testminonials tend to help delete an article; third-party <b>references</b> tend to help keep it (gaming blogs connected to fans of the game fall in the first category, not the second); 2) Wikipeda is not a crystal ball (either the game is successful or notable <i>now</i> or it isn't), and because of that, it must deal with the <i>here and now</i>; 3) Keep rewriting the article, but if it smells of self-promotion and reeks of POV, it will be deleted; 4) No matter the final result of this AfD, your hard work in good faith is always appreciated here; 5) To give more weight to your comments, please sign them with ~~~~. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 18:01, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Again, it doesn't matter if it's notable. It is there and has been there for a long time. Just as many small northern Ontario towns have articles concenring them, yet these towns aren't notable by any means. Yet they exist, and have the right to. Regarding references/player opinion: I agree wholeheartedly. In fact, recently, after 4 years of active involvement in this game, I quit because the game creator made a completely irrational decision to restart the game. Anyways, enough of that boring talk: I vote for this articles deletion as I won't be contributing to it any more (0 interest) and the people I know who will be contributing have no concept of wikipedia in them, and do regard it as a marketing tool (even though I didn't). You can see this by looking at the farahad page, where it marks their player names and a piece of "opinion" (yuck) about the game. Soooo subjective. *Shivers* Sorry for wasting your time, I'll write an article about my scarce hometown instead.

<p>This AfD arises from <a href="../../../p/a/u/Talk%7EPaul_Mooney_2aaa.html#Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment" title="Talk:Paul Mooney">this RfC</a>. There was an edit war on the Paul Mooney page between editors writing about the comedian Paul Mooney, and an anon who claims to be Paul Mooney (blogger). The two pages were disambiguated, and this page has {importance} and {cleanup} tags. I have removed a SPEEDY tag once, to ensure the page could come here to AfD. <b>No vote</b> myself at this point: I'm bringing this here to help resolve the RfC. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 21:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see your reasoning. It looks A7-able. However I don't think a speedy will resolve the edit war on the other page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 22:03, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would have thought that a speedy is more serious than an AfD, since a consensus isn't even needed to establish encyclopedic value. That other page I think should be dealt with via the usual channels, such as RfC, moderation and so on. I don't see how having the blogger article deleted via an AfD as opposed to speedy can possibly change that. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 22:16, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>P.S.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I will go to the trouble of expanding this article to reflect what I believe is its true context but am not confident in doing it at this time. The creation of this label does complicate further important issues raised in human and economic geography.</li>

<dl>
<dd>There is a swathe of literature about how retailers squeezed their suppliers during the 1980s and 90s. Classic cola is one of the main examples where a retailer tried to take on the might of a coporation by using its dominance in the retail sector to best effect. This may not sound like a big deal, however at the time there were few examples of this behaviour. The creation of the cola led to a law suit between these two corporations which may have already been covered in wikipedia.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> However classic cola is an exception because it has a place in history as being the first own-label product that specifically tried to take market share away from a global label by using its retail space to greatest effect.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, unless good verifiable sources are cited prior to end of AfD discussion. It's also incredibly irritating. "Halloween," formerly "Hallowe'en," is a contraction for "Hallow's even," the evening before All Hallow's day. There isn't any day called November, so there's no "November even." If it meant anything, it would mean the evening before the beginning of the <i>month</i> of November, which is, of course, October 31st, or... Halloween. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:03, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
