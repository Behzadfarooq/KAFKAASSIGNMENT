<li><b>Strong Keep</b> on both. Kai Budde is a winner of a MTG World Championship, is notable enough that he is the top-rated Pro player in the game. Jon Finkel is also a World Championship winner, and No. 2 behind Kai Budde in ratings. MTG may be a new game, and perhaps not quite as big as poker or chess, but it's still a significant business, and as such, the top players deserve an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Do not confuse "notable" with being a "household name". According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, Kai Budde is notable as an athlete. The spirit of the term applies here, and athletes gain notability within there own sport, not across sports.

<li>That presumes that Magic can be considered a sport. Do we want to really add articles for top bass fishers, top players at horseshoes (whatever the term would be for them), and top chickendancers?

<li>FWIW, M:TG world championships were broadcast on ESPN2 at one point. It didn't do that well, mainly because it's not exciting to watch (like poker), but unlike poker, most people don't know the rules.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> both. Jon Finkel is the subject of a book published by Random House: I will admit, his article needs to be refocused, since he is now much more well-known for his poker accomplishments than his M:TG ones. And while we're at it, there's no new reason here (or in the speedy kept debate) for deletion other than notability, which was adequately settled in the first debate. Kai Budde meets the WP:BIO criteria. There are plenty of sources out there on him; see <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" rel="nofollow">this</a> for instance, which is a published book, that describes Kai as "the best player in the world as of this writing." Lots of columns published on the Wizards site too. If it needs better sourcing, it should be fixed, not deleted. Let me add: under consideration, I don't think MTG or other CCG (or, really, any non-mainstream sport) competitors should automatically become notable for being in a professional league: I wouldn't think that EVERY professional tournament player would deserve an article. However, both Finkel and Budde could be considered "other professionals whose work is widely recognized and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record in their field", and both have been the subject of multiple MTG-related columns, and most importantly, WP:BIO is not intended to be exclusionary. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:13, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As this article stands, it does not meet the criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and badly needs sourcing. Sources should be included in the article, not the AfD debate. It takes a very broad interpretation to fit these subjects under the category of "athlete." The first bullet was not intended for participants in a leisure activity; it would require another broad interpretation, this time of "field." It does bring into question the inclusion of articles on poker players, champion backgammon players, chess grandmssters, and any other indoor game of skill; and Nlu does bring up a good point of where we draw the line at inclusion of champions of a particular activity. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> draws a fine line, and I could see an argument for broadening the notability criteria to include champions of popular activities. But that debate is for the policy page. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 11:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Additional Comment</b> If a verifiable citation of a reliable third-party source can be included in the articles outside of an article by WOTC for the purpose of demonstrating the subjects are "widely recognized" as performing at the highest level, I could be persuaded to change my position on CCG players inclusion. This has to be addressed in both articles. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:45, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I pointed out a book describing Kai as the best player in the world, and there's a book written about Finkel.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I stop short - but <i>just</i> short - of agreeing that this a bad faith nomination, but I have big problems with nom's handling of this issue. There are venues on Wikipedia to argue for the general non-notability of CCG players (although given that there are articles on world-class chess, poker, backgammon and Scrabble players, it's a crock), but an ambush AfD of a World Champion in a professional circuit is certainly not one. And winning "only" $300,000 isn't notable? Policy forbids me to respond with the appropriate degree of incredulity, but Wikipedia has numerous articles for professional golfers with lifetime earnings lower than Budde's (<a href="../../../d/e/a/Deane_Beman_a2b2.html" title="Deane Beman">Deane Beman</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Jacklin_cf5e.html" title="Tony Jacklin">Tony Jacklin</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Shearer_6b53.html" title="Bob Shearer">Bob Shearer</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Pott_6bbd.html" title="Johnny Pott">Johnny Pott</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/v/Orville_Moody_74ef.html" title="Orville Moody">Orville Moody</a> ...). <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You might get away with that, but it is streching the principle further.

<li>Your inline link is really a press release from WOTC republished on that site. The problem with citations from WOTC is that they are the makers of the product and would naturally want to hype it through a large tournament. It doesn't demonstrate that the event's participants are "widely recognized." Citations of coverage of the event in <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrye.html" title="Scrye">Scrye</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/q/InQuest_Gamer_9233.html" title="InQuest Gamer">InQuest Gamer</a> would be better evidence that the subject is widely recognized. One big problem is that the claims of notability in this AfD aren't backed up by verifiable citations in the articles. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 15:51, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what you're doing now is being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. Are you genuinely suggesting that a former World Champion and the lifetime career earnings leader in a game's pro circuit is not notable within that field? (If so, could you tell us what within that field you <i>do</i> consider notable?) You could, with just as much justification, claim that the notability of many prominent scientists only stems from scientific journals and thus aren't "widely recognized." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A line still has to be drawn somewhere on notability within profession -- depending on what that profession is and whether that profession is itself notable. I'm sure that there are professions for which even the most notable people within the profession can be agreed on as being not sufficiently notable overall to be included. The question is whether professional Magic-playing is such a profession. I think it is. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the line is drawn here, then we might as well delete all the players of any CCG, as well as a good chunk of Scrabble, dominoes, and other "traditional" game champions. As stated, Kai is the winningest player of the game ever. He will get in the game's Hall of Fame on the first ballot (he's not eligible yet), and the only other player of the game that even comes close to him in notability is Jon Finkel. To be less argumentative, my line is drawn at Hall of Fame members, World Champions, and players who are notable in other fields (like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Williams_%28card_player%29_98ff.html" title="David Williams (card player)">David Williams</a>). -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> 18:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>They still have to meet the criteria of being "widely recognized." Promotion by WOTC doesn't cut it as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. This is because coverage by WOTC is inherently unobjective; they want these people to seem notable. This isn't new; it's the same standard we apply for NCAA athletes. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 19:03, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two things: (1) WOTC employs semi-independent columnists. Sure, they write about and promote MTG, but I see no reason to doubt their authority when they describe someone as a prominent player. (2) I'd stop pushing the point about WOTC and independence. You've made your point, clearly and cogently. The best thing now is to see if people end up agreeing or disagreeing with it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> on both. MTG's most well-known competitive players are just as notable as most pro-sports players or, for that matter, pop-culture writers.
