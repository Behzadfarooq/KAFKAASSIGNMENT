<li><b>Strong Keep</b> According to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html#Alternate_Proposal" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Inclusion guidelines alternative proposal</a>, this web comic is worthy of an article. It has nearly <b>400 strips</b> and has been regularly updated, without missing a day, for the past <b>two and a half years</b>. This is a comic that is regularly posted on messageboards and communities like LJ (how I first heard about it), so it might not get much direct traffic. Perhaps Alexa alone may not be sufficient in determing if its worthy of inclusion? On a related note, the author has stressed in the past that he is mostly relying on word-of-mouth and does not currently utilize mass traffic influx techniques like ad placement. So it may be more of a slow grower. It is a decent project and is still worthy of note. I'd be willing to write a more detailed article if that would appease the Wikipedists... --Sumsumone 2 July 2005 01:20 (UTC) <small><i>(user's only edits are to this VfD and a related one)</i></small></li>

<li>It seems on the Talk Page that there is just general dispute about what makes a comic noteworthy. People are suggesting for many criteria beyond Alexa. Is Alexa the only true measure at this point? If so, what justifies Alexa as the unrivaled basis for determination? If there is general dispute over how to determine "noteworthiness" then by what criteria can anyone on here make a compelling case/decision <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> this entry? --24.198.18.42 3 July 2005 00:55 (UTC)

<li>The dispute is over whether the alternative proposal is too lax, and whether it should be amended or dropped entirely. The <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html#Alexa_test" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Alexa test</a> has precedent for determining whether an article on a website should be deleted or kept. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 3 July 2005 03:04 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance may have a relatively small following but its strong and loyal. It constantly gains new members and *is* growing. There is no sense in removing the article when it has the potential to boost Disassemblance's notoriety and actually make it "worthy" of a wikipedia page. Disassemblance has much to offer the comic-reading community. But without pages such as these many of them will miss out on this entertaining, witty and insightful comic. Also, do you really have to rely on a website to see what is good and what isn't? If you read the comic yourself, you'd see that it deserves this page. It makes me sad that people can't decide things for themselves anymore. <i>— unsigned vote by 80.225.70.65 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.225.70.65_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.225.70.65">contribs</a>)</i>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to clarify my point about Disassemblance's "notoriety" as i obviously didn't express it in the best way. My point is that Disassemblance deserves this reference point; I was not implying advertising purposes. It is established as a respectable comic within its community and is not an off-hand project that will fade away. As a tribute to this, the page should stay. <i>unsigned comment by 80.225.82.107 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.225.82.107_a7bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.225.82.107">contribs</a>).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> it meets the criteria, those for deletion have no grounds to defend that stance. Dis is a great comic, by a great guy. The art is unique and original. To those who say it doesn't get enough hits: the guy doesn't shove it down peoples' throats and pimp himself like so many other webcomic whores.

<li><i>Comment:</i> Alexa and traffic are being pointed out as the only area, so far expressed, where Disassemblance fails the 'inclusion test.' I would like to point out from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html#These_are_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Notability and Inclusion Guidelines</a> the following: <i>Sites that are close to, but still under, these thresholds may also be included on the basis that web comics customarily grow in size and have a higher likelihood of increasing in readership and, thus, becoming encyclopedic.</i> As well as the Websnark commentary that often gets mentioned throughout the guidelines, about what comics should be included: <i>I think every webcomic with more than 100 strips worth of archives on the web should have an entry in Wikipedia, and I think the Webcartoonist should not be the person writing the entry.</i> Disassemblance has longevity, an extensive archive, and from the comments so far, there is obviously a fan base and interest. --Sumsumone 2 July 2005 23:05 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is not just a webcomic that's out there to get statistical ratings or advertising. Mr. Hart makes more than jokes and 'pot shots' in his strips. It is an intellegant strip that addresses a myriad of current social, economic, cultural, religious and HUMAN issues. Dissenters would do well to go through the comic archive and experience the range of strips. Disassemblance.com is also not a site that is just about the comic. Disassemblance.com is a COMMUNITY -- a refuge for people to experience honesty, open dialogue, support, and a lot of fun in it's forums. The level of civility/etiquitte on the boards is unparalelled to any other forum i've been part of, and yet it is a natural friendliness -- not strained or fake. I'd love to see the article here in Wiki expanded to reflect Disassemblance's true nature and encompass more than just the stip. 65.40.121.21 3 July 2005 00:06 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've been follower of Disassemblance since right after it came online. It's a great comic that is more that worthy to be on this site. It has a very loyal following and even though it's small it's been growing. I remeber when their was only a hand full of people that read it and now there's more than two hand fulls. The writer of Dis has chosen not to site whore and that's one the reasons that I like it so much. I believe that there is something in this comic that everyone who reads it will get out of it, be it a simle, a laugh, a giggle, an idea, a deep though, or even a tear. I don't think chosing that it should be deleted because it doesn't get that much traffic is a good reason when it meets all the guidlines.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is a highly amusing webcomic that focuses on some serious issues. It's certainly one of the more noteworthy webcomics out there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Disassemblance is a very unique comic. First of all, it has a most unusual reader demographic which seems to break fairly evenly into 1/3 christians, 1/3 atheists and a 1/3 pagans. That is a very unusual balance of readers. And it gives insight into the gem that is Disassemblance. The fact that the author has managed to capture relevancy to such differings groups and to bring these readers together (and for the most part - quite peacefully) is impressive. Perhaps due to the unique content &amp; message and the author's method of delivering the messages. The content of the strips deal with every day life issues but all within the objective of building further understanding in mankind of one another. They are extremely reflective while at the same time quite humorous. I've read quite a few web comics, and sure many are more true to life. But few are quite as imaginative and so very satirical and yet at the same time very optimistic. I am actually amazed at the reader retention of Disassemblance. I have repeatedly been surprised to find out that someone I sent a comic too a few months back is actively reading the strip. Especially when it includes my own father, co-workers, etc. I find it interesting that Disassemblance crosses the age barrier as well with readers ranging from teenagers to 50+ year olds. Disassemblance is a comic that has been built up soley by word of mouth (and a bit of merchandise stickers/T-shirts/etc). Is it as large as Red vs Blue. Nope...but many of us find it much more relevant. Furthermore, I can say that Disassemblance has had a direct impact on my life, in bringing things to mind and affecting active thought on my part with regards to the issues. Often necessitating change on my part. That is an impressive "achievement" for a web comic. So sure...you can delete Disassemblance but Wikipedia would lose much respect in my eyes for doing so. Disassemblance is a great and unique comic that needs more support and attention...not less! People need to hear the messages Disassemblance comics say. And in truth, we need the humorous approach to let us hear them openly with out taken to our defensive postures. Please show me another web comic that is not simply humorous but address socio-political issues and has a reader demographic that ranges from teens to baby-boomers, conservative Republicans to leftist liberals, includes christians, atheists, pagans and treats such with relevancy. So if Disassemblance's only failure is to rank low on Alexa (not that I've ever heard of Alexa before) and if such were to be the justification for it's deletion. Than I will strongly question whether Wikipedia's will truly continue in it's goal or simply become another bean counter like so many other web indexes. Disassemblance has a strong, loyal, and growing following. It provides a unique perspective to a broad demographic in a humorous and enlightened way. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesaj_92fa.html" title="User:Thesaj"><b>The Saj</b></a> (July 7, 2005) <i>"The Saj" is 65.85.113.98 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.85.113.98.html" title="User talk:65.85.113.98">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.85.113.98_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.85.113.98">contribs</a>)</i></li>

<li><b>comment</b> just a side note....many of whom you're calling "meatpuppets" are people [like me] who use wiki on a regular basis for gathering info, but who [until this point] either 1. haven't been aware that we could be on the 'edit committee' or 2. didn't know how to join it, or 3. haven't known that it existed at all.

<li>Ditto. I've never bothered to register, though I use Wikipedia all the time, and have even edited/added to articles on occasion. If you want to register click on where it says "create account" in the very top right of the screen.

<li>So what are the justifications for Disassmeblance being singled out? Disassemblance meets the inclusion guidelines in all respects but the "Alexa Test", but obviously the "Alexa Test" is not all there is, or even "has precedent," if other webcomics "make the grade" without it. The bottom line is that Disassemblance is a good webcomic, regularly updates, has longevity, a loyal fanbase, and worthwhile subject matter and viewpoint not seen in many strips. It is worthy to note, and its lack of inclusion, would not only be unfounded, given the precedence, but also a terrible mistake. --24.198.18.42 9 July 2005 05:38 (UTC)</li>
