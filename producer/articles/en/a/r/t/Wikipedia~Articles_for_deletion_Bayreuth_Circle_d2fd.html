<dd>I agree: just because the word 'Kreis' has a capital letter in German doesn't raise the circle of Wagner enthusiasts to any sort of movement. Let me reemphasize: these enthusiasts did <b>not</b> have a 'great cultural impact on the age', <b>nor were they</b> 'a notable German historical phenomenon'. Anyone making such grandiose statements has at least a responsibility to provided some resepectable citation in support - of which we have seen none so far in this debate amongst the 'keeps'.--<a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerus_1e2d.html" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> 17:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have no specific opinion on whether it is in fact true that the circle had any notable effect - but the existence of scholarly literature such as that cited above indicates that such an idea exists out there and that the term has currency. Which for me is enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:37, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is the problem Eusebeus is pointing out. Someone writes a book with 'The Bayreuth Circle' in the title, to describe a social / political / cultural milieu, someone else puts it on WP as a formal body (it even has an organisation-stub tag, would you believe), and then its kept because there's a published title (in a language many of us don't read). Suddenly Winifred Wagner's music evenings have become the precursor to the SA. Utterly nonsensical. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 19:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Suggestion</b> - why not be bold and rewrite the article to give a better idea (as you seem very knowledgeable on the subject) of the origins of the phrase "Beyreuth Circle", the milieu it describes, and the objections to the use of the term?

Yech. Anyway, link, connection, that which brings two things together. The Bayreuth Circle were a link between them - people connected with both, in fact people quite actively connecting them, in the sense of interpreting Wagner to support the Nazis, and encouraging the performance and even adulation of Wagner during Nazism.

<li>As far as I understand, we deal in neither accuracy, nor guesswork, but verifiability.

<li>The obscenity may be uncalled for, but it seems fairly accurate to me. And btw since when have Bnei Brith been recognised authorities on musical history? Just to make clear my own POV, I write as an orthodox Jewish music historian who desparately wishes to draw clear lines between music history and the Holocaust industry. This article is a disastrous concession to the latter by exaggerating something utterly trivial to a specious significance that can clutter school essays under the 'authority' of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I added two more references to the article, in English, from two different college professor's sites. They're pretty damning. I am writing without a POV, I'm just a guy who can type "Bayreuth circle" into Google, and see what comes up. From that, even if the article won't approach "good article" heights, the term looks pretty verifiable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 23:06, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, in response to requests I have rewritten the article with proper references. I deleted one external link which said nothing about the 'BC' except to mention that Chamberlain 'was a member' of it. The other link, which is pretty footling, I have left so you can all assess it yourself. I have given Frederic Spotts's book as appropriate literature; he at least knows what he's talking about and has researched all the German publications relating to Bayreuth.

<li>I'm sorry, and I'm sure you mean well, but I am finding it difficult to see how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bayreuth_Circle&amp;diff=52916798&amp;oldid=52915303" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bayreuth_Circle&amp;diff=52916798&amp;oldid=52915303" rel="nofollow">your edits</a> are more than just deleting references, and arguing, in the article, for the deletion of the article, for lack of those same references. I won't revert your edits without a bit more consensus, since that would be just an edit war, but I hope there is something you could do other than delete my and others' work. By the way, the Bnai Brith you have left with the wonderful comment "does not, as has been claimed by a previous editor of this article, mention the 'Bayreuth Circle'." contains the text: "Richard’s wife Cosima Lizst, the daughter of composer Franz Lizst, was also a vicious antisemite, and after his death in 1893 she consolidated a Bayreuth Circle which attracted such antisemites as racist writer H.S. Chamberlain. This circle attracted the elite of German intelligentsia and royalty, including both Kaisers Wilhelm I and II."<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 23:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re the references - I deliberately removed the German references. Neither I - nor anyone who has contributed - knows what these say. Someone picked up two reference titles from [www.copac.ac.uk] or somewhere, with articles in two obscure German periodicals, not exactly available through your local library. And how many English readers of Wikipedia could read thme, even if they could find them? English articles should show English sources, as a matter of principle - if none are available it's a sign of weakness of the article topic. sorry about the so-called 'Bnei Brith' quote - write in haste, repent at leisure. The quote is actually from a review of the autobiography of Wagner's self-hating grandson, and cannot count strongly as a powerful citation for the topic. I still think the article should be deleted, btw. --Smerus 06:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You actually removed 3 references, in English, that I put in, including 2 with quotes, from university sites. Please look at the "your edit" link I put in above. I'm glad to know that it was inadvertent, but I must ask that you be more careful about that. You're quite right that I haven't read the German references, but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, we need to assume that the editor who put them in has. We can't go around deleting all references we haven't read on the assumption that no one else has read them either. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 23:27, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Now I see the good <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> has erased my nice article and replaced it by a couple of sentences. I have corrected them, by the way. I can't help feeling this was just a little high-handed on Eusebius's part - I shall invoke the shade of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Schumann_9001.html" title="Robert Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, who originally used his pseudonym, and was a responsible musical critic, to haunt him. It seems I can't win - I am castigated for not using my (alleged) expertise, and then when I use it to produce an informed article, it is effectively deleted. <i>C'est la vie, c'est die Scheisse</i>......Anybody who wants to see a 'proper' article on the topic (insofar as there can be one) can see my article by clicking on the history.--<a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerus_1e2d.html" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> 08:33, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've reverted and restored the status quo ante, minus your most recent edits. As I pointed out in my edit summary, apparently Eusebeus attempted to accomplish by "editing" what he could not by deleting. ==<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 10:17, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
