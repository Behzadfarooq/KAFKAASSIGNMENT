<li>If you don't see a reason why this article would be deleted, how do you respond to the nominator's claims that this is a neologism (which we <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">tend to avoid unless they're proven widespread and well-known</a>)? And think of it this way - you wouldn't want people to learn terms that <i>no one uses</i>. Internet chat is internet chat. I don't know anyone who uses the term "MMOCC". Before you say "but they <i>should</i> be using the term", remember that it's not Wikipedia's mission to push new terms and new concepts either; the material has to be remarkable and widely known <i>before</i> getting here. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This information was very useful to me in finding teenage chat communities across the internet. For example, Coke Music - I've never heard of it until today and discovered one of the neatest chat rooms I've ever encountered. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.172.63.214_a033.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.172.63.214">76.172.63.214</a> (talk) 08:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">Neologism</a>. The concept is interesting and remarkable (yes, graphical chat rooms with avatars exist and are popular); however, I have never ever heard the term "MMOCC" used anywhere to refer to this sort of chat places. For an Internet-related term, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=MMOCC&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=230&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=MMOCC&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=230&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">223 distinct Google hits</a> is a pathetic hit count.

<li><b>Keep</b> - MMOCC shoud be kept as it is very resourcefull. If you go on sites such as;<a href="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/wowbb/" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/wowbb/" rel="nofollow">WowWeb Designs</a>, or <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pixeljoint.com" rel="nofollow">Pixel joint</a>, and many other online community sites, the term <i>MMOCC' is used many a times. It is not simply trying to put the acronym 'MMOCC' out there, as it is already used, but for those people who do not knnow what an MMOCC is, the artical can be very usefull for finding that right online chat, or just research in general. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.211.163.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.211.163.13_7b37.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.211.163.13">contribs</a>).</small></i>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If this article goes, who's to say that the MMORPG article sholdn't go too? I'd never heard of the term 'MMORPG' until this year. What is your problem? This is a very informative article. I can think of loads of articles that shouldn't be on wikipedia, as they mean absolutely nothing. Why should Habbo Hotel stay on Wikipedia? It's not in the dictionary. And I'm sure the word 'Habbo' was relatively new when it was launched.

Note this, however: "Habbo" is a <i>fictional</i> term. It refers to the <i>content</i> of the games. "MMOCC" is a "<i>real</i>" term used to describe a real-world construct. <i>That</i> makes it inappropriate unless it's actually famous. Wikipedia has a problem with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>; it's all good and appropriate that "<a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo.html" title="Habbo">Habbo</a>" is a redirect to <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo Hotel</a> because the <i>game itself</i> describes this fictional construct, and as such, we're not publishing new terms, just reporting on an <i>established term</i> that is used in Habbo Hotel. However, "MMOCC" label points to a real-world thing; what's the source for <i>that</i> term? How did it came to be?

<li><b>Keep</b> - Who actually uses the term? Go check on habbo chat clients who uses it... Which at any given time usually has over 10,000 users logged in. Is this huge in comparison to myspace?

<li><i>I</i> call it a graphical chat with multiplayer game elements. Habbo.com <a href="http://www.habbo.com/newusers?partner=newus&amp;isp=newuserlnk2" class="external text" title="http://www.habbo.com/newusers?partner=newus&amp;isp=newuserlnk2" rel="nofollow">calls it</a> a "virtual community", and the term "MMOCC" isn't (according to Google) found on the website. I don't know what the <i>users</i> call it, but I'd wager few call it a "MMOCC". Like the nominator says, we're not concerned with what the players think the thing itself '<i>is</i>; we're more concerned with this question alone: <i>who calls it a "MMOCC"?</i><br />
If you want an easier, completely (yes, <i>completely</i>, without any sarcastic undertones - but hopefully strong enough to drive point across) rhetorical example: I could declare Habbo Hotel a WasteOfTime, and write a Wikipedia article about WastesOfTime similar to Habbo. (Remember, again, this is a <i>completely</i> rhetorical example. As an IRCer, I know that the only thing that deserves the name of "waste of time" is IRC. =) I could use a lot of fancy words that would define how WastesOfTime operate. Now, assume you have been a Habbo user - or just an ordinary MMOG user - all through its existence, and have <i>never</i> heard of Habbo referred to it as such. Wouldn't <i>you</i>, in that case, be terribly interested of who came up with this term "WasteOfTime", and who uses it in scholarly context, and is it truly as widespread as the few loud proponents claim? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 01:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Anyone</i> can submit content to Urban Dictionary. It's <i>not</i> considered a particularly trustworthy site when evaluating popularity of a particular term. Especially one that was submitted in October 2 and has whopping 7 votes since then.

<li>A great resource about a term that few people appear to use. As it's not widely used, we hope it'd be obvious why it is being considered for deletion. Also, I kind of hoped it would be obvious that insulting people is not really helpful toward making people understand your point of view. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 00:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article cites no sources at all. The preceding discussion cites no sources. Doing the research myself, I can find no sources. There is no evidence that a concept of a "Mass Multiplayer Online Chat Community" has actually been documented anywhere at all. The concept <i>hasn't even been documented by its creator(s)</i>. They haven't even published their own documentation for it on web pages of their own. The article is original research, the primary source documentation of a concept that has not yet been acknowledged by anyone and become part of the corpus of human knowledge. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">That is forbidden here</a>. Arguments that other things are not in dictionaries are irrelevant. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.
