<p>Neologism, oxymoron, non-notable. Its only advocates are a few trolls who seem to spend most of their time trying to tick off the various anarchists on wikipedia. It was already nominated for deletion with a consensus to delete, but I don't know what happened there. Do not be fooled by the apparent fullness of the article - the "movement" is confined to a few individuals and websites and the existence of this page adds nothing but ammunition for the trolls. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 19:06, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did some more checking and made some sense of the situation. There was apparently an earlier version of this article created in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> which was deleted. Then, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a> of this year, a new version of the page was created. <i>If</i> that recreated page was more-or-less identical to the deleted one, then it should have been speedy-deleted at that time. In any event, it has now been edited to the point where it is very unlikely to be the same, so it should be treated as a different article and reconsidered for deletion.

<p>I certainly don't see how anyone could consider "national anarchists" anarchists, and it makes about as much sense to file this under anarchism as it does to file national socialism under socialism. I tried to place this article under the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> template, but one of the national anarchists deleted the template.... I say, don't delete it, file it under fascism. Humanitarian</p>

<dd>Fascism isn't just a term to beat people over the head with, and not every group of racist jerks is fascist. The definition of fascism involves totalitarianism and a hand-in-glove relationship between the state and capital; the people who call themselves national anarchists don't seem to advocate either of those things. You're incorrect when you say that "one of the national anarchists deleted the template." I deleted it, and I'm not a national anarchist.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 03:42, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> This deletion attempt is a POV attempt to keep certain anarchist philosophies out of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. The so-called "traditional" anarchists have been trying to censor out anything that's not in keeping with their communist version of anarchism. They're now resorting to try to certify this movement as non-notable (when in fact it is notable), as a desperate attempt to keep national anarchism of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. Also, they have been claiming that since it's for racial seperatism it's not anarchism, which is faulty reasoning. Regardless, nowhere do I see national anarchists advocate "exterminating" the Jews, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> does, and nowhere do I see them calling Jews an "collective organic parasite" as <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> does, yet those individuals are presented as anarchists in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. This picking and choosing of who is or who isn't an "official" anarchist, and censoring or ostracizing them, is not only inconsistent with the NPOV policy of Wikipedia, it's downright Archist.

<p><b>Delete</b> Non-notable. RJ has been running around creating anarchism articles for any two words he can slap together, regardless of the presence or lack of evidence to found the movement. There is no evidence at all that this phenomena exists anywhere outside of the internet, and there are only 3 identifiable individuals associated with it, all of whom reject the claims of the others and call their own version the only one. This is just a series of webpages designed to make the white supremacists look like they have ideological links to movements which they clearly do not. It is also interesting to note that though Proudhon was in fact an anti-semite, RJ have been completely unable to dig up a single primary source indicating him as such, yet another indication of his tendency to create articles and fill them out based on heresay rather than actual facts. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 09:34, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1800 hits sure sounds notable to me. But your wording leads one to believe that your motivations for wanting it deleted is that it's "racist." But, I could be wrong. Hopefully, it's not, because even racist ideologies should be described on Wikipedia.

<dd>I agree that it's bizarre and racist, but I'm not convinced it's non-notable. A quick survey of Google hits shows the following for some of the varieties of anarchism listed in the anarchism template:
<dl>
<dd>Christian anarchism, 5700</dd>
<dd>green anarchism, 5100</dd>
<dd>anarcho-primitivism, 4100</dd>
<dd>national anarchism, 1900</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>IMO, all four of these are probably too inconsequential to be listed in the anarchism template, but I don't see any evidence that national anarchism is a complete fraud compared to the others. (And Christian anarchism strikes me as being every bit as much of a bizarre combo as national anarchism -- yeesh, Emma Goldman must be rolling over in her grave&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 04:26, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think Christian Anarchism is a bit more sensible than some of the others.

<p><b>Keep</b>. It's a real phenomenon and probably encyclopedic enough for Wikipedia.

<p><b>keep</b>. Agree with <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a>. It's not an oxymoron unless you buy into the anarchist ideology that racism and nationalism will automatically dry up and blow away once state coercion is gone; national identity is not the same as the nation-state. It's unfortunate, however, that <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> has been trying to inflate these articles' appearance of significance by adding spammish links from unrelated articles like <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, and has used redundant external links from the articles to do the same thing. Another issue is that people have been adding links to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anarchism.html" title="National anarchism">National anarchism</a> in templates such as Fascism, which is clearly inappropriate, both because the national anarchists don't seem to consider themselves fascists, and because they're not important enough to be included in the template. The "what links here" for national anarchism includes tons of articles which, AFAICT, no longer actually link to it, but may have in the recent past because of templates. (E.g., I just deleted national anarchism from the fascism template, but Nazism still shows up in national anachism's "what links here" page.)--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 15:42, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Salsb. If this were a paper encyclopaedia, I wouldn't see the point of keeping it, but we are under no such constraints here.

<p><b>KEEP</b>! The argument for deletion is blantly POV and sectarian in nature and smacks of censorship.

Whether or not "national anarchists" is a valid as an exponent of anarchism (and I happen to agree that it isn't good anarchism) is entirely irrelevant to whether there should be an article on this topic here on Wikipedia. The argument that the argument is too non-notable to warrant a Wikipedia article is entirely false - the long list of links on this page, the large number of websites (both pro- and anti-NA) resulting from a Google search for "national anarchist" or "national anarchism", the obvious influence it has in the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofolk.html" title="Neofolk">neofolk</a> music milieu, plus the very active <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/National-Anarchist" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/National-Anarchist" rel="nofollow">National Anarchist Yahoo Group</a> are all evidence that this is a topic of interest and criticism for many people and therefore well-deserving of a Wikipedia page to introduce interested people to the topic.

I think maybe it should be developed in parallel to arevision of the NatuionalBolshevik page - particulalrly in relation to the deletion of the reference to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>. (It is perhaps also relevant to link this with the complete take over of Japanese univeristy departments in Scientific method by popperians following the occupation of Japan after the Second World War. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harry Potter</a></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. The term has enough circulation to warrant an article. People seeking to understand its meaning should be able to find neutral information on Wikipedia. â<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorning_star_a8a3.html" title="User:Morning star">Morning star</a> 21:16, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep the article, but delete much of its present content</b> The article <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson_e829.html" title="Peter Lamborn Wilson">Peter Lamborn Wilson</a> identifies Gabrielle D'Annunzio as a "proto-nationalist anarchist", linking here. Whether or not Hakim Bey's interpretations of D'Annunizio are accurate, D'Annunzio as presented by Bey is indeed a kind of "proto-nationalist anarchist", adopting an intermediate position between anarchism and Italian proto-fascism. However, in Bey's account (and I must say I believe in real life as well), his views are not primarily racist. What I mean is this. The real D'Annunzio, and/or the Wilsonian D'Annunzio, may or may not have been racists, but racism was not the focus of their philosophy. They were nationalists, yes, but they did not view nationalism in such a biological sense as more explicitly racist philosophies (Nazism, white supremacy) do. And indeed, this article from its very beginning identifies "nationalist anarchism" with 'white nationalism', i.e. white supremacy. I have never ever heard of anarchist white supremacists. But some of the work of Hakim Bey, explores (without adopting) some ideas of "nationalist anarchism", without being racist (although Bey at other places certaintly seems to endorse "racialism", i.e. blacks are superior; white people are all inferior; but any white person we like isn't really a "white" person, they're actually a celt or persian, which makes them a "black" person, and hence superior... go figure...) In any case, I think the article should be maintained, but its contents modified to remove (or at least de-emphasise) the white supremacy, but discuss Wilson's interpretations of D'Annunzio. -- SamuelKatinsky</p>

<li>There seems to be enough momentum to keep the article and I would agree it needs to be developed. The remarks about Peter Lambourn Wilson aka <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakim_Bey_818f.html" title="Hakim Bey">Hakim Bey</a> are interesting. I think it might also be worth bringing in <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Rocker_49c2.html" title="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a> into the discussion, particularly in relation to his <i>Nationalism and Culture</i>, but perhaps this should be discussed on a talk page! <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 17:00, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
