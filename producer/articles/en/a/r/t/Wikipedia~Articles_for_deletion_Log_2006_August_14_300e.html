<p>This is the second time this article has been nominated for deletion. It was originally deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rules_of_Make_Believe_8da6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rules of Make Believe">here</a>, and was then protected from recreation due to repeated recreations, including changing the guidlines then claiming that it fit. But it's back. Previously, the website, seen <a href="http://www.jushin-manga.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jushin-manga.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> had an Alexa rank of 2.5 million, it is now off the radar with <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.jushin-manga.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.jushin-manga.com" rel="nofollow">no rank</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22rules+of+make+believe%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22rules+of+make+believe%22" rel="nofollow">90 Google hits</a>. Its sole claim of notability is that it was once mentioned in a "Tech News" (CNET?) article in 2002. This is meaningless, it's like being mentioned in a local paper, and I doubt that the story was centred on this webcomic. (note that the reviews linked are not from professional sources, but in fact reader reviews) This is less notable than the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Philip_Sandifer_dc6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Philip Sandifer">Philip Sandifer incident</a> and no way near as popular as Encyclopedia Dramatica.

<p>This is the 3rd nomination for this article. It has been deleted twice before at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_San_Renard_b18d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/San Renard">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_San_Renard_%282nd_nomination%29_8a4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/San Renard (2nd nomination)">here</a>. If this discussion concludes as a delete, I strongly suggest it be protected from recreation. It might not be vanity, but somehow, I think the way this article professes the subject's deep love of his girlfriend in spite of the great difficulties due to distance, hint at it. Also it mentions of the authors' lack of "passion for fame and attention". Let's help this non-notable internet noncelebrity (just read the article and see what important notable things he's done) achieve this by deleting this article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following page has been existence since December 2005, and the top of the page notes "This is a temporary page to host a rough draft of the merger of articles Alternative Metal and Nu Metal". However, in almost a year nothing has been merged, and seems to be nothing more than a waste of space.

<li><u><b>Keep</b></u>, no need to compress articles. There's a lot that can be said about this topic. The idea to merge this is strongly biased, confer <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Abkhazia_e5fe.html" title="Politics of Abkhazia">Politics of Abkhazia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_British_Columbia_f188.html" title="Politics of British Columbia">Politics of British Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Assam_2005.html" title="Politics of Assam">Politics of Assam</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Toowoomba%2C_Queensland_0442.html" title="Politics of Toowoomba, Queensland">Politics of Toowoomba, Queensland</a> and so <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllpages_Politics_of_af7b.html" title="Special:Allpages/Politics of">forth</a>. Any state that has a separate (which is in this case <i>very</i> separate) government, with its own parliament and secretaries, deserves its own Politics article. I agree that this may not be obvious if you don't know the topic, so here's my telling you. The article just needs decent cleanup and considerable expansion. --<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderhead_3955.html" title="User:Thunderhead">Thunderhead</a> 13:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, did anyone saying delete actually READ the page? It's a disambiguation page pointing at the two seperate articles. Whoever first created articles on the "first twins" created ONE article, which was then (rightfully) split into one on each sister. As is unfortunately true of most twins, a great many people think of them collectively, and when looking for information on them would natrually do a collective search. Checking the "What links here" gives us 53 pages including (tellingly, if you ask me) <a href="../../../t/o/p/Wikipedia%7ETop_10_Google_hits%2C_A-K_dce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Top 10 Google hits, A-K">Wikipedia:Top 10 Google hits, A-K</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Wikipedia%7EPopular_pages_54e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Popular pages">Wikipedia:Popular pages</a>. To delete this disambiguation page would be a mistake, leaving stranded anyone looking for information about the Bush twins. At the VERY LEAST it should become a redirect pointing at SOMETHING where people can find what they are looking for. Otherwise it would be left open for the creation of redundant articles. (P.S. Redunant and unnecessary aren't exactly the same). <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 20:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Delete or at least merge with something, this one-sentence vanity article adds nothing on its own. Complete self-serving trash. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtney_Akins_7935.html" title="User:Courtney Akins">Courtney Akins</a> 01:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article is a pretty poor stub at the moment, but should remain for expansion: there is plenty to be said on the subject, and Wiki has a series of "Gay Rights in [Country X]" which is intended to be comprehensive. It's certainly not "vanity" as it doesn't promote any non-notable person or organization. It's just skimpy in its present form. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD">DanB DanD</a> 02:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Ok, but fair enough, lets <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Brazil_b7f7.html" title="Human rights in Brazil">Human rights in Brazil</a> for now then split the article off on its own once its hit "critical mass."<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtney_Akins_7935.html" title="User:Courtney Akins">Courtney Akins</a> 02:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Also, I have to say that the "complete self-serving trash" comment strikes me as a tad inappropriate.

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> The article is a stub, but there are tons of stubs on Wikipedia. The only reason to delete a stub is if there's no possibility to expand the article, or if the article's subject obviously doesn't belong in the encyclopedia. I think just about anyone would argue that this subject can definitely be expanded, and a quick search will turn up many related articles for other countries. As for belonging here, the subject of gay rights is unarguably a large and devisive issue for many countries. Brazil is one of the largest countries in the world, and the largest of its continent, so the issue of gay rights there is most certainly a notable issue. That being said, this article definitely needs a lot of work. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 02:59, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b>, part of a series, one man's trash is another man's article waiting to be expanded. Please explain "self-serving". Courtney's characterizations are disturbing, in that not only is it more than one sentence, has nothing at all about it that can be called vanity, and is well-sourced. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 03:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per NMChico24 and Zoe. This stub has clear possibility for expansion and is actually very well sourced in its own right right now. Merging it as a wait-and-see isn't the best way to approach this, as it involves shuffling content over and then shuffling it back when the (inevitable) expansion occurs, while removing valid <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay_rights_by_country_6550.html" title="Category:Gay rights by country">categorisation</a> in the meantime. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 03:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one's going to use this search term, and frankly I feel the neologism "Christianese" has a very distinct POV. That said, there are certainly words used specifically by certain religious sects. Why not <b>merge</b> that information to articles (or sub-articles?) about those particular religions?<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 21:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you think it's a slur on Christians, it isn't. As a matter of fact, the word is <i>itself</i> Christianese: it arose among evangelicals who feared their proselytizing was ineffective because they "speak a different language" from the people they're talking to. Anyway, the titles of many articles--the names of advocacy organizations and so on--express a PoV. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD">DanB DanD</a> 06:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. Let me address some of the above opinions advocating for deletion.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Non-notable” and “not won anything major”: Xcellent is the winner of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Derby_8b7b.html" title="New Zealand Derby">New Zealand Derby</a>, which is New Zealand's most prestigious three year old race. The horse is notable for this alone, and deserving of an article. But the horse has also won the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelt_Capital_Stakes_bdf1.html" title="Kelt Capital Stakes">Kelt Capital Stakes</a> which is New Zealand's richest thoroughbred horse race. And the horse has won a total of four Group 1 races from just 9 races contested.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if the horse had been a <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky_Derby_fe94.html" title="Kentucky Derby">Kentucky Derby</a> or <a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsom_Derby_8317.html" title="Epsom Derby">Epsom Derby</a> winner if it would be up for deletion. I think not.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">User:Riana_dzasta</a> “it came third” - It ran third in the 2005 <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cup_8497.html" title="Melbourne Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> behind <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makybe_Diva_dede.html" title="Makybe Diva">Makybe Diva</a> – which was the only horse in its 125 year history to win THREE Melbourne Cups, and is one of Australia’s greatest ever staying mares.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlenn_a98b.html" title="User:Glenn">User:Glenn</a> – you may be a kiwi, but you are sadly lacking in your knowledge of New Zealand thoroughbred racing.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalopin_ab51.html" title="User:Galopin">User:Galopin</a> who is a Japanese wikipedian and a very knowledgeable horse racing contributor recognises Xcellent as a notable New Zealand racehorse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if any of the people calling for deletion bothered to Google “horse Xcellent”. If they did they would have got 33,000 hits. Not-Notable? The horse certainly was the subject of a enormous interest from the Australian racing public when it crossed the Tasman Sea for the 2005 <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Spring_Racing_Carnival_42ab.html" title="Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival">Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival</a>.</p>
<p>I small number of wikipedians are making great efforts to increase the number of articles on thoroughbred racing around the world and their efforts will not be helped if we have to constantly defend articles on our chosen subject. The article is a stub, and needs expanding, but I strongly believe that it should not be deleted. - <a href="../../../c/u/d/User%7ECuddy_Wifter_7c6c.html" title="User:Cuddy Wifter">Cuddy Wifter</a> 02:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, I still believe that Maralyn Ramsay satisfies the notability requirement on her own because of her other blood connections (including being in line to the throne by her own right, not just that of her husband). This may even be a case where the wife <i>is</i> more notable than the husband, though I'll admit that I'm not currently conversant enough on the details of these two individuals to make that determination myself (except it is telling that a Wikipedia article on the wife appeared before an article on the husband). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me that there was a reasonable rationale for including UK peers by default so long as they could sit in the House of Lords, not that most of them cared to do so. That made them more or less comparable with Senators in the US/France/&amp;c. However, that's no longer the case. That doesn't retroactively make them nn, but it does mean that there is a good deal less reason to include peers and their families now than there was a decade ago. In this specific case it does seem odd to have an article on the wife rather than the husband, who probably qualified in that he was a peer in the period when they could sit in the upper chamber. My own view is that neither of them is of any great importance, probably less important than local council leaders, most of whom we delete without much fuss at AFD. I used to rent an apartment from a Count, and had French lessons from the grandson of Duke; I suspect that they'd be amazed to learn that their ancestry made them notable. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Note that we have generally considered Irish peers since 1801 and Scottish peers between 1707 and 1958 as automatically notable, despite the fact that, like today's hereditary peers, they only served in the house of lords if they were elected as representative peers. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 10:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I feel that peeresses are fair game, especially when combined with two peeress cousins and a spot in the line of succession to the British throne, as well as descent from the Russian Imperial Family.

<li><b>Delete.</b> nn, yes <i>someone</i> <i>may</i> be interested in her, but there's no indication that she's done anything but marry and procreate -- something that several billion other people have done -- the fact that she is distantly related to some famous people does not make her notable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 06:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b>, I think. I think any peer or peeress has generally been considered to qualify as <i>a priori</i> notable.

<p>The result was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). Not the easiest of decisions here with 12d/5k which is frequently sufficiently strong for consensus, but I have registered that there have been significant attempts at improving the article during the course of the discussion. One of the arguments presented (unverifiability) appears to have been countered and I gather that a Google search which someone referred to does give some independent media mentions, e.g. <a href="http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060817/NEWS01/608170346" class="external text" title="http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060817/NEWS01/608170346" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. I am uncertain about notability here, but I will call this a no consensus based on new evidence surfacing over the course of the discussion. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:00, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Self-promotional (see creator's username and record company), debut album comes out this fall, not famous yet. We are not a promotional vehicle. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 03:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Artist's label created the page, yes. But, as far as the debut album coming out this fall, I didn't know that such promotional information is prohibited, and to prevent the page from being deleted, the info was changed. To counter your suggestion that including a listing of Cory Phillips is somehow inappropriate because he is not famous yet to your specification, phillips is a very popular live musician in Los Angeles. And what difference does it make whether or not there is a commercial music product for sale to validate him to you? Does participation in the capitalist system only validate a public figure on Wikipedia? I did not think so. Thermalrecords 06:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Participation in the "capitalist system" isn't strictly necessary, but the bar for inclusion for most people is much higher without a major label/produced well-selling record. See <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for some of the suggestions: was he featured in multiple non-trivial published works (such as LA papers, music trade magazines of record, etc)? Was he ever in a notable band prior to his current "supergroup" (or was anyone else)? Has he won a major music award or competition, and do you have proof as it is reported in the press? Is he the most prominent representative of a notable style of music, and has this been reported as such? You have options, and you have at least four days to make your case...thanks for trimming the article already of the promotional material, and welcome to Wikipedia! Cheers, and as noted below, if his record takes off and he does become more famous this fall, it's intensely likely a fan will come and write an article for you! -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 12:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I love the site, I visit it often, and I've participated on the forums. However, it's does not meet the notability requirements for wikipedia.</p>
<p>It fails two important guidelines. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> The site was created and heavily edited by the site creator who goes by the nickname Delphi. The site was featured in two mass-media publication, however, the seem part of the excluded content of WEB #1: "Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the Internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of Internet addresses and site or content descriptions in Internet directories or online stores."</p>
<p>The site also has a high Alexa rank. However, web ranking is not a criteria for inclusion in the wikipedia and shouldn't be considered. Also, a detailed search query of google shows that 90,000+ of the unique google hits belong to the page itself. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hs=YSU&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Modthesims2+-forum+-fourms+-blog+-blogs+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hs=YSU&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Modthesims2+-forum+-fourms+-blog+-blogs+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. A vanilla search of the site's name reveals that there are only 635 unique web entries.</p>
<p>The article is also somewhat of a link farm that may also be a violation of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.</p>
<p>It's a very good resource and should be referenced in the main Sims2 article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would think that since it has been featured on G4TV's Attack of the Show and in Rolling Stone Magazine it is good enough. Maybe not for you, but it's still a third party reference of notability of the site. And in no place does it say in the policy about how it should be featured by the third party. When said sources recognize it, it is automatically notable. <i>"Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.</i>" Both of those are credible, and are reputable. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 11:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is a general-knowledge encyclopedia. While it does not have the same physical limitations as a printed encyclopedia, it isn't the universal vault of all obscure fan knowledge. While MTS2 is certainly not obscure in the Simming community, I'm not sure it's something of benefit to the general reading public. In addition, when the article was created by the website owner and approx. 25% of the edits were made by him, with another 25% or so being made by editors whose only contributions are in this article (realizing, of course, that some of these are may have been made by people who have since registered), I do wonder about <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. While this is somewhat to be expected of an article of this nature, the only main namespace article linking to this one (other than redirects) is the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sims_2_4964.html" title="The Sims 2">The Sims 2</a> article. As far as the Rolling Stones, etc., reference is concerned, I agree that a single off-handed mention does not constitute notability - it constitutes fortuitous coincidence. Out of curiosity, does anyone know if there was any significant increase in the hit count for MTS2 immediately following this mention? --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindrain0000_a57c.html" title="User:Braindrain0000">Carl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraindrain0000_b3ff.html" title="User talk:Braindrain0000">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Braindrain0000_7580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Braindrain0000">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do refer to the comment above: yes there are a lot of articles that need to be considered for deletion. However, this deletion is about MTS2: not the hundreds of other poorly-sourced, iffy articles on websites which need to be examined. "There are articles with more trivial sources than this one" is not a valid argument for keeping. Given the time and attention of dedicated editors and (hopefully) a new focus on quality over quantity by the wikipedia foundation, I hope they will be evaluated in due time and with due process. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A line must be drawn; when a site has been mentioned in two very reliable sources, it deservs a mention. I myself am an inclusionist (but I am sure you are aware of that fact). If articles are deleted on the grounds that they are "poorly-sourced", "iffy articles" etc. and are just deleted without having the chance to be buildt upon and improved. It's going to be very hard to get anything up on WP.

<li>It <i>should</i> be "hard" to "get stuff up" on wikipedia (i.e. there should be standards); especially when it's a fansite. Collocating and merging such things will not harm wikipedia. If the site's included in a link in the main Sims 2 article, there would be nothing lost. The problem is that you a mistaking two mentions of a URL in the mass media as "sources". Have you read the sentence in Rolling Stone that you're calling a source? It's not even about the site; it's about Brokeback Mountain. The TV "source" is equally trivial. Read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which states the inclusion guidelines for media sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> a list is not an ojective decsion because the list serves as a stub like the example of the software split. It should be expanded with a concise comparison based upon usage statistics, and its role in modern business.The multiprotocol list is useful for research. The point that 2bit software/freeware is added wrecklessly can be addressed by a requirement that the new entry must have 2-5 verifiable outside links (ie: sorceforge), and that their entry is placed inot talk before it is added. I thinks this is a better solution than deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page serves no purpose other than to allow non-notable two-bit apps to appear alongside notable ones. It's a pointless list and you don't learn anything. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndymarczak_410b.html" title="User:Andymarczak">Andymarczak</a> 06:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is nothing inherently POV about comparison. You can easily compare by sets of criteria that are not POV-laden. Comparing seems like a reasonable name for the article, because that's what it does (lists what features each client does or doesn't have). Also, I <b>Strongly Disagree</b> with the idea that this falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Yellow Pages</a>. Such a list is very useful and informative to users that are in search of instant messaging clients and/or services. [Comparison of instant messaging clients] is not simply a directory, but a well laid-out and deserving article. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">Ardent</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><font color="#33CCCC"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree">∈</a></sub></font> 15:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - where the hoax issue is concerned, the words are certainly cognate to the relevant Turkish infinitives ("asmak" and "kesmek"), so nobody's trying to pull the wool over our eyes by sneaking an obscenity in, since Azeri's close enough to Turkish for the words not to have changed enough.

<li><b>Comment</b> my challenge is on the premise of its claim to be "It is one of the oldest dances which is current in marriage". Apologies if it was misunderstood: I was not challenging the existence of the dance, nor that it has a very long history. An assertion to notability of the dance such as "It is a folkloric dance which dates back to the Xth century" would appear sufficient in this regard. With respect, I would content that <a href="http://azerbaijanidances.blogfa.com/" class="external text" title="http://azerbaijanidances.blogfa.com/" rel="nofollow">the source</a> of the translated document itself needs to be subject to the same credibility test. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:01, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Even junior boxing champions that have received <i>zero</i> media attention?

Since he's made no significant or lasting impact to his field, and has received absolutely no recognition from third parties, there's not much reason to include his article here. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<span style="font-size: smaller;"><sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>chat me up</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_RandyWang_2_3c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/RandyWang 2"><b>fix me up</b></a></sub></span>) 11:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I see RandyWang's point perfectly, but what makes Omar notable is this – he is a Muslim boxer in a predominantly white field, and his religion is at odds with his impending success. There has actually been a fair amount of controversy in boxing circles in the past few days about the guy [my Google search got 401 hits for <i>"omar shaick" boxing</i>, by the way – what terms did you use?] I don't see any reason why there should be an article about him, unless this gets big. He isn't notable as a boxer, yet. He's notable for his refusal to get tested, and his religion. I'm going to abstain from voting on this one [after all that!!!] <small>— <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana_dzasta</a> • <a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">c</a> • <font color="green">e</font> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Riana_dzasta_04dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Riana dzasta">ER</a> • 12:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</small></s>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Aren't you meant to be on enforced WikiBreak?&#160;:) You're right though, I seem to have used the wrong search terms: I get 479 for simply "Omar Shaick," but that still doesn't seem enough to demonstrate notability. As far as I can tell, the only significant thing he's done is refuse a drug test, but that's not really a particularly notable thing. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<span style="font-size: smaller;"><sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>chat me up</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_RandyWang_2_3c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/RandyWang 2"><b>fix me up</b></a></sub></span>) 23:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I found out how to bypass it&#160;:) I still stand by my previous comment, though – I think he's at least slightly notable due to the fact that it's not just a normal refusal to get tested, it's for religious reasons. It's interesting how many articles on the web about the controversy display such blatant anti-Islamicism and racism [note: no bias here... I've been raised Hindu. OK, maybe a little&#160;:)]. That said, unless this hits the fan (which I doubt it will), there's not much need for a proper article about him. Aaargh, that sounds confusing! In summary – he is slightly notable (notorious?), but right now we don't need an article about him. <b>Weak delete</b> <small>— <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana_dzasta</a> • <a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">c</a> • <font color="green">e</font> • <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Riana_dzasta_04dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Riana dzasta">ER</a> • 01:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Okay didn't realise I would cause controversy over this. As the person who originally added the article I'm not going to vote. I have zero interest in boxing, never heard of the guy, but then again I can probably name about 2 or 3 boxers in the world. When I saw the article on the ABC News site I thaught that it was interesting enough to see what WP had to say. When I realised he had no article I thaught I'd add it. I more or less (if I remember correctly) wikified the news article. If this is a copyvio (copyright violation, I'm assuming) I appologise. I knew the article couldn't be just that story, but as I knew nothing else about him, I figured someone who did (and actually cares about boxing) could add more info. If it gets deleted for any reason, I won't lose any sleep over it, I really did add it in good faith. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAussieDingo1983_466f.html" title="User:AussieDingo1983">AussieDingo1983</a> 11:38, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Pulavar Kulandhai's book was initially banned by Madras Government, but the ban was revoked by the Tamil Nadu Government and today excerpts from the work are given in the Government Text Books as a chapter for Class X Tamil Subject. The book is same as Ramayana except for few variation - Ravana as Hero and Rama as Villain and Rama as Aryan and Ravana as Dravidian. Hence that book is totally verifiable and is not a original research. (Please see the History of TamilNadu to know what is Madras Government and what is Tamil Nadu Government)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Rewrite</b> It has been established in presN that mods are indeed notable. However, this article needs a rewrite. Nothing will be done on wikipedia however of any note if articles are deleted in their infancy. This particular mod has been commended by VaLVE, the creators of the Half-Life series of games and in some media sources. Immediate lack of such mention and the format of the article are grounds for a rewrite, not an immediate deletion. The following link gives a basic idea. <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/January27.2006/" class="external free" title="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/January27.2006/" rel="nofollow">http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/January27.2006/</a> <s>--Palehorse864 06:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.48.159.136 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.48.159.136_c0b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.48.159.136">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know much about Half-Life 2, but besides that Valve played a game with them and promoted their mod, does having their mod being selected for distribution over STEAM with other selected mods and commercial products make the mod notable?<a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=all&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=all&amp;" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Or is any mod that reached a certain development stage allowed to be pushed through STEAM?

<p>Article had an AfD tag, but no page created so I'm listing it. I can see why it was tagged considering WP:NOT a soapbox - this article seems to have been created and is being maintained for the sole purpose of promoting Raj Bhakta and his congressional campaign. <b>Delete,</b> maybe insert a paragraph about him into Apprentice 2 Candidates article and redirect it to that page - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulus89_6ad4.html" title="User:Paulus89">Paulus89</a> 14:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, abuse of wikipedia as entry is being maintained by paid employee of political campaign which regularly deletes information not favorable to the campaign including references to Mr. Bhakta's DUIs until others cried foul, deletion of references to articles from the Hill and the Philadelphia Inquirer unfavorable to the candidate, use of spam blogging to intimidate Wikipedians making comments. Page is nothing more than a thinly veiled piece of campaign literature. Bruceberry 11:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Article should be watched closely, and if editors are removing pertinent info in bad faith, they should be warned/blocked. When I read the article today, though, it didn't strike me as campaign propaganda (maybe because the DUI and false-accusation stuff was in it). <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 15:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The conduct of certain editors doesn't change the fact that the subject of the article meets criteria for notability on account of his TV appearance on The Apprentice and his campaign.

<p>While I'm hesitant to nominate an article for deletion when it has received more edits than many Featured Articles, I feel I have no choice in this case. It's completely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, with the 'question and answer' format just an excuse to pack even more fancruft into an already unencyclopaedic article. The title itself is a weasel word; alleged by who? The article never says.

<dd>In addition, Dr Gargolye should familiarise himself with wikiquette.

However, removiing tags like "unreferenced" or "NPOV" without having put the article right can be considered vandalism.

<dd><b>Comments:</b> About the bad-faith nom, that's not the case at all. I'm actually a pretty big fan of the band, just don't think the band articles qualify for notability. This is a combined Afd for all the aritcles mentioned in the nomination (as proposed on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>), so there's no need for an extra section for each seperate article. And lastly, the criterias from <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> apply, yes. But only to the band, not its individual members. That's a major difference which many of the articles' editors don't seem to realize, as they are recreted/made redirects/recreated/etc. every now and again. Especially since the articles don't state their notability, it would be reason alone to delete them. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 17:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet, as I also said in the nom: The fact that other band members have pages does not justify the necessity of the Panic! at the Disco articles. And those <i>striking</i> similarities between the bands... well. Just because somebody is in a Las Vegas rock band does not make him notable for a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 14:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case please address two concerns I have 1.) What has another band (we can take my example of Killers) done to get forked pages, that P!atD has not. You can also provide an example of a successful AfD for band member page. Then point out what worked for that band and bring it here. 2.) Opening AfD with "The fact that other band members have pages does not justify the necessity of the Panic! at the Disco articles" as a means to circumvent <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> requriments tested before seems to be 'Framing the debate' and intentionally attempting to crimple any argument to support sub-pages, such as individual band member pages. How can you justify that statement as not an attempt of 'framing the debate'? <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackajar_d1e3.html" title="User:Hackajar">Hackajar</a> 14:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not framing the debate, I'm merely pointing out that every Wikipedia article has to stand for itself. Each article must state why the subject is notable. Referencing other articles in the sense of "If <i>this guy</i> gets an article, so should I!", is not a valid criteria for notability on Wikipedia. That's the whole point I was trying to make with the statement you quoted, you see. I hope this clears up the concerns. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 19:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It could possibly be merged into the University article as per Fg2, but this can be done with a {merge} tag and discussion when someone actually takes up the task, and there seems to be no harm in keeping this as a stub article until that might happen - it doesn't seem to be a puffery attempt by suTCo fans. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 07:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Probably there is nothing to tell about the 2028 presidential election and 2032 Olympics, but in F1 there are already discussion for next years (long term contracts). So if there are interesting news about future season, let keep it. But I think we need some experts to give opinion (or to add relevant content to article). <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECate_0f06.html" title="User:Cate">Cate</a> 14:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - The tire fact is true, but is on the 2008 site, since the agreement starts in that year. The 2009 article exists, but with good reason as the Formula One Management has made announcements about 2009. I think that until they make news specific to 2010 (which could be next summer?) we probably don't need this one yet. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian_G_f919.html" title="User talk:Brian G">Talk</a>) 23:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The issue of deleting is not that important, because we <i>will</i> have this article sometime (assuming that F1, WP, the earth still exist); but those who believe that AfD's have precedent value can hang on to this one and speedy the recreation of the article for all eternity. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 06:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unlike nearer F1 years or other future sporting events there just isn't much to say about this one yet - as evidenced by the lack of content. I can't remember any announcements relating to 2010 having come out yet. If anyone's got something solid then fine, but I don't think there will be for a little while yet. --<a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 07:06, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Besides the Bridgestone fact, article could include Grands Prix, teams and drivers that have contracts that go as far as 2010 and are thus semi-confirmed. The new engine development freeze was supposed to last until the end of the 2010 season, but it was changed to 2007-2009. This shows that there are rule changes made by FIA that go as far as 2010, and these can be published at any time. The article is not crystal balling and might prove useful. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 00:42, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, it's generally a bad idea to write about anything that you have any kind of self interest in. When this reaches the proper level of "notability," it will be recreated and should remain an article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't understand why it is acceptable for individuals with apparently little topic knowledge to make the decision to "house clean" and wipeout an entire topic area. The people who have been building that page, including a few measly edits by me over the years, have spent a lot of time sorting data and fending spam to get a decent, definitive list of information together. Those of us who write and use this software find this list extremely valuable. Should the entire body of CMS knowledge be wiped clean - even though a year ago it was fine? I really would like to see some insightful commentary by those with real knowledge of this topic area. CMS web applications hardly existed 5 years ago, and now are overly abundant - the are the genesis of wikipedia itself. I think the pillars should be adhered to - all biased information should be removed, and we should <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a>. Most of these applications are written by geeks in basements like me, not large corporations. For all the WP this and WP that, this body of knowledge is at the center of changing our species. Wikipedia should have a definitive guide to this, since it is what wikipedia is in itself. What I find abhorrent are people with clubs who come in and knock over blocks that other people have been collecting over the years and shove "policy" in people's face. I now feel compelled to go re-read <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a>. I know all have the best intentions and want to improve quality, however deleting knowledge is not the best means to acheive this, especially when those shouting "delete it" have no topic knowledge. I make a third request for someone with real knowledge of the CMS space to offer some insight. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiderr_f5be.html" title="User:Spiderr">Spiderr</a> 05:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The assumption that nobody involved in the debate (with the exception of the supporters) has any knowledge of CMS is slightly rash. Aside from that, it is acceptable for the continuing existence this article to be challenged by non-experts because WP has guidelines and policies which they can apply without expert knowledge of the subject. The coverage of the CMS subject area on WP will be considerably better if the non-notable products are removed: as you say, there are a lot of systems coded by geeks in basements, but that doesn't entitle every geek in a basement to the right to an article. If the article can't establish notability then it is correct to conclude it isn't notable, expertise in the subject not withstanding. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 09:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Satori, I am sorry you are frustrated, and feel compelled to make such disparaging comments. In your 6 months of being here, I am skepitcal you have learned the true essence of wikipedia enough pass judgement on others. This kind of comment comes across as someone less interested in the usefulness of the information, and more interested is "rules and regulations and policies and debate", none of which help people like myself who greatly appreciate a source of information for something they use personally and professionally and helped build. I am sure there are areas about attorneys that I might not find useful, but I certainly don't feel it my place to go and judge the worthiness of the content, such as you do here. I would like to know why you think the vulnerability evaluations are insufficient. Your motives appear personal at this point, and thus your vote has devalued merit, in addition to your lack of knowledge about what qualifies as notability in this debate. I know you want to make wikipedia better, so instead of thumbing through pages and deleting accumulated knowledge, offering to make a *positive* contribution would be much more helpful. If I have misunderstood, I would appreciate clarification. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiderr_f5be.html" title="User:Spiderr">Spiderr</a> 20:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Topic area knowledge appears crucial to this particular debate, and I have requested those with a vested interest to speak up. In both deletion debates, the hinging argument has been on notability, and both times, it has been mentioned that having multiple top tier application security site evaluations and notices about the software, as well as mention on Newsforge, a huge technical resource for software developers, was more than sufficient for it to have received enough notability. The two delete's from Santori and yzzy_n fail to address why that is insignificant notability. My consensus, based on their edits, is they have little to know first hand knowledge of what makes a "notable" web application. I have a vested interest, not only in this page, but all of the pages on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_content_management_systems.html" title="List of content management systems">list of content management systems</a>. It is my desire for the community that BUILT that topic area to be the ones to determine it's future, not the self-appointed thought police who were never a part of building that knowledge.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Spiderr, to be honest, Wikipeida has rules, guidelines and standards that apply to all articles. It doesn't matter if an article has been here since wikipedia's inception or was just created a minute ago. The same rules apply. Regardless of what you 'believe', <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> need to apply to all articles. Those are rules you can't ignore.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wikipedia's three content policies are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Because the three policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</i></dd>
<dd>A few things to point out is <i>We hope expert editors will draw on their knowledge of published sources to enrich our articles, bearing in mind that specialists do not occupy a privileged position within Wikipedia.</i> (from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) So while you can call in 'specialists' their opinions hold no more weight than that of any other user nor does it mean that only 'specialists' may decide what is or is not notable or if an article passes all of Wikipedia's standards.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This AfD is not about censoring anything as you are hinting to with your Animal Farm refs. This is about determining whether or not the subject of the article is notable, verifiable, and meets all of wikipedia's policies for inclusion in an article of it's own. Suppose I had a friend who wrote a book about wikilawyering. He wouldn't be notable enough for an article of his own, nor would his book be. However, if there was an article on that book about various aspects of wikicommunities, it might have a factoid that reads "Newbies often use repeated, outlandish proposals, often failing to convince the established members of the community. For example, <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwolf</a> wrote a book "Wikilawyer for Hire" (2008, O'Ridley &amp; Patrons), where he states (pp. 42-43) that melodramatic polemic is 'the oldest trick ever in Wikipedia AfD debates' and won't win you any friends." See? Facts can exist even when they don't have articles of their own. Hence, comparing this AfD to censorship, or even book burning (if I recall Animal Farm correctly) is silly to say the least.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original information nor is it a free webhost either, as stated in policy. If the history of the website in question is available here but not on the site in question (or some other website that has researched the background of the site), then that is backwards. Wikipedia articles are to cite multiple, Reputable/Reliable, Independent, Third-Party sources who can present 'pre-chewed' pieces of information, and condense that information to something that tells the uninformed people with one glance on what this stuff is about.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with the Newsource article interview is it is not focused on Bitweaver only. That makes it a 'trivial-source' per the stated Policies (read them if you disbelieve me). We do not have Multiple, Reliable, Independent, Third-Party sources that mention this software exclusively. We have an article with a passing reference, and a handful of security warnings from a software security website. Nothing that would denote a passing of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 22:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In my opinion <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> isn't really the issue here. Any claims about third parties that are made in the article are referenced and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> specifically allows self-published sources to be used in articles about themselves. As I see it notability is the problem, and it is important to remember that, despite earlier claims, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are <i>only</i> guidelines and not policies, and that <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is not even a guideline. As a proposed guideline it should be treated with a great deal of caution - a criterion that it puts forward may be the opinion of no more than a couple of people, and may be gone tomorrow. The wikilawyering by the article's supporters isn't helping, but I'd ask everybody to look at the article again and ask yourself whether you would nominate it for deletion if you came across it at random. I'm not arguing in favour of it because I fixed it up (I've fixed up articles and still argued for them to be deleted), but because I think the bar for notability here is being set too high when compared to other articles we've kept (kept <i>after</i> AFD, not kept because nobody has put them up for deletion yet). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The only thing I want to point out is there are limits to what is acceptable as a self-published source (From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) <i>Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, <b>so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party news organizations or publications. However, exercise caution: if the information on a professional researcher's blog is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so.</b></i> Hence the reason I said this fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 13:49, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yomangani, I completely respect your opinion in this matter and thank you for keeping civil discourse when so many would fall into feeling this was a personal matter. Again thank you! To continue the debate, the reason I failed to mention this part is because I believe their personal website fails because it is unduly self-serving and with the comment about the "bitweaver vs 'the man': Will takes on NYC cronies" it involves claims about third parties and events not directly related to the subject. I am not seeing how their website is also relevant to their notability.

<li>Ah, it appears that we have interpreted the policy in different ways - I looked at those rules as applying to the material directly used in the resulting article, whereas you seem to have applied them to the source material in general. Unfortunately, when looking again at the policy it doesn't seem clear (at least to me) which is correct, so I can't very well continue trying to convince you of my point when I could be wrong. Just for the record, I was never claiming that the material from the site established notability, just that it allowed the article to be exempt from the requirement for additional third party sources when refering to itself (and hence not failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>).

<li>Brian, Apparently we are not able to communicate well. The shifting sands of WP:this and WP:that, not to mention the "highly contentious" notability guidelines throughout this dialog, without making specific reference to the exact information at issue is very unhelpful. Yomangani has done a great job listing his issues on the Talk page so they can be addressed and that works very well. Please list very detailed criticisms of what you consider at issue on the Talk page, or better yet, please make a positive contribution to the article so it can meet your standards. Both of these actions require some time and effort on your part, however since you are advocating removal of knowledge, I certainly would appreciate some elbow grease to convince me this information should be removed, or as I said, i would love if you could lend a hand and bring it up to your own standards.

<li>JzG - Thanks for your participation. I appreciate all the edits you have made on software technical articles. I would request a re-consideration of VSCA if you have time for a recap of how we got here. I am a leader in this project, though with 60 developers, and tens of thousands of downloads, this is not my personal project. After the initial AfD, community came and tried to improve the quality, however, their, er "over-exuberance" led to a rash of non NPOV edits. After a delete, it was quickly recreated by someone else with a copyvio. So, Xinggg and I tried to step in and avoid the "help" of the community, to make a fair, and complete article that would sit well along side articles of sibling applications so the uninformed can understand how these applications compare in design, functionality, and purpose <a href="../../../t/i/k/TikiWiki_9fbe.html" title="TikiWiki">1</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drupal.html" title="Drupal">2</a>, <a href="../../../x/a/r/Xaraya.html" title="Xaraya">3</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Content_Management_Systems_2281.html" title="List of Content Management Systems">etc</a>.

I attempted to look up about half of the awards and could find few if any Ghits for the awards themselves (probably due to age of the award).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Since you felt the need to add the big pink box lower down the page it seems that traffic is flowing to wikipedia. Therefore, I think it's fair to say that this is not an being used as an advertisement, but a way to share information - which is my understanding of what wikipedia is supposed to be about. I've learned a lot about the show and its creators by reading this page. I would hope that if given a chance there will be an episode by episode account - similar to what was done with many television shows. DrumIntellect 18:34, 18 August 2006 (EST)

As far as I know, Israelisms is the only podcast of its kind that provides a man (and woman) on the street perspective of current news events in Israel. I think it has value. The listing as it is currently written doesn't sound overly promotional to me. --Mfogarty 15:30, 18 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Mfogarty (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mfogarty_618a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mfogarty">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Preserve</b> The Israelisms Podcast is unique in that it brings perspectives on Israel to the world in a way that is not available through mainstream media. My family and friends use the program as a starting point of discussion on political and moral issues. In that sense, it is an important Podcast. It seems like a user here has an issue with the listing being promotional, a grievance that may be better addressed by suggesting an edit, rather than a deletion. <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Sgersh (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgersh_adb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgersh">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>What issue</b> I have viewed the wikipedia entries for The Closer,Hell's Kitchen,JawBone Radio, and I fail to see any issue that would cause this article to be nominated for deletion Other than the Fact that the name for the entry is Israelisms. I have looked at all the guidelines about article deletion and find no disparity against said guidelines. I am not a contributor or a user therefore I have no biased opinion except for the facts that are spelled out by Wikipedia users. This is a new site - I see no issues with it compared to any other site except for someone's personal bias. It would benefit the administrators to look into all the other sites mentioned above before issuing their decree upon this article. --John M. 21:32, 18 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Gigasr (<a href="../../../g/i/g/User_talk%7EGigasr_d739.html" title="User talk:Gigasr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gigasr_6d68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gigasr">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>This is a single purpose account.</b> After all, I just created it. The longtime editors can ignore all new voices as "Single Purpose Account" all they want to, and ignore the fact that once upon a time, THEIR accounts could also have been tagged as "Single Purpose" but the fact remains -- just because this is the first time I have felt the need to say something doesn't mean that I am not a Wikipedia user. It simply means that this is the first time I have been aggravated enough to SAY something. It's clear that everyone arguing in favor of keeping the page are using "Single Purpose" accounts, and that they are Podcast listeners. What is not as clear are the motives of the "editors" who have seen fit to comment on the legitimacy of this page. Editors acting in good faith would actually address the questions raised by those here -- how is this page different than others referenced above that have not been challenged? How can the page be edited to make it more closely conform to Wikipedia policies?<a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcartreel_ddd0.html" title="User:Ycartreel">Ycartreel</a> 03:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)ycartreel <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcartreel_ddd0.html" title="User:Ycartreel">Ycartreel</a> (<a href="../../../y/c/a/User_talk%7EYcartreel_af99.html" title="User talk:Ycartreel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ycartreel_ab05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ycartreel">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Preserve</b> I hope that the AFD will please be tolerant of the posts listed here. I know there are a lot of first time contributors and others (myself included) are new contibutors. And, I know that the Israelisms web site asked for help in maintaining the article here in Wikipedia, but in all honesty - we are all amateurs in the Wikipedia process and are learning. Please know that the Israelisms site receives no funding for its podcast and we pay nothing to listen. And I know that the Israelisms article may not have a huge readership, but a small crowd is valuable too...yes? I would ask that the contributor who is asking for the deletion please help us instead to change the wording or make it a better article. In fact, I would ask that all who come here would please help us to do a better job. Thank you, --Staceyferguson 11:13, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Preserve</b> I too am a first time contributor and have come here because, as a listener of the Israelisms podcast, I have been made aware of the fact that someone is challenging the right for Israelisms to have an entry in Wikipedia. It is not like this is the first podcast to have an entry. Two of podcasts I listen to - Extralife and Jawbone Radio - have entries and I have read all three entries again before making these comments and I really don't think that the Israelisms entry is any more an advertisement for their show than the other two. Therefore I really must question Dseryn's motives for singling Israelisms out.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I didn't "single out" Israelisms; I stumbled across it while doing some disambiguation. However, your point about the other podcasts is a good one - perhaps those should be scrutinized also.

<li><b>No delete'</b> Thanks for the comment Weak Delete: we agree 1 criteria has been met.Podcasting at best has been main stream for only about 18 months,[check Adam Curry's wiki]I say why kill off an entire growing industry,let alone one podcast out of 123 <a href="../../../p/o/d/Category%7EPodcasts_42a2.html" title="Category:Podcasts">Category:Podcasts</a>.The community has set this precedent not the One but the many. The Web! Tell me what's a webby award or a blogger award.These are Products created by those to foward their creations ie Blogging software,web site design etc. These also are niche awards for the few do they deserve a Wiki. This i can say the birthing pains of an industry are tough enough to overcome,But the narrow mindedness of a few over this one article is intolerable. Should we accept the rough guidelines a few recklessly use as their athority the wiki would count in the 10's of thousand and not the millions.Israelisms should no more be deleted than the first bloggers or the first web designer placed in this community.

<li><b>Preserve</b> Questionable notability for this deletion seems to be it is considered Advertising. Wikipedia defines advertising as "Advertising is the commercial promotion of goods, services, companies and ideas...". Israelisms is NOT a commercial enterprise or affliated with any commercial enterprise. Israelims does NOT promote goods or services. Therefore the Advertising basis cannot work.

<li><b>Preserve</b> There are many entries in Wikipedia for "pop culture" items that wouldn't be the subject of a traditional encyclopedia - I kind of thought this was the point of Wikipedia - it can be more current and responsive to new trends than a traditional encyclopedia. Yes the article could have some information added but what is already there is accurate and would be helpful to people who are looking for background information about the show. As others have said there are articles about other podcasts, radio shows, books, tv shows etc that are similar in style and content to this one and unless we're going to rid wikipedia of them all there is nothing to separate the Israelisms entry from those others. Oh and yes I have just created this account - I last contributed to Wikipedia a year ago and I don't remember the password I had then. But why should someone have to be interested in more than one wikipedia article in order to have what is considered a valid opinion? Why isn't the wikipedia community seeing this as an opportunity to engage a whole swag of new participants? How can an article that generates lots of 'single purpose accounts' be considered an article that there is no interest in (I'm reliably informed you cannot have your cake and eat it too) BSquaredInOz 03:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: BSquaredInOz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BSquaredInOz_31ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/BSquaredInOz">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>.</li>

<p>Firstly I am a First Time Poster, but I would like you to consider my point of view. I did become aware of this discussion, through mention of the website, but I am here voicing my own opinion. This is not about winning a Vote.</p>
<p>Please consider keeping Israelisms, in your Wikie Encyclopedia. Their show may be controversial to some, due to their point of view, being Jewish.</p>
<p>Although their opinions, may not match other people's, Ideals, it is none the less valid, because it is the perspective of those living within Israel, today.</p>
<p>This makes them Unique, and I challenge anyone to find another Podcast, that compares to it. It is their Uniqueness, that should qualify them to be in your Wikie.</p>
<p>To what I am aware of, they at no time, try to attempt to sell anything, while I have been listening to them. It is seems more of a Political Show, that reflects what it is like to live in Israel today. I fear, that the questioning of Israelisms, in the Wikie, may be more about Censorship, than concern about Advertising. I enjoy listening to their show, because I get a Window into their world, that I could not obtain through other means, including the various News Broadcasts.</p>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> I am the original creator of this article, and I would like to apologise for some of the above comments. I know it looks quite suspicious that all these messages were sent from the same IP address but there is a valid explanation. I am a high school student and a fan of the admittedly little-known author Patrick M. McCabe. I was a relative Wikipedia novice and was pleased to create this article and see it accepted by the Wikipedia community. When it was nominated for deletion, for reasons which I am still unsure of, I was upset and asked various school friends to help save my article from deletion by sending messages of support. I did not realise that apparently every computer in our extensive school network shares the same IP address. Also, as can be seen, some of my friends did not take my request seriously. Some insulted me; some insulted McCabe and others insulted other Wikipedia users. My apologies to any offended Wikipedia users. However, some friends did take this seriously and their points are legitimate ones, not to be dismissed simply because they came from the same IP address. I hope this dispels some of the suspicion my article has aroused. I assure you that Patrick M. McCabe is a real – albeit little-known – short story author. I would dispute the claim that he is too obscure to warrant an article, after all, even ‘Big Brother’ contestants seem to be worthy of Wikipedia articles. The article and related articles contain no lies or deception other than the natural bias that may have surfaced due to my being an admirer of McCabe.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.84.67.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.84.67.187_882a.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.84.67.187">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>(I'm getting a bit off topic here, but it's something I'm interested in) How would wikipedia function properly if WP:V didn't work like this? If people had to prove that something was not verifiable in order to remove it, it seems to me this would be a disaster. I could write an article about Purple Candy Striped Unicorns from the planet Neptune, and claim my source was Ye Olde Booke of Little Known Animals, out of print since 1762, my copy of which was sadly destroyed years ago in a fire. And then say, "Try to PROVE the book and the unicorns don't exist!", which of course no one can do, as proving things don't exist tends to be impossible. While my example is silly, people believe in vast numbers of unproven and unprovable things, which we are fortunately able to keep out of wikipedia due to the current state of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It would work better than you think it would.

<li>The article you cite is simply a discussion of whether manatee meat is red meat or white meat. There is no legitimate reference to eating or hunting manatees.

<li>And where, pray tell, does it say anything about eating them? It doesn't. You are correct in spotting my poor phrasing, where "eating or hunting" should have been "hunting and eating."

<li>The question should be "why keep" (respectively "why create" in the first place), not "why delete". I merged the details on sources into <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManatee_4f89.html#Eating_Manatees" title="Talk:Manatee">Talk:Manatee#Eating Manatees</a>, as a central place for not directly deletion-related discussion, and left a pointer at the top of this page. If you want to convince other editors, start there. Those sources <i>aren't cited</i> on this page (beyond the basic fact that "manatees are made of meat and sometimes people eat them"). Instead, your 'taste' section <i>still</i> copies wholesale from Monkeyspit.com. There are <i>two</i> links to eatmanatee.com. Unless you consider a PO address selling books and t-shirts a reliable source, the details in that section are dubious too. Remains the reproduction of an unencyclopedic hunting travelogue.

<p>I have never been assosciated to any of the websites I used as sources, ever. First, why would I promote their website? I am in 10th grade in Canada, not a college idiot with nothing to do. You may think, "If Mubote isn't affiliated with the websites in any way, why does he care so much?" It's becuase I have pride. Personally, I'm proud of starting the article. You may think otherwise.</p>
<p>Secondly, what would be my initiative? I don't think I'm a moron. I just ran across something interesting, and put it on wiki. Of course, wiki isn't only for "Interesting Things," you need sources. Which I have. There is no evidence that it is a hoax. True, it has been deleted twice, the second time by accident by Yamla. I recreated it after Undelete said I could. Yamla didn't know, and he let me remake. Manatee meat is just as much a hoax as beef and mutton are. Just becuase most people don't eat it, doesn't mean it isn't good enough for wikipedia.</p>
<p>Finally, if wikipedia truly does not censor, then why is this being deleted? I'm sure there are many joke articles on many other meats. Wikipedia has many arcane articles, and manatee meat is one of them. Manatee meat has sources, I'm fixing copy vio, I'm borrowing the books I have listed from the library, and I'm putting it on wikipedia. So please, consider my statements, and vote <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../m/u/b/User%7EMUBOTE_83d7.html" title="User:MUBOTE">Adam Wang</a> 00:42, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Adam, you have now voted twice here, which is in keeping with your continuing disregard of the rules and practices of the Wiki. You have also failed to identify yourself as the author of this article. Voting twice is <b>cheating.</b>
<p>You have added completely unacceptable sites as "support" for an entry that boggles the mind with its irrelevance. While you have removed the most bizarre and ridiculous of your subsections, the two remaining both fail as Wiki material. One is quoted in its entirety from a single unsupported web source which is a memoir column written for a tourist site, and the other is based on a joke website that exists only to sell t-shirts and "cookbooks." Your inclusion as an external link of a page on rexcurry.net, which appears to be a repository of undocumented paranoid ravings, is another instance of your failure to read and identify your sources. Your "educational site" is an email quoting a wire-service article about a single instance of <i>illegal</i> manatee meat sale - poaching, not cuisine. The "brochure" on the manatee is a management report which simply reports occasional poaching. The Thinkquest.org citation was written by elementary school students, complete with pictures drawn in crayon.</p>
<p>It appears that you do not understand the difference between a reference work, which exists for the edification and use of the greater public, and a blog or MySpace page, on which you can work out your obsessions in your own private circle. The standing article on manatees already has a sentence on the hunting and eating of manatees, which is more than sufficient for this pointless topic.</p>
<p>This entry utterly fails the first of the five pillars of the Wikipedia: "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general encyclopedias, specialized encyclopedias, and almanacs. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. It is not a collection of source documents or trivia, a dictionary, a soapbox, a newspaper, vanity publisher, an experiment in anarchy or democracy, or a web directory. It is also not the place to insert your own opinions, experiences, or arguments — all editors must follow our no original research policy and strive for accuracy." Please familiarize yourself with Wiki policy before you post any further articles.</p>
<p>You are sustaining an argument here as your own personal private joke. It is beyond trivia, pointless and irrelevant in the extreme. Your inability to distinguish between the relevance of beef in worldwide civilization and the relevance of manatee meat is rather alarming.</p>
<p>As far as your argument that "I'm sure there are many joke articles on many other meats" - any such articles will be deleted as they are found, and even if there are others it does not mean that this one should be permitted - especially since you have now freely admitted in the open that this is a joke, which <i>is not permitted here.</i> - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 01:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>First off, I did not admit that this was a joke site. I admited that he monkeyspit site that I recognized that Monkeyspit, a site I unknowlingly used, is a joke site. All information from that website has been removed. Secondly, I did not mean to vote twice. I was just trying to sway other people to vote twice. Thirdly, this article is not random trivia, a dictionary, a soapboax etc. etc. It is encyclopedic fact. Eating manatees is "irrelevant" as "beef" is to cows! I can distinguish the difference between beef and manatee meat. Please don't insult me. Manatee meat is part of a culture, just as beef and other meats are. I have not freely admitted anything whatsoever. I have sources in books. I realize now that yes, my topic is too short for its own article, but no, I don't think that "manatee meat" should be removed completely. I agree with Yamla's idea below to double the existing article in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">Manatee</a>, which I added, and keep like that. When I reffered to Manatee Meat as arcane, I meant that it isn't as hot an article as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> is. I wrote most of The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Norway_16ea.html" title="Conservative Party of Norway">Conservative Party of Norway</a>. It isn't exactly the most popular article, yet it isn't irrelevant. I would be satisfied by a merge. I do not write joke articles. I am not a vandal. I am not an immature high schooler.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Although I seem to be in the minority, I'm <i>not</i> convinced that this is a joke article. So (for this paragraph, anyway), let's assume this is a legitimate topic. I just don't see enough content to warrant an entire article. The article on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">manatees</a> has a single paragraph noting that they used to be hunted and that the commercial meat farming has been suggested as a way of preserving the species. This seems to be a relatively recent addition (wasn't there at the beginning of June, for example), so I suspect this article has already contributed to enhancing the main article. I'd like to see us look at the rest of the content and perhaps add some of it to the main article. I'm not talking a huge section, mind you, but we could at least double that section in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">Manatee</a>, I'd think. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 04:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - in response to Mais oui - when was the last time a Lib Dem candidate lost their desposit (and finished in 6th place!) in a Scottish election? I'd say its a fairly unique occurence. Anyway, I wasn't saying that was the only claim to notability, just a small part of it. May I just a comparison to, for example <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Constance_e1dd.html" title="Angela Constance">Angela Constance</a>, a shorter serving councillor and parliamentary candidate <i>once</i>. I note Angus McLellan voted keep on that, largely on the basis of mentions in the Scotsman etc - I note MacLaren has 4 times as many unique hits.

<li>Hi all. I created this article way back when, and occasionally wondered if it would ever get AFDed on a "no wins, no notability" basis... Vclaw, thanks for letting me know it was listed. MacLaren's notability is not great, but it's a cumulative thing. She's contested five national elections (albeit two of them on a list); one of these was remarkably bad (Hamilton South - I don't know of a worse LibDem record) and one remarkably close (Edinburgh South 2005). She's held Party office, and she's been on the council of a major city for twenty years. None of them necessarily things which give notability in and of themselves, but I'd argue that when applied to the same individual they're reasonably notable. (I wouldn't have created the article if I didn't think she was!). Incidentally, if councillors in the main aren't notable, it might be an idea to clean up the redlinks at <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Edinburgh_5d5e.html" title="City of Edinburgh">City of Edinburgh</a> and the like. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 08:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Making a page about a certain country's/people's contribution to humanity (arts/sciences/history) is one thing. That's acceptable and is precedented. However, now we're pushing the boundaries. The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_picture.html" title="Motion picture">motion picture</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">Calculus</a> are now asserted as "Scottish inventions." Sure, a Scottish innovator probably was very revolutionary in the creation of motion picture, but because of that motion picture is a <i>SCOTTISH invention</i>? Give me a break. The dozens of other countrymen to contribute wouldn't be pleased. If anything, a lot of reliable information on this page should be kept and moved to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Scotland_a221.html" title="Culture of Scotland">Culture of Scotland</a> (and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_England_eaa4.html" title="Culture of England">Culture of England</a>) under a Discoveries/Innovations section (much like in <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom_4b58.html" title="Culture of the United Kingdom">Culture of the United Kingdom</a>). But purporting some pretty outrageous claims and somehow attributing an invention to a single nation.. especially when many other men contributed to its creation... is inching upon nationalistic or ethnic pride. Furthermore, we can't say that just because "discoveries" are often miscategorized as "inventions" we should list them as such (note the material on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_inventions.html" title="English inventions">English inventions</a>). Something should also be done about the categories <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_inventions_d8a8.html" title="Category:English inventions">Category:English inventions</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_inventions_b74f.html" title="Category:Scottish inventions">Category:Scottish inventions</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the proposers' arguments sound more like reasons to rename and re-focus the articles, rather than to delete them. This is a very well covered area: there are absolutely tons of websites and books listing Scottish inventors and inventions. All of the entries ought to be referenced, and I am sure they could be, but it does take a lot of time. I know less about how well English inventors/inventions are dealt with in good sources, but I would be extremely surprised if there was not a wealth of source material. Of course if a claim is false it ought to be qqualified/explained; or removed altogether; but if the false claim is well-sourced then that in itself is a notable phenomenon. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 17:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What's wrong with that....what I mentioned above. A category of Scottish inventors or a section in Scottish culture mentioning some innovators in Scotland is a different story from what this article is doing. We can easily say "one of the inventors of TV technology was Scottish." but this would be completely different from saying or implying "Television is a Scottish invention." Furthermore, we can't pin discoveries as the same as inventions. "Noble gases" is an invention? <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 18:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In addition, a great deal of the current entries are patent (if you'll pardon the pun) nonsense. A scot "invented" cornflour, which had been created and used several thousand years before the scots even had <b>corn</b> (Did they "invent" rice, too)? They "invented" popular use of a decmial separator, traced back to arabic culture and in use since 850?

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - horribly broad, both in what counts as 'Scottish' and what counts as an 'invention'. Includes foodstuffs, 'popularising' something, the work of various engineers, discoveries, 'pioneering work', etc. It's pure jingo, in other words. There's a good article or series of articles to be written about this subject. This isn't it.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 18:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in fact substantial additions could be made - as well as a few deletions I think I agree with Nydas above, except that I would work with this article. One further point I would like to make is there is a current trend to deny innovation on largely picky grounds - TV is a good example Baird did in fact invent an early TV system which was produced and was used, fair enough it was a development of other work - which this does reduce the significance of his achievement. However by that arguement no-one invented anything.--Eek10bears 19:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the expansive criteria used to decide whether an invention is 'Scottish' (by a Scot or by non-Scots in Scotland) mean that Baird's television is also an English invention, as are Lister's antiseptics. Either have a list of Scottish inventors or a list of things invented <i>in</i> Scotland - having both in the same article is a recipe for mayhem.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 07:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> as trivial, unverifiable (for many inventions) and an edit war magnet. Who invented things and what nationality (or ethnicity or religion) they should be counted as is very frequently disputed. For example, sometimes multiple people claim that they each invented something. Some inventions are so old or their history is so poorly documented, that it is unclear who invented it, yet some people claim that their ancestor or countryman invented it anyway. Also, many things are invented (especially many of the important modern inventions) as a result of multiple people's work, who may be from different countries, have different ethnicities or religions. Finally, it is unclear what nationality, ethnicity or religion someone should be counted as. For example, a person with a German mother and an Italian father may have been born in France, grew up in England and created his invention in the U.S., which he moved to at 18 years old and stayed the rest of his 90-year life. Which country or countries should he be counted under? As each group (Ukranians, Muslims from India, Chinese Americans, German-Irish, Latter Day Saints) gets its own list, the problem grows exponentially. Creating, maintaining, edit warring, dispute resolution, blockings and bannings resulting from the articles takes time and manpower away from far more important articles. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 19:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the first article, <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> the second two. A broad, highly inclusive list is a spam and self-promotion magnet. However, a List of famous people on MySpace seems somewhat useful given the enormity of Myspace as fad/cultural phenomenon (however, I think it would be important for editors to keep this list limited to very famous people).--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 18:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can definately see how, if you were looking for infomation about someone, knowing if they had a myspace thing or not would be useful. Having this list and linking to it from the individual's article would serve as a sort of "see also" guide for the general wikipedia user who is just looking stuff up to learn more about it. I really don't see any reason for it to go except that it would never be all-inclusive, but when is anything wikipedia has ever all-inclusive? <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 19:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having a MySpace is not an encyclopedic trait worthy of lists. It's close to product promotion, in fact.

<dd>Not really. What does the fact that they have had drunk Pepsi or owned an I-pod tell you about them? If, on the other hand, they have a MySpace page, then noting that fact and linking to it in their article is almost the same as linking to their non-myspace-website, or citing their auto-biography as a source in an article. It gives the general reader and researcher someplace to go for more information. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 20:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. The count was 27-25 keep, counting 2 Redirect comments and 1 Merge All comment as Deletes. With this many commentators, raw totals take on greater importance in determining consensus, in my opinion. No way am I going to close this as a Delete with that many Keep comments. On the other hand, neither numbers nor strength of argument is enough to make this a clear straight-out Keep. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Having a model as half sister and a politician for a father aren't notable points, even that article boils down to one item of "being arrested", which is not worth an article in itself. I would also dispute that it's well referenced, I do not regard "a newspaper reported that an unnamed neighbour said" as very reliable, for example, expecially as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> required "high quality references". Also, "more information is likely" is very crystal ball. Failing notability, WP:NOT, and WP:BLP concerns are all grounds for deletion based on policy.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. There is no reason to create stubs for everyone arrested as long as they haven't even been charged. There names are listed in the main article, which is more than sufficient - and in many countries it would be a violation of privacy laws to publicly name people before they have sentenced, let alone not even been accused (i.e. charged) for anything. What if it turns out that all or most of them are totally innocent? Would anyone of you who say "Keep" like to have your own name forever linked with a false arrest on one of the most read websites in the world? As many people always think that a mere arrest means that a person must have done something, this could very effectively ruin the rest of your life. So, as a compromise, let's keep the names in the main article but delete the stubs. The fact that Slimvirgin has managed to put together a tabloid type gossip article more suited for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a> about one of the arrested persons is no reason to keep it. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 14:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> the only claim to notability is being arrested/charged, which is not sufficent for individual articles, even if more "padding" is added to lengthen them. They may become notable in the future, but wikiepedia is not a crystal ball, neither is it a news outlet. Also, as is common in breaking news stories, newpapers report comments by relatively unreliable people ("A neighbour/friend/eyewitness") which are often sensationalist, and later retracted/overridden. Wikipedia should not be in the business of repeating gossip immediately without allowing a reasonable time to elasp and check whether it was unfounded or not. As an encyclopedia, we should act like one with calm, measured, and unhurried actions, and not act like a tabloid newspaper trying to get the "scoop". In short, by failing notability, WP:NOT, and having WP:BLP concerns are all be grounds for deletion based on policy.

<li><b>Delete all</b> On BBC Radio 4's World Tonight news programme yesterday evening (21 Aug 2006), a criminal lawyer expressed concerns that media coverage and speculation would make it difficult for the suspects to have a fair trial. If you think the suspects may be guilty, you'll agree that a fair trial is essential for them to be convicted and sentenced; if you think they may be innocent, you'll also agree a fair trial is essential so they can be released. Strongly disagree with expanding the pages now: whether they are innocent or guilty, second-hand speculation based on flimsy media reports ("neighbours said he looked a bit shifty") doesn't help the suspects or the aim of justice. At the moment, the pages are too minimal to be of any use... and anyone who wants the suspects' names can get them elsewhere. It would be more appropriate to list them if they are actually convicted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusswann_0ff9.html" title="User:Marcusswann">Marcusswann</a> 13:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't want to merge it; I want to delete an uneccessary POV fork. I've just taken out the useful bits. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 23:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I refer you to the first four words of your nomination. You clearly <i>do</i> want to merge it. So do the merger properly, and complete it in the way that mergers are to be completed. That is <i>not</i> by nominating the article for deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think "I don't want to merge it", was rather clear about whether I do or don't want to merge the article, but I will change it. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 00:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that you have already <i>done</i> the first part of the merger, per the diff that you yourself gave above, indicates that you do. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>To clarify, I DO NOT WANT A MERGER. I want to delete a POV fork that is unnecessary because the section in the original article is not large enough to warrent. A merge would result in an equally unnecessary redirect, and there isn't much to merge anyway. So the articled should therefore, IMO, be <i>deleted</i> and not merged, and so this discussion is very much valid and Uncle G shouldn't have tried to close it because he has misinterpreted my intentions. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 00:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've already pointed you to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">Wikipedia:Merge</a> once. <i>Please read it.</i> If you wanted this article deleted, you should not have begun merging its content into another article.

<li>And I've read it! And I've said <i>twice</i>, I don't want to merge it! Tell me, what should I have done when I saw a POV article, sat around and waited for a dozen merge and redirects, when I want the thing deleted? Instead, I have an admin who insists I've started down the road to merging, WHEN I DON'T WANT TO MERGE IT. Merging means a redirect, which is pointless in this case and the entire thing should be deleted, obliterated entirely. The reason there is no overwhelming consensus is because, Mr G, you have insisted I am halfway through a process I am not. How can there be any kind of decent consensus when you have shut down the AFD? The only voter before you came demanding I want a merge when I don't supported my plea to delete - that is hardly no consensus to me. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 01:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dev, your edits are very good, but I think G is right - merger is the right policy. You found "two or more edits that are a large overlap." I don't see the Shia view of Islam page as a POV fork - the editors aren't protecting themselves from the alternate POV by creating the page, they just have more pages than they need. As I said, I think your pages are great, but I would go ahead with the merge. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 02:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I went to ANI for a second opinion, and they said that because I didn't write the information I added to the article in my own words, despite it being free content to the world, deleting the page it originated from is effectively stealing the content and claiming it as my own. Having now been told this (and it would been nice if Uncle G had explained it himself), I realise I have no choice but to create a redirect, despite my misgivings, whatever my original intent was. I will do so now, and will refrain from making the same mistake with my next AfD.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think something needs to mentioned here. Even if an article in a major newspaper is just a repeat of a Reuters article says something... it should count for something. Why? Because it means a major newspaper decided to use it, meaning the editors of a major paper thought it was somewhat important. I can understand not wanting to count small-town news paper repeats, but if the ohter major outlets carry it, then it is something more. Dave 16:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>with half a million hits on youtube, he is notable and many people like me, might hear about him from the news and would want to know about him in more detail and quickly from wikipedia. Since I found many interesting information on "Salam Pax" in wikipedia, I've felt that the main advantage to wikipedia is that it is up to date and doesn't only cover TV celebrities. And since one criteria for notable personalities contains "large fan base" for TV personalities, I don't understand how TV personalities would be more important than You tube personalities. And finally even if he does die away, his importance will always be in his age.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Within a week, he has become the most subscribed-to video uploader on youtube, as the article says. My suggestion is simply to keep the article up for now. He has had millions of views, and some of those people may be looking for some background information about how an unknown retired person became the number one youtube contributor. theAnarch 1:18am 19 August 2006</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> A definate keep, G1927 is now a 'household name' in online circles. He's been reported globally, and his has been an impact - that may prove critical to the future successes of YouTube. Something, which could well have a lasting impact. This article, is relevant indeed.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I don't understand Brian's insistence of verifiable and more media mention of geriatric1927 considering Emmalina was a Keep with less media coverage, fewer viewers and did nothing notable. This man is the most subscribed to user on YouTube, has had International media coverage and most important - he's captured a worldwide audience that spans four generations, that alone is quite notable and an amazing accomplishment. He won't soon be forgotten. If he is, then take the page down then, like Emmalina's should be considering she's no longer on YouTube and never accomplished anything noteworthy.

<li><b>Keep</b> Once again Capitalistroadster is turning to the media to base his decision. One reference in the Australian media DOES NOT CONLCUDE Matthew Okine is not of notoriety.

<li><b>Comment on database</b>. Using the Factiva database, "Matthew Okine" gets 9 hits - one on an irrelevant soccer play, the rest mainly very brief mentions of this comedian, mainly in minor Queensland papers (and a minor mention in the <i>The Toronto Star</i>, and a short article on him in the <i>South West News</i>, no idea what sort of paper that is). "Matt Okine" gets 19 hits, mainly with brief mentions/gig guides in minor newspapers. He does get quoted in <i>The Courier-Mail</i> one time (5 July 2006), and there is also a once sentence mention in <i>The Courier-Mail</i>. I don't have any conclusions about this.

<li><b>Delete</b> He's appeared in 4 films. Let's see: his role in house of wax is so minor that it is not listed on the IMDb, his one speaking role in Aquamarine is the 15th listed on the credits on IMDb for a D-class movie. His first main role is in a small production whose main article was recently deleted on Wikipedia. I'm not sure why it is so wrong to use media searches to help determine whether or not someone is notable. People arguing for keep seemingly ignore the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. Even if you feel that this guideline errs by being overly strict you have to agree that this guy falls way, waaaaaaaay below the criteria. Also it is important to point out that the claims in the article about the notoriety of the comedy competitions are a bit dubious. Let's also point out that the creator of the article is probably Michael Skelton who directed the movie Sweet FA (the only "important" role of Matthew Okine). The sole contributions of User:Mickskel were to articles related to this film and the corresponding production company.

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. Actually, there were no delete votes. Basically, there wasn't a quorum. But the four editors who did respond all wanted the keep the informationm, the only question was whether thru Keep or Merge. So I chose the least destructive, Keep. But since there was no quorum, I called it a No Consensus. I could have relisted the article, but I didn't think this was necessary as no one (except the nominator) wanted to delete the information. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Enigma was highly invovled in the LARPY awards, well honored, and instrumental in some of the growth of Theater Style gaming in the California Area, having spawned multiple forms of Live Gaming, a semi-popular subject. The article should (and will) have this information added, but is absolutely interesting for LARP fans outside of the scope of UCLA. rizwank</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The way this article is now, it still isn't very encyclopedic.

One might look at the Black Cop article and say 'yeah, I've seen black cops on TV, it must be a real phenomenon' and you might be right. There might be something real there. But if there is it hasn't been shown from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in the article, so it's still <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 01:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> First, it should be noted that <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStukov_cb80.html" title="User:Stukov">User:Stukov</a> is the creator of this article so his vote should not count. Now, I'll just repeat my reasoning from the first AfD: Does <b>everytime</b> a black actor play a cop automatically make them a character type? Or does the "black cop" have to exhibit certain traits? I could maybe see gruff black lieutenants or captains being considered a "type" (<a href="../../../4/8/_/48_Hrs._8ab1.html" title="48 Hrs.">48 Hrs.</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starsky_and_Hutch_c4a1.html" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/f/Homicide%7E_Life_on_the_Street_4b34.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>) but even that's reaching a little bit. But just any cop who's black regardless of personality or rank is automatically a stereotype? Any black person with a badge is a stereotype? Come on. I could make the page "Black Doctor" and list just as many examples of black actors that played doctors. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 07:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Speaking of guidelines, <i>Please disclose whether you are an article's primary author or if you otherwise have a vested interest in the article</i> is part of the guidelines regarding AfD. OK? I did skip the first part of my comments in the first nom which was: "Original research, lack of reliable sources and most of all ill-defined". The Ethcial Spectacle, though well-written, is a person's vanity page. The Narc review is from a blog and the "black cop" is mentioned very briefly in one sentence. The link provded above is an article about the "sassy black woman" stereotype and is also from a person's vanity site. The "black cop" stereotype is only mentioned in posts by readers responding to the person's comments on it. From this it is apparent that some people, myself included, feel that the black police captain is a type.

<li>Has it been a month already? Well, at least this time we're having an actual vote. As always, <b>keep</b>. To answer the specific issues, this is not copyrightable information - a magazine cannot copyright the results of a poll even if it conducted the poll. This list is no more copyrightable than a list of Academy Award winners. The list is not compiled by editorial opinion, it's a poll of the readers' votes. This information is encyclopediac - if you think otherwise, give me an definition of what you think "unencyclopedic" means and I'll show you a hundred other articles that meet it. And if your sexual issues are so extreme that you consider a list of women's names offensive, I recommend you see a therapist. Sorry if my response seems flippant, but all of these issues have already been repeatedly raised and discussed. Based on history, the next stage will be somebody's decision that these articles are so wrong that they need to be speedily deleted by unilateral fiat. <a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 03:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> easy now. It is unencyclopedic as it essentially a copy of a primary source and and encyclopedia is by definition not a primary source. You can change it into a secondary or tertiary source by adding additional information on the persons in the list. However, the subject of each of the lists makes it impossible to add such information, as it was not published in FHM or a definite copyright violation. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It can also be changed by including discussion of the lists in the articles. In the previous AFD discussion, several sources for such discussion were given. Your argument appears to be that this is encyclopaedic if there is scope to expand it beyond the simple list data. Per the citations in the previous AFD discussion, that appears to be the case. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. However, looking at the provided citations, I'm not seeing those go beyond: "This is the new top ten" and "these people aren't" in the list anymore. The first is void, as it is covered by the lists themselves. The second can only applies to very few of the people in the list, which would make for very flimsy, never beyond quite stubby, articles, which makes it sound much more attractive to add that info to the articles of the respective people. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 02:54, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thinking about this a bit more: what about ditching these articles in favour of one article for each of the editions of FHM presenting such a list? Filling these articles with a sourced discussion of the lists, criticism, changes, etc? -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 03:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all Articles</b> of these lists as long as they remain simple lists.

<li>Scope for expanding these lists, such as the reaction to Britney Spears disappearing from the list, was given in the prior AFD discussion. From what you write, you want the articles to be expanded beyond mere lists. So expand them! Deletion is not the way to do that. AFD is not cleanup. Nor is it <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a>.

<li>Personally, I say these articles are a good example of why the FHM lists should remain as they are. Wikipedia is supposed to be a useful reference site. So if somebody is looking for information about the FHM sexiest women polls, what are they going to be looking for? The list of names and the rank they were in. Wikipedia has that information and the reader will get the information he or she wants. Now suppose somebody is looking for information about the Rolling Stones list of greatest songs. Does anybody think they want to read a commentary about the list? Of course not. They're going to see the wikipedia article on this subject is useless and go look somewhere else for real information. We have to remember that this site was not built for those of us who are contributors; it was built for users and our job is to provide information people will be looking for in an accessible manner.<a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 02:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>We <i>are</i> a useful reference site; that doesn't mean we're supposed to a) copy the Internet/sum of all human knowledge, or b) infringe on anyone else's copyright. Even if we do/did get permission to replicate FHM's lists, they just become vandal magnets for people wanting to switch the list, and without images or annotation, there's no value added over having the list linked. I'm all for mentioning notable placements on these lists <b>in the articles for these women</b>, as it's easier to keep an eye on there. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 15:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's annoying is that several people are claiming they're voting to delete because this is a copyright violation. So let me repeat - this is not a copyright violation, you cannot copyright a compilation of facts. This is a list of women's names ranked in the numerical order that they received votes in a survey - it is a factual list and cannot be copyrighted by FHM or any other entity. It would be like the Motion Picture Academy claiming that they had a copyright on the fact that <i>Crash</i> won the Best Picture Award in 2005 - once they release that information it's public knowledge. FHM can copyright the text they wrote with their published articles and can copyright the choice of pictures they used as these are editorial content that was added to the factual listing. But none of this editorial content was included in the Wikipedia articles. (I will concede that the 1995 list was created by editorial decision and not as a result of a survey; therefore it may be copyrighted.)<a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 06:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Remember: this is not so much a vote as a discussion.

<li>I have no problem with the principle of consensus decision - I just feel that it should be bound with the limits of the facts. If people were voting to eliminate the article on Millard Fillmore because he was a relatively unimportant President, I'd argue against that decision but I would accept it if that was the way the consensus went. But if people were saying they were voting to eliminate Fillmore's article because he was a fictional character, I don't care what the consensus is, those people are simply wrong. If you start ignoring the facts and treating your opinions as if they were reality, you'll just end up invading Iraq. <a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 16:09, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Each of these articles about characters from a television movie is written almost completely from an in-universe perspective with no citations. Each has one or more sections devoted to trivia, "facts", speculation, and extraordinarily banal quotes. Attempts to remove such sections are reverted by the articles' author. One of the articles is a duplicate. These articles should all be deleted and merged into the main article, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_10th_Kingdom_bd83.html" title="The 10th Kingdom">The 10th Kingdom</a>, which could use some work itself. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 22:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Neutral</s></b>. These aren't high-quality articles, but I know for a fact that 10th Kingdom has a fanbase. I'm not sure how big it is, though.

Though AFD is unnecessary if the goal is just to merge the articles, I support keeping the AFD live to develop consensus on 10th Kingdom's notability and the suitability of keeping the individual articles, because a consensus to delete could very well emerge. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">szyslak</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a>)</small> 00:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete all</b></s> <b>Shorten, merge and redirect</b>. I loved "The 10th Kingdom". I actually applauded at the end of the final installment. The performances were superb. But Wikipedia has no articles on Natasha Rostova, Andrey Bolkonsky and Pierre Bezukhov. No way should there be individual articles on the characters from "The 10th Kingdom".

<ul>
<li>I'm not familiar with War and Peace, but if those are main characters then they certainly could have articles here.

More applicable to the 10th Kingdom, many contemporary characters have articles too. I don't see why certain characters not having articles (yet, at least) means that other characters shouldn't, either. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 19:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Calling it a "TV movie" is a bit of a stretch, as it's like 12 hours long or something (I have the DVD and it takes up 3 discs). It's at least a miniseries or a "limited series".

<li><b>Stubify and merge, and redirect</b> per Vary.
