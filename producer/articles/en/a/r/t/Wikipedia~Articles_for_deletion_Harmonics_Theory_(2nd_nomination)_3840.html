<p>A previous version of this article and 6 related articles were nominated for deletion on 18 May 2005. (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_9b87.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory</a>). After much reflection, I concluded that the community concensus was to delete the current versions. During the discussion period, two sandbox versions were created. In the previous vote 4 people explicitly endorsed the first sandbox version, however, many of the objections raised about the original article could be said to apply equally to the sandbox version. Concensus on whether Wikipedia should have <i>any</i> article on this topic remained unclear. This is a procedural nomination specifically on the sandbox version(s). I abstain. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:41, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I recall the sandbox version being vastly superior to the article presented. The theory, no matter how left-field, is worthy of an article due to how well-known it is in certain fields. For those reasons, I think that it should be <b>kept</b>, though I acknowledge it may still need considerable work. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:39, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Delete. No original research.</b> If it's well-known in "certain fields", why can't I find <b>any</b> references to it besides those written by Mr. Tomes himself? Where's the peer-review? Where are the verifiable sources on the subject <b>not</b> connected with Mr. Tomes (which includes negative reviews of the theory that are instigated by Mr. Tomes)? Actually, let me correct myself: there <i>is</i> a "harmonics theory" concerned with the effect of nonlinearities in electrical power systems - see <a href="http://engr.calvin.edu/PRibeiro_WEBPAGE/IEEE/ieee_cd/chapters/CHAP_2/c2toc/c2_frame.htm" class="external text" title="http://engr.calvin.edu/PRibeiro_WEBPAGE/IEEE/ieee_cd/chapters/CHAP_2/c2toc/c2_frame.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.jessler-gsell.de/DE/0_harmtheor.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jessler-gsell.de/DE/0_harmtheor.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This has <b>nothing</b> to do with Mr. Tomes' <s>crackpottery</s> theory or this article. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 03:06, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable crackpottery of the kind that appears to be particularly seductive to those not well versed in the physical sciences. The sandbox article is better, but as always, we delete because of problems with the subject, not the article. This subject can't be rehabilitated into an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:30, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How so? There is no requirement that the model described by the article be correct for it to remain in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/_/r/N_ray.html" title="N ray">N ray</a> is perhaps the archetypical example of a model that is incorrect but noteworthy enough to show up in most science texts. The idea behind Wikipedia or any other encyclopedia is that someone wondering about a given topic (be it <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop-tarts.html" title="Pop-tarts">pop-tarts</a> or harmonics theory) can get a concise description of what it is. In this case, any NPOV article will be along the lines of "harmonics theory is a model that claims <i>X</i>, and that is not accepted by mainstream science". The only question is whether harmonics theory is notable enough for people to look for it in the first place.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:21, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you say, <a href="../../../n/_/r/N_ray.html" title="N ray">N ray</a> is notable enough to show up in most science texts. What science texts is <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonics_Theory_c757.html" title="Harmonics Theory">Harmonics Theory</a> notable enough to show up in? You are seriously proposing that Wikipedia be the first encyclopedia and in fact the first respected reference of any kind to write up this crankery? That's the very definition of original research. If the physics community has no interest in exploring or debunking Harmonics Theory, it is the height of arrogance for WP to decide that it has notability that the experts themselves do not grant. I assume you're familiar with <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Fermi_bd69.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>'s famous put down, "It's not even wrong". I think that applies well to Harmonics Theory. (Oops, I see that linas beat me to it. It was Fermi, not Erdos.) For crank theories like this, being included in a serious wikipedia article is like winning the lottery. Some crank science is notable enough that it should be included in WP because of notoriety or widespread public discussion (for example, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>), but WP should not provide a soapbox for non-notable crankery to try to gain legitimacy. I have no ill will toward you, and I realize that you had to work hard to try to create an encyclopedic article out of the idiocy that was the original text. Unfortunately I just don't think it belongs in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:21, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Abstain</b> again.</s> Mostly, this boils down to difficulty demonstrating either that HT is or isn't notable.
<ul>
<li>Arguments for deletion:
<ol>
<li>Notability status is controversial (per previous VfD discussion). Certainly it isn't referenced much outside the discussions of cycles enthusiasts.</li>
<li>As the /Sandbox version wasn't acceptable to at least one person with strong feelings on the issue, it seems likely that contested edits by both sides will occur in the future, making the viability of the article questionable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arguments against deletion:
<ol>
<li>The /Sandbox version I created is, to the best of my ability to create, something encyclopedic and NPOV, that doesn't itself contain original research.</li>
<li>If harmonics theory is deemed notable, or at least is hard to demonstrate to be non-notable, then the article has merit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I'm puzzled at statements that the /Sandbox version is original research, as it provides a second-hand reporting of the views held by Mr. Tomes and the followers he controversially cites, as opposed to containing the vast amount of original discussion of the model that the original version had.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see multiple problems: 1) There does not seem to be a community of scholars pursuing this topic. That makes it "original research". 2) its dressed in pseudo-scientific clothing, while asking to be taken seriously. This means its intellectually dishonest and intentionally misleading. 3) It makes wild-eyed unfounded assertions. If the first sentence of the article said something like "Harmonics theory is a wacky but popular bit of pseudoscientific culture jamming...", then there might be grounds for accepting as an article. But it doesn't appear to be popular, and it sure ain't <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_jamming.html" title="Culture jamming">culture jamming</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 22:39, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I could understand these objections if made to the original harmonics theory article, but I frankly fail to see how you derive these statements from the current version (formerly Harmonics Theory/Sandbox). To address your specific statements:
<ol>
<li>The original version of harmonics theory was indeed <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The version at Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 still is, as it contains a lengthy presentation that duplicates much of the information in Mr. Tomes's web documents. I fail to see how the current harmonics theory page is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> - it presents a concise summary of the claims and mechanism without going into any form of derivations or detail. To call it a republishing of Mr. Tomes' work is an exaggeration of extreme proportions.</li>
<li>The current harmonics theory article (formerly Harmonics Theory/Sandbox) makes no claim that harmonics theory be taken seriously. To the contrary, where the summarized claims of harmonics theory are listed, the discrepancy between these claims and the view held by the vast majority of scientists is clearly noted. Any sane person reading this article will correctly perceive that the tenets of harmonics theory are not accepted by most scientists. What is misleading about this?</li>
<li>I fail to see any "wild-eyed unfounded assertations" in the present version of harmonics theory. As far as I can tell, you're still looking at the old version (written by Mr. Tomes).</li>

<ul>
<li>To rebut:</li>
<li>1. The article itself states that it is original research: <i>Harmonics theory has been embraced, to a small extent, by individuals and groups interested in non-mainstream, "alternative" science, but not enough for others to work on or extend it.</i> If no one else is bothering to pursue the thing, then it is original research.<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:12, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me try to explain this concept to you as simply as I can: An article containing <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a> <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> would be original work. An article noting that Klingon opera has been composed would not be. Am I making this distinction sufficiently clear? If an encyclopedia article about HT is to exist at all, it must present enough information about HT to indicate what HT is, so that readers can decide whether to bother following links to external information. I believe that the current version of harmonics theory has pared back HT-related material to the minimum possible while satisfying that constraint. Check /Sandbox2 to see the kind of article that _used_ to be there. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 00:52, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>2. The article maintains a serious tone througout, and thus is expressly intended to be taken seriously. The only disclaimer, and a weak one at that, comes in the penultimate sentance: <i>It has been almost entirely ignored by the scientific community.</i> And that's not much of a disclaimer. There's lots of serious, legit, high-quality science that gets ignored by the scientific community. Harmonics theory, by contrast, is pure bunkum, and the article should have unambigously said so.<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:12, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've told you previously, the N-ray affair is in no way comparable to HT. Its a "look at the wookie"/"don't think of an elephant"/"red herring" type argument. Its possible that the article on N-rays is poorly structured; I did not study it carefully. N-rays deserve an article because its an infamous episode in the history of physics research that most young physics students learn about. The HT article is misleading by presenting the subject matter as if it were science, when it is not. Furthermore, to present HT as if it were a blunder of the scale or magnitude as N-rays is also misleading. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:32, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And you miss my point. The whole HT topic is a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potemkin_village.html" title="Potemkin village">Potemkin village</a>. It is not a "theory", and it makes no "predictions". Taking random statements and calling them a "theory" doesn't make them an actual theory. Making other random statements and calling them "predictions" doesn't make them predictions. The falsehood in this article is that of pretending that there exists a theory when in fact one does not. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:32, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I don't see how these statements are consistent with the current version of the article. What factual errors are in the article? It states, correctly, that Mr. Tomes has <b>claimed</b> X, Y, and Z, making it clear that these claims are <b>not</b> accepted as fact by mainstream science. Mr. Tomes has indeed made these claims, repeatedly. The article does not present them as fact, and your continued claims that it does cast serious doubt on either your integrity or your statement that you'd actually read and understood the article text. Understand that these statements _are_ an attack, by _you_, on _my_ integrity as an editor, and so you are expected to be able to justify them.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 21:04, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've tweaked harmonics theory to have something closer to its original strength of phrasing re. the claims of harmonics theory not being accepted as valid mainstream science.

What's actually happened is that Mr. Tomes has claimed that HT predicts them while not showing any form of derivation from the physical properties of the systems involved, either in response to my requests or those of his Usenet critics. Thus, saying "HT predicts X" is considerably less accurate than "HT claims to predict X". Similarly, it does seem to meet the definition listed under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> (claimed by its proponents to follow the scientific method, claimed by most other people to not, very limited following), so I'm puzzled as to why this was removed if the article is to be NPOV. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:56, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>The present version is full of garbage. Saying "it is claimed" everywhere does not make something NPOV. It makes it wrong when the evidence is incontovertable, such as in the case where Christopher states that I claimed to predict a particle of mass 34.8 Mev. I *did* predict a particle of mass 34.76 Mev before the discovery of a particle. The evidence still exists in google and the link is in the page Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2. There are many other similar errors in the main article now. I would rather have that page deleted as it is rubbish for anyone who wants to seriously investigate Harmonics Theory as many do. Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 should be made the main page and people should discuss the necessary changes to make that acceptable. My vote is to <b>change to</b> Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 and make the necessary changes to satisfy people of NPOV. See also Talk:Harmonics Theory for many more criticisms of the present article. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 02:39, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>In my opinion, the changes you wish to make (Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2) will land this article right back into <b>vanity/original research</b> territory, which is what got the original article deleted. The current article (again, in my opinion) is the <i>most favorable treatment</i> you can expect on Wikipedia, and voting is still heavily against it.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> latest version (edited from Sandbox2). I have been reading a bit of physics recently dating back to 1920s (the 'Born Einstein Letters' are very interesting). Significantly there is quite a lot of references to de Broglie and Schrodinger, and the wave nature of matter (Schrodinger was very unhappy with Born's probability wave interpretation, believing that matter was a wave structure of space). My point in mentioning this is that 80 years on, Physics still faces many problems, and the wave aspects of matter have largely been ignored (Milo Wolff and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carver_Mead_f52e.html" title="Carver Mead">Carver Mead</a> are two notable exceptions). So it seems to me that it is important that these wave aspects of matter interactions are explored and their knowledge presented in Wikipedia. And one very central aspect of wave interactions is Harmonics Theory. I find the latest version of the page to be well written, in a sensible matter of fact style that suits an encyclopedia entry, so I think it is important that the page is kept.

After your wholesale replacement of the page, sandbox2 got 5 positive votes, 3 from suspiciously new and single-minded contributors (<i>i.e.</i>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#.22Meatpuppets.22" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">meatpuppets</a>), 3 new negative votes, and one previous positive vote changed to a negative vote. Please note that <i>the strong objections of the editors voting "no" on sandbox <b>were not dealt with in any way</b></i> in sandbox2; in fact, the <b>features they objected to became even more pronounced</b>. --<a href="../../../d/c/f/User%7EDcfleck_50ba.html" title="User:Dcfleck">Dcfleck</a> 12:35, 2005 Jun 10 (UTC)</li>

This is a closing statement by me aimed at those that will sit in judgement. Most of the objections to the article are not really about presentation. They are an objection to its mere presence. The most oftenly made statements are along the lines that: it is not published in peer-reviewed journals; it is "original research" meaning not published elsewhere; that it is crackpot or rubbish; that claims are made that are not supported. I suggest that the correct reason for the deletion votes is <b>I didn't learn about that at school</b>. That is unfortunate, but it is not too late to learn now&#160;:-)
<ul>
<li>The claim of unsupported assertions is difficult to deal with because when supporting material was added it (not surprisingly) increased the size of the article. When it got too big it was split, and this too was criticised and a reduction requested. How can these criticisms possibly both be met?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Peer reviewed journals. There exist no peer-reviewed journals relating to cycles. The FSC did have one which ceased publication before Harmonics Theory was ever published. Something that I am fairly sure is not understood by anyone here that has voted for deletion is that there is a very substantial body of interdisciplinary cycles research from <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R_Dewey_45eb.html" title="Edward R Dewey">Edward R Dewey</a>, Alexander Chizhevsky, Raymond Wheeler, Piccardi, Simon Shnoll and others that show that there are a lot of things happening in the universe that are not explicable by any existing theories before HT. For those that want to investigate this, I strongly recommend reading the excellent paper by Edward R Dewey available at <a href="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Dewey was a very careful researcher and took frequent advice from statisticians, physicists and others (as you will see in the article). AFAIK, there does not exist in the world today a living English speaking person that would be capable of being an adequate referee for a physics journal for this material. Therefore it ought to be accepted that it is impossible to meet this request and the question of original research examined instead.</li>

<li>This is ludicrous. There are many general scientific journals as well as physics journals that would be appropriate for this paper.

<li>Original research is defined as quote: "It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate)". This does not apply to the Harmonics Theory. It has been published elsewhere. It has been published by the Foundation for the Study of Cycles (in its time the foremost organisation concerned with cycles) in its conference proceedings. It has been published in the proceedings of a number of other conferences, including ones supported by Apeiron Journal and a Sierra Nevada University in California. I have spoken on the Harmonics Theory in conferences: FSC, Irvine, California; FSC, Princeton; Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Russia (this was a special seminar on Harmonics Theory only); Cycles conference, Stavropol, Russia; Moscow University, Moscow; Sierra Nevada University, California; FSMN Auckland, New Zealand; and others. Without exception I have received high praise from these audiences ranging from "this is the best presentation of cycles that we have ever heard", "you should be given a nobel prize" and from a group of physicists, astronomers and bio-physicists "we are convinced there is something in your theory". Many of these conference proceedings have been published. In Stavropol I was an invited keynote speaker to a conference with perhaps 500 participants. Such invitations are not issued to crackpots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Claims <i>are</i> supported. After Christopher Thomas criticised my claims re prediction of a new particle, I found that my post to google is still able to be seen from 1994, before the discovery of a particle was reported in 1995. I also showed that despite his claim that it is not a particle, the words particle are used by the original paper and later ones. In fact a search on google for "particle 33.9 Mev" finds more than a thousand references. The Harmonics Theory has considerably more succesful explanations and verified predictions than GR had until some 40 years after GR was first put forward. There are also a number of new tests with clear predictions of Harmonics Theory that have been put forward. Much of this has not been put in the article because of requests for restricting space.
<ul>
<li>The various people, including me, who question your predictions mainly object to the fact that they seem to be pulled out of thin air, as opposed to being derived by the usual manner of applying the model of a new concept to a <i>physical model of the phenomenon being studied</i>. I've tried to explain this to you several times, but you appear to not be willing to accept that this is needed for a scientific prediction. Regarding the KARMEN paper, despite multiple attempts at explanation, you don't seem to understand what the paper is actually saying. It doesn't claim that the particle interpretation it proposes is correct - merely that it <b>might</b> be correct, or might <b>not</b> be, while suggesting follow-up research to settle the question. I have several published, refereed papers under my belt - believe me when I tell you that I know how the process works. Finally, please consider the possibility that when a large number of people are concerned with the methods you've used to draw your conclusions, that their concern might actually be well-founded. If you apply a properly rigorous approach to your research, you might find that your work is more accepted. Among other things, this involves fully deriving predictions in the way that I've described to you, and when announcing (and publishing) results, starting out with the assumption that they're <b>not</b> the result of your model, and methodically examining and ruling out other explanations until only your model remains. Claiming that there are no alternate interpretations merely suggests that you haven't considered any, which is frowned upon. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 07:54, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>When I added extra pages to give the derivation of the mathematics and the redshift in greater detail this was criticised. The explanation of the redshift prediction is clearly contained in the two parts (1) Mathematical derivation of harmonics (which has been fully researched and checked by PRF Brown) and is presented in its entirety in the first diagram of the current page (the rest is just arithmetic but was deleted in the first round) and (2) The redshift recognition that the fundamental wave corresponds to a frequency halving (z=1). If you are looking for a whole lot of complicated differential equations, there aren't any. Redshifts are predicted for (1+z)^H=2 where H is a strong harmonic. That is it. I attached a graph that shows the exact spectrum but that was on a page that has been deleted. Isn't it ironic that the only person here that has actually checked the maths of this has had his vote disallowed for being new. He came on wikipedia to place the harmonics theory article and was not allowed to vote for it to be kept. This means that wikipedia policies are not working. I intend to look at this aspect of wikipedia policy after the dust settles. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 22:56, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will try to spell this out for you as clearly as I can: You <b>claim</b> that harmonics interact with each other in the way that you specify. However, you fail to <b>demonstrate</b> that they <b>do</b> act in this way. To make that demonstration <b>does</b> require the "complicated differential equations" that you seem to object so strongly to, as without <i>showing</i> that your idea of how harmonics interact springs forth from the dynamics of the system you're applying it to, you end up lacking a rather critical part of the foundation for your subsequent claims. When writing your math page, you put a lot of effort into answering a question that wasn't asked, while continuing to not address the one that was. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 23:02, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Christopher, I never claimed that "harmonics interact with each other", that is <b>your</b> claim. I told you that it is wrong and that you had not understood. Waves generate harmonics because of <i>non-linearity</i>. These harmonically related waves then do the same. There are two aspects to the theory that should be understood:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the idea that that waves generate harmonics in the manner described is taken as an axiom. This is just as Einstein did with the speed of light in all reference frames. He looked at what happens if this assumption is made. In both HT and SR the consequences of the axiom are a wealth of explanations of previous problems and verified predictions of new phenomena. This is what sets HT apart from things like the big bang which invariable fails in its predictions and needs tinkering and epicycles. There are no complicated differential equations in this part, just combinatorials. In both SR and HT the axiom is able to be understood in terms of existing theory once some mental blocks are removed. In the case of SR the mental blocks are still there in the general community as you are probably well aware.</li>
<li>Secondly, it is desirable to see how HT fits with existing physics. That is a difficult job and not claimed by me to be fully accomplished. I have listed the areas that need more attention, but that material has been deleted. In the case of GR and QM the fitting together is still not accomplished to everyone's satisfaction, so this should be no surprise. Complicated differential equations <b>are</b> likely to be required to achieve such a union of domains. I have made and can make more suggestions in this regard but it is well beyond the scope of a simple article. It simply needs noting with something like "The question of how HT might mesh with GR is an open question". But it is in general accord with GR but not the big bang. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 00:23, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Claims of Crackpottery, Pseudoscience etc. - Ignorant people state such things when they have no logical arguments. One such ignorant person made a "list of crackpots" in about 1994 with my name on it. One person complained that he was <b>not</b> on that list. He said that he too was an original thinker and deserved a mention. He was added. The list includes genuine crackpots and good researchers. This list has been perpetuated over many years. I challenged a particle physicist who had a copy on his site. He spent three months investigating the particle prediction mentioned above and his conclusion was that my prediction was justified by Harmonics Theory. He agree that I was practicing science, was not a crackpot, and saw that it was just a different branch of science than what he was familiar with. There have been several other similar cases with physicists and astronomers.</li>

<li>There is no such thing as a proven theory; all theories are unproven. However Harmonics Theory is as well established by its successful predictions which cannot be made by any other theory (Thomas point above) as GR is. It has been accepted as highly useful by a number of qualified people. An encyclopedia should contain exactly this sort of thing so that people that hear about it or are searching for related concepts can find out more.

This is almost unreadable because the anti-astrology astronomers and physicists (who actually have never done any study of astrology) put so many disclaimers on everything. It is enough to mention once at the start that astronomers and physicists believe astrology to be bunk and that they have also never studied it. That is the truth.

How can I add material that shows how I derived the prediction when I am fighting a rearguard action of having it all deleted as fast as I add it?
