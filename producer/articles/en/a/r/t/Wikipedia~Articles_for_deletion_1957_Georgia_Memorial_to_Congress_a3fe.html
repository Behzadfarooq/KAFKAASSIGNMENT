<p>non notable symbolic "memorial" to Congress asking it to declare the 14th amendment invalid; I see no sign that it received great or lasting notice, except from a small fringe element of conspiracy theorist types (other than several such websites, it gets very few Google hits.) The dispute over the legitimacy of the amendment is covered in the 14th amendment article in some detail. And, of course, the article has been the site of long-running edit wars. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I was trying to prod this article just a few days ago, but now I find it to be a rather interesting and worthwhile article on a notable subject. The article is all <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> at this point and has become much more stable in the last 24-48 hours. I believe it is notable because it is unique--it is uncommon, to say the least, for a state legislature to urge the federal government to repudiate two constitutional amendments (especially ones that had been around for nearly 100 years). This being the case, a simple Google search is not adequate to test notability. Given the context of the civil rights movement's beginnings in the 50s (including the then rather recently decided <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_9aee.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>), it is indeed remarkable that the Georgia legislature was making a (symbolic) attempt to excise the equal protection clause from the Constitution and even remove the right of African-Americans to vote. I do not believe an adequate ground for deletion based on sound policy/guidelines has been presented thus far, thus I respectfully dissent from those who have commented. If deleted, I hope it will be mentioned in relevant amendment articles per the above. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has gone from being a long, painful, monumental train wreck consisting almost entirely of fringe, unverifiable, non-neutral, <i>completely erroneous</i> original research to what it now is: a short article that at least has the possibility of development. Assuming that the 1957 Georgia resolution is real (and it appears to be so at this point), I second editor Jersyko's comment that it is "remarkable that the Georgia legislature was making a (symbolic) attempt to excise the equal protection clause from the Constitution and even remove the right of African-Americans to vote." Let's give Wikipedia editors a chance and some time to develop this into something better. Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 15:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article, hitherto dominated by conspiracy theorists and fringe forum posters, can become something quite valuable. It is truly rare for a U.S. state legislature to attempt to repudiate two constitutional amendments (one of which was passed to allow African-Americans to vote). This sort of measure is of much interest to historians of the period, as it is a good example of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massive_resistance.html" title="Massive resistance">massive resistance</a> to the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_a2ad.html" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">U.S. Civil Rights movement</a>. A trip to the microfilm department of a good university library will certainly turn up a plethora of newspaper articles on the measure, both critical and supportive. I'd wager that there are some good law review articles on this matter as well. So I must respectfully disagree with the delete votes on two counts: this topic is certainly notable, both by its rarity and importance as part of massive resistance. Secondly, provided we go offline in our search for sources, we shouldn't have much trouble finding them. (Looking offline, looking in older sources is something we need to do much more of anyway).--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html" title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 18:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I certainly agree that this is historical, and it is part of the history of the resistance to the civil rights movement, but the question is, was it a small part or a large one? I'm not sure anyone took this that seriously at the time, let alone now. Unless this got a lot of attention in 1957, I suspect it is too trivial for its own article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>delete</b></s>Keep--reexaming what should be the main articles, they are quite weak &amp; it might be better to build up from articles like this. --<s>Actually, merge into the larger articles, neither of which mention this resolution, though the one on the 14th does mention the controversy. It would just be a reference in larger article--the preset article has nothing much to say. see the larger article for context. <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_74cf.html#Controversy_over_ratification" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Controversy over ratification</a> <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</s><b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a very notable (far from "stupid") historical event in the form of a legislative (Georgia Code Annotated) act having passed all the required legal research guidelines before enactment by the State of Georgia, and which has not only been unrefuted for nearly 50 years but is supported by reliable press editorials in various newspapers (e.g., Chattanooga Free Press Editorial Section - March 8, 1995).Burk Hale 00:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article has been re-edited by the initial editor to further comply with Wikipedia standards and to focus on the notable points of the subject matter (considering that the actual text of the memorial is not allowed to be posted and thereby forces Wikipedia readers to seek external sources for a better understanding of the articles notable import).Burk Hale 03:04, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I reverted the edits; they were poorly sourced and remarkably <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>.
