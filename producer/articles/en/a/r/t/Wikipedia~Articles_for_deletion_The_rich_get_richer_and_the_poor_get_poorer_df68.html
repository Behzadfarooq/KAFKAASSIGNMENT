<li><b>Keep</b>, mark as needing source citations and expansions, and hope for a substantial rewrite. Borderline, but I think this is a legitimate topic because is a catchphrase that is <b>frequently alluded to</b> (making it more than just Wikiquote material). "As we get older there's nothing surer/The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is in a sixties <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Rome_ac56.html" title="Harold Rome">Harold Rome</a> song from <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Can_Get_It_for_You_Wholesale_4cee.html" title="I Can Get It for You Wholesale">I Can Get It for You Wholesale</a>. More significantly, the very famous 1921 song <i>Ain't We Got Fun</i> does a <b>takeoff</b> on the phrase, showing that the phrase itself was proverbial at the time: "In the winter, in the summer/Don't we have fun/Times are bum and getting bummer/Still we have fun/There's nothing surer/The rich get rich and the poor get... children." Oddly enough, when you Google on this, many sources attribute it to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>. I say oddly, because it is <b>perfectly</b> clear from the context<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200041.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200041.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that he is <i>quoting</i> the song... in other words, Fitzgerald's novel proves that the song was wildly popular, and the popularity of the song shows that the phrase was really proverbial. I really think there's enough here for a legitimate short article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I said it should be kept as a frequently alluded-to catchphrase, but now I'm going further. Although the present article reads as unsupported opinion, if you glance over the Google hits, I'm convinced that much of the <b>present</b> content <i>can</i> be properly supported by source citations. E.g. "So the old saying 'The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is not some kind of ironic paradox but an economic law as trim and tidy as Newton's Third Law of Motion: the rich get richer <i>when</i> the poor get poorer, and vice versa", C. Donald Loomis, <i>Radical Democracy</i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801484510&amp;id=vN-Hw3rVZh4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Rich+get+richer%22+%22poor+get+poorer%22&amp;sig=_fv9wmFZD2wMqfTZxydh1nuK5iU" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801484510&amp;id=vN-Hw3rVZh4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Rich+get+richer%22+%22poor+get+poorer%22&amp;sig=_fv9wmFZD2wMqfTZxydh1nuK5iU" rel="nofollow">p. 71</a>. It may or may not be true that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but it <i>is</i> verifiable that this is a widely-held <i>opinion</i> on the left end of the political spectrum and that this opinion is frequently expressed in these precise words. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:23, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Raymond Egan was the lyricist for <i>Ain't We Got Fun,</i> which of course says the poor get <i>children,</i> not the poor get <i>poorer.</i></s> No, I'm wrong about that.

All of them give the phrase, on its first appearance, as <i>the rich get rich and the poor get—children."

<li><b>Delete</b> However interesting and mind-blowing the topic might be, this is an essay rather than article, and I can't imagine how it could be anything else. One might write a Wikiquote entry on that, but I can hardly imagine anybody searching for that in an encyclopedia. Moreover, the article is currently linked from userpages and one talk page, not including pages related to this AfD, and I can't imagine any other legitimate Wikilinks that could logically be generated without pushing. Last but not least, this article is extremely prone to become POV-slanted and generate unending debates and conflicts, certainly not helping with the informative purposes of an encyclopedia. All, in all, I can't see how this can be developed into a proper encyclopedic entry<br />
Please note that my opinion is not based on the current contents of the article, but my thought on what it may be and might become. I have only taken a brief look at the current article and not read it thoroughly, as I believe all issues with the text that could be fixed do not merit a deletion - only when an entry cannot be improved to become a proper encyclopedic its article deletion is legitimate.

<li>If it changed my view of this article, it's only for the worse (which is why I chose not to delve into the contents before I decide). As I presumed, it is an essay, of a rather poor quality, trying to tie a few different quotes to a catchphrase referenced (imprecisely) from a song and discuss some economic and sociological issues more or less loosely related to it. It is constructed as an essay and not as an encyclopedic article, because it tries ot gather different things related to some elusive topic rather than describe all the facts pertaining to a well-defined subject. And, as I said, I can't imagine it ever developing into the latter (i.e. proper encyclopedic article), so it has no place in an encyclopedia.

<li>None of those are reasons to delete. The distinction between essays and articles, in Wikipedia terms, is our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, which is not, apparently, what you are implying at all. You are apparently merely criticising the writing style, which is a matter of cleanup, not deletion. That nothing links to an article is not a reason to delete it. Neither is the fact that an article is a magnet for editors that want Wikipedia to become a soapbox a reason to delete it. (We don't delete <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>, for example.) To argue that an article will only ever be a stub, one has to argue that it is a topic that has not already been discussed in the world at large (which <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a>'s citation of C. Donald Loomis above disproves) or that the discussion of the topic is so trivial and peripheral that it is not enough to actually fill an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think I managed to get my message accross - the topic of this article is a purported "catchphrase and proverb", but the article goes to mention some more or less irrelevant issues and develop into an essay loosely based on the title. This is NOT an encyclopedic articlein the first place. Secondly, I believe that it would not be possible to create an encyclopedic article based on that, because the connections between different instances of the use of the "catchphrase" in popular culture are weak. See <a href="../../../a/y/b/AYBABTU_f73d.html" title="AYBABTU">AYBABTU</a> for a good article on a catchphrase, which does not resemble an essay on ideology (mostly because there fortunately is no major ideology connected to that).

<li>My immediate reaction to the article, given above, was to remember "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Knows_bc9c.html" title="Everybody Knows">Everybody Knows</a>", the relevant lines of which are "Everybody knows the fight was fixed. The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.". My second reaction to this was that having an article about a topic in economic theory at this title was as bizarre an idea as having an article about <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Ali_9e91.html" title="Muhammad Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> at I am the greatest. Looking at the sources, however, it appears that Leonard Cohen was correct. <i>Everybody does "know" this.</i> And, moreover, they cite <i>this</i> as the name of the purported economic law, even if they call it a cliché when they do so. (See Dietz and Cypher.) The topic of this particular economic trend, <i>correct or not</i>, has been the subject of much published work. What swung it for me was the books and papers. Not only have Reiman and Hapgood written whole books on this subject, Hayes has a whole paper in <i>American Scientist</i> discussing the modelling of free market economic systems to determine whether this maxim is true or not. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I only understand what you mean until you mention Cohen. But if what you mean is that this is an article on an economic theory, then it should be one. And perhaps there is a much more precise name for that, one has to dig deeper into the history of economics to find one. You won't find <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economies_of_scale.html" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> under It's cheaper to produce more.

<li>It shouldn't be an article about economic theory. It should be an article <b>about a phrase</b> that is so proverbial that it will virtually always used be invoked in any discussion of economic inequality. Although not a very good article, a comparable example would be <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_sucking_sound.html" title="Giant sucking sound">Giant sucking sound</a>. The article describing NAFTA should not be entitled <i>giant sucking sound.</i> But <i>giant sucking sound</i> should not simply redirect to NAFTA or to <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> because it is now an idiom that pops up in any discussion of jobs being lost to neighboring regions. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as good documentation of notable and socially significant catchphrase. Otherwise, <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_inequality.html" title="Economic inequality">economic inequality</a>. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 14:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was won over on this one in much the same way Uncle G was (although my first thought was of Ain't We Got Fun, instead). As long as this article remains about the <i>use of the phrase</i>, I say <b>keep</b> it. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 05:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
