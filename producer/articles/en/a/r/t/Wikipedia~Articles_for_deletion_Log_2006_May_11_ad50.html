<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination.

<li>I'd say <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I hope you get this message. I am writing a book about the subject. Because it is such a 'small' family and outside of New York and Chicago, it has not got the attention that perhaps it should. I found the subject rather interesting and so I created a page about it. The problem with uncovering information on this subject is that it is not 'notorious'. I have had a great struggle finding information on this, and other 'smaller scale' crime organizations. I hope you find the subject as interesting as I do!

<li><b>Comment</b>: You would, indeed, be correct on my overstatement in the first sentence. As I have just made the page I have yet to edit it thoroughly and I thank you for pointing that out to me. I guess they are not as influential as they are interesting. I would, of course, be obliged to change the wording of the introduction. Did you read the whole page or just the first bit? I get the impression you just assumed it was a hoax without coming into it with an open mind, as you state: 'pull the other one'. If you would like to improve the page or discuss the topic then that’s great! If you only care to make comments you find ‘clever’ to insult... why I am lost for words.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I disagree with you on notability for the same reasons. Notability and context are subjective, which provide consensus. Different users have different opinions; seeing how they stack up are what decide these votes. Votes themselves are irrelevant, it's the conversation that decides the outcome. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>k</b></font><font color="maroon"><b>e</b></font></a> 05:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - How exactly does a discussion provide consensus without taking into consideration the votes? I guess that is one of the wikipedia issues that doesn't make much sense to me. We are not an experamentation in democracy but if enough people say "keep" we "keep" and if enough people say "delete" we "delete". So the votes do matter. The only difference is that people can change their votes if they are open to hearing other peoples point of view. I am open to hearing points of view on the issue of notability but as of yet have not seen a way we can enforce such a guideline or policy consistantly to all articles. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 18:08, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Like most statistics, I think the overall curve is nice and bell-shaped for most actions on Wikipedia. It's the nitty gritty examination of details that get ugly. Many votes are drive-by Keeps and Deletes, and often times the voter doesn't take the time to research. But if the nomination is good enough, I know I don't feel a need to explain myself in detail. I'm not an admin, so I cannot speak for their actions, but I would hope that closing admins read the votes instead of tallying. Um...I lost my point.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Ok guys, I see how the runescape main article explains to someone with no previous knowledge of Runescape what it is etc, and how eg the Wilderness article has a small description for the wilderness. But is an article on ITEMS necessary? Having a list of runescape items is really jumping off the fence in WP:NOT. And besides this, due to the large amounts of errors, bad consistency, etc in this article, I do not thoroughly believe many people even read it (copied from previous message on Talk:RuneScape_items) =-=- <a href="../../../r/z/_/User%7ERZ_heretic_c684.html" title="User:RZ heretic">RZ heretic</a> 00:24, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"I am a governor of a school just like this" is a non arguement. Pretty much everything that warrants an article has somebody who is associated with it, and any of those people might be a Wikipedian. On you're comment "every village has one". Well, every U.S. village also has an article on the village itself, and eventually almost all villages will (even when the population is microscopic).

<dd>"Effect on your life" is a pretty poor argument for Wikipedia inclusion.

<li>You're an admin? Well, that surprises the hell out of me. Let me explain something to you. Either Wikipedia isn't a cookbook, or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> should be amended for us masses. Even if it were, it wouldn't be obliged to include fictional recipes. Sure, I read the Hitchhiker's Guide in junior high, as did a lot of other people. That's why the Hitchhiker's Guide is notable, but every little detail from it is not. I'm trying to clean up the cocktail articles, and having this fictional bullshit around doesn't help. Pretty please, delete this crap, or I may have to take it to deletion review on the basis that recipes shouldn't be included. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li>Do not patronise me. If you had actually read the article and done the proper research, you would find that this is clearly an encyclopedic topic and that an excellent article can be written about it. However, you resorted your typical tactics of forcing your personal dislike of topics from fiction and popular culture in a misguided attempt to "cleanse" the encyclopedia of so-called "cruft". Given the fact that you seem to have little to no interest in actually contributing content to Wikipedia, and instead only wish to remove things based on your personal biases, I refuse to be spoken to in this manner.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:26, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, but I guess it begs the question, should every single little suburb have an article? Respectfully disagreeing with Kimchi.sg, I think that some suburbs (whether on a map or not) are so small that they would be best merged into the larger area they are within. Which, in this case seems to be Glenfield. As a possibility, you could even include the information in Glenfield (which I have, by the way, suggested it be moved to Glenfield, North Shore City or similar - see <a href="../../../a/u/c/Category_talk%7EAuckland_urban_districts_33f9.html" title="Category talk:Auckland urban districts">Category talk:Auckland urban districts</a>) and then use a redirect. I guess what I'm basing this on is that I lived in Auckland for twenty years and have driven around the north shore but have not heard of this suburb (which isn't to say it doesn't exist, just that it probably isn't notable). <font color="red">P</font><font color="#FF7518">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">g</font><a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><font color="blue">a</font><font color="indigo">n</font><font color="#8B00FF">t</font><font color="#8B00FF">U</font><font color="indigo">p</font><font color="blue">d</font><font color="green">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">t</font><font color="#FF7518">e</font><font color="red">r</font> 09:10, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A diligent soul started articles for pretty much every suburb on the North Shore. I did a little minor clean-up after a few of them, but I'm a bit mixed about their value. I can only surmise the location of Marlborough in relation to the suburbs its apparently between. Further, my brief interactions suggest that Hillcrest isn't much to "write home about", although I confess to only having dropped off a friend of a friend there a couple of times. On the other hand, I see these articles as almost totally harmless.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I'm an Aucklander, and the original creator of the page(the page was created by a semi-automatic process with manual review, with a batch of other Auckland suburbs, using data generated from LINZ data to compute the compass directions between suburbs, and with automatic collation with census data. Marlborough has no census data, but it is in the LINZ maps. I do not personally know much about Marlborough except that it exists, but I think if it is on the LINZ map data, it is a recognised land name, and should be kept. <a href="../../../a/1/k/User%7EA1kmm_995f.html" title="User:A1kmm">A1kmm</a> 11:03, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I honestly don't know why I'm still arguing to delete this because I don't really care one way or the other (based on your arguments), but here's another test. I did a google search of the <a href="http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz" class="external text" title="http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz" rel="nofollow">North Shore City website</a> for "Marlborough <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=site:http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz+Marlborough&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=site:http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz+Marlborough&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and came up with fifty-one results. The majority of these talk about "Marlborough Park" (/Reserve) (most of the results), "Marlborough School", "Marlborough Avenue". Not once can I find it referred to as a suburb. In comparison, a search of the site for Hillcrest (as an example given above) came back with thirty-six results <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=site:http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz+Hillcrest&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=site:http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz+Hillcrest&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, but most of these referred to Hillcrest as a suburb.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I'm close to withdrawing my nom as this obviously isn't going anywhere, and this probably isn't the place to talk about it, but I strongly disagree with the argument "all real places are notable". I'm not basing this on any relevant policy, but if you ask me that's too broad an assumption. I can hardly see how a place can be notable if someone who has lived in the city where that place is their entire life has never heard of it. Furthermore, your argument could easily be extended to: my street (which is a real place) is notable, which it clearly isn't. Just because it can be found on a map or in Linz doesn't exactly confer notability in my opinion, because there are many mini- mini- suburbs out there that are generally considered part of the larger area (Glenfield, in this case) but that are given specific mention in Surveying reports because those reports need to be specific to the most miniscule detail. I also feel that the assumption that "all real places are notable" is as ridiculous as "all real people are notable". Can someone please direct me to the appropriate WP policy page so I can continue this argument there and save you guys the steam? -- <font color="red">P</font><font color="#FF7518">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">g</font><a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><font color="blue">a</font><font color="indigo">n</font><font color="#8B00FF">t</font><font color="#8B00FF">U</font><font color="indigo">p</font><font color="blue">d</font><font color="green">a</font><font color="#FFBF00">t</font><font color="#FF7518">e</font><font color="red">r</font> 22:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a somewhat controversial issue, so here goes: two prominent OR tags on it, and, aside from that, has serious POV issues (and I have no doubt, will continue to as long as the article continues to list "gay-friendly" celebrities and organizations the way it does). Also, according to another opinion I got, which I very much agree with, the article shouldn't exist, since it implies that most people are not -- hence it is an unmaintainable list. We don't have an article on "black friendly", for example. The article originally had a transwiki tag on it, but it is not fit for transwikification in the state it's currently in. Recommend either <b>delete</b> or <b>eliminate</b> the last two sections (leaving a dicdef that can be transwikied). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 04:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, though such an article should mention a few really prominent people to illustrate the concept, it is POV to assert unequivocally that an individual is or isn't "gay friendly". The most that we could have is List of people identified as gay friendly, but that would be pointless and unmaintainable. Homophobes can still do gay-friendly PR stunts, and celebrities who haven't yet done gay-friendly PR stunts shouldn't automatically be considered "gay-unfriendly."--<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 05:22, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gay-Friendly is a real term, and refers to the policies and practices that institutions and companies implement in order to create a welcoming environment to LGBT people. It is very North American late 20th century term that largely arose due to 1) the gradual recognition of gay rights and acceptance of gay-friendly policies in the workplace and in schools 2) the recognition of a potentially lucrative gay market by businesses and communities. I can think of three big areas where “gay friendly” is typically be used:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Travel/Leisure/Places to live: There are a lot of travel guides and organizations that create Gay Friendliness indexes for vacations spots, countries and cities. Businesses and tourist centers actually do pay attention to this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Gay Friendly workplaces &amp; gay friendly companies: Basically, creating Gay friendly environments and would include policies or practices that protect gay rights. These would include policies to discrimination policy, maternity leave, health coverage, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Schools/Universities: A mix of the above two, for example, rankings of Gay Friendly universities, gay friendly student policies, etc.</dd>

<dd>I have absolutely no idea how this article has remained so mixed up over the last few years, but hope that it will change in the future.

<li><b>Keep</b> or possible <b>Merge</b>. Yes, the term "gay friendly" is certainly a real term. There is no real parallel between the concept of "black friendly" and "gay friendly." To my understanding, it is illegal on all basis (at least within the United States) to discriminate against blacks. Therefore, all institutions in this country <i>must be by law</i> "black friendly." This is not the case where gays are concerned. I believe there are many pockets of society where you can still fire a person, deny them housing, deny them child custody, adoption rights, etc., simply because they are gay. I recently read that <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> was dropped by Christian organizers of a Christian concert -- because they heard he is gay. Could you imagine the reaction had they dropped a black artist because they are black? What I'm trying to say here is that, for more than a decade, the term "gay friendly" has indeed been used within the gay community as a means of identifying businesses, organizations, and people who openly accept gays and will not discriminate against them. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 14:37, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, you would need one for each cluster (and would be HOXA, HOXB, HOXC HOXD, nine indicates the order of the gene in the cluster), as the clusters are located at different chromosomes. Regulation in hox genes works actually quite different from other genes, with number of start codons (instead of a single one) as an important aspect for which hox genes in a cluster are activated and which are not. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup></dd>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't make sense to say that <i>all</i> of the claims in the article need to have sources added, since many of them already have sources. For instance, the claim that some arm cannons in fiction are portrayed as firing bullets or shells is supported by the example of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barret_Wallace_3000.html" title="Barret Wallace">Barret Wallace</a> from <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VII_f2ee.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>.

<ul>
<li>Agreed, This would seem to just be a grandstanding abuse of the reference policy. There are no direct assertations made. If you are going to tell me we need a reference to an independent work stating that such and such had an arm cannon in it and it fired x type of ammunition, its a little bit neurotic and quite a leap. Unless you can mark a specific claim that needs citation, I see no reason to even consider this.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 03:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are a lot of weasel words like "tend to", "often", "can also" etc., simply because the article doesn't have a single reference (so it doesn't <i>really</i> say anything about arm cannons, except that they're cannons around the arm area). I can edit if you like, but that would drop the article down to dicdef level. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 03:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article references numerous works of fiction involving arm cannons. I explained to you the reference to Final Fantasy VII, for example. Instead of cutting out the parts you feel are under-referenced, why not tell us what those parts are? Which claims do you want references added for? Jimpartame 04:12, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said, <b>everything</b> needs a source. The problem here is that we're writing an article about a fictional weapon in general, however we only have wildly different specific examples to go on. All we can say for certain about "arm cannon" is that it's a cannon around the arm area. Everything else, from what they shoot to what they're made of to how they function differs depending on the particular fictional case. We would probably have to model this after the <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raygun.html" title="Raygun">raygun</a> article, which has some history and a listing of fictions it appears in, but has nothing technical. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 05:32, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll try to explain this once more: <b>The article has sources.</b> Metroid, Teen Titans, Mega Man, etc. If there is a claim made in the article that you think needs to be better supported with references, tell us what that particular claim is. Please be specific. Just saying "everything" is nonsensical, since not everything in the article is unsourced. Jimpartame 05:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Foolishness. When writing about a videogame, do you need a source to prove that it happened? No, thats what the game is there fore the same goes for a movie and the same in this case. Why don't you spend time sourcing articles that REALLY need it, such as ones that actually cite claims made without providing evidence. Lords knows there are more Citation Needed tags around than one could shake a stick at, and plenty of nonsense without these tags that need them. In any case this discussion belongs on the article talk page, as its getting rather long (or at least continue it on the project talk page.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 06:04, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's now referenced externally, as well as internally. There's a surprising amount about Metroid &amp; Mega Man physics on the web, buried among the fanfics. Incidently, the use of "some" and "most" aren't weasel words in this context. It is indeed true that "some" arm cannons shoot bullets, but "most" shoot energy beams, and "can also" interface with computers, and the references added back this up. <font style="color:#FF1111"><u><b>s</b>murray</u></font><font style="color:#CC1111"><u>inch</u></font><a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_Greene_3f62.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester/Greene"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#CC1111"><u>ster</u></font><font style="color:#CC1111"><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 08:43, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but the more notable references to it (Megaman and metroid most likely) along with the majority of other works that refer to it call it an ARM cannon or something along those lines.

<li>I don't know where else one would go for facts about a site like YTMND other than the site itself. Unlike corporate sites like Google or AOL, there is very little "legitimate" news and research on private yet popular sites like YTMND. I believe most would agree that YTMND is popular and significant enough to merit its own article, but I think many are not sure what would have to be done to make it compliant with Wiki rules. My knowledge of Wiki guidelines is admittedly not great, but I'm trying to learn as much as I can. InfinityDUCK 07:32, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The current article, in all its glory, is tragic. It is akin to a disaster zone, like MySpace.

Would anyone really take the time to groom this mess; to properly categorize, be it alphabetically or chronologically, or even link to specific YTMNDs that adhere to the alleged fad at hand? Does anyone really care for esoteric fads that have fallen into deeper obscurity?

<li>I agree... sort of. What I would like to see is a YTMND article that covers what the site is, the site's history, etc. and completely avoids going into detail about fads or particular sites.

From there it would simply require rigorous moderating to prevent further "contamination." InfinityDUCK 07:38, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Max, the owner of YTMND himself, researched the troll by IP search, confirmed that the Stukas of YTMND.com and YTMND.com/wiki were the same, and removed him from the ytmnd.com user list, deleting his YTMND sites. An email was sent to Max from Stukas, saying he was unjustly banned. Soon after, Refault posted a new section called "Admin Abuse" in response to the actions taken by Max (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=YTMND&amp;diff=52207419&amp;oldid=52205860</a>), further adding false information to the article. In an attempt to revert this vandalism, Dr. Ke continously restored me deletion, proclaiming that it was a valid section of the article, when it fact, it has been completely orchestrated by both Dr. Ke (Stukas) and Refault, in an attempt to delete this article.

<p>Hobeywood is the new name for the home. It was once called The Cedars, during Ernest's time. Ernest grew up on the very same lake, directly across the way, and spent much time. This is, as stated in the article, one of the oldest homes on the lake. It was built around the same time as Hemingway's, the families were friends. Included in the Hobeywood collection are the light fixtures from Hemingway's original boyhood home, and more importantly to the article numerous postcards featuring a young Ernest in the lake with the cottage visible in the background. In response to the first posting above, the owner doesn't claim to be a socialite, the owner claims that the socialite Andrew Hobey is a frequent visitor. This house is an important piece of american literary history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.64.180.120 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.64.180.120_b901.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.64.180.120">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Read the last AFD. It degenerates into an argument about the nominator's motives, and begins with a "this isn't my pop culture, get it off my wiki!" argument. Heck, I may have voted keep if I had seen that last AFD first. Why is a precedent set because of a bad nomination more important than the merits of the article? Are you planning to address the merits (or lack thereof) of this article?
<ul>
<li>Because the precedent means we hashed through already, and not asking people to argue over an article over and over is more important than deleting a marginal article. I addressed the merits of this article a week ago; why shouldn't that be enough.</li>
<li>As for this article, half of Wikipedia is an indiscriminate collection of trivia. This article was probably created by someone wanting people to stop adding it to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a>, which probably worked pretty well. Having this article lets a few new editors add something to an article and not get immediately reverted, and it saves the experienced editors sheperding <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a> some trouble.

<dd>While the discussion seems a bit too fargone by now, I will none the less add my two cents: For unrelated reasons, I had become aware of the name 'Marduke' as a curiously repeating name in fiction. Namely, I noted at the time that he was a summon in Seiken Densetsu 3, was somehow related to the selection of the Evangelion pilots, and simultaneously lent his name to a dual-wielding demigod and a race of singing space warlords. In the end, my experience tells me that this information is significant, as it led me to seek out information on the character to whome the name originaly belonged, is that the sort of scenario wikipedia should strive to avoid? is the accumulation of knowledge so undesirable? --KefkaTheClown 06:52, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To Kefka: however, for the article to be kept, this claim would have to be <i>in the article</i>, and with a source (as indicated in the NOR policy you have cited).

<dd>For what it's worth, my intention was to provide an example of how the page in question (and truly, any 'x in popular culture' page out there...) would be put to service, and not to imply that this would be the sole excuse to keep the article around, which seems to be the way it was interpreted. An another note, does the material not count as a source? I mean, if we're going to rely on a published work to verify that say... Marduk is referenced in Septerra Core, can't we cite the game itself as a source? Anyway, I'm too sick to argue the point, I still think that the article should stay, but uppon reflection, I don't see a reason for it not to be <b>merged</b> with the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marduk.html" title="Marduk">Marduk</a> article proper.--KefkaTheClown 01:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think using the game itself can't be used as a source.

<p>This is either a hoax or improper manipulation of Wikipedia's reputation. There is information in this article that has not been revealed anywhere else (e.g., Enzo Valenzetti is said to have proven Fermat's last theorem but burnt his work after showing it to his colleagues) in either the shows or the related websites.

Articles about ARGs are one thing: providing articles that are part of an ARG is another -- &amp; something we must keep out of Wikipedia, because in blurring the distinction between fact &amp; fiction this can only harm our encyclopedia's credibility.

<li>If either Encyclopedia Britannica or Encarta allowed an something like this in their website to promote a television show, I would lose a great deal of respect for them; I doubt am alone in this view. The same applies to Wikipedia: people would distrust us if we let Hollywood -- or any other commercial entity -- use us as a conduit to raise a buzz over their products. And I can think of half a dozen fan websites that would be excited to accept something like this from the creators of Lost, become part of the show &amp; promote the heck out of it. Take it to one of them, &amp; create goodwill with your fanbase; your submission is <b>not</b> what Wikipedia is looking for. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:16, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry, I just don't see how this is anymore "promotion" than an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>. Seriously, if you say it's fiction, it's just like those articles. Besides, before someone pointed out it had to do with LOST, there was no mention of LOST OR ABC - so someone coming across it wouldn't suddenly want to watch LOST - it's promotion for Wikipedia if anything. Besides, now that it's up at LOSTpedia, what's keeping someone from (after this is deleted), sourcing LOSTpedia and putting up the exact same text - only with the words "fictional character" in it . . . because then, it would be by the guidelines stated here. --S 11:39 11 May 2006</li>

<dd>Those articles begin along the lines of "X is a fictional character in the works of Y", &amp; refer to specific episodes, creators &amp; other verifiable sources for their statements. In the case of this article, even if it were re-written to Wikipedia standards, &amp; Lostpedia was used as a source, we still come back to the problem that we don't know where various details in this article come from: if Javier Grillo-Marxuach created these details, &amp; they are canonical to the series then he must be quoted directly -- for him to say "it's mostly accurate" is not good enough.</dd>

<dd>He should have put it on a fansite first, for a number of reasons. First, Wikipedia does not accept submissions in the fiction category; if this is not a clearly understood, then give me 5 minutes &amp; I'll start making it a formal policy. Secondly, all information on Wikipedia needs to be verifable, which means it can be found outside of Wikipedia in a book, the mass media, or an appropriate website; we don't accept primary sources or original research, so tv writers submitting fiction about their characters is again inappropriate. Third, as I said above, there are countless fans who would be thrilled to be part of the making of Lost, &amp; they would be far more eager than we to help publish this kind of information; &amp; if this became successful enough, an article would be written in Wikipedia. Lastly, as Leflyman above points out, this is part of a promotion for a television show, not an objective submission of information; Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> advertising. If you can't understand the difference between the two, then your time on Wikipedia will only become less pleasant: I'm being civil &amp; respectful; there are other Wikipedians who won't be as nice over submissions like this. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:01, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for being civil and respectful. I was merely trying to find a middle ground, but I <b>do</b> understand your points. I still stand by most of mine, but where my stance falters is the "all information on Wikipedia needs to be verifable." In the end - that's all it takes to make my arguments moot. That said, I just think that once it's deleted it will show up again and even though it will have been done by the book - there won't be much of a dif. Even so, as they say, rules are rules. --S 16:23 11 May 2006

That's not to say that, within the <i>Lost</i> mythos, they're not true. In reality, Enzo Valenzetti is a fictional character referred to by the blast door map in the Lost TV series and the book <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Twin_701b.html" title="Bad Twin">Bad Twin</a>. The "previous book" by the fictional author of Bad Twin, Gary Troup, was "The Valenzetti Equation" and is referred to as "out of print" rather than the more truthful "non-existant".

<p>I have been struggling to figure out what should be done here short of deletion. The entry itself is simply a dictionary definition, which is what this is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a>, so it should be transwikied to the wiktionary.

<li>He gained his fame through his association with Yao, but now he is a well-known face. You can't easily merge this information anyways.

Infact, Watson is the best known conspiracy theorist in the UK, some even say in Europe but I don't know. He is well known for Alex's "attack" on Parliament in London.

Since the author probably didn't see it during it's 5 day lifespan on PROD, I'm sending it here for further concensus.

<li><b>Not delete</b> I have no pecuniary interest in this, but there are far less significant social phenomena referred to in Wikipedia, and in the case of this anonymous recovery group, there are special reasons given at[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lightdarkness#On_the_deletion_of_YES_Recovery_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lightdarkness#On_the_deletion_of_YES_Recovery_article" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>] (which I hope will be read by people before voting here) to explain why certain kinds of "non-official", non-hierarchical self-help groups don't have what some editors might think are the "credentials" to exist. Consider "underground" movements in history ... just because their headquarters were not advertised nor their leaders celebrities, doesn't mean they didn't exist. I think the move to delete is too narrow in this case. Not everything real and useful in this world can be gauged by Google page ranking. YES Recovery is such a movement ... compared to, say, Alcoholics Anonymous which has a big head office and huge publishing industry. Wasn't Wikipedia itself not so long ago such an "underground movement" which could not be seen above ground according to such criteria as search engine mentions? My view of the original Wikipedia spirit, as I've always understood it, says "let it stand". It certainly isn't doing any harm or wasting bandwidth when people's lives are at stake.

<p>In defence of my creation of this article: this is a well-known paradox that is often used in introductury books on first order logic to explain issues related to material implication and excluded middle. It is often discussed in first year courses on symbolic logic. It is also used as a test case for automatic theorem provers. I will find some proper references to support it. <a href="../../../e/u/b/User%7EEubulide_af5b.html" title="User:Eubulide">Eubulide</a> 14:20, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article exhibits some fundamental and severe problems:</p>
<p>1) NPOV: While many articles that demonstrate POV issues can be successfully salvaged, the premise of the Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis (TWUH, for the sake of brevity) is itself a POV based on speculative interpretation.</p>
<p>2) Verifiability: Opinion cannot be verified. If the writers of every show mentioned in the article publicly agree that their shows were the figment of Tommy Westphall's imagination, I will support an article on the TWUH.</p>
<p>3) Triviality: Tommy Westphall is a minor character, not particularly worthy of a dedicated Wikipedia article. Tommy existed more or less as a foil for Donald Westphall, and although a recurring character, appeared in very few of the show's episodes. The bottom line here is that not every character appearing on every show merits an entry in Wikipedia. Any factual information can be merged with the main show article.</p>
<p>4) Fallacy: As pointed out on the discussion page, POV issues aside, the premise that the "universe" of any show that can be linked to <i>St. Elsewhere</i> is also the figment of an autistic boy's imagination is demonstrably false. Wikipedia is a work of non-fiction, so article should not depend upon a suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>5) Original research: Another user has suggested that the contents of the article are based on a chapter from an existing book, although the original author never made any citations. I don't have access to that book, so I can't say rightly whether the article does or does not contain original research, but I invite more knowledgeable users to disucss the issue of original research here.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I will admit that the article has problems, i.e., it is not well written and needs to be seriously edited and rewritten, but I believe that the concept has merit. It needs to be rewritten to deal with the POV issue. But, no, one cannot verify opinion. What one can verify is that the opinion in question is widely held, and is not simply the product of the author's mind---and this is fairly easily done. Now, as to the hypothesis being a fallacy, I would argue that that point is specious. In as much as it is a discussion of a possibility (or a number of possibilities) in the context of a television show (and its "universe"), I would argue that it can neither be proven nor disproven. If one looks here (<a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html" class="external free" title="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/crossovers.html</a>) one will find a page dedicated to researching the subject, and wherein one will find an argument for the idea that not only is Tom Fontana (creator of "St. Elswhere") aware of the Tommy Westphal phenomenon, but he is actively seeking to expand the universe of shows related to it. As I said, keep the article, I believe it has merit as an interesting pop culture notion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 19:29, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, although his character wasn't significant to the storyline, it was significant to the ending of the series. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:29, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> on the sole basis that the character wasn't that significant to the series -- NOT for the POV arguments stated above since this was not a hypothesis created by a Wikipedia editor. Also this should NOT be taken as any sort of support for deleting List of series connected to the Tommy Westphall Universe which I support keeping.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Tommy Westphall hypothesis is not original research, having been discussed on Usenet possibly as far back as 1996 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.tv/msg/b156b9d7fd6f8f5a?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.tv/msg/b156b9d7fd6f8f5a?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> and definitely as far back as 1998 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.homicide/browse_thread/thread/c4a5d1250a5195ca/4f1a17a1dc572eee?lnk=st&amp;q=%22tommy+westphall%22&amp;rnum=71#4f1a17a1dc572eee" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.homicide/browse_thread/thread/c4a5d1250a5195ca/4f1a17a1dc572eee?lnk=st&amp;q=%22tommy+westphall%22&amp;rnum=71#4f1a17a1dc572eee" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. It has even been described in an article on the BBC web site from 2003 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2951086.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2951086.stm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, which means it has a reliable source. The article is already written in a neutral point of view since opposing arguments are given reasonable space. While Tommy Westphall would not have merited a Wikipedia article of his own absent the final scene which gave rise to the hypothesis, the scene was indeed the ending of the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Elsewhere_3fa8.html" title="St. Elsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a> series and the hypothesis inspired by the scene continues to be of interest to fans of television in connection with the large <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional universe</a> which is connected to the show.

The point is not that we need to believe that Tommy Westphall imagined the entire series <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Lucy_f6db.html" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a> (for example), just that the hypothesis under which he is assumed to have done so is notable -- and it is. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:25, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is at best a speculative theory that gained notoriety BECAUSE it received a Wikipedia article. The sources given by Metropolitan90 are hardly convincing--the BBC article is a fluff piece that mentions the TWUH in passing; I sincerely hope that Wikipedia requires more of its sources than that. If the entire concept is unsourced and based on speculation rather than facts, there's no reason to devote an article to it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 08:28, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The BBC article was published in 2003, more than 2 years before this Wikipedia article was created (in June 2005). It's easy to find multiple blog entries about the main web site about the Tommy Westphall universe dating from 2004, and as indicated above the hypothesis was being discussed on Usenet in 1998, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#History" title="Wikipedia">more than two years before Wikipedia was created</a>. Thus, I don't see how the hypothesis's notoriety can be attributed to this Wikipedia article. I understand that you may consider the hypothesis unworthy of an encyclopedia entry on other grounds as well, but "gained notoriety because of the Wikipedia article" shouldn't be the reason for deletion in this particular case. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 08:41, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The historical predecessor of the American movement that originated in 19th Century Germany no longer exists.

<li><b>Comment</b> The German page was created by user Amb (name and edit history suggest it might be the subject of the article herself); said user asked that the article be deleted on May 11, claiming it (presumably the edited version) was offensive and hurting her image. In the AfD discussion (the German equivalent, anyway) an anonymous user suggested that it is very offensive to mention the conversion of a person to Judaism (apparently, she used to be a Christian minister);it could presumably hurt her career as a Jewish scholar. Pretty much all the deletion discussion revolved around this issue (resulting in a clear keep), notability was only mentioned in passing (inconclusive). – As for the amount of publications, these are just selections (that's what "Auswahl" in the German article means). – The "Hochschule für Jüdische Studien" is closely associated with the University of Heidelberg, but not part of it; and she is not full or tenured, but assistant professor (basically someone with a PhD). – The liberal jews thingy she co-founded (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Progressive_Jews_in_Germany_0fc4.html" title="Union of Progressive Jews in Germany">Union of Progressive Jews in Germany</a>) is quite notable. – My impression as a total layman is that she seems to be notable enough for a German Jewish scholar. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 15:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> I created this, but Mmx1 brings up a good point. Im not sure if im convinced about the lier stuff, but it giving no google hits does cause it hard to source. However, we still have lots of places in WP where he is presented as the former head of ASPD, and they should redirect to SDI. It could be argued that it has so little sources about it since it was a secret project, and it was later known as SDI, so the secret project name was droped. Ill go ahead and make the page a redirect. Mmx1, good work on a good nomination.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 19:40, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom unless reliable sources surface. <i>Do not redirect</i> as a redirect would suggest the term and the "secret project" is real and that would be untruthful. If ASPD must be mentioned it would need to be verifiable information, e.g. documenting the hoax organization, the liar who invented it, and the conspiracy theorists who swallow everything hook, line and sinker (though good luck on finding non-OR sources on that.) <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 19:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I appreciate the response to my article. I now understand the concern of most editors and I will try to address them one by one. One easy thing for everyone to try is doing a Google search on Jews and the Torah True Jews website comes up the 5th. According to that, it’s a busy website and gets many hits External websites linking to this one: A simple search will find many websites linking to this website. About the concern of membership: It’s hard to verify this, because as stated in the discussion page, the group is like an offshoot of satmar and doesn’t keep its own membership, but as I said there the satmar rabbis defiantly back this group as evident by the letter signed by several satmar rabbis. Another example that the consensus in the street is that this group represents satmar is that recently the grand rabbi of satmar passed away upon his passing the PLO mission in Washington sent a condolence letter to the satmar community and the rabbi’s family it did so by sanding a letter to True Torah Jews and asking them to pass the condolences to the community and the rabbi’s family (the letter was widely circulated in the satmar community and I can post it if only someone here helps me in doing so.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Positioning on Google means very little. Anyone can buy google ranking or do something like a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google bomb</a> to move their site ranking up. The fact that a letter was sent on the Rabbi's passing says very little as well as well, IMO. If the long time pastor of a 50-person Baptist Church were to pass away, the church would get letters of condolence, but that doesn't make the 50-person church notable. Can you give us an idea of the membership? Even if you don't know exact numbers, do they have five members, five hundred, or five thousand? If that's a question that you can't answer, then I'm not sure that it's a notable subject for an article. As I said before, a condition of a keep, IMO, would be some verifiable evidence that this organization actually has members that can't be counted on one hand. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:49, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You did not understand my point. The mission wanted to reach the “satmar” community (which “is verified” to have tens of thousands of members) they used the channel of the True Torah Jews. In my opinion, this verifies that the conventional wisdom in the street is that the True Torah Jews is the satmar anti-Zionist voice in the secular world. This brings me to my point that even though, to someone that is not evolved in satmar, it is completely new that this group is affiliated with satmar, it is the fact. About membership: the group does not keep its own membership satmar is behind the group and that is were they get there funding by making appeals in the satmat synagogues so they do not need independent membership. Nevertheless, they do keep some kind of membership by sending their weekly newsletter that they send to thousands of subscribers. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloger_aa64.html" title="User:Bloger">Bloger</a> 02:47, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Besides the fact that you have not provided any verifiable sources for these claims, you still persist on making illogical jumps. How in the world do you figure that True Torah Jews in the mouthpeice for the Satmar community. You have claimed to found a source that says three satmar rabbi's have said that they support the organization, but even if that is true how do we know they were acting officially on behalf of the entire Satmar dynasty, and how does showing suport indicate that they are part of the the same organization?- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 04:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

In <i>VaYoel Moshe</i> Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum explicitly declared that the Zionists violated the three oaths, and thereby caused the Holocaust, as well as all violence in modern Israel, as a result: <i>"...it has been these Zionist groups that have attracted the Jewish people and have violated the Oath against establishing a Jewish entity before the arrival of the Messiah. It is because of the Zionists that six million Jews were killed."</i><a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/rabbi_quotes/vayoelmoshe1.cfm#6Million" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/rabbi_quotes/vayoelmoshe1.cfm#6Million" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></p>

<b>Comment</b>.</p>
<p>Hi I will again try to address the concerns raised.</p>
<p>About the concern of anonymity: <a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a></p>
<p>It is an understandable concern but one has to take in account that when an issue of such controversy is involved it is understandable why one wants to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Take for example Rabbi Weiss of Neturei Karta, one can only imagine what harassments he has to encounter, because he is in the public arena on an issue that is so close to so many harts, and is dear to so many people.</p>
<p>It takes a very strong person to be able to withstand such hardship, which this group probably cannot find.</p>
<p>This should also satisfy the concerns of , <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> (as per MPerel concern)</p>
<p>As per the concern from <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a>:</p>
<p>He raises a few concerns with the article:</p>
<p>Concern:1) The only source that refers to the organization is the organization's own website.</p>
<p>Answer: The fact is that there is quite a few referring’s to the group and its web site:</p>
<p>Try for example searching the word JewsAgainstZionism (as one word) in Google this is the result <b>Results 1 - 100 of about 21,000 for "JewsAgainstZionism"</b> for the 621 you can actually see they all are referring to the group’s web site. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22JewsAgainstZionism%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22JewsAgainstZionism%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>
<p>Then Try searching the word JewsAgainstZionism (as one word) in yahoo this is the result <b>Results 1 - 100 of about 7,340 for "JewsAgainstZionism"</b> for the 1000 you can actually see they all are referring to the group’s web site. <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=JewsAgainstZionism&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;toggle=1&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;pstart=1&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;b=901" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=JewsAgainstZionism&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;toggle=1&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;pstart=1&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;b=901" rel="nofollow">[38]</a></p>
<p>Now try searching the word TrueTorahJews (as one word) in Google this is the result <b>Results 1 - 89 of about 395 for "TrueTorahJews"</b> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=TrueTorahJews&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=TrueTorahJews&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></p>
<p>Then try searching the word TrueTorahJews (as one word) in yahoo this is the result <b>Results 1 - 60 of about 252 for "TrueTorahJews"</b> <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=+%22TrueTorahJews%22&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;n=100&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=+%22TrueTorahJews%22&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;n=100&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>
<p>If this is not “being referred to”, I do not know what is.</p>
<p>This should also satisfy the concerns of <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> ,<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> (as per Zaxem concern), <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a>(as per Heptor concern),</p>
<p>Concern 2) Three satmar rabbis, does not necessarily mean the entire community is behind it.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Firstly:</p>
<p>The three rabbi’s are not just three picked out of all the other’s, they are of the most senior of rabbi’s each one in there own respect.</p>
<p>Take Rabbi Nathan Joseph Meisels for example he was the chief dean of the yeshiva (rabbinical university) from-----until his retirement in 1982.</p>
<p>The position of chief dean can be characterized as the second in commend of the dynasty, given the fact, that at that time almost 100% son’s of satmar’s studied in this college.</p>
<p>In addition, he was a very close confidant and personal adviser to the Rabbi, Rabbi Joel (of blessed memory) on all aspects and on anti-Zionist issue’s in particular.</p>
<p>In fact, the famous - and one of the most important in regards to anti Zionism - book published by the Rabbi, Al HaGeulah V'Al HaTemurah was written and published by Rabbi Nathan Joseph Meisels.</p>
<p>Rabbi Mayer Weberman, was the only English speaker at most anti-Zionist demonstration called by satmar, which makes him the face to the media or the press secretary if you will, when it comes to satmar, the media, and anti-Zionism.(a clip from one such speech can be heard here <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/mediaclips/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/mediaclips/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a></p>
<p>In addition, until recently (when he fell ill) Rabbi Weberman was the official censor of the satmar boys &amp; girl’s school’s, censoring all - secular studies - books for Zionist and adult content.</p>
<p>Rabbi Abraham Leitner, probably one of the most revered and respected student’s of the Rabbi, Rabbi Joel (of blessed memory) still living among us. . (A clip from one such speech can be heard here <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/mediaclips/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/mediaclips/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, instead of taking ten’s of signatures from all the satmar rabbis the group chose the most senior in respect to the satmar battle with the Zionists state. And by that scale, these three rabbis’ were picked to sign the letter.</p>
<p>So my point is it’s not three random signatures that can be dismissed as not being the mindset of the entire community. It is as if the three most senior cabinet members of the white house sign a proclamation, you con rest assured that this is the holding of the entire cabinet.</p>
<p>Secondly:</p>
<p>As I wrote before, an example that the consensus in the street is,- that even though TTJ isn’t per se a mouth piece of satmar - this group is the de-facto satmar podium on anti Zionism, is that recently the grand rabbi of satmar (Rabbi Moses of blessed memory) passed away, upon his passing the PLO mission in Washington wanted to reach the “satmar” community (which <b>is verified</b> to have tens of thousands of members) and the rabbi’s family to express there condolences they used the channel of the True Torah Jews and asked them to pass the condolences to the community and the rabbi’s family (the letter was widely circulated in the satmar community and I can post it if only someone here helps me in doing so).</p>
<p>In my opinion, this verifies that the conventional wisdom in the street is that the True Torah Jews is the satmar anti-Zionist voice in the secular world.</p>
<p>Thirdly:</p>
<p>The grand Rabbi’s of satmar both Rabbi Aaron and Rabbi Zalman leib Teitelbaum are active supporters of the organization. Rabbi Aaron has proclaimed in the Talmudic journal published by the satmar yeshiva in K.J. that everyone is to see that this organization succeeds in there work and he made it a necessity that everyone gives at least $20 to the TTJ.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zalman leib Teitelbaum personally attends fundraising diners made by the TTJ.</p>
<p>In addition the TTJ is regularly featured as news and in editorials in both “Der Yid” (the official newspaper of the Rabbi Zalman faction in satmar) and Der Blatt” (the official newspaper of the Rabbi Aaron faction in satmar)</p>
<p>Fourthly:</p>
<p>As you watch, the clips and slide shows on the website of the TTJ from the numerous demonstrations called by satmar, you will - in almost every instant - come across a sign with the TTJ web site plugged and even sometimes the banner behind the head table was dedicated to the TTJ group (B.T.W. in one such instance Rabbi Zalman can bee seen seated on the head table that the banner featured the TTJ.</p>
<p><br />
In addition, as I have said before the funding for TTJ comes primarily from satmar by making appeals in the satmar synagogues (which – BTW - can only be done with the approval of the congregation)</p>
<p>The above should also satisfy the concerns of <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> ,</p>
<p>Another fact that would make the TTJ notable is the expensive website the ads it takes out in the biggest newspapers and radio station’s which add up to ten’s of thousands of dollars yearly this can only be achieved with a strong financial backbone such as financial support of satmar.</p>
<p>As per the matter of membership:</p>
<p>The group does not keep its own membership they get there funding (for what membership is primarily needed) by making appeals in the satmar synagogues and diner’s maid by satmar’s.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they do have some membership by sending their weekly newsletter that they send to thousands of subscribers.</p>
<p>And the point that <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> raised sending out a newsletter to thousands of people doesn't really mean anything:</p>
<p>You say yourself that it came upon you by voting that sets up a data base of conservative thinking people that might be interested in getting conservative literature, but the TTJ does not have such a date base available to them, the only way the TTJ sends an e-mail is by people subscribing to there newsletter on there website.</p>
<p>Moreover, one cannot be sending newsletter’s out every week to thousands of people with such highly controversial content, when one can with the touch of a button, block and report it to be spam, and within a month or two your list goes down to none.</p>
<p>Given the above, the fact that they send out thousands of newsletters, and are not blocked is significant inRegard to the support they have</p>
<p>The others I cannot satisfy since they did not say why they think it should be deleted.</p>
<p>This is my case, the defense rests, and the decision is in the hand of the jury.</p>
<p>P.S. I would like to ask all participants to thoroughly read what I wrote and rethink the position taken.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - several things: (1) The google hits look to be self-generated. I lost count of the number of JewsAgainstZionism hits that were from the comments section of blogs. Just because someone has time on their hands doesn't make them notable. Are there any references to the organization from a mainstream media site? (2) The fact that some Rabbis agree with the objectives of the organization and that some of their quotes and audio clips are on the site doesn't mean that the Rabbis are a part of the organization. Plenty of Baptist churches quote John Wesley, for example, but he was most certainly never a Baptist. (3) The newsletter is email? Good grief - then it really doesn't mean anything.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I respect your views. But I haven't seen any actual, verifiable, evidence that the organization/website is more than just a few people. If you could find mentions of them in the mainstream media (not blogs) or some kind of reference to their actual, registered membership, that would be something convincing. Again, this is not a vote on their worthiness to exist or the correctness of their views ... it is just an attempt to establish a consensus on whether or not the organization is notable enough for a WP article. I haven't found any evidence that it is. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for taking the time</p>
<p>It may be that many hits are from blog commenting, but there are 21,000 sittings according to Google. And I do not think, you think that a few people did all this.</p>
<p>With so much time on there side you don’t think they would try to get some attention from any notable media outlet, for crying out loud people with much smaller issue’s and much less time on there side get signifying more attention.</p>
<p>The truth is TTJ isn’t in the market for good looks all it does is trying to get there massage across and according to there web director (you can contact him just like I did by e-mail) they get thousands of hits a month and that satisfies them.</p>
<p>About the rabbi’s you missed the point all I was trying to say is that for example if the pope, the secretary of state of the Vatican and cardinal Edward Egan of New York sign a proclamation on something doesn’t this mean that a significant amount of people in the catholic religion think the same way?</p>
<p>The same way when rabbi’s in the position of the ones mentioned take a position on anything it carries the thinking of a nice majority if not all of satmar.</p>
<p>And about the newsletter it’s not only e-mail the reason I spoke about e-mail is that e-mail is blocked very easily and the fact that thousands of people let this in there inbox and don’t spam it means a lot in my opinion</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. – Although I’ve edited Wikipedia in the past<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.139.62.77" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.139.62.77" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, I’m not sure about the rules here. However, if being a die-hard Wikipedia reader qualifies me to vote then I offer this:</p>
<p>I’m a Satmar member who can attest to the fact that this organization takes its philosophy from the teachings of the Satmar rabbi Joel Tietelbaum, and its financial support from his today’s over 120,000 (according to latest news reports) followers.</p>
<p>I now recall a morning in the summer of 2005 as I entered the main synagogue in <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiryas_Joel_7930.html" title="Kiryas Joel">Kiryas Joel</a>, a Satmar village in upstate New York with 15,000 residents. I met a huge poster stating: Support True Torah Jews. I followed a call from Rabbi <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Teitelbaum_f162.html" title="Aaron Teitelbaum">Aaron Teitelbaum</a>, chief rabbi of Kiryas Joel, to support this organization. I took out my wallet and found my last twenty dollars. I made my donation and walked away with an empty wallet.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the three above mentioned rabbis serve as an editorial board, but they are certainly not “the only” rabbis behind True Torah Jews.</p>
<p>One should not expect as many Satmar internet users to notice this discussion as Zionist do, since Satmar educates its members to refrain from internet as much as possible. This vote will probably be decided by two types of voters; the ones who are truly unaware of, and the others who are truly biased against True Torah Jews.</p>
<p>In the recent 6 months, I’ve come to rely on Wikipedia as my encyclopedia. It will be devastating to learn that I was only reading the side of the story allowed by interest groups. I will be shocked to see an article deleted because some people, who can’t tolerate criticism against the Zionist cause, are better positioned on Wikipedia. Finally, it will also be informative to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mearsheimer_4e28.html" title="John Mearsheimer">John Mearsheimer</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Walt_27a0.html" title="Stephen Walt">Stephen Walt</a> that the list of Israeli targets for censorship now includes Widipedia, with quite some success!</p>

Please don't <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume</a> that the posters here are biased. Try to see it from my perspective. I have never heard of this organization. All I have to know that is exists is its own website and a few anonymous poster. Letters by rabbis might show that this exists but it does demonstrate what it does, or how big the organization is. We are not looking for a thousand links to it's website but to one link to a real news source talking about what this organization is and what it does.

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When I look back to the current version of the article I see that it describes in TTJ’s words what it claims to be doing; this article is about TTJ and TTJ only. It doesn’t even make the claim that it is supported by Satmar, although it is. The article doesn’t give clue about the magnitude of its followers. It is only stating that there is this website making such and such claims.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also think that Blogger made a good point that the level of support that TTJ enjoys from the Satmar rabbis can be evident by watching footage on TTJ’s website. In Blogger’s words: “As you watch, the clips and slide shows on the website of the TTJ from the numerous demonstrations called by satmar, you will - in almost every instant - come across a sign with the TTJ web site plugged and even sometimes the banner behind the head table was dedicated to the TTJ group”</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. At the request of Bloger, I’ve read his/her appeal to reconsider my vote and this is my response. First, Bloger, I do appreciate your efforts here on behalf of the article and I echo what BigDT said, that "this is not a vote on [TTJ's] worthiness to exist or the correctness of their views ... it is just an attempt to establish a consensus on whether or not the organization is notable enough for a WP article." My concern about the anonymous nature of the website still stands, since for whatever reason the website owners have for remaining anonymous, this factor alone unfortunately still makes it fail <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, one of the three WP non-negotiable policies. If TTJ were really a mouthpiece for Satmar, there would need to be some official statement from Satmar or even something in the media verifying this, we can't just assume. Since the anti-zionist views don't appear dramatically different from Satmar, it doesn’t make sense to me that Satmar would feel the need to be anonymous about it if it were indeed their mouthpiece organization. Now, what I have found, however, on a little further investigation, are a few names associated with the website that I’ve been able to glean from some blog sites (these aren’t verifiable sources as far as WP is concerned, but they do shed some light for our discussion here on who is behind the website). Three names keep popping up variously as "founders" of the group: Mark Elf, Tony Greenstein, and Roland Rance, basically bloggers with an anti-zionist slant. None of these three individuals appear to be religious Jews (which precludes them as representatives of Satmar), though there seems to be some possible loose association with the British <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a>. All I can find so far is data that points to the website belonging to one or a couple of individuals, an extension of their blogs really, and while the site is certainly interesting, it doesn’t meet WP encyclopedic standards for notability. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 06:04, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi and thank you for responding:</p>
<p>Firstly, as I said before the TTJ isn’t per se a mouth-piece of satmar – nevertheless because satmar doesn’t have an anti Zionist platform for the outside of satmar - meaning Jewish non satmar’s and non Jews - this group has become the de-facto satmar podium on anti Zionism in the world of non Yiddish - so to speak –, this can be seen thru several thing sited above,for one the satmar rabbis, the banner on the head table for TTJ by an official satmar demonstration, as I linked above.</p>
<p>This brings me to my second point:</p>
<p>Should it be the fact, that the TTJ is run – or for that matter in any way associated - to non-religious Jews, or even more, to a left wing socialist movement, you can rest assured not only wouldn’t you find any satmar rabbi signing a proclamation for the group, but also not in any circumstance letting the group grab any publicity on an official satmar event, given that satmar is not a political opponent to the state of Israel, but rater a morel opponent of it, in fact should the world - and for that matter Evan the Arabs - miraculously unanimously become supportive of Israel, it wont affect satmars opposition to Israel not one iota, moreover satmar has always maintained the position to not be seen in any way having an association with people or groups like the ones you mentioned, so much so that when a group like the Neturei Karta - which is an orthodox Jewish group and even has the same fundamental for opposing Israel like the one of satmar – but because they associated themselves with the political apposition to the state, satmar very openly and aggressively disassociated themselves from them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as I said before the TTJ is regularly featured in the two Yiddish newspapers “Der Yid” and “Der Blot” that are the official newspapers of the two satmar factions (the Aron’s and Zalmons).The question is would it be considered a verification of TTJ works and structure if it is spelled out in the above newspapers?</p>
<p>If yes, I would be more than glad to present such writings and let the Yiddish speaking and reading editors here, confirm the content.</p>
<p>However I would need more time to do just that, since they don’t publish the newspaper on the web I would need to contact them, go to there office and get a hold of the articles.</p>

<li><b>DONT DELETE</b> I wrote this as a courtesy for the company because the managing partner is the Mann Report's Hedge Fund manager of the year and has been written up in several financial papers and law journals. I will cite sources if this will allow the page to remain. I was NOT commissioned to add it, but I do have permission from the company. Also, this firm has created a process called the "GPO" (which is a trademarked procedure- completely unique) which differentiates it from other firms. Also, if this is a corporate "vanity site", then arent all articles about actors, musicians, celebrities, and fashion companies also "vanity sites"? What about celebrities with no known occupation that are famous anyway (such as Kato Kaylin). Would an article about him be a "vanity site"? Another thing to note- look under "law firms" on wikipedia. If you look at the list under "united states" there are several law firms listed, and many of them have articles on wikipedia. Are those also all considered "vanity sites"? What regulation says that those articles can stay and this one cannot? Olayak 21:43, 11 May 2006 (UTC)k</li>

<li><b>DONT DELETE</b> this is not a website, nor does it try to be one. It explains mostly the unique "GPO" procedure. Look under "law firms" in wikipedia. Are you suggesting that every one of those firms should be deleted? There are at least 100 from around the world. Also, this company has been written up many times in the media, does that not merit an article in wikipedia? How often must a company or person be written up before someone will approve its article? Once again, the firm did NOT ask me to write this article. I thought it should be added and gained the permission of the company to write about it.Olayak 22:31, 11 May 2006 (UTC)k <b>(Second Olayak Vote)</b></li>

<dd><s><b>Keep and edit it</b></s>. The source John Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition Of Islamic Salvation History checks out, though the translation of the work is under question, Traditum is to surrender, so Traditum Votum should mean Surrender to God, shouldn't it? The School of Oriental and African studies stated that the book was delayed as a result of the author's death. SOAS is also apprehensive about having a wiki page on the society, I think they don't want this being "leaked". But obviously there is no proof that this society has any links with the institution. 212.219.118.149 14:14, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> lol, you're expecting a student from a high school to have expert in latin. However I too don't know whether or not traditum actually means surrender, though I'm sure you would be able to enlighten me with your perfect latin translation abilities. Through Wansbrough's notes, the name Louis IX was stated. However, I cannot be 100% certain it is St Louis it is referring to. The time period of the 13th century led me to assume that it was St Louis of France.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 19:41, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> They didn't found a football team, they took control and then allocated control to the fans. Islam was the religon under which the soceity was founded in the south of Spain, the Quran was a big influence on their thinking. The Church where the engraving of the societies initials and seal still remain today, stands on an old mosque. Mushrif-ud-Din Abdullah (known more commonly as Saadi in his works) was captured during the crusades and he is said to have become a member while in captivity in Spain. In Wansbrough's last edition of his book Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation he states that part of the thoughts Saadi portrays in his writings are Quranic (i.e. of Islamic origin) and speak of his "finding of a new politcal underground" which "does the word of God through subtle means". This very writing was found within the remains of the church.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 22:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Note</b> that the current wiki page for Saadi verifies that he was captured during the crusades and that his writings were contreversial, how likely is it that a Muslim in his times would write about homoeroticism? Surely, he was protected by some sort of organization from certain excecution. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 23:38, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(backing up, pushing the right margin) So let's get this straight. You've got a medieval Sufi, who <u>may</u> have been captured by the Crusaders and <u>is said</u> to have been held in Spain. He wrote of an unnamed political underground but said little about it. From that, you come up with a group with a Latin name (whose meaning you don't know, but got from where?) supposedly connected to a French king and saint, as well as an Italian saint, neither of whom was remotely connected with Spain. And all of this is somehow connected to a 19-year-old Bulgarian/British schoolkid, whose article appears to have just been deleted and recreated. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

I had created this article originally in an attempt to diffuse arguments over placement of WebQuest content that had been on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a> and others (I simply moved a copy of content that had been on another article, but I don't remember which offhand currently). I feel that that in theory information recent promotional marketing strategies can be good information (espically to people with interests in those areas (marketing majors?)) IF and only if it can be written in NPOV. Furthermore I feel that while such information is interesting (and has been on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a> for years (per its talk page)), I feel that it's not quite directly related to the content of the Book or the movie (it's more related to the general public's interactions with the book/movie), and therefore deserving of a seperate page. Thirdly as the Da Vinci Code has the potential of being a large franchise (3 books, 1 movie already, several related books), and having seperate articles that are common/related to multiple articles can help keep the pages smaller and concise (note the too long tag on the book's page). All that said... In this case I'm also not opposed to Deletion, per nom. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlie_Huggard_5a3a.html" title="User:Charlie Huggard">Charlie</a><sup>(<a href="http://cirl.missouri.edu/wiki/User:Charlie" class="external text" title="http://cirl.missouri.edu/wiki/User:Charlie" rel="nofollow">@CIRL</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlie_Huggard_1b04.html" title="User talk:Charlie Huggard">talk</a>)</sup> 04:23, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Merge or</s> Keep</b>. The information is appropriate for Wikipedia, though the format isn't.

(revised opinion) - yet another <a href="http://quest.eurostar.com/en-us/home.php" class="external text" title="http://quest.eurostar.com/en-us/home.php" rel="nofollow">new webquest</a> has just been released by Eurostar in the last day or so.. it's starting to make sense to have a separate article for Da Vinci Code webquests, and then the two other articles due to length issues (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code" rel="nofollow">one</a> for the Da Vinci Code book and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code_%28film%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">one</a> for the Da Vinci Code movie and future movie(s)). Some of the comments above like SirNuke's or M1ss1ontomars2k4's could have researched a little deeper first - I don't think some of the commenters are even aware there are separate webquests, some related to the movie, some to the book - two of the quests have been running since 2003 and are not short-term promos, they are quests in their own right and continue generate a lot of interest. I don't know if Google will keep thier webquests on line permanently, but judging by the interest, I'd imagine they will. Likewise with the even newer Eurostar quest - it seems like launching Da Vinci Code Quests is gaining momentum, so it would make sense to keep this info active and on its own page. As far as people deleting links, if it's possible to protect portions of an article, then do so. AFAIK, the legitimate links that have been there from the start are <a href="http://demon.twinflame.org/archives/2003/08/the_da_vinci_code.php" class="external text" title="http://demon.twinflame.org/archives/2003/08/the_da_vinci_code.php" rel="nofollow">this one</a> for the original two webquests since 2003, and <a href="http://student-rant.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://student-rant.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://googlefact.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://googlefact.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">two</a> for the Google webquests.

<p>The long revert war over including this actor's real name aside, I am not convinced that this article asserts the subject's notability. Controversies exist over the actor's apparent admission that he falsified his identification in order to work in porn at age 17 (illegal in the US), and over his insistence that he is entitled to continue using "Brent Corrigan" (which Cobra Video claims as intellectual property), but these "controversies" were exclusive to the gay adult entertainment community and media, and went utterly unreported in mainstream media, per Google. (As an aside, I cannot find any source other than the "press release" supposedly issued by Cobra Video for the subject's "real" name which, frankly, comes across as an effort to discredit the subject or and/or lay claim through the "media" to its "property".) Since I alone cannot determine whether this is a clear-cut case of notability or non-notability, I am bringing this here. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 9px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 21:13, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Care, but keep</b> I've done a lot of work salvaging this article from edit wars and horrible POV writing from both sides. I really have no care in the world about whether gay porn stars are automatically included in Wikipedia. But, considering the number of het porn stars that exist on wikipedia, it makes sense to keep the gay ones too. It may miss "mainstream media" but who cares about mainstream media?

<li><b>Keep.</b> Okay, so a page about a future product isn't the most encyclopedic thing out there - but Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. In fact, WP:NOT says that "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place". And most certainly MacBook meets this criteria. Analysts are predicting it, rumour sites are all over it - and more notably, Apple accidentally leaked the name a few days ago on the iPod page. Thus, it is both verifiable (analysts and Apple, if not rumour sites) - and if we delete this, there are so many other things that could be deleted. I suppose we just wait a week and see what happens. =) --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintchocicecream_dfbe.html" title="User:Mintchocicecream">mintchocicecream</a> 23:12, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, the precedent is a terrible one. Club sports do not by default indicate not notable, esp. if there is not varsity equivalent. As Ultimate is an extremely popular sport (estimated that over 100,000 people play Ultimate in the United States alone <a href="http://www4.upa.org/files/2006_Fact_Sheet_low.pdf|" class="external text" title="http://www4.upa.org/files/2006_Fact_Sheet_low.pdf|" rel="nofollow">UPA Fact Sheet</a>), Ultimate is a notable sport, and the college level is one of the priemier levels of Ultimate. I really don't see the worth in deleting the page, as it could certainly be of interest, it is not vanity, it is of relatively high quality, and does not violate any Wiki standards.

The contributions that B-Mo has made to ultimate fribee as a sport are significant and their accomplishments are more than worthy of record on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I already posted a "Keep" above, but wanted to expand a little. I mostly add and edit articles about literature and writers, but the thing that has attracted me to Wikipedia from the beginning is its inclusiveness. I ofent use it in my own writing as a first choice source of information. I could easily imagine myself drafting a novel with people playing Ultimate Frisbee mentioned in passing and then deciding I needed a couple of facts about how it is played-- club sport at college-- who plays it-- Ivy leaguers and others-- what do they call themselves? Brownian Motion for heavens sake! This is exactly the kind of odd quirky info that a fiction writer thrives on. <a href="../../../m/s/u/User%7EMSueWillis_ad2d.html" title="User:MSueWillis">MSueWillis</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> The club team precedent seems unreasonable; Ultimate has a very large player base these days yet there are no varsity ultimate teams I know of. As club teams go, Brown is certainly notable; the team won nationals last year and on another previous occasion and gets significant name recognition from Ultimate players across the country. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobinmarcus_4f40.html" title="User:Tobinmarcus">Tobinmarcus</a> 19:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well for one thing, some media source that shows the group won a national championship would go a long way toward getting this article out of AfD.

<li>Interesting in the sense that it is useful can be criterion for keeping. If it is useful, then it is, arguably, encyclopedic, and thus wiki-worthy. Secondly, as the defending national champions in a large college sport, I would argue that notability has been proven. I would ask, at this juncture, why are they "not notable"? By asserting that they are not notable, but by not giving justification, it is really impossible to defend the article. To quote the great Jerry McGuire, "Help me help you (understand why this subject is notable)"-- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 04:20, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, this is a perennial powerhouse and recent <b>national champion</b> in a sport where college level is the peak. Ultimate fans will want to know about the team.

<li>Continuing in this vein, I found several interesting and well established articles about college clubs. For example, the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_Outing_Club_a5b0.html" title="Dartmouth Outing Club">Dartmouth Outing Club</a> has, for quite some time, had an article (which, after reading it, I would agree that it whole-heartedly deserves). There are over 350 college teams that participate in the UPA Championship series (see the reference to the UPA factsheet in the article), and Brownian Motion reached the pinnacle of this compeition this past season. As JJay implied above, if this doesn't show notability, I don't know what does. -- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 04:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Given that other editors (rightly or wrongly) removed that text which now appears in the separate article, for consistency's sake it would seem better to have attempted to find some sort of consensus at the main article for 'fairly representing all POVs' before simply hiving off the disputed view into its own article (which itself fails to mention any other alternative view).--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 00:28, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

What that article should have is some kind of "Controversy" section that details (with sources, please!) the differences between the Sunni and Shi'a view of Hasan ibn Ali. There's plenty of room in that article, and, written concisely, I do not think this information would dominate. There's no reason I can see to write it exclusively from the Shi'a POV; instead, the section should be framed as the differences in opinion between Sunni and Shi'a.

<li><b>delete</b> -- the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasan_ibn_Ali_16cc.html" title="Hasan ibn Ali">Hasan ibn Ali</a> article already contains Shi'a POV material, such as the charge of poisoning. The POV fork just presents the same charge in greatly amplified form with much emotive language and ancillary vilification of Yazid; moreover, it is presented as truth, not opinion. There are no references given at all. If the Shi'a editors could give a <i>short</i> quote, referenced, saying the same thing, we could put it in the regular article.

<dd>So, now i improved it, and it now includes a lot of Shi'a views that are not present anywhere else. It no longer has any copy vio material and it tells about his doings before becoming a caliph, something that the main article does not. It still needs sourcing, and the details surronding events can be expanded, for example, his actions during Umars era. Anyhow, it should now be clear that its not a pov fork and that it merit its own existence, since it would dominate and be given undue wieght if the info was to be merged in to the main article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:57, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> -- Striver has added some hadith references to Hasan's role in raising troops against Aisha. There is nothing specifically "Shi'a" about this; if he wants it in the main article it can go; however, hadith references are notoriously tricky and it would be better to consult modern authorities like Madelung, who mentions Hasan periodically in his treatment of early Islamic history (Madelung's <i>Succession to Muhammad</i>, Oxford University Press, 1997 -- about half of the book is devoted to Ali and Hasan's caliphates). The references to Suyuti, ibn Arabi, and ibn Kathir do not come from these works (Striver can't read Arabic -- nor can I). They're from Shi'a websites mentioning those works. Striver has based his article on whatever he can google and has read nothing of the academic literature on Hasan. I certainly haven't read all of it, but I've read some of it, what there is in English. I am therefore distressed to see that his hit-or-miss googlings in Shi'a websites and the MSA hadith database are being construed as evidence of "research". Those fragmentary references are to events that could be added to the article, if necessary. They do not require a breakout article.</p>
<p>Striver's article is extremely Shi'a-POV, but the POV is found in the descriptions of the people involved (Muawiya and Yazid are villains, scum of the earth, Ali and Hasan are the noblest of humans), the reduction of history to a morality play, the suppression of inconvenient historical facts, and above all in the elaborate descriptions of the death of Hasan by poisoning.</p>
<p>This is an interesting topic. Madelung (p. 331) believes that it is not purely a Shi'a invention, and cites several Sunni scholars as supporting the poisoning theory. However, Madelung has spent his life studying Shi'a Islam and it is clear from his book that he has absorbed much of the Shi'a POV, even though he is not (so far as I know) a Muslim or a Shi'a. I'd have to do a trawl through the academic literature to find out what other scholars think about the poisoning theory. The poisoning story certainly fits into Twelver Shi'a theology, which postulates that the first eleven imams (all of them up to the twelfth imam, who has disappeared, and will return as the Mahdi) were all killed by Sunni Muslims and were all martyrs (a loaded word). Hence any natural-seeming death of an imam MUST be the result of conspiracy, poisoning, whatever.</p>
<p>Striver set up his own article just because he didn't want to <i>engage</i> with other editors who might criticize his writing, or his use of sources, or his reduction of history to morality play. He really ought not to be allowed to set up his own little Shi'apedia, where he is unchallenged.</p>
<p>There is only one way to salvage the article. Someone would have to do some intensive research, in Arabic and Persian language sources, many of them probably still in manuscript, on the evolution of Shi'a views of Hasan. This would be original research, unless first published as a book, and it would also be extremely controversial. The Shi'a version of their history is often quite at odds with an outsider's view of their history (hence Momen, in his book on Shi'a Islam, has two historical sections: the accepted Shi'a view and "what happened," as near as he could come to it).</p>
<p>Since no one is going to do this research (certainly not me, unless someone wants to give me a huge grant to learn the necessary languages, get a graduate degree, and visit various archives to search for sources), I think this article should be deleted, or if kept, merged. There is simply not enough uniquely Shi'a material to justify a breakout article. The main article could just be expanded to incorporate the material Striver thinks should be included. He's going to have to allow editing, however, to which he has never taken kindly. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:23, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that it can be added to the main article, sure, do that. But as you laid out yourself, Shi'a, Sunni and Non-Muslims have different views of the events. I described the Shi'a view of it, and the hadith are perfectly valid to describe those events <b>from a Shi'a view</b>. Madelung is a "modern authorities" on <b>Madelungs view</b>, hi is not a expert on the <b>Shi'a view</b>. Hence, the position that madelung is a beter source for the Shi'a view than hadith are is rendered false.</p>

<p>Yes, excatly my point. Shi'a sites are a far better source for the Shi'a view than Madelung is for the Shi'a view. That is obvious.</p>

<p>That is a personal attack on me. First of all, whe are not here to disscuss me or you, we are here to disscuss the article and its sources. And further, you seem to imply that there are no academic works on the Internet. That is proof that you are not familiar with the Shi'a view enough, otherwise you would know that many Shi'a academics such as <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Tijani_5720.html" title="Muhammad al-Tijani">Muhammad al-Tijani</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Sistani_cf45.html" title="Al-Sistani">al-Sistani</a> have many of their works on the internet, and i have linked to those sources plenty of times. Zora seems to assume that since i have my sources online, they are somehow inferior. I didnt know that a work becomes inferior when it is uploaded. For more Shi'a academic books online, see <a href="http://al-islam.org/alpha.php" class="external text" title="http://al-islam.org/alpha.php" rel="nofollow">the library</a> at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-islam.org.html" title="Al-islam.org">Al-islam.org</a></p>

<p>Yes, of course, didnt you read the title? "Shi'a view of Hasan". If you mean that my sentences are pov, then you are misstaken, i always write "Shi'a belive he was poisoned", "Shi'a belive he was good", "SHi'a belive Yazid is scum" and such, in perfect harmony with wikipedia rules. What are you suggesting, that we should present the Shi'a pov, but not state that SHi'a belive Yazid is the scum of the earth? Please get your facts straigh, writing "Shi'a belive Yazid is X" is not POV, "Yazid is a scum" is pov. Dont accuse the article with false accusations.</p>

<p>Yeah, great, that it Madelungs view. Why are we talking about Madelungs view in this article? His views on whether it acctualy happened or not is relevant to Non-Muslim view of Hasan ibn Ali, and his views on why Shi'a belive it is so could go to a critic section of this article. Madelungs views are not to repleace the Shi'a view, Medelung is a critic of the Shi'a view, he does not hold the Shi'a view.</p>

Reads like a resume, and boils down to saying he went to school in various places, has certain family members, and has been an employee of different companies. The one thing that remains that would seem to qualify as suggesting notability is the assertion that he and a business partner started a company, raised $11 million, and sold it. However, I'm unable to verify this, due in no small part to the complete absence of identifying details. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but expand and add images of his buildings rather than that rather uninteresting plaque.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is a relisting of a nomination from February 2006, which was nominated by <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> and closed as "Speedy Delete" without any discussion (!) by the administrator <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a>. This re-nomination should definitely mention that it is a re-nomination, and it would be good if <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a> could explain the rationale for closing the original nomination. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 02:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The original article was only the following content: "Lee started out as a marine engineer officer before travelling the world and living in Thailand. He later became a top model, presenting live shows for Barclaycard, Sony and Vodafone. You may recognise him from 90s boyband, Northern Live and his stints on Bid TV and Sky Vegas Live." Sceptre, not unreasonably, felt that this was not quite enough to establish notability. I think the current article makes it more clear, though. Just because something was speedied once does not mean it can ever be created again; speedy deletion is a way of cleaning out the thousand obviously bad/fake/wrong articles we get per day at Wikipedia, sometimes a few things slip through the cracks. (If they are really notable subjects, then someone will soon create a new article about it. Which seems to have been the case here.) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
