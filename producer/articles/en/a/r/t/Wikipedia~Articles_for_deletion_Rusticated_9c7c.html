<li>It could be expanded to include names of famous people who have been rusticated, and the types of offenses it is used for. It could also discuss how the universities are allowed in law to restrict the movements of their students. It used to be (don't know whether it still is) that the universities could ban students from traveling to within four miles of the town centers, which would otherwise be regarded as a violation of civil liberties. And finally, it could discuss how being "sent to the country," which is what rusticated means, was regarded as about the worst thing you could do to someone socially. It could be an interesting article with some work. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPintele_Yid_7fc7.html" title="User:Pintele Yid">Pintele Yid</a> 00:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I have found some wikipedia articles where the word "rusticated" is used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Rusticated" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Rusticated" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so it is nice to keep the article to explain the term. According to a comment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk_archive/December_2004&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk_archive/December_2004&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> was rusticated, when he sat under the Apple Tree.

Wikipedia does not make exceptions for verb form just because the past participle is used more often than the noun. Countless pages use verb and noun forms other than the ones most commonly used for the sake of consistency, because, unlike disputes over which name is correct for a person or place or whatnot, it is easy to be consistent regarding verb form, which makes things much simpler for anyone trying to find these articles. Plus both rustication and rusticated are so small that merging them does no harm, and helps make both less like dictionary-ish. If we had an "expulsion" article that wasn't just a disambiguation page, I'd recommend merging it into that. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:23, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

"Rusticated" would be appropriate for an article about "Students who have been rusticated". "Rustication", however, is the standard for the concept itself. Also note that "rustication" is nothing but a British variant on the meaning of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">rustication</a>; it is not a different word, just one of several definitions of the <i>same</i> word, with the definition at "rustication" being another of these definitions. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 15:07, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rephrasing vote, see below. <s><b>Weak keep.</b> Move, merge, wherever; but I do feel <i>strongly</i> that enough dabs and redirects should be created to ensure that anyone, curious about the academic usage, who types in "rusticate" or "rusticated" as the "go" term, will easily find what they seek.</s> I found a boatload—well, several more—literary references, and some British and U.S. notables who were rusticated in their college days. It seems that the term was not limited to England but was also common in nineteenth-century America. I have a preference for keeping it at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusticated.html" title="Rusticated">rusticated</a>, because, in reference to college suspension, the word is frequently used <i>in that form,</i> whereas "rusticate" and "rustication" seems to be rare. Despite what folks say are naming conventions (I thought "use the most common term" was the überconvention. But whatever. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:56, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That convention applies to choosing between <i>different</i> words, names, and titles, not between different forms of the <i>same</i> word. In other words, the "name article after the most common name" would apply if we were discussing which of two more-or-less-synonymous words to have an article at, with the less-common name being a redirect to the more common one. The rule does <i>not</i> apply to choosing between different forms of a single noun, verb, adjective, etc., however: with that, the policy is quite clear, to have all nouns singular (even though very often the plural is more common) and all verbs in their noun form, rather than in a past participle form like "rusticated". For non-Latin words, "-ing" is typically the noun ending (<a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">running</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating.html" title="Eating">eating</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding.html" title="Bleeding">bleeding</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggling.html" title="Juggling">juggling</a>, etc.) whereas Latin words tend to have an "-ion" ending, especially "-ation" (<a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancellation.html" title="Cancellation">cancellation</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunication</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigation.html" title="Navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, etc.), and still other words can have the same form as a noun or verb, avoiding the problem altogether (<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cough.html" title="Cough">cough</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">sleep</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope.html" title="Hope">hope</a>, etc.). But regardless, only in truly rare and unusual situations is a form like "rusticated" ever used; simply having one form be <i>more common</i> is not good enough. There are many other words that are almost always used in -ed form and yet aren't listed there; being consistent is a good thing, and means we don't have to make tricky judgment calls like "'Vikings' is more common than 'Viking'" or "'obey' is more common than 'obedience'", which are sadly unavoidable with most names, titles, etc. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In discussing merges, moves, and general organization, I think we should consider... is <i>rustication</i> not a synonym for "suspension?" Suspension, at least in the U. S., is the name for an academic disciplinary action, stronger than probation but weaker than expulsion, defined as loss of student status for a specified (limited) period of time. e.g. <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/judicialprocess/penaltycode.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/judicialprocess/penaltycode.htm" rel="nofollow">Stanford</a> defines it that way and then goes on: "All rights and privileges of student status are suspended during this time, including but not limited to: the right to attend classes; use library facilities; use any other facilities of the University except those open to the general public; obtain credit for any academic work; engage in any activities, or hold any position on any University committee or student organization, whether appointive or elective; live in student housing; participate in intercollegiate athletics." Loss of the right to "use any other facilities except those open to the general public" sounds essentially the same as "the student may not enter any of the university's buildings or facilities." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:21, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. And, for obvious reasons, suspension gets over 400 times as many hits on Google. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension.html" title="Suspension">Suspension</a> is currently a disambiguation page; if listing noteworthy people who have been rusticated is a worthwhile endeavor, then why not also list noteworthy people who have been suspended? Why not make a page for suspension in an academic context, merge this information to that page, and then simply list at the top of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a>, "<i>This article is about the architectural term. For the academic term, see Suspension (academia)"</i>. Then we could mention both terms, and the differences between them, on that page. Wouldn't that solve <i>all</i> of these problems?</li>
<li>Anyway, regardless of what we do, the current situation is clearly ridiculous: (1) having a disambiguation page for only <i>two</i> pages is absurdly inconvenient and unnecessary, rather than just picking one and having it link to the other; (2) if <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a> is going to redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a>, why not just make <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a> itself the disambiguation page?! No matter what, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a> is a bad idea; (3) my original suggestion of merging the two Rustications onto one page was actually, if you like, supposed to be a quasi-disambiguation page, sans the links and with a bit more information on each item, to provide all the information necessary on both terms in a quick and simple manner. I recommended it because there was so little information on each term, with the idea that they might <i>eventually</i> be turned back into separate articles once they'd been expanded enough. But such a solution isn't ideal, so I'm happy now that an ideal one <i>has</i> been found: create an article for suspension and put this there as a <i>type</i> of suspension, and leave the architectural term at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">rustication</a> with a link to suspension/rusticated. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

It contans references to notable people who have been rusticated, including Wilde and Dryden, references to American usage in literature (Twain), historical usage at Harvard and so on. Much more than a dicdef. I vote delete on dicdefs as a matter of course, but I don;t think this article is one. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 22:02, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nonsense. Expulsion and suspension can be very significant events in many people's lives, often turning points in their goals and ambitions. Once we have an article for expulsion or suspension, we may want to consider incorporating <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushout.html" title="Pushout">pushout</a> into it as well, since it's a much less common term than <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropout.html" title="Dropout">dropout</a>. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would strongly oppose such an article, because it violates Wikipedia naming conventions, just as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusticated.html" title="Rusticated">Rusticated</a> does. <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expulsion.html" title="Expulsion">Expulsion</a> would be the correct name. And yes, I'd support some sort of move like that, though it seems that <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension.html" title="Suspension">Suspension</a> is a much better description of the term and thus is a better candidate for making a new article to merge this into (as both "expulsion" and "suspension" are disambig pages, we'd either need to move them to (disambiguation), or, probably the better idea, add an (academia) or (education) or similar to the end of the name). Dictionary.com gives this meaning of the word as "<i><u>Chiefly British</u></i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The article <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusticated.html" title="Rusticated">Rusticated</a> as it stands now is defective, in my opinion, no matter what you call it. It currently is no more than a list of citations for the use of the word, and therefore belongs in a dictionary, not an encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 23:32, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the article as it stands now is defective. I don't know how I could have made that any clearer in my comments. I said to <i>integrate</i> it into a new article, called "expulsion" or "suspension" or similar, if only as a mentioning of the term. It obviously doesn't stand well on its own. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. And as I said, the article is primarily a list of citations of useage, and I think that kind of thing belongs in a dictionary, not in an encyclopedia. I would be opposed to simply tacking it onto some other article.

<li>If it's far more than a dictionary definition, then why not merge it into <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension.html" title="Suspension">suspension</a> or suspension (academia), where it would be vastly more useful and accessible to readers? Or at the very least move it to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28academia%29.html" title="Rustication (academia)">rustication (academia)</a>, which happens to not violate Wikipedia naming conventions? Always a plus. But, again, a "suspension" page would allow us to avoid the entire problem and resolve this dispute immediately. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 13:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, move I suppose to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">rustication</a>, not that one often comes across the noun form.

<dd><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Disambig</a> as usual, of course. In fact, I see it's already been done; <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a> is a disambig page pointing to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28academia%29.html" title="Rustication (academia)">Rustication (academia)</a>, which is currently a redirect but could be easily swapped with the page under discussion. I'm sorry, Silence, 'cause you seem kinda worked up about it, but I really don't see a problem. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 22:02, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not worked up about it, just interested; a scholarly, long-winded tone is hard to convey over the Internet, so it may come across as just being frenzied, which is not my intent.&#160;:) Anyway, I illustrated the problem with a disambiguation page above: it's impractical and pointless to have a distinct page for links to the two articles when you could just have the page go directly to one of the articles instead, and provide a link to the other at the top. In this way, the people looking for the other article are no more inconvenienced than they would be by a disambig, and the people looking for this article are much better off! Neutral/win situation. Also, even if we have a disambig page, having it at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a> makes no sense, because Rustication is just a redirect to that page--so why not have the disambiguation page at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a>? So either way, Rustication (disambiguation) will have to go (and it looks like you agree on that at least, I think, and just didn't notice that Rustication is a <i>redirect</i> to a disambig page, not the disambig itself; correct me if I'm wrong), but for the most convenience and to stick with the standard for most Wikipedia articles, we probably shouldn't really have a disambiguation page at all, as they're usually only for when there are more than two or three articles to choose from, or in especially contentious situations where it's totally impossible to pick one over the other to start from. I don't think we're <i>that</i> stuck in the mud here. But anyway, thanks for clarifying! I only asked because I genuinely wasn't sure what your vote was; while you say "Disambig as usual, of course", you're only the second or third of all the people who have voted or commented here to yet say that we need a disambiguation page at all! (The other one I can think of is Uncle G, who's the person who changed the pages recently by moving the former Rustication page to Rustication (architecture) and having Rustication redirect to Rustication (disambiguation), both of which I think are mistakes—the only page that needs to be moved is "Rusticated", everything else worked more or less fine the way it was before this debate.) So it's not as clear-cut as you think. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, I see what you mean. Yes, it's not as clear-cut as I was suggesting. Your suggestion is quite sensible, and I'm sure you can get an admin to do whatever you need to be done. My advice (I've done this): put it on requested moves, wait a couple days to see if you get any votes (you probably won't, I suspect) and then just ask an admin to do it--since nothing with any significant history would be deleted, I'm sure it'll be easy to make happen. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 02:50, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

After all, whatever he does is just normal editing and anyone can change anything he does anyway. From the Talk page I see don't see anything remotely approaching a consensus to delete--I see at least a 2/3 vote to keep it in some form, in fact--and I don't see any strongly held views or overwhelming majorities on how, exactly to do this. Personally, the only situation I would object to is one where we <i>have</i> information about a topic, but a reader who types something reasonable into the Go box doesn't <i>find</i> it. Really, AfD is for discussing whether a page should be deleted. As long as we're here, if we're keeping it's not unreasonable to discuss <i>how</i> to keep it, but there's no reason to put that burden on the closing sysop. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh! Well, I can't really show what my version of the articles looks like because I'm not an Admin; I could change all the article texts, but the history and talk for the page that used to be "Rustication" is currently at "Rustication (architecture)", and I'd need to be able to delete the "Rustication" redirect and move "Rustication (architecture)" there to make the pages functional. If I did it someone else would just have to redo it, in other words. But if anyone doesn't understand an aspect of the page moves I've proposed, I'd be glad to explain, demonstrate, or show examples of similar articles being handled in a similar way.</li>

And, of course, having each article link to the other on the top, rather than wasting readers' time with an extraneous disambiguation page for only two articles, is just common sense.
