<p>I propose that this vote be closed, with a result of KEEP. Counting the votes is tricky given the flipflopping that has gone on, but I make it Keep:36 vs Delete:26, looks like a clear win for keepers, and IMO deletion should always warrant an overwhelming consensus anyway.

<p>If you stalk my habits, then you know I'm not a deletionist by nature. This article was created by an employee of the QuakeAID corporation. The reason I am listing this article is not only because it is vanity/self-promotion, but also because the authenticity of this company has been brought into question.

<li>Interesting comment. How would you provide a link on a page which is intended to be informative as the way that someone can donate to organizations collecting donations for victims of the Indian Ocean tsnumanis? QuakeAID is the only organization that is 100% dedicated to providing relief for victims of earthquakes, and has been doing this since July 1998. Because it has done this from Greece, is perhaps why a number of US-based organizations do not record it. However, believe me, there is a world outside the US. Not all charities are US-based and or US-created. --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My objection to the donation link is that it is essentially a solicitation, requesting that the reader pay money, which is frowned upon in an encyclopedia, even for good causes. My vote to delete was based on my opinion that for any organization, there has to be some evidence that it is somehow noteworthy, that it stands out from others and is generally well-known in its field. Just doing charitable work does not make an organization encyclopedic. And contrary to the stereotype, there are actually lots of people in this country who are aware of the world outside the US, including me. I would vote according to the same policy just as readily to a non-notable American company. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 02:49, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>By elsewhere you mean where? Which authority would satsify the users of this medium? Tax authorities in Greece, where the organization has been pay tax (no tax breaks in Greece) since 1998? --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you should pay attention to that struggle. You are at risk as well. The facts, which I suspect you have not even considered are that QuakeAID registered quakeaid.com through Network Solutions. During the first year of registration, while the amount paid $70 was still *in force*, Netsol allowed and Register.com was able to permit the registration of the domain name by another person (could be one of the people so fervently objecting to QuakeAID's presense here) and despite numerous legal attempts against Netsol, and then the registrant, it has been unable to recover its property. From my perspective, QuakeAID is the victim. --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right. I'm on a personal quest to find facts. Rather than turning this into an opportunity to provide even a glimmer of substantial evidence that QuakeAID done anything more than sucker people out of their hard earned money, you've spent all your time defacing websites, spamming Wikipedia, and name calling, then following it up with misinformation over at the BAOU fakenews central (Official Wire). Meanwhile, I continue to uncover mountain after mountain of documentary evidence of repeated legal problems and disputes related to any organization even remotely affiliated with Greg Lloyd Smith. The fact that you then attempt to spin the story on Official Wire afterwards does you no favors, just as it never has with any of your past disputes. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<i>talk</i>) 06:27, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no disclaimer on that page by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> that says that these links have not been verified.

<li>I don't see that. The NASA page claims to be a search service and describes the QuakeAid as "spider URL." It's not a rating or evaluation any more than Google is.

Absence of a listing means only that the organization has not been investigated. However, these organizations have a wide scope; Charity Navigator in particular has evaluated 3400 charities.

<li><b>Comment</b> The FBI state on Wednesday that "False Web sites have been established that pretend to be legitimate relief organizations asking for donations - one of which contains an embedded Trojan exploit that can infect your computer with a virus if accessed." Under the circumstances, I don't think we should be providing a clickable link to any organization claiming to provide tsunami relief unless it's on a well-vetted list (like the USAID list). The last time I tried to sanitize a link to a dodgy organization—a diploma mill—I was beaten bloody and retired in defeat. <b>Does retaining this article means retaining a clickable link to QuakeAID?</b> Will those who vote "keep" accept the link being tagged "nowiki" or does keeping the article mean keeping a working, intact link? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:49, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:in all of this meandering discssion I have yet to see the QuakeAid or Baoutrust representative offer any evidence about their past contributions to charities, or how they have spent any of the monies they have collected since 1998 in Quake relief. Would the person from QuakeAid care to provide this forum with any links to such evidence? Such a simple action would quickly move this discussion forward, I would think. (Comment left unsigned.)
<ul>
<li>They've been oddly silent. Usually people who try to promote a business or POV, and see the article get NPOVed before their eyes, get quite upset and try to revert or delete the article, often saying they're "withdraw ing their permission" to use the material they contributed under GFDL. Either the QuakeAid people have cut their losses and given up, which is <i>unusually</i> sensible, or just possibly this is the calm before the litigious storm. Rhobite is right: we need to be very careful to keep the article NPOV. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:06, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: This ain't yellow pages, it ain't the guide to helping people who have been earthquaked. We don't give recommendations and endorsements. QuakeAID's domain figured in a WIPO case that set a precedent, which makes it encyclopedic. QuakeAID is, for better or worse, listed as a foreign disaster relief organization by at least one US Federal government agency, which makes it encyclopedic. If you think the content of the entry is bad, perform a cleanup. But this is clearly not a case for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:59, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>What makes something "encyclopaedic" is that it is treated comprehensively in an encyclopaedia. Please don't encourage the use of "encyclopaedic" as a synonym for "notable", because as is clear to anyone who owns a dictionary it isn't one. Actually, check out WordNet: "broad in scope or content". <b>Like it!</b><a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 06:25, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Encyclopedic in the context of Wikipedia is defined at <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">Wikipedia:Encyclopedic</a>.
<dl>
<dd>Yes. A page should have what you'd expect under the title. A subject cannot itself be "encyclopaedic" under that definition.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>You yourself have chided people for using the word "notable" in a context unrelated to individual people. I think my usage here is consistent with Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:24, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I noted that you avoided "notable" by employing what you take to be a synonym. I'm asking you not to because it encourages a reading of "encyclopaedic" that is not borne out by the word's meaning or by our policy. I can only ask, Tony. You're welcome to continue to do it.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 07:57, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">Wikipedia:Encyclopedic</a>: "Articles need to be of sufficient <b>importance</b> to be included in Wikipedia. This policy attempts to define which <i>subjects</i> are suitable for Wikipedia." (<b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> are in the original).</dd>
<dd>My reading of <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">Wikipedia:Encyclopedic</a> is that the <i>subject matter</i> does have a bearing on whether an article is encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Here in VfD we don't (or shouldn't) judge <i>article content</i> so much as whether an <i>article</i> has encyclopedic potential. I disagree that I misuse the term. The encyclopedic criterion <i>does</i> support a more general equivalence of your own restrictive application of the term "notable", although there is rather more to it than a synonym. As a mergist I'm keenly aware that many <i>subjects</i>, while they may have little or no encyclopedic potential, at least for the time being, can be covered very well within <i>articles</i> on more general <i>subjects</i>. VfD is where we make such decisions on an article-by-article basis. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:03, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
