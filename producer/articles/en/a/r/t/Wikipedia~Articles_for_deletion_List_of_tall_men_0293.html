<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The arguments to keep are very poor in comparison with those for deletion. Nobody has succesfully refuted the chief reason for deletion - that the list is subjective and there is no accepted single definition of what to be 'tall' means.

<p>I just know this is going to end in tears, but... The definition of "tall" is completely arbitrary (where is the reliable secondary source for <s>6'3"</s> <s>6'4"</s> 6'5" as being "tall"? - seems to me we just plucked a figure out of the air; originally it was 6'3", then 6'4", then 6'5", then a bit of an edit war). Add to that the fact that the list is completly overwhelmed by basketball players, unsurprisingly, and you have an essentially useless list. You can't find the people who are genuinely notable as having been unsually tall. Tall-for-today is different from tall-for-the-12th-Century; <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a> (Edward Longshanks, no less) was renowned for his height, but these days 6'2" would be unremarkable. It's also crammed full of external links (great for SEO spammers, not so useful for us). Would support retention as a list of people considered unusually tall for their time and/or context, with reliable sources for that, but a 6'5" basketball player is pretty unremarkable, whereas a 6'5" actor is unusual. I could go on but you get the idea: this is essentially a combination of a list of pretty muah <i>all</i> basketball players, a list of men over an arbitrarily selected height (based more on trying to get the numbers down than any realistic external definition), and a very few entries who are genuinely notable for exceptional height, such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Wadlow_1478.html" title="Robert Wadlow">Robert Wadlow</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Addendum, with apologies: a valid point is made below which I failed to take account of. Whatever value we were to come up with as an <i>n</i>th percentile of population height, the values proposed thus far are or appear to be specific to the United States. Here is a list of average heights by country:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Australia: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>Brazil: 5' 6.9", 170cm</dd>
<dd>China: 5' 6", 168cm</dd>
<dd>France: 5' 7.7", 171.9cm</dd>
<dd>Germany: 5' 8.2", 173cm</dd>
<dd>Holland: 6' 1", 185cm</dd>
<dd>Italy: 5' 8.0", 172.8cm</dd>
<dd>Japan: 5' 6", 168cm</dd>
<dd>Sri Lanka: 5' 4.5", 163.9cm</dd>
<dd>Sweden: 5' 8.5", 174cm</dd>
<dd>United Kingdom: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>United States: 5' 10", 178cm</dd>
<dd>Vietnam: 5' 3", 160cm</dd>
</dl>
<p>So: a 6ft Japanese is unusually tall, a 6ft American is completely unremarkable. 6'5" is quite normal for a Dutchman, noticably above average for a Briton (and even there, the average height varies between London and Liverpool or Yorkshire). An average height Dutchman would be a giant in Vietnam. Any list based on any absolute value of height is irredeemably flawed. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yet this list of tall men in on the English wiki, and the people noted on it are almost all from the English speaking world, primarilt the USA and the UK. So it is more of atall man list for these two nations.

<dd>If we could find the 99th percentile of height for the nation with the tallest average height, than limit the list to that, I think we'd be limiting to men who are tall by any standard. That they might be taller by the standard of the Japanese shouldn't be too much of a problem.

<dd>Actually I think the only way it can be fixed is by making it a list of men who have been reliably identified by multiple sources as being exceptionally tall for their occupation, time or country, and where their height forms a significant part of their claim to fame. So we might have the <i>tallest</i> basketball player, Robert Wadlow, Edward I, maybe Andersen. Then all we have to do is show that the selection criteria (men, and being identified as tall) are not arbitrary.

<p><b>Note</b> If you average all those average heights around the world as above average hieght is about 5ft 9. Now I don't know what world everyone is in if you are solid 6 ft 4 inch man walking down a street anyway in the world you will be notably above average. I noticed that in medical books and everything height-weight chart goes up to 6ft 4. However trivial the lists are (beleive me there are more trivial lists on wikipedia( but again a matter of opinion) they do provide statistics. SOurced and everything they look fine as it was before but only limit basketball players to the very fmaous. If you are not interested in the page then just don't visit it -wikipedia caters for thousands of different interests. If you want to be stricter why not change it to List of men over 2 metres? 6f6.5 starting point? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your passion swayed me, as did the fact I had doubts about further restriction from the get go, so I put back those 6 ft 5 to 6 ft 7. The 6 ft 4 people had been removed awhile back as the list was getting too long. The stricter basketball section is getting some complaints though, if not by you perhaps, and I'd considered lowering it to 7 ft and over. The problem is I could find no justification for that. The 221 cm figure was at least based on a site about tallest basketball players. I'd also considered dumping it as an independent section, but I'm not feeling up to that as it'd be a good deal of work. I really shouldn't be here considering I only slept four hours and feel ill.

<li>Twice, actually - the other time was in 2005. And one was a bundled nomination, so it has only really been properly considered once in 2006, back in September. And I don't think you adressed the substantive point either: where is the reliable secondary source for 6'5" being considered tall; what do we do about people who are considered tall by reliable sources but don't meet the 6'5" criterion; what do we do about people who are over 6'5" but not considered remarkably tall as a result (e.g. basketball players)?

<li>It was a bundle with other heighth lists so it was essentially the same. Anyway I don't think I needed to address the substantive point again as I did it the other times. You only can repeat yourself so many times.

<li><b>Delete</b>, exactly per Guy. These lists are completely non-informative, but they provide a wonderful petri dish for the statistics-obsessed to play in.

Everyone who's on this list who's otherwise notable can have their height mentioned on their own article page, and everyone who's notable only for being tall can probably be linked to from <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigantism.html" title="Gigantism">gigantism</a>, or a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_gigantism.html" title="List of people with gigantism">list of people with gigantism</a> can be created <i>if absolutely necessary</i>. With all that considered, it's clear that the encyclopedia loses nothing but a millstone by deleting these articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is true that tall is a relative term, so the article avoids that by objectively listing, with sources, known notable people who have heights in the top of the top percentile. It happens that a lot of basketball players are tall - so what? That's to be expected. The nom's points can be mentioned as controversy in the lead, and you can add a section that lists notable people widely considered to be tall in their respective eras. How likely is it that an SEO spammer has a credible site that contains reliable information about tall men? <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_most_obese_humans.html" title="List of the most obese humans">List of the most obese humans</a> is in poorer condition. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 12:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The current standard is 1.8 inches or around 4 cm above that. This is necessitated by other nations having taller populations and changes in human height over the years. Still 196 cm is likely in a high percentile of human male height, I will look for the 99th percentile of current human male height later.

<li>Your link doesn't establish that any particular percentile is considered "tall". Why that percentile and not another? I'm not asking for you to set the limit as high as you think is reasonable. I'm pointing out that you can't set the limit. You are just choosing arbitrary numbers. Why is the 99th percentile better than the 98th or the 95th or the 64th for example? Who says any one of these particular choices are "tall" and whatever's below is "not tall"? I'm not even asking "why should we believe them" yet, I'm just asking "<b>who</b> says"?

<li>And you're wrong. As the 99th percentile is the highest percentile listed, in most things, it is a logical upper-limit to human height.

<dd>We talked about this on the article talk page, and I understand and appreciate your motivation in wanting the extra adjectives to limit inclusion in the list. And "very tall" <i>would</i> be a psychological deterrent to some otherwise zealous editors. But it's not something that we could actually uphold with any of the policies on Wikipedia. Such an approach would easily be cast aside by the first eager editor who wanted to add their favorite footballer and knew the ins and outs of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. So it's unfortunately unsustainable. I think that Guy's nomination, to simply delete the article, will solve all the problems.

<dd>Halbared, the site you linked to says: "<i>Judging by government safety regulations and industry's standardized sizing, everyone 6ft4 and over is considered statistically irrelevant. When allocating space for car, bus, train and plane passengers, and considering life-jackets or other emergency equipment, people over 6ft4 are ignored completely.</i>" Now, I do not see any external citation of this actually being true, so I'm not going to grant 6' 4" just from this link to a "tall people" website. But, it's a good idea to consider your argument in the abstract. If not 6' 4", there is surely <i>some</i> height that is statistically ignored by government and industry regulators, one can safely expect. However, I do not believe that this hypothetical height is of any use to us in deciphering what "tall" shall mean. Regulators are bound to an economic trade-off. There is a certain height that they will consider economically infeasible to build for, however, this is a market-imposed limitation and it is clear that there is a conflict of interest involved; they could set it higher and take the safety of more people into consideration, but they feel that they can "get away with" writing off these few people and saving a few bucks. I'd be much more receptive to arguments from disinterested scientists who do not have to take profit factoring into account. See where <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Non-scholarly_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Non-scholarly sources</a> warns against "<i>Bias of the originator about the subject—If an author has some reason to be biased, or admits to being biased, this should be taken into account when reporting his or her opinion.</i>" I'm afraid that industry regulation sources cannot be considered <i>reliable</i> sources for our purposes here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 14:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mel, that is an exceptionally good point. Even if we were to apply the <i>n</i>th percentile, that will vary from nation to nation; how do we work out the proportional ethnicity to see if a 6'4" half-Japanese Sumo is unusually tall? Or do we simply build in a criterion that gives an immediate advantage to the Dutch at the expense of the Japanese? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:47, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not "giving an advantage." Being on the list shouldn't be a source of pride, shame, or anything for any nation. If the Dutch have more people in the highest brackett of human height that's just how the statistics break down. However I'm not convinced that's even true. There are far more Japanese people than there are Dutch people in the world and therefore it's probable they have had a greater number of people with gigantism or unusual growth. I found two Japanese people over 6 foot 9 since I started and there are likely more that can be added. <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasutaka_Okayama_2ba3.html" title="Yasutaka Okayama">Yasutaka Okayama</a> is, I believe, taller than any Dutch man on the list.

<dd>"Tall" is a term of comparison. If a person is in the highest bracket available, the 99th percentile, then they are in the highest percentile of "tall" measured. Still if you'd like the standard could be raised further. The Italian Wikipedias version of the list has 201 centimeters while the Dutch has 229 cm. These are perhaps overly strict, but I did not find a deletion history for either so they apparently work by being so.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We don't keep lists where the standards for inclusion amount to original research and personal opinion or that would be too large and diffuse if populated accordingly.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a sourced and encyclopedic list. But 99th percentile is a silly limit, since if there are about 3 billion men in world 1% or 30,000,000 would be eligible for the list. Some people have had stub articles created just so they are "notable" and could go on the list. I would say keep it, but raise the bar to perhaps 2 meters = 6feet6.5 inches. An American man at 6'3" or 6'5" would never stand out in a crowd. Common as dirt. And there is no reason to have a different standard for each country.

<li>At least twice, it is claimed that the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Of the seven actions listed there that qualify as original research, the fourth--"It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms"--is relevant to this discussion. However, equating 6'3", 6'5", 6'7", etc. with <i>tall</i> is surely not an original idea--it has been done before, it will be done in the future. Any given cut-off point for <i>tall</i> is not original research; it is simply arbitrary. For a person, tall is defined as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" rel="nofollow">having a vertical extent greater than average</a>". So, if the average height in the United States is 5'10", then someone who is 5'11" is tall (when considered at the level of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>). Since Wikipedia should not be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward any particular nation(s), it seems to make sense to define "tall" in terms of the average global height.</li>
<li>However, a definition of <i>tall</i> that includes 50% - 1 of the population of the world (same applies if it's just a country, city, village, etc.) would make the list useless (or, at the least, VERY incomplete). For that reason, it makes sense to use a high percentile, like 99% or 99.5% or 99.9%. Yes, it is arbitrary! No, it's not original research! In many of the social sciences, results are considered statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. It's an arbitrary choice, but one that is used by <b>consensus</b>. Just because a cut-off point is arbitrary, does not mean it is not useful. I think this could work if the first line of the article specifies something of the sort: "This is a list of men who, in terms of their height, are in the 99th (or some other number) percentile globally".</li>
<li>Finally, and this strays from this AfD somewhat, if the list is kept, perhaps it should include only individuals who currently have articles on WP. Again, it's an arbitrary inclusion criteria, but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as that criterion is reached through consensus. Also, this would address the concern raised in the comment above by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">User:Edison</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I originally had no particular interest in this article or its AfD, but felt compelled to write this lengthy comment after seeing the reasons for the proposed deletion. To any inclusion criterion, there is (almost) always an alternative. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28people%29_789e.html" title="WP:Notability (people)">notability guideline for biographies</a> is only one of many that could exist. However, it specifies an <b>objective</b> criterion for inclusion ("primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.") and has <b>consensus</b> support. I think this issue should be discussed in the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, refangle, source with reliable sources describing the people as "tall" (then it's both accurate and varifiable). Perhaps rename to "List of notable people above the 99th percentile of height" or "List of notable people who have been described as tall" or somesuch cludgy name if the name is the key objection.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The most common reason for deletion I'm seeing is that any inclusion criterion for the article would be "arbitrary". However, all you really mean by that is that there are a great many alternatives. <b>So what?!?!</b> In that sense, every WP policy and guideline is <i>arbitrary</i>, as there are many possible alternatives to them. For example, instead of not allowing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, WP could allow it. There is nothing wrong with an arbitrary criterion for inclusion, as long as it is reached by <b>consensus</b> on the article's talk page. So far, such a discussion (to establish consensus) has not taken place.

Height is a relative quality, but being among the tallest individuals ever is a historic feat, and worthy of inclusion in a list. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilliam_7bdc.html" title="User:Gilliam">Gilliam</a> 04:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Trim out anyone who just happens to be tall and leave only those forwhom we have independant sources stating that they are/were considered notably tall in their day. If that can't be done, then <b>delete</b>. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 08:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, no matter what "keep" rationales are provided, the fact remains that this is a subjective list, and thus is unsuitable for inclusion as its very existence requires <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 12:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand arguments like this. Average height is verifiable. So is everyone's height in this article. Original research was not involved. The act of carefully and continously re-evaluating whether or not include a piece of information in an article (in this case debating a cut-off height) is very different from what we know as "original research." Using discretion and building consensus and particiapting in the gradual evolution of what each article should and should not cover is a good thing. What you call "subjectivity" is the stuff of building a good article. The article only becomes inappropriate if we start filling it with POV statements; unsourced, unverified or libelous material and idle speculation.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 15:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep as it was before'</b> <b>As the page is now delete</b> I can't believe you all wasting your life debating something which doesn't really matter. Who cares if a Vietnamese guy thinks 6 ft 2 is a giant and a Dutchman thinks it is a midget? I don't know what world you are in but if you walk down the street in any country at 6 ft 4 inches you are going to be way above average height. You are all missing the point. The list as it is now is rubbish who cares about the basketball players? . If the list stays as it is now delete. It was absolutely fine before! 6 ft 4 is a clear starting point in any place even average height in Holand is about 6'1. The list was intended to note the people in the public eye well renowned who are notable for being tall. Forget most basketball players unless they are well over 7 feet. All I know is that a lot of people have put a lot of time into it and found citations and it does provide information.<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 13:39, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought the changes I made helped make it more certain that the people listed have a tallness that is significant to their fame or notability. It also is the standard at Italian Wikis version, but still lower than the Dutch standard, so I thought that could give some consistency. If the current standard is objectionable it can be reverted fairly easily.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deletion nominators are relentless.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wish to draw a parallel between this frequently maligned list and the magnificent article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unusual_deaths.html" title="List of unusual deaths">List of unusual deaths</a>, another frequent target for casually destructive deletion hawks. I would sound ridiculous if I were to enter an afd debate for the deaths article shouting in a condescending tone, "but what does <i>unusual</i> really mean? Isn't that <i>subjective</i>? I know all you idiots find this article <i>interesting</i> (please refer to the set-in-stone policy <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>), but unfortunately, what one group of people might consider unusual might appear ordinary to another. This article has to go, no matter how well sourced it becomes." In cases like this, whining that a certain adjective must have a precise, independetly verified definition arrived at through scientific rigor is a fruitless semantic exercise, inimical to the subjective nature of language itself. NOR applies to "new definitions of pre-existing terms;" it does not preclude the variable, reasonable interpretation of very common adjectives. Trust people to build consensus; they'll decide what tall means, and the meaning will fluctuate from time to time, as well it should.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 15:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Almost a model list since it sets rational parameters and requires references for inclusion. The nom calls this list "useless", but then goes on to make numerous suggestions for improving the content and/or approach. His ideas on the subject should have been proposed on the article talk page - the proper place to hash out editorial issues. Instead, here we are examining the same article for the fourth time. Since even the nom admits that the subject is valid (but apparently doesn't like basketball players), there is no good policy reason to delete and none has been suggested in the nomination. AfD is not clean-up and "I don't like it" is not a valid argument for deletion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
