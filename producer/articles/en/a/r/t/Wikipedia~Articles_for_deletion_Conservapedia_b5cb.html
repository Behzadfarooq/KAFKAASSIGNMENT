<li><b>Keep for now:</b> Maybe raise another AfD later depending on how it progresses and delete it then if need be. They just got going about three weeks ago. They have 1500 articles, which is small, but not insignificant. I think Wikipedia should extend the benefit of doubt to competitors, in the spirit of fairness. Wikipedia will not suffer from a little competition, especially since they are avowedly Christian and have two flaws: one, they are biased and non-neutral point of view; two, they do not have an adequate means of filtering since they are very accepting of just about any kind of edit (may change later). It is so new that no third parties can be expected to have written about it, but they have potential. Technically it may fail on the Web criterion for the moment, but it is verified: it does exist and it is growing. The Conflict of Interest / Vanity charge is bogus, but even though I advocate keeping for now, we must still edit the article stringently, as I have been. So I say, relax the keep/delete criteria in their favor, but scrutinize a little more carefully in compensation. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 05:32, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; the seven Google hits don't persuade me of its being "very well known" -- quite the contrary. If it becomes famous and covered in reliable third-party sources at a later date, <b>then</b> is the time to have an article on it. Only three of those Google hits are neither on Wikipedia nor Conservapedia itself. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Antandrus, I have a question for you. Is there a Wikipedia policy that states that <i>Google</i> is the designated gauge of how well known a site is? The site is only two or three months old... how many Google hits do you expect? Last time I checked, Conservapedia had 81 users, which is not bad on the scale of things. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVeniVidiVici007_8a0a.html" title="User:VeniVidiVici007">VeniVidiVici007</a> 05:44, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a "policy" -- it's basically common sense. Conservapedia is <i>not</i> well known by any measure, except maybe to you and a few home-schooled kids. Hey, I wish you well building it, but we don't exist to help you attain notability. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well... I say it is well known, now what? It all depends on what you consider "well-known." I suggest we go with Hu's idea and give the site more time to become "well-known." <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVeniVidiVici007_8a0a.html" title="User:VeniVidiVici007">VeniVidiVici007</a> 06:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"I say it is well known" is not a valid keep reason. Please read <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_assertion.html" title="Proof by assertion">proof by assertion</a>. We go on Wikipedia policy and guideline for our keep/delete decision, and the applicable policy/guideline here is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 16:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is an abuse to demand "speedy delete" for political reasons. Conservapedia has obvious importance as an alternative source of information from a conservative perspective. With 1500 entries in a short period of time, conservapedia is clearly successful and growing quickly. There are many entries on Wikipedia that are less significant yet do not hear calls for speedy deletion. Let's be fair about this. Andysch 06:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch
<ul>
<li>How would you describe the process by which the article on <a href="../../../o/n/a/Onan.html" title="Onan">Onan</a> was recently deleted from Conservapedia? I would call it "speedy deletion."

<li>You are free to nominate any article for deletion that you feel do not meet Wikipedia criteria for retention, Andysch. You can do it carefully following the three step AfD tagging process, or you can get someone else who agrees with you to do it for you, though it is not difficult. Use it with care, but feel free to use it where you have read the relevant Wikipedia policy pages and feel that an article meets the criteria for deletion.

<li><b>Comment:</b> the demands to censor this entry illustrates how Wikipedia has changed from its original purpose. This entry is factual, useful and obviously noteworthy, as demonstrated by the many comments here. Yet some don't like this entry for political reasons, and demand it be removed. If it is removed, the only question will be this: how many other sites have similarly been removed or censored on Wikipedia for political reasons??? Alternative sites may be the only way to combat this type of censorship. Andysch 15:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch

<li>The article, as you and your allies wrote it, was full of promotional adjectives and at least one factual error. I spent a little time editing it down to a more factual presentation. I also took time to advise you on some policy pages to read, but you have given no indication that you have digested or absorbed them, or even read them. The article is not being censored. You are new users here, and you don't understand yet as well as the other conservatives who are more experienced on Wikipedia, that Neutral Point of View is the controlling philosophy here and it works. Wikipedia policies and processes like this AfD have been hammered out over years and with thousands of discussions and participants. They are robust and effective and neutral. You need to get up to the level of understanding of the other conservatives here because your claims of censorship and political bias don't hold water. It used to be that conservatives would see a "red under every bed" (communist). Now they sometimes see a censor behind every web page. Both views are nonsensical. Wikipedia has articles on conservative sites <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Green_Footballs_498d.html" title="Little Green Footballs">Little Green Footballs</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a>. The Conservapedia article does technically fail the notability requirements, but I have argued on your behalf that it deserves a relaxed interpretation of the rules. I suggest that you try to adopt christian humility and Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume Good Faith policy</a> (which is christian and conservative, when you think about it, though not limited to those orientations) and have the good grace to not question people's motives here. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 16:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The reasons cited here for immediately deleting "conservapedia" are pretextual. Those same reasons would require deleting tens of thousands of other Wikipedia entries. But those demanding deletion of this entry do not complain in the same way about the other entries. Instead, they demand that this particular entry be deleted. Simply put, nothing except political bias justifies defacing this entry with the "speedy delete" notice. This entry is not defamatory or offensive and it is obviously noteworthy and useful to many people. The lengthy debate here is strong evidence that the entry should remain. It will receive far more visits than tens of thousands of other entries that remain. Andysch 18:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch

<li><b>Reply</b> to Andysch: Possibly you should read through that article I linked right before your comment, Andysch. 1) re: "Those same reasons would require deleting tens of thousands of other Wikipedia entries" is only an argument that there are many other Wikipedia entries that may need to be deleted, not an argument to keep this one if it fails to meet wikipedia's criteria. 2) The reason this "particular entry" is being debated is because someone looked at it, believed it was inappropriate, and brought it here. Dozens of other articles every day have this happen to them, and those do not involve politics so there is no need to do anything but assume good faith. 3) "it is obviously noteworthy": if it were obvious, there would be no debate. Don't assert it, prove it. The comments of a small handful of individuals does not make a website notable. Verifiable proof, in the form of reliable secondary sources, is what makes it notable. It is NOT obvious as the article currently exists. If you wish it to be obvious to those of us voting for deletion, find the evidence to support that, don't state it as rhetorical argument. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 20:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not post the original entry "Conservapedia" here. But the defect to the citations above to numerous policies (like many regulations) is that enforcement becomes selective and biased. I've helped many criminal defendants against arbitrary enforcement of laws and know well the potential for abuse. Regardless, the above comments indicate that Wikipedia has become a tool for bullying, which is the opposite of its original purpose. I contributed to Wikipedia entries years ago when it was a voice for those outside of the mainstream. Sadly, Wikipedia has been taken over by bullies. Andysch 17:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)andysch
<ul>
<li>Fact is, Wikipedia has a deliberative process that is <b>not</b> bullying. By contrast, if someone edits the Conservapedia Evolution page to indicate that the "theory" is well-established science, just like gravity, though well-established, is a "theory", the bullies at Conservapedia will delete it post-haste, without discussion or justification, because not only does it not fit their faith-based agenda, but there is no place on that site for anything else. By contrast, Wikipedia has an extensive series on so-called Intelligent Design, even though it is way outside of science and the mainstream. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 17:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hu, you have truly stated that on conservapedia.com an entry claiming that evolution is a well supported and well established fact was deleted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> just as a reply to the hipocracy (sic) argument: I believe this point has been made a few times in this discussion, which confuses me. Hundreds of articles are nominated for deletion every week, and a large percentage of them are deleted upon discussion. Quite often the reasons for deletion are the same ones being argued here, which means there is no hypocrisy, only an ongoing consistent policy which is currently being applied to this article. The only other point you seem to be making is "the article is more worthwhile than..." which is, by definition, a subjective view completely at odds with wikipedia's policies on maintaining a neutral point of view.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>::: OK, here's the thing. You say that Wikipedia is unbiased because it contains material that would satisfy a "faith-based" person. But having the article doesn't invalidate a biased report. The content may be very biased. And, Conservapedia does, in fact, welcome established science in its articles. Then you might be asking why we deleted the phrase describing evolution as a scientific theory. Well the reason is very simple. That phrase did not meet the requirements of a well-supported statement. Based on solid scientific fact, the "theory" of evolution is just an accepted hypothesis.
