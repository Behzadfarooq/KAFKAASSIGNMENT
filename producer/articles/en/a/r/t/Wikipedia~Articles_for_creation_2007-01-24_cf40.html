Andy Smetanka is a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missoula.html" title="Missoula">Missoula</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a>-based writer and filmaker who has created work for the Decemberists, Volumen, the Fireballs of Freedom and Le Force. His animation style employs a vintage <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> "Kvartz" 8-milimeter camera, and largely hand-made paper images, figures and backgrounds.</p>
<p>According to newwest.net, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/13814/C8/L8/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/13814/C8/L8/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Smetanka's animation work is inspired by Lotte Reiniger's work of the early 1900's.</p>
<p>Smetanka co-founded the Missoula hardcore punk band Humpy, formerly edited the "Shat Upon" fanzine, is a graduate of the University of Montana and former Arts Editor for the weekly Missoula Independent newspaper. He helped to bring Volumen, an independent rock band from Missoula, to eastern Europe in 2003 and later designed their album cover for their 2006 release "Science Faction".</p>

<p>SUPERPOP is an unidentified anomality seen in IRC channels. It has been suspected to be a bot or virus. Username SUPERPOP started to emerge IRCnet and QUAKEnet servers sometime november 2006. SUPERPOP is not hazard bot or virus but it is annoying. SUPERPOP has been seen doing some different acts, the typical one being entering into a IRC channel and posting "SUPERPOP SAYS OWNED PWENED!!" and/or "SUPERPOP SAYS OWNED HACKED!!" in several different languages, usually English, Portugese, Greek or Korean. Sometimes it floods a channel by joining in with multiple identities by adding numbers after username (like SUPERPOP57) and creating some 10-100 nicks, but in this case posting to channel havent been noticed. The anomality leaves a channel after posting or idling minute or two. Once entered into a particular channel it reappears randomly, usually few times a week. SUPERPOP seems mostly login through a Dutch based internet service provider XS4all.net using random ip adresses, but it's been seen connected from various IP adresses tracerouted around the world.</p>

He has left a mark on the earth that will not be erased and simply refuses to lose, not many have come before him and not many will come after he is truly a unique and dominate individual.</p>

<p>Lodreth Gaft (born 1964) is a Lithuanian-born writer associated with various national liberation movements in the former Soviet Union in the years leading up to the Soviet Union's collapse. He first gained national fame in 1988 as an outspoken critic of Soviet political leadership and a radical proponent of Lithuanian indepedence, and was considered, for a time, a prominent leader within the progressive Sąjūdis (Reform Movement of Lithuania) (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Persitvarkymo Sąjūdis). He was later accused of transporting arms to a radical sect of the Popular Front of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Tautas Fronte), and, at the behest of Soviet authorities, was imprisoned in Latvia in the early months of 1991. Gaft was released shortly after Latvia officially gained independence in August of 1991. He later relocated to Cali, Colombia, where in 1997 he published his first novel, Subversión Política de los Invertebrados. In 1999 he moved to Havana, Cuba to study linguistics, and returned to Colombia in 2002 before publishing his second novel, La Distribución de Locura Civilizada. Gaft's mother (Olivia Rafuls Pineda) was a Cuban nurse sent to Vilnius under a Cuban-Soviet medical exchange program. His father (Jurgis Gaft) was a primary and secondary school teacher. Both parents died in 1985. Gaft does not have any siblings.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Balinese Art is of Hindu-Javanese origin that grew out from the artisans of the Majapahit Kingdom with their expansion to Bali in late 13th century. Since then, Ubud and its neighboring villages have been the center of arts. Ubud and Batuan are known for their paintings, Mas for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silver smiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.</p>
<p>Prior to 1920s, Balinese traditional paintings were restricted to what is now known as the Kamasan or Wayang style. It is a visual narrative of Hindu-Javanese epics: the Ramayana and Mahabharata. These two-dimentional drawings are traditionally drawn on cloth or bark paper (Ulantaga paper) with natural dyes. The coloring is limited to available natural dyes: red, ochre, black, etc. In addition, the rendering of the figures and ornamentations must follow strictly prescribed rules, since they are mostly produced for religious articles and temple hangings. These paintings are produced collaboratively, and therefore mostly anonynous.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave, similar to Tahiti for Paul Gaugain, for avant-garde artists such as Walter Spies (german), Rudolf Bonnet (dutch), Le Mayeur (belgian) to Arie Smith (dutch) and Donald Friend (australian) in the recent years. In addtion to many artists, Bali has attracted world famous anthropologists from Stutterheim (dutch) to Gregory Bateson and Margeret Mead (american). It was during their stay in Bali in mid 1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan.</p>
<p>Among the western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernisation of the traditional Balinese paintings. They provided painting media and introduced western painting concepts, such as picture and color composition and human anatomy. More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging individual freedom of expression to break out from the confining traditional Balinese painting tradition. The results were the explosion of individual expression that lead to the birth of the neo-traditional Balinese paintings. The Ubud painters embraced it with the most courage and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The modernization took the forms of: (1) shifting of the subject matter from the narration of religious epics to the depiction of daily Bali life and drama; (2) changing the patron from the religious temples and royal houses to western tourists/collectors; (3) shifting the picture composition from multiple to single focus. The latter is more evident in the works of Ubud artists.</p>
<p>Despite the adoption of modern western painting tradition by many Balinese and Indonesian painters, the neo-traditional Balinese painting tradition is still thriving and continued by decedents/students of the artists of the pre-war modernist era (1928-1942)</p>
<p>The schools of neo-traditional balinese painting include: Ubud, Batuan, Sanur, Young Artist and Keliki school of painting.</p>
<p><b>Ubud Painting</b> Ubud has been the center of art for centuries with the surrounding royal houses and temples as the main patron. Prior to 1920s, traditional wayang style paintings dominated the subject matters, although Jean Couteau (1999) believes that both secular and religious theme paintings have long been co-existing as unitity of the opposites (Rwabhinneda in Balinese belief system).</p>
<p>It was not until the late 1920s that this balance was tiltled toward secular art by the arrival of western artists such as Covarubias, Le Mayeur de Mepres, Theo Meier, Walter Spies and Rudolf Bonnet. The last two artists were often credited as the agents of change that brought Balinese Art to modernity. Their influence culminated with the founding of Pitamaha Art Guild in 1936, with Tjokorda Raka Sukawati as one of the founders.Its mission was to preserve the quality of Balinese Art in the rush of tourism to Bali. The board members of Pitamaha met regularly to select painting submitted by its members and conducted exhibitions throughout Indonesia and abroad. Pitamaha was active until the beginning of the second world war in 1942.</p>
<p>The influence of Bonnet and Spies were most welcome and flourished in Ubud, and naturally Ubud artists were most influenced by them. The subject matters shifted from religious narration to Balinese daily life capturing every aspect of ordinary life in Bali. Ubud artists who were members to Pitamaha came from Ubud and its surrounding villages; Pengosekan, Peliatan and Tebasaya. Among them were: Ida Bagus Made Kembeng of the village of Tebesaya and his three sons -- Ida Bagus Wiri, Ida Bagus Made and Ida Bagus Belawa; Tjokorda Oka of the royal house of Peliatan; I Dewa Sobrat, I Dewa Meregeg, I Dewa Putu Bedil, I Dewa Dana of Padangtegal; I Gusti Ketut Kobot, I Gusti Made Baret, I Wayan Gedot of Pengosekan; and I Gusti Nyoman Lempad.</p>
<p>The spirit of Pitamaha is well preserved by the decendents of these artists. The contemporary Ubudian artists include I Ketut Budiana, I Nyoman Meja, I Nyoman Kayun, A.A. Gde Anom Sukawati, I Gusti Agung Wiranata, Ida Bagus Sena, and many others.</p>
<p><b>Batuan Painting</b> Batuan school of painting is practiced by brahman artists in the village of Batuan, situated ten kilometers to the South of Ubud. The Batuan artisan are gifted dancers, sculptors and painters. Major Batuan artists from the pre-modernist era were I Dewa Njoman Mura (1877-1950) and I Dewa Putu Kebes (1874-1962) who were known as sanging; traditional Wayang style painters for temples ceremonial textiles.</p>
<p>The western influence in Batuan did not reach the intensity it had in Ubud. According to Claire Holt, the Batuan paintings were often sultry, crowded representations of either legendary scenes or themes from daily life, but they portrayed above all that fearsome nocturnal moment when grotesque spooks, freakish animal monsters, and witches acoosted people. This is particularly true for paintings collected by Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson during their field studies in Bali in 1936 to 1939. Gradient of black to white ink washes laid over most of the surface so as to create an atmosphere of darkness and gloom. In the later years, the design covers the entire space that often attributed to the crowdedness of their paintings.</p>
<p>Among early Batuan artists were I Ngendon (1903-1946) who is considered as the most innovative Batuan School painter. Ngendon was not only a good painter, but also a shrewd business man and a political activist. He encouraged and mobilized his neighbours and friends to paint for tourist consumption. The major Batuan artists from this period were I Patera (1900-1935), I Tombos (b. 1917), Ida Bagus Togog (1913-1989), Ida Bagus Made Jatasura (1917-1946), Ida Bagus Ketut Diding (1914-1990), I made Djata (1920-2001), and Ida Bagus Widja (1912-1992).</p>
<p>The spirit of Pitamaha period is still strong and continued by the contemporary Batuan Artists such as I Made Budi, I Nyoman Bendi, I Ketut Murtika, and many others.</p>
<p><b>Sanur Painting</b> On his first visit to Bali in 1930, the Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias noted that local paintings served primarily religious or ceremonial functions. They were used as decorative cloths to be hung in temples and important houses, or as calendars to determine children's horoscopes. Yet within a few years, he found the art form had undergone a "liberating revolution." Where they had once been severely restricted by subject (mainly episodes from Hindu mythology) and style, Balinese artists began to produce scenes from rural life. What's more, these painters developed increasing individuality.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including Charlie Chaplin and the anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. Much of the buzz emanated from three villages: Ubud, where Spies settled, Sanur on the southern coast, and Batuan, a traditional hub of musicians, dancers, carvers and painters. The artists painted mostly on paper, though canvas and board were also used. Often, the works featured repetitive clusters of stylized foliage or waves that conveyed a sense of texture, even perspective. Each village evolved a style of its own. Ubud artists made more use of open spaces and emphasized human figures. Sanur paintings often featured erotic scenes and animals, and work from Batuan was less colorful but tended to be more "busy.</p>
<p>Sanur school of painting is the most stylized and decorative among all modern Balinese Art. It features animal kingdom often drawn in an Escher's like manner.</p>
<p>Major artists from Sanur are I Rundu, Ida Bagus Nyoman Rai, I Soekarja, I Poegoeg, I Rudin, and many others.</p>

<p><b>Young Artist Painting</b> or much of the late 40's and 1950's Indonesia as a whole laid aside art for politics. But a new burst of creative energy came to Bali in the 1960's in the form of Dutch painter Arie Smit (1916-).</p>
<p>The story is that Smit, while visiting Bali, was walking through a stretch of countryside near the village of Campuan when he happened upon a group of boys drawing in the sand. He was impressed by their talent and invited them to his studio, where they promptly became his students. Smit gave them the material they needs, taught technique, but was careful not to make suggestions about content or color. And he did not let them see his own painting.</p>
<p>Smit had come to Indonesia as a Dutch soldier and stayed on Java after independence. Among other things, he taught art and drawing at a university in Bandung. In 1951 he applied for Indonesian citizenship to keep from being expelled from the country. He first visited Bali in 1956.</p>
<p>The Young Artists Movement which developed from Smit's students was a lively, sometimes humorous, genre with color and line characteristics which, while unique within the history of Balinese art, remained essentially Balinese. At its height, the movement probably included between 300 and 400 artists.</p>
<p>The Young Artists Movement has been given mixed reviews by history. Smit distanced himself from it in order to allow the Balinese he'd taught to stand (or fall) on the merits of their own arts. Smit himself went on to an outstanding artistic career in Bali.</p>

<p>GYPSOPHILE began life in the mid-90s as Guillaume Belhomme's very continental (and very French) answer to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bossa.html" title="Bossa">bossa</a> influenced pop of 60s A&amp;M acts like Chris Montez, Pisano &amp; Ruff, and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudine_Longet_2915.html" title="Claudine Longet">Claudine Longet</a>, and of his then contemporaries Blueboy. From 2001's De loin, les choses onwards, Gypsophile has been charting new, twilit territory: somewhere between <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical.html" title="Classical">classical</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk.html" title="Folk">folk</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>. Whether you prefer the earlier or the later work, it's all soft vocals and late night atmosphere: slip this on when you and your friends have pushed the dinner dishes aside, dimmed the lights and opened another bottle...

<p>Tjärnö Marine Biological Laboratory (TMBL) was founded as a field station for university education in marine biology in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. During the first half of 1970ies TMBL became manned all the year round and scientists began to choose TMBL for their permanent place of work. The activities have expanded and diversified. 75 people now work at TMBL.</p>

<p>Within 10 minutes by boat lies the Koster fjord, a 247 meter deep fissure fault between the Koster Islands and the mainland. It is in deep-water contact with the remaining <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skagerrak.html" title="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> beyond, leading to oceanic salinity, 35 ‰, in the bottom water. This is the only true oceanic environment in Sweden, with the highest number of marine species in Sweden. Between 5000 and 10000 species are to be found in the Skagerrak, and more than 200 of them do not occur elsewhere in Swedish waters. For instance, cold water reefs of stony corals could be found.</p>
<p>Annually, about 500 university students, mainly from Göteborg and Stockholm, attend courses at TMBL, lasting from one week to one term. A large proportion of the education is devoted to identification of marine algal and animal species. Other courses are more concerned with ecology, including training in experiments and investigations. Field education, on research vessels, in smaller boats and at the shore, are common.</p>
<p>The major research programs are directed towards marine ecology, presented under six programs – marine chemical ecology, evolution and genetics, biodiversity, biohydrodynamics, fishery biology and aquaculture, and integrated coastal zone management. Most scientists at TMBL belong to the Department of Marine Ecology, Göteborg University.</p>
<p>TMBL is a resource for regional industry, decision-makers and authorities, and gives support for the development of research-based marine innovations and business projects.</p>
<p>At TMBL anyone can book guided tours and beach excursions. During summer season the public also can visit the aquarium, listen to popular science lectures and participate in excursions with research vessel.</p>

<p>Dana L. French is a prominent U.S. computer scientist working in the fields of business continuity, disaster recovery, and high availability. He has designed and written numerous software packages to automate the processes of disaster recovery and high availability. He is most noted for his approach to system administration as an automated process, rather than an interactive one. His work as a programmer and system administrator has influenced the design and implementation of Unix systems in organizations all over the world and is the source of the commonly used phrase "enterprise wide unique". His business function approach to system administration has caused a global shift in the way Unix system administrators perform their work.</p>
<p>He operates several companies that specilize in providing business continuity services to large world wide organizations. These companies provide services that include consulting, disaster recovery facilities, application and business function hosting.</p>
<p>French is well known in the Unix community for his advanced shell programming skills and is a noted advocate of Korn Shell programming. He provides source code for most of his programming work on-line free of charge. One of his most well known shell libraries is "shell curses", which is a shell script implementation of the "C" language "Curses" library. Another is "kshSQL" which is a Korn Shell implementation of a complete SQL database system. French is also the author of "shunix", which is a project to implement all of the GNU Unix utilities entirely in shell script code.</p>
<p>French is also well known as providing a MicroEMACS binary executable repository for a very wide variety of operating systems. Linus Torvalds, the developer of linux and notable MicroEMACS user, is known to frequent this site. French has provided continuous access to this repository since 1995.</p>

<p>Bong Oil is often disputed between 'stoners' over it's taste and effects. Some believe it to be very much unintended for recreational use, and should be disposed of in the bong cleaning process. However, there are a minority who smoke it; for the purposes of those who are interested in this process, it will be detailed here:</p>
<p>The Gaining of Bong Oil</p>
<p>Essentially, bong oil can be recognised easily by the quite disgusting look of it. It is found in the cone-piece, but the more disgusting and/or hardcore substance is found in the downpipe. Traditionally, these substances are put into a spliff, though they may also be used in a bong. Both methods result in a pretty shady smoke. The methods of getting these substances out are much to the users content, though it has been known for people to pour the extremely putrid bong water through the downpipe, and gain substance like that.</p>
<p>IT MUST BE MADE KNOWN TO ALL INTERESTED, THIS LOW FORM OF CANNABIS IS NOT GOOD FOR ONE'S HEALTH.</p>

<p>Jonester is mainly aimed at college students by offering them chatrooms, discussion forums, personals, classifieds, and events. Another great thing is the features on the site are focused only on the users college/university he/she is attending. Allowing them to connect with students on their campus.</p>
<p>Currently the site is available only to United States college/universities. But soon the website will be available to Puerto Rico and Great Britain. And eventually, the entire world.</p>

<p>I am the founder/CEO/developer of the site. So I don't really need a source, because I am the only one behind the site.</p>
