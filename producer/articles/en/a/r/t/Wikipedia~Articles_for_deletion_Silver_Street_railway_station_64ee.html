<p>I used this railway station recently, and I can tell you from direct first-hand personal experience there is nothing notable or even interesting about it at all. It's bad enough we have to have articles about every non-notable pokemon, school, etc. Maybe we'll at least be able to get rid of the non-notable stations. After all, the only people who'll miss them are the trainspotters... <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 1 July 2005 12:21 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Ok, let's delete some articles about non-notable subway stations too. Seriously. What is it about the completist nature of some Wikipedians that makes them want to iclude articles on <i>every</i> subway station, <i>every</i> Pokemon, <i>every</i> river, etc. instead of only the best, most important, most notable ones??? <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 1 July 2005 12:49 (UTC)

<li>For starters, the phrases "Wikipedia is not paper" and "If it's notable and has had an impact on a few thousand people, it's probably in our encyclopedia's domain. That's not to say we lack mainstream topics you'll find in Britannica, World Book, and Encarta. We generally meet or exceed their quality on those subjects. It's just we like to have a little bit of fun at the end of the day." <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 1 July 2005 13:22 (UTC)

<li>I've never understood that argument. I'd gladly delete articles on some "mainstream topics you'll find in Britannica, World Book, and Encarta" too. e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_b611.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV of the United Kingdom</a> was a pretty non-notable monarch, and no-one would really miss him if we deleted his article. The only I haven't nominated him is that I <i>know</i> that the completists would all vote to keep him and I'd lose. OTOH Silver Street station is such a dump that I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to keep it based on its own merits. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 1 July 2005 13:50 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment:</i> You see, to the dogmatic hyperpreservationists, "merits" are irrelevant. Only existence (or the possibility of existence: they're not big on verifiability either) matters.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I can buy the idea of some people wanting to delete a railway station article--perhaps one could argue that they're not that interesting to anybody--but I find that suggestion of deleting <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_b611.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV of the United Kingdom</a> utterly baffling. Don't read it if you don't find it interesting, but why delete it? It defies reason. That goes beyond the parameters of the inclusionist/deletionist framework, I should hope we'd all agree that William IV is not deletion material by any stretch of the imagination. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 3 July 2005 14:18 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Because William IV was <i>not</i> one of the most notable kings of the United Kingdom. I'd like Wikipedia to have articles on <i>only</i> the most notable Kings, <i>only</i> the most notable stations, <i>only</i> the most notable Pokemons, <i>only</i> the most notable schools, etc. Having articles about inferior kings, inferior schools, inferior Pokemons, etc. makes Wikipedia inferior. And you don't want that do you? <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 4 July 2005 10:21 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well this is where the problem begins. You say that William IV was "not one of the most notable kings of the United Kingdom." Leaving aside the question of whether a monarch is intrinsically notable (I think most people would concede that this is the case) you are stating <i>your</i> judgement of whether or not William was notable. And yet the article itself tells us all about his active role in walking into the House of Lords in the middle of a debate and proroguing Parliament in 1831. And in 1834 he became the last monarch to appoint a Prime Minister against the will of Parliament, when he chose the Tory Robert Peel to govern with a Parliament having a Whig majority. And you say this guy isn't notable? Surely some mistake! --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 4 July 2005 19:20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>CoMmEnT</b> Yeah, the reason why every one wants to include every single school, train station, antique shop, fire hydrant, street sign, every song ever recorded, every business, company, corporation, every single insect in the world right now, every video game ever produced, every product ever manufactured, every building in which that product was manufactured, the definition of manufacture, the latin root for hand, every history about nothing, is because many wikipedia contributors lack topics to write about thus including non-notable things with the argument of inclusionism gives them that opportunity to contribute just like they see everyone else doing.

<li><b>Keep</b>; people look up railway stations in encyclopaedias.

<li><b>Keep</b> valid article of interest to some people even if they are trainspotters as P Ingerson dismisses them as. As a so-called completionist, I think that it is good that Wikipedia is becoming a comprehensive reference work as was initially intended. The concept that P Ingerson would delete what he describes as obscure kings and queens is deletionism taken to the nth degree and would be a ludicrous policy for any work aspiring to be an encyclopedia. Either we want to be a thorough reference work or we don't - if we don't then I will find other things to do with my time. As for RickK, his leaving had nothing to do with votes for deletion but was a dummy spit after he was blocked for 24 hours for breaking the 3-revert rule. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 1 July 2005 23:48 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> That's nonsense! To be the best, most notable encyclopaedia, we should <i>only</i> have articles on the best, most notable subjects. Otherwise what's the point?

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've got nothing against railway stations in general, even the ones that I've used. For example, I'm proud to have contributed to the article on <a href="../../../g/i/p/Gipsy_Hill_railway_station_87ba.html" title="Gipsy Hill railway station">Gipsy Hill railway station</a>, which is notable because of its historic architecture, including the LB&amp;SCR's coat of arms set into the walls. That's a notable station, so it should stay. But I believe Silver Street station is not notable. Now, if anyone can rewrite the article to demonstrate notability, then I'll happily admit that I was wrong and change my vote to Keep. Just one tiny, little sign to show that Silver Street is more notable than an average station, that's all it would take. And so far, no-one's managed that. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 4 July 2005 11:44 (UTC)</li>
<li>Isn't it an unreasonable demand, though? You don't think it's enough that it's a railway station, you're asking for it to be <i>more</i> notable than "the average railway station". Well I have no idea whether it is more or less notable than that, but recall the case of William IV above. Participated in a constitutional crisis, prorogued Parliament in the middle of a debate, appointed a Tory Prime Minister against the wishes of a Whig Parliament, and the last monarch to exercise that prerogative. So your notability criterion is either extremely high or here we have demonstrable that fact that something that doesn't appear notable may later be shown to be notable. Notability isn't something to take that seriously. It's just a good rule of thumb that enables us to delete articles about bus drivers and the like. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 4 July 2005 19:26 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b>, P Ingerson, I can almost (but not quite) follow you're argument on railway stations but saying that every Country schouldn't have an article?
