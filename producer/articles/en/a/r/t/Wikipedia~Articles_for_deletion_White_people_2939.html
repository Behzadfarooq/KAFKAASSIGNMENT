<p>Nominating for <b>Deletion</b>Reason:How is this page notable? Their has been so many hurt feelings and strong reactions to this white people,black people articles. i dont think black people are very pleased with been putting in to a certain category just because they are black, and the same for white people.

<p><b>Very strong delete</b>: We don't need wikipedia trying to tell us who is white. What the hell does light skin color mean? Light compared to who? What is European ancestry? How much European ancestry and how far back? Europe is just an arbitrary landmass. There's very little genetic about being from Europe in particular and light skin isn't exclusive to Europe anyway. This article contains no real facts just opinions. Does race even exist? If so, I thought caucasians were the race; if so we already have an article about them. An article about white people is just pure nonsense. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 21:44, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. An encyclopedia should not delete information and historical accounts on what has been and what is. This and other similar articles are not putting a value to a certain skin color or "race" but only describing the cultural heritage and history of mankind - with all the bad sides to it. If this article is deleted then we're on a slippery slope and it could lead to historical revisionism, much worse than the proposer is suggesting. Closing the eyes won't make any suggested problems disappear - only enlightenment can take care of that. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 21:55, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No having this article itself will lead to historical revisionism because extreme POVs on either side will selectively quote selectively chosen historians to push their POVs and since most people don't bother to read history books, they just get all their information from wikipedia, history will indeed be rewritten <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 22:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On that basis, several articles about the nazi's <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcrime.html" title="Warcrime">warcrimes</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_hygiene.html" title="Racial hygiene">racial hygiene</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> and similar should also be deleted. If they're taken out of context they could also be misused and misquoted. Just because people have heavily slanted POVs out there is one reason why articles like these should be there to inform and point to the facts in its sources. History is ugly in many cases, but deleting the accounts of them won't make them go away and the following generations won't learn from the previous one's mistakes. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangnet_7125.html" title="User:Strangnet">Strangnet</a> 22:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>wikipedia only works when editors work together towards a common goal. It does not produce quality results in controversial articles because controversy attracts extreme opinions and when editors become polarized they work against one another's interests which gives rise to editorial chaos. Articles that have required repeated protection do not lend themselves to the stability wikipedia strives for and should be deleted. In most cases no article at all is better than unstable, and thus uncredible one <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 01:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Odd how the majority of the "speedy keeps" have had little or nothing to do with the article in question. I wonder if they are making snap decisions here without actually having had a look at the sort of POV pushing racism on this article? Defending something they have not actually read. This article is certainly damaging the integrity of Wikipedia, and claiming that it is a valid subject for an encyclopaedia is <b>not</b> the same as claiming that the content is of any value. If it is impossible for the article to become of any value because it attracts people with extreme POVs to push, then what exactly is the purpose of the article? The value of an article is no measured by the utilty of it's title, it is measured by the impartiality of it's contents. Unless more good faith editors are prepared to spend their time on this sort of difficult and depressing article, then it is never going to be anything other than a very deep and very sad reflection on the lack of credibility Wikipedia has. This article currently makes Wikipedia look like a bunch of racist nutters, but if that's how you want the project to be perceived then please go on defending this article, even when you do not know what is actually contained within it. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 01:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It may be bad. I will make no judgement on an article which is in meditation, because frivolous Arbcom cases are soo not worth my time, but it may be. However, it is <i>certainly</i> a valid topic, so it should just be cleaned up. We can't delete articles because they attract POV pushers. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 01:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh really? Why not? An article may look good in theory but if experience has proven that the subject is too controversial to be maintained at a level of quality, then of course we should delete it <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 01:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see why not if a vote for deletion were to be carried. Maybe the fact that Wikipedia is prepared to allow this sort of nonsense, just because the subject is allegedly a "valid topic", just goes to show that it is as fundamentally flawed as it's critics claim. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 01:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It is "fundamentally flawed" to accurately report the widely held concept of people who are white? By what <i>concievable</i> standard is that flawed? Oh, and no, being too controversial is not, and <i>can</i> not, be a reason for deletion. If things begin to be deleted for being too controversial, I'm quite sure most everyone will leave. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 01:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>It is "fundamentally flawed" to accurately report the widely held concept of people who are white?</i> SO are you claiming that the article in it's current form is accurate?

<li><b>Comment</b> - As an administrator pointed out above, when speedily closing the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> AfD, (which was nominated for identical reasons) "Controversy is not a reason to delete." Removing an article requires far more substantial an argument than, "It might cause problems," "Its content has issues," or, "I don't like this topic." In the <i>opinion</i> of a few editors, the articles are "unstable," but there is no policy that can possibly be followed to justify the removal of content simply because of trolls, vandals and politically driven soapboxers. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 01:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If an article is controversial to the point where it can not function, to the point where quality editors are being driven out by POV pushers, to the point where there's constant chaos, incivility, and requires page protection repeatedly, and is damaging wikipedia's credibility, then I think that's perhaps the best reason of all to delete. Never forget that a paramount wikipedia value is stability. Just as stability causes articles to become feature articles, articles that have demonstrated an inability to achieve stability and cooperation should be deleted. Wikipedia policy states that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view. Experience tells us that some articles are too polarizing for this ideal to be maintained in practice, and thus thier very existence violates the spirit of wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 01:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't know. I haven't studied articles on eastern European countries. But I have studied articles dealing with race, and I've seen a consistent pattern of editorial disorder. <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> is quite frequently the sounding board for editors in conflict over countries like <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>.

<li>Again I haven't studied middle eastern articles and thus will not speculate outside my experience. But with respect to articles on blacks and whites, experience has repeatedly demonstrated that they tend towards chaos, incivility, editorial disintegration, and POV pushing. Experience has repeatedly demonstrated that they are impossible to maintain to wikipedia's standards so how much longer should we induldge such hopeless topics before pulling the plug? At some point we have to accept that certain topics simply don't work in wikipedia <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Disruptive editors should be warned, and then disciplined. POV statements should be removed, and controversial statements should be properly sourced. You don't delete content from Wikipedia as long as it satisfies the criteria of verifiability and notability. We can certainly verify that a subset of humanity refers to itself as "white," and the amount of problems you've mentioned with the entry certainly speaks to its notability. Experience should be a catalyst for growth, not defeatism, and you don't quit doing something just because it's "hard." Editors who find their stress level rising over a particular entry should simply edit less emotionally charged material and leave the matter to those willing to continue - you don't try to cover up temporary and apparent failures by erasing the evidence. This is the way Wikipedia has worked and continues to work. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 02:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>All excellent points. You have convinced me. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 02:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Certain topics are simply a magnate for disruptive editors and when one is removed ten new ones show up. There's an endly supply of notable verifiable content but opinionated editors selectively choose only that which promotes their agenda and find excuses for removing alternative content. People end up wasting days and weeks arguing on the talk page. Edit wars ensue, pages get protected, editors get blocked or simply leave in frustation, articles get tagged, good faith editors are told to hang in there, and the cycle continues endlessly. At what point do we say enough is enough? We've tried this topic on wikipedia, we've given it opportunity after opportunity to succeed, and it simply has failed. Why can't we just admit that not all topics lend themselves to the wikipedia process and confine our efforts to those that do? I think editors that are claiming this article can work, despite the massive evidence to the contrary, have a responsibility to stay here and make sure it does work. It's very easy to throw ideals around, much harder to maintain an article 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, in the face of numerous conflicting interest groups <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think you have understood my point above. This is not about ideals, it is about maintaining <i>policies</i>. You have all the freedom in the world to give up hope... I am not going to try to convince you to keep trying to do what you have been doing. But this does not mean that we must deny others the opportunity to make the attempt because of <i>your</i> point of view. Wikipedia works by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. I think it might help, though, for you to realize that it is not your personal responsibility "to maintain an article 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, in the face of numerous conflicting interest groups." That's what the community is for. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 02:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding was that wikipedia works by maintaining <i>standards</i>. I agree that there's a consensus that this topic has a right to exist, but I urge people to stop trying to reinvent a broken wheel. There is value in learning from the mistakes of others and policy needs to be flexible <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 02:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Certainly, but if you take a look at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>, you will find that right under "Wikipedia policies" (the table on the upper right) you find, "Article standards," and then the list of policies I have mentioned. In other words, the standards are maintained by the policies, not the experiences of individual editors, regardless of how valid those experiences may be. Policies may be flexible, yes, when they come into conflict with consensus, but that is not the case here. I am not trying to trivialize the difficulty that has existed with this and other articles, and I do believe (as you seem to as well) that "race" has far more to do with society than anything empirical, but it is a notable, verifiable social construct, and as such must be discussed in any legitimate body of knowledge (i.e., an encyclopedia) with as much neutrality and care as can be. Again, if you find it difficult or feel burned out on this entry, take a step back; take a look at <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a>, and let others fight the vandals for a while. In any event, I think I have represented my position as clearly as I can, so I'll just let the votes tell the tale. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 03:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So how much time does wikipedia give an article to come up to quality standards before deciding to delete it? <a href="../../../i/s/e/User%7EIseebias_d54d.html" title="User:Iseebias">Iseebias</a> 03:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well if demonstrated repeated failure isn't a reason to delete an article I don't know what is. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and based on past behavior I see no reason to be optimistic about this article's prognosis.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> at least, and if not, <b>Move or Merge</b> to caucasians. <b>Comments</b>. Are we certain Matrix17 is not working for NAACP? In any case, you know what: who cares if he report this to NAACP. This article, unlike caucasian race, actually explore the perceptions of each regions with Caucasians. I think this is a valid article. As for <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasian race</a>, which is also going AFD and nominated by Matrix17, that's a even more valid article if not more. May be a bit better rewording, but nothing a <b>move</b> can't solve. And you know what? The exact reason why we have racism is because, aside from people who are out right racist, is also because we have people who decided to do a young Malcom X and just accuse everything that is unfavorable to them as racist. And no, political correctness, which is clearly what the nominator trying to do, just does not work, unless you actually believe that by erasing essential but ugly knowledges will help things out. Then again, in that case, why don't we take out male and female? Why don't we take out fat and thin?
