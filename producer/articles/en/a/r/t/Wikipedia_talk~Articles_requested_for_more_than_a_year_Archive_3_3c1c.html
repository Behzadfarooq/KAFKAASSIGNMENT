<p>Highlight headroom is a particular term relating to the ratio of the luminance at which an image medium produces a "normal" white versus its maximum possible luminance.

In the Computing section "identification by next value" has more hits than just wikipedia, as this line from google shows: "Results 11 - 20 of about 193,000,000 for identification by next value".

<p>Well, I decided to find out what "identification by next value" meant, so I entered the entire phrase -in quotes- and found only 13 hits.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maybe some of these shouldn't be articles</span></h2>
<p>I checked the "What links here" for maybe five or 10 of these requests in the past few days. All or almost all had negligible links -- not just the number, but the type -- such as being linked from a page "Foobar topics."</p>
<p>I am thinking about making comments in the list, such as about the number of "What links here" or Google hits, etc. And then maybe we could sort out items that probably aren't worth the time.

<dd>I'm not sure if this is a useful distinction. If we don't want obscure articles, we should simply remove them from <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:requested articles</a> and this list. Leaving them on this list, but marking them as of questionable or unknown value, will simply discourage people from writing them and increase the length of time they sit as red links. Discouraging the creation of these articles is exactly counter to why this page exist. As a rule, any page that has not been created for so long is an obscure topic of little interest to anyone. However, we still get articles like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Johnson_%28artist%29_16ac.html" title="William Johnson (artist)">William Johnson (artist)</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_wave.html" title="Breaking wave">Breaking wave</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/b/Dabney_Oil_Syndicate_46aa.html" title="Dabney Oil Syndicate">Dabney Oil Syndicate</a> written on a regular basis. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 13:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is much better. I have always thought that it would be useful to say which requests page a link has come from.

<li><a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Granda_d093.html" title="Ricardo Granda">Ricardo Granda</a> - Is the article being requested.</li>
<li>Nothing links - Attempting to create an article, then searching to see what links, finds nothing</li>

<p>I should have made a link to the last field, but got lazy. In any case, the middle field, "what would link" if the article is created is the most important.</p>

<li>On the new editpage on the lower left, below the search box, is the the link <i>What links here</i></li>
<li>That's a special page, we can't get the source. So copy and paste the links to our request page.</li>

<dd>That is putting words into my mouth. There is not an equivalence between <i>people working on this page being realistically able to resolve a request</i>, and an article being worthy of inclusion. I am not arguing that such requests should not be denied, but we should take care and make judgements as to why a search term does not appear on Google. Let for instance a name sound very African, remember there are large parts of Africa who never have seen a computer, for this reason the name might not appear on the internet but still be notable. Had the name sounded English, there is a far greater chance the name is not notable. <a href="../../../b/f/g/User%7EBfg_7212.html" title="User:Bfg">Bfg</a> 09:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
