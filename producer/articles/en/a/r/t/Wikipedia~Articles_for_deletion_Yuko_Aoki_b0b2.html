<li>And what with all this "keep" talk the article as it stands could <b>still</b> be speedily deleted as having no claim to notability. I put a note to that effect on the talk page and {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}-ed it <i>instead</i> of speedily deleting it myself, in fact. Here's a bit of a crazy idea - put some of these references into the article.

<dd>If you could read Japanese, you would know that if you do a search using <b>kanji</b>, that she was (and still is) incredibly popular in Japan and also outside of Japan. She has several DVDs in Japan, and numerous photobooks. A search on amazon.co.jp will show this. As far as fleshing out this article, a) I only stumbled across it today because it was listed for deletion b) since I do most editing at work, searching bikini model web sites isn't really an option as I would probably get fired. This needs to be expanded, not deleted. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 05:28, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which is exactly why I used prod instead of speedy deletion, I repeat. All I'm asking for is that rather than closing this as "keep" and leaving the article a micro-stub that someone sometime in the next five days puts some evidence <i>into the actual article</i>. If for no other reason than so that I may bookmark them for, ah, research.<br />

<dd>Now that I know of the existence of this page, when I can get some edit time where I don't run the risk of a sexual harassment suit, believe me, I will dedicate myself to expanding it. I will make the sacrifice of browsing page after page of scantily clad, buxom Japanese models in order to ferret out more information to add to the general repository of knowledge contained in wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> since I don't actually think she ahs ever done anything that notable. Any woman with large enough breasts can garner a million Googles easily without ever doing anything of any signifciance whatsoever. Not that I care overmuch, but this really does seem to be breastcruft. I suppose it might justifiably be defended per systemic bias, as balancing some of the millions of utterly non-notable American women with large breasts... <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:27, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alright, I'll contest it. She's a girl with moderately large breasts (this is the second draft of my comment) and she appeared in one porn movie 20 years ago. Wow. Non-notable. It's a <b>speedy delete</b>, not a speedy keep. If there's someone who cares enough to add other movies she must surely have appeared in, then they should do so post-haste rather than merely asserting her fame here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the article is claiming she's notable for being a famous bikini model, not for being a woman with large breasts or an actor. The only evidence I have of her notability are the Google hits and the word of Nobunaga and JJay, but for me, that's enough to keep a recently created stub. While editors' personal knowledge shouldn't be cited as a source in articles, it seems reasonable to me to consider it in behind-the-scenes judgements like AfDs. (I haven't been here long, so if anyone can point me to any old discussion on that last point I'd appreciate it.) --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:20, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the article says <i>"mainly known for her large breasts."</i>, not <i>"is mainly known as a bikini model"</i>. The only passing claim to notability is having, as they say, big ***s. Evidence that can't go in an article is difficult to find much use for, since it is the article and the material in it that is at issue here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, it does say that. But what about this official website that Nobunaga added? The "discography" link goes <a href="http://www.universal-music.co.jp/aoki_yuko/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.universal-music.co.jp/aoki_yuko/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>... she seems to be a recording artist with a major label album, which would make her notable in itself. I'd add it to the article, but I'll leave that to the editors who can read Japanese. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:40, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that this means she is signed with HMV, if that's what you mean, since I'm not even sure that they are a label. Even if it does mean that, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> asks for two albums on a major label, and there is no proof of that. Allmusic.com has never heard of her, sugesting that probably that release was not, in fact, on a singificant label. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:56, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I was thinking Universal Music Group, not HMV. Again, I can't read Japanese, but it looks to me like a Universal release. And you're right that it's just one, but it's packaged with a DVD and looks like the kind of big pop release that would easily have sold 5000 copies. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:07, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I see. Hmmm, that is difficult. But absent any proof of notability (or even, for that matter any proof of the one claim in the article), it remains deleteable, and speedily. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:27, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps. I bet Nobunaga will be able to shed a lot of light on this when he gets back. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 03:50, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, looking at the IMDB listing, I don't think that's her. She would be about 10 or 11 years old when that movie came out, and seeing as it looks like an erotic film, I doubt it's her. Most of her *ahem* movies are "smile and pose" straight to DVD type jobs, not listed on IMDB. The album is news to me, but I'll look at the site. I'm not really a Jpop fan so I don't stay on top of those things (actually I despise Jpop). <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 06:53, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
