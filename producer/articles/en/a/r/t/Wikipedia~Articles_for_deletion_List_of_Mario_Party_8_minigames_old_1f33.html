<li>List of Mario Party 7 minigames</li>
</ul>
<p>Listcruft that is much better suited for a video game wiki. Previous mini-game lists for Rayman Raving Rabbids and Super Monkey Ball have been deleted or turned into redirects. Mini-games are important: but an entire list on them all is game guide content. If people want to know all that detail: they can check gamefaqs. Wikipedia shouldn't be turned into a video game guide, period. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 15:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I wouldn't go that far. It's just a short list of confirmed minigames for an upcoming game.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Could someone tack on the following to this debate: List of Mario Party 6 minigames, List of Mario Party 7 minigames. Similar listcruft pages.

<p><b>Comment:</b> RobJ, will you shut up about Game FAQs?! It doesn't matter that you can check it. Different sites are allowed to have the same info on them.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> it's part of a resolution, I know that isn't a reason, but it's got reliable published sources, it's written (or can be written) in an encyclopedic manner, it isn't an instruction guide. I challenge anyone to find some real policy that it fails. Barring that, there's consensus (on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMario_Party_8_5777.html" title="Talk:Mario Party 8">Talk:Mario Party 8</a> page). <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 19:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Rather blatant listcruft. Also being used by Henchman 2000 in an attempt to blackmail editors in order to stop the edit war over Mario Party 8 (and I quote "RobJ, if you want this edit war over, get an admin to speedy keep the pages conserned with this unnecesary Afd. If you don't, once again, we will be getting no-where."). The consensus on the aforementionted talk page only concerns the Mario Party 8 article, IIRC. Specifically, that lists will not be included, and prose will be used. This article was created by Bowsy after a suggestion from Messedrocker, not as part of a consensus decision AFAIK. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 20:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It needs to be noted: <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Henchman_2000_0c0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Henchman 2000">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Henchman_2000</a> determined Bowsy and Henchman use the same computer. The note at the bottom clearly states this: <b>soliciting a person sharing your computer to show up to articles for deletion debates or content conflicts on articles and support your position is probably not going to be looked upon very favorably by the community.</b>. I thought I would put this out, since both Henchman and Bowsy have posted here (clearly against the note at the case, which I'm sure they've read in the past). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 21:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment for closing admin:</b> Please read this VEEERY carefully before taking the above comment on board paying particular attention to the bolded areas:
<blockquote>
<p>Based on what I saw on the talkpage here I wanted to clarify something. There was a <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Henchman_2000_0c0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Henchman 2000">sockpuppet</a> case which I closed with the finding that they were probably not puppets. <b><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenchman_2000_6976.html" title="User:Henchman 2000">Henchman 2000</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenchman_2000_c725.html" title="User talk:Henchman 2000">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Henchman_2000_1d9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Henchman 2000">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/o/w/User%7EBowsy_2307.html" title="User:Bowsy">Bowsy</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/w/User_talk%7EBowsy_c73d.html" title="User talk:Bowsy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bowsy_ef24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bowsy">contribs</a>) are free to participate in the same AfD's and talkpage discussions. If they want to have the same position on something, that is fine.</b> As I said in my closing notes, they need to be careful because "soliciting a person sharing your computer to show up to articles for deletion debates or content conflicts on articles and support your position is probably not going to be looked upon very favorably by the community". That was an opinion on my part that such actions may induce a closing admin to ignore one of their&#160;!votes <i>at discretion</i>. <b>It was not permission to harass them for participating in the same AfDs.</b> Unless they are actively working in tandem to circumvent <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> though, <b>I don't think the accusations of puppetry are warrented.</b></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The only reason Mario Party 8 minigames list isn't a game guide yet, is because the game isn't out yet. Look at the lists for 6 and 7: they clearly tell you how to play each game.

<dd>I'm sorry, this is nothing like gamefaqs, this is merely a list of the minigames we know about in MP8. If there were something like "When trying to cross the tightrope, the player should lay his wiimote down on the ground, because then you'll stay balanced and win every time" That would be a gamefaq. This information is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 05:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just as an aside, Gamefaqs isn't just a strategy guide website. If you ever take a look at the in-depth FAQs, there are detailed articles about the game.</dd>
<dd>Example: <a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/mario_party_5_minigame.txt" class="external text" title="http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/mario_party_5_minigame.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a></dd>
<dd>While it does contain strategy information, that's not all it consists of. Another example might be something like&#160;::<a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/metal_gear_solid_tts_changes.txt" class="external text" title="http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/metal_gear_solid_tts_changes.txt" rel="nofollow">this</a>. While not Mario Party related, it does illustrate that it doesn't have to be strategy related to be included on Gamefaqs, and just because it doesn't discuss game strategy doesn't mean it isn't information better handled by other sites. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_S._Poole_174e.html" title="User:Gene S.

<dd><i><b>WHAT?!?!?</b></i> The policies posted on <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a> clearly state that if an article *could* be cleaned up, that it should be cleaned up, and <b>not</b> deleted. The principle here, is that if an article isn't encyclopedic, but could be, then vote "keep" and fix it. If you don't want to fix it yourself, that doesn't mean that you should vote delete, just let someone else fix it. If it's unfixable, that's what the delete is for. I can understand people who make this mistake, it's a rather common one. You on the other hand have made the opposite mistake, saying, in essence "well, it's encyclopedic now, but it's likely going to fall into ruin, so we may as well delete it now." this is the <i><b>WRONG</b></i> approach. The correct approach is to vote keep, and fix the other articles (for MP6,7...), because <i>obviously</i> they <b>can be encyclopedic</b>. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 05:49, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Furthermore, there is no <i>inclusion criteria for lists</i> except for the regular <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a> guidelines, which this article clearly passes.

<dd>Absolutely disagree. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a> states "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself". Please, enlighten me, tell me where <b>the minigames from the Mario Party series</b> are the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works. I agree, the games deserve the article, as they are the subject of such published works; the minigames of such games are not.</dd>
<dd>These lists, frankly, are unencyclopedic, and they contribute nothing to Wikipedia. Simply noting the names of the minigames contributes nothing; indeed the only person such a list would be of interest to would be someone who has already played the game and knows about the minigames; and adding descriptions of all the minigames makes such a list far too similar to an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">instruction manual</a>. Witness <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/mariopartye.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/mariopartye.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>for clarification; although it's for the Mario Party-e, it has the exact same sort of information, and it's an instruction manual.

<dd>It's an instruction manual which has descriptions of all the mini games. it does say how to do the minigames, and also has descriptions (i.e. Mario must catch the fish that princess peach requests without touching the wrong fish) which is essentially what we're looking at in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. How exactly can they be encyclopedic? I can see the articles going a few ways: game guide/how to play guide (which it leans towards now, Wikipedia isn't an instruction manual or game guide), or just simply a list of mini-games. Both aren't suitable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 06:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, how about the way they are now, with a list of games, and information about each game. Maybe more encyclopedic information could be added: like how they relate to previous games in series, how well they are received by players, pop-culture references in the games... I agree that how-to guides on how to play are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> appropriate, but the list currently doesn't have that, so it is obviously possible for the content to be encyclopedic. If you're worried that the article might turn non-encyclopedic, then watch the article and patrol changes.

<dd>It's listcruft leaning towards a game guide. As I've stated before: other mini-game lists have been in AFD and deleted: the most recent Rayman, and the most recent Super Monkey Ball as well. Both of which are mini-game collections (while SMB has a story mode, but it's still alot of mini-games). These precendents are more than enough to determine this another listcruft, much better suited for a gaming wiki. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 23:49, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, let me be more clear. I think an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instruction.html" title="Instruction">instruction</a> manual <b>is</b> a <b>how</b>-to guide. I think that "How" is the important word. Wikipedia and most dictionarys seem to agree with this definition. I think that the wikipedia article and the instruction manual serve entirely different <i>purposes</i>. the purpose of the instruction manual is to tell you <b>how</b> to press the buttons to play the game. On a similar note, strategy guides are very similar to instruction manuals. They tell a user <b>how</b> to use the controls to play <i>effectively</i>. The wikipedia article can present encyclopedic information without specifying <b>how</b>. It tells "what"s going on in the game. "what" the minigames look like. If there are current deviations from this, I think that they can be free from "how" and present valuable (non-indiscriminate) information.

<dd>I'm sorry AKMask, according to WP ruling, they are not sockpuppets. Also, according to <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, Calling them meatpuppets is definitely a bit of a grey area, as they are not strictly single-purpose users. Both of them have hundreds of edits, and they are contributing in at least two disparate areas (<s>Wii games</s> <s>Mario Party games</s> video games, and Spongebob). They may have interest in WP as a whole, but are only capable of editing in those two areas.

<p><b>Comment about the kind comments:</b></p>
<p>I must explain, if you can please excuse my use of your time; forgive my ignorance of much of the topic material itself?</p>
<p>I am a single father of 3 girls. (ages 11. 15. and 23.) I love Wikipedia; use it all the time. My children cannot use Wikipedia (as a factual reference) in our school system in Illinois, more often than not, because of either,</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of pertinent (up to date) content, or</li>
<li>lack of reliable sources, or most unfortunate,</li>
<li>The ability of vandals to change the truth, at will.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mention " the children" because it is timely to consider that most companies with a vision for the future, plan for repeat users well into the next generation, or more. (e.g., I cite Apple, Inc. as a primary example of this.)</p>

<dd>Just so you don't think he's some guy whose reasons for Wikipedia don't matter to wikipedia, I'll note that his first point falls under "Wikipedia is not a Paper encyclopedia" our information can be up to date, and can fill niches that paper encyclopedias can't (like thousands of articles in Harry Potter categories)</dd>
<dd>Lack of sources falls under one of the WP trifecta <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>.</dd>
<dd>and the third point falls under <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">WP:VANDALISM</a>.</dd>
<dd>So, his reasons are valid. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 21:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia does not plan for the next generation of users. We plan to be an encyclopedia of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-trivial</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">previously published</a> material. Multiple, reliable, non-trivial works must be published on a subject for it to be included. It's nice you have kids you care about, but frankly, it doesn't matter in the context of Wikipedia. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 23:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>My final comment to AKMask:</b> Thank you. You just gave the most salient, transparent, and powerful reason on earth, why, the above article should stay, here today. Good for you.

<dd>AKMask, <b>his reasons are your reasons</b>. I thought I made that clear in my post. If you're going to make logical progress, you're going to have to attack the issues of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (and "Encyclopedic" like others are doing to varying degrees of failure) Not just say "IT'S GOT TO BE NOTABLE!!!!!" We all know that it has to be notable, you've got to show that <i>our efforts of showing that it is notable</i> are fallacious. Also, I fear that Lee has left wikipedia because of this argument. His last post seemed so ... final. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 06:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or, you know, I could just point out that we should follow the policy. Or attack it, as you suggest I do. I prefer my way better, the "we should have encyclopedic content as per policy" way, as I call it. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 16:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
