<li><b>Comment</b> You might want to check bullet number 1 again under WP:SOFTWARE as this is one of the new products under the ijji game portal. While that may not sound important on its own, ijji is the North American version of the HANGAME portal, a major gaming website in East Asia. Still choosing to delete this article could violate some worldwide view issues. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinoyGenius_7d46.html" title="User:PinoyGenius">PinoyGenius</a> 19:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Somehow there always seems to be an argument saying we should keep bad articles because they may someday be good/verifiable/notable, etc. Meet the standards for a verifiable and notable article now, or wait and create the article later. It will be a total waste of people's time if they put in the effort to "perfect" an article only to see it deleted in a few months because it never really was notable to begin with. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 08:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would argue the opposite. If the game turns out to be huge then people will have to start completely fresh with this article. Having never heard of the game I can't claim this to be the case but I believe that there should be a way to prolong deletion if it is believed that an article only needs time. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlleicua_887d.html" title="User:Olleicua">Olleicua</a> 18:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As this game is still in development, open beta, there's no way I or anyone else for that matter could possibly provide as much information currently. Upon further research and development of this game by it's creators, I will be able to provide any missing information currently shown under the article. As of now, none of these Wikipedia users have any authority to even be considering deleting my entry. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilanthropy_0da3.html" title="User:Philanthropy">Philanthropy</a> 14:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The game just needs time to develop popularity, then all the info will come flowing in. Also about the crystal ball thing, the game has been confirmed and will open today and all of the info on the wikipage is on the website. Whats so unverified about it?

<li><b>Delete as unreferenced</b> It's ok to have an article about an upcoming game, but only if the article is based on referenced, verifiable, independently published facts and it demonstrates a certain level of notability for inclusion. This article, though, appears to have no independent references and fails to demonstrate the game is at all notable. Delete unless proper sources can be provided for verification and notability. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:37, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> You should give the game some time before deciding if the article should be deleted or not. Check out the release date, it's barely 1 day.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have tried to edit this article more to make it more readable and "wiki" like but I don't usually edit articles and don't know more of the code per say. The article however is legit and is pertaining to a game that was just released. Its following is a couple thousand and growing so given time the article should grow. It is unreferenced however because all the information is on either the game's site itself or found by playing the game. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocerhed_03ab.html" title="User:Socerhed">Socerhed</a> 01:18, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> I reference my comment above as to why this article should remain since it is a product of the ijji gaming portal website. Additionally, the game has been out for several days now and, with the number of users fluctuating between 2500 and 3000, there has been ample opportunity to test the game out and render all crystal ball concerns obsolete. Furthermore, the fact that there have been no further recommendations for deletion since the release of the game should provide more evidence to keep this article. It is important to preserve the "history" of this game as it is occurring and fresh in its players' minds rather than trying to write about it after the fact. Finally, how someone can recommend the deletion of an article pertaining to a topic within 24 hours of its release is beyond me.--<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinoyGenius_7d46.html" title="User:PinoyGenius">PinoyGenius</a> 19:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Metacomment</b>: The game was apparently released (as open beta) after the nomination, so many of the "delete" comments saying "crystal ball" or "unreleased" seem to be outdated already. I encourage those who already commented above to update their stance (possibly still recommending delete for reasons other than "crystal ball"). <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-19 11:21Z</small></i></span></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article has been significantly improved (including sources) since the AfD was placed (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soldier_Front&amp;oldid=107955391" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soldier_Front&amp;oldid=107955391" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Also, I don't find it very appropriate to nominate a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy-able</a> article for deletion <b>7 minutes</b> after its creation. I appreciate the work new-page watchers do, but non-speedyable articles can be added to one's Watchlist or bookmarked. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A new game that does exist and has now been released and has gained sourcing since first being put on the chop block shows more of a new article being formed than an article beyond hope of meeting wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbagot_183b.html" title="User:Bbagot">Bbagot</a> 05:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As I commented above. Hasn't established notability. It is common for fans, or those in favor of promoting a new product in beta, to insist that an article should stand without establishing notability, or providing independent third party references. You may like the game, but anyone can announce a beta test and get some folks to download something for free. That doesn't make it a suitable subject for an encyclopedia article.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 23:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As I am saying again as well, the same goes for the articles <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunz.html" title="Gunz">Gunz</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunster.html" title="Gunster">Gunster</a> but we still had those articles during their open betas.

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that there are other articles which may not establish notablity DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE KEPT.
