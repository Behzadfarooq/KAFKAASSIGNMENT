<p>The information in this article seems to be unverifiable. It is assembled from four different web sites which contradict each other in various ways and have various factual inaccuracies. None of the web sites cite <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. I went to the nearby university library today and can find no reliable sources about it. I was reluctant to list this at first, since I've heard of this tank, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that I've only ever heard about it from Internet tank fan sites, never a reliable source. Without a reliable source, the article must go, based on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. My guess is that virtually no hard information exists on this design and everyone just keeps building on the story. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:23, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I appreciate that, Agent 86, but I worry that I simply didn't find the right books and I'm doing the article an injustice. I'd be happier if a reliable source were found, the contradictions were cleared up, and the article got to stay with all the inaccuracies trimmed out. However, I did look through every possible source at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_State_University_da5b.html" title="North Carolina State University">NCSU</a> library and didn't find anything... as you can see, I'm torn. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe the more prudent course of action would be to tag it with the {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} template. Given that you instead chose to nominate it on the basis of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I'll have to say <i>delete</i>, but out of deference to your comments I'll soften my position to <i>weak delete</i>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Would it be acceptable for now to trim or qualify portions where the sources are in disagreement? I too respect and appreciate the legwork contributed by the nominator, but I'm unconvinced that AFD isn't premature. Two apparently-independent web pages predate the wp article: Achtung Panzer<a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/p1000.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/p1000.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Panzershreck<a href="http://www.panzerschreck.de/panzer/pzkpfw/p1000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.panzerschreck.de/panzer/pzkpfw/p1000.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (other web sites that appeared since then look like they may be sourced from the wp article itself). Neither site provides reliable sources, but both sites agree that a project with the name existed, and roughly agree about the intended size and armament. Achtung Panzer, at least, appears to be fairly reputable as far as such enthusiast sites go, and presuming good faith on their part I'm willing to provisionally allow that the whole thing isn't just a hoax. On the other hand it does seem to be disturbingly hard to find information about the Ratte compared to the Maus and E-100. --<a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESaucepan_785f.html" title="User:Saucepan">Saucepan</a> 05:20, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be honest, my initial intention when I found the article was to simply trim portions that seemed to be original research and sections where the sources were in disagreement, but I ran into resistance there. When I tried to verify information about the subject, I couldn't find anything. For a short time I thought it would be a good idea to simply trim the page down to what everyone agrees on, but it seems to me that a source is either reliable (or based on reliable sources) or it isn't, and four web sites that don't cite sources don't add up to one reliable source. While I generally consider Achtung Panzer to be reputable, their P-1000 page has at least one factual inaccuracy (discussed on Talk:P-1000, and their illustration looks nothing like Panzershreck's, which casts some doubt on the reliability of one or the other. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 06:26, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think information reliability is much more probabilistic than it is black and white, although it does seem to be true that hobbyist sites might have trouble reaching the minimum standards currently called for by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> -- in the case of Achtung Panzer, it would seem to hinge on George Parada's reputation as an amateur historian. Someone should probably ask Mr. Parada where he got his info and diagrams. --<a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESaucepan_785f.html" title="User:Saucepan">Saucepan</a> 21:37, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I e-mailed Mr. Parada a couple of days ago, so hopefully he'll get back to me. He does have a <a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/book.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/book.htm" rel="nofollow">bibliography page</a> but it's just a big list of books, with no information about what came from where, so I wrote him to try to clarify where his P-1000 information might have come from. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:22, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've received no response from George Parada to my request for sources and questions about a few things about the article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 19:38, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the information present in this article comes from a reliable source, <a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/" rel="nofollow">Achtung Panzer!</a>, which User:TomTheHand has attempted to discredit using a fallacious argument based on a strawman distortion of a single sentence in one article: namely, he claims that a statement that a mock-up turret was moved <i>to</i> a location must mean it was installed <i>at</i> that location. This is not only ludicrous, but original research aimed at making the article appear to have no reliable source when in fact it does have at least one such source.

<dd>Add also as sources demonstrating the thing's existence <a href="http://www.panzer-archiv.de/planungen/deutschland/p1000/p1000.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.panzer-archiv.de/planungen/deutschland/p1000/p1000.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and if anyone can get hold of <a href="http://jadarhobby.home.pl/product_info.php?products_id=10840" class="external text" title="http://jadarhobby.home.pl/product_info.php?products_id=10840" rel="nofollow">this</a> it could presumably be used as a source. The book <i>Waffen und Geheimwaffen des deutschen Heeres 1933-1945</i> would also presumably include something on P1000, since (apparently) it even includes details of the Midgard-Schlange project to build a 60,000 ton burrowing train.Hrimfaxi 09:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't need to use a "strawman distortion" to discredit Achtung Panzer. It is not a reliable source according to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Read it.</dd>
<dd>I'll see if I can find German Secret Panzer Projects. Until I do, I stand by my position to delete the article as it is based entirely on unreliable sources. If, in the future, someone gets their hands on a reliable sources, they can recreate the article based <i>only on information found in those sources.</i> Again, for goodness sake, read the verifiability policy. There's nothing to argue about here, no room for interpretation. None of the sources used to make the article are reliable according to Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 15:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have, thanks. It says nothing that would disqualify a respected website with numerous awards as a reliable source. Hrimfaxi 15:33, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The first sentence is <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This means that we only publish material that is verifiable with reference to reliable, published sources.</i> Achtung Panzer! is a personal web site, not a published source.</dd>
<dd>Also see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Reliability_of_online_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">here</a>. <i>Publications with teams of fact-checkers, reporters, editors, lawyers, and managers — like the New York Times or The Times of London — are likely to be reliable, and are regarded as reputable sources for the purposes of Wikipedia.

<dd>There is also this: <i>Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name.</i> It seems like a long shot but it's just possible that Mr. Parada migh turn out to qualify. --<a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESaucepan_785f.html" title="User:Saucepan">Saucepan</a> 21:37, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wonder how "acknowledged expert" is meant to be interpreted. Is it enough that assorted other amateur web sites consider his to be good, or are we talking about a higher standard of acknowledgement? Does he have to be generally acknowledged to be an expert by professional historians? I did some Googling, and George Parada seems to be well-respected on various web forums and stuff, but his presence seems to be limited to the amateur military history community on the web. I wish he had a bio or something on achtungpanzer. I'll try to look and see if he's written any books or anything. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:48, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This tripod site, <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~fingolfen/superheavy/p1500.html" class="external free" title="http://members.tripod.com/~fingolfen/superheavy/p1500.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~fingolfen/superheavy/p1500.html</a>, at least points to a book in reference to the P-1500, so we could see if it mentions the P-1000, too. The book in question is, I think, <i>Tanks; the Axis powers: Germany, Italy, and Japan</i>, by Eric Grove. Libraries that have it are: NORTHLAND PIONEER COL (AZ), LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUB LIB (CA), PLACER CNTY LIBR (CA), MIAMI-DADE PUB LIBR SYST (FL), PRITZKER MILITARY LIBR (IL), ALLEN CNTY PUB LIBR (IN), KOKOMO-HOWARD CNTY PUB LIBR (IN), KENTUCKY HIST SOC LIBR (KY), NICHOLLS STATE UNIV ELLENDER MEM LIBR (LA), SAILS, INC (MA), SAGINAW PUB LIBR (MI), UNIV OF NEBRASKA OMAHA (NE), MOHAWK VALLEY COMM COLL (NY), CUYAHOGA CNTY PUB LIBR (OH), EASTERN OREGON UNIV ((OR), US ARMY, MIL HIST INST (PA), NAVAL WAR COLL (RI), BLUE RIDGE REG LIBR (VA), MILWAUKEE CNTY FEDERATED LIBR (WI), and SAINT NORBERT COL LIBR (WI). So, I'd say, have someone who lives nearby check that book, see if it seems scholarly or has references. This thing was supposedly cancelled by Speer in '43, so I'll check my copy of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, but it wouldn't hurt to check <i>The Spandau Diaries</i> and <i>Infiltration</i>, too (I don't have those).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I just spent two hours at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_State_University_da5b.html" title="North Carolina State University">NCSU</a> library looking at Spandau: The Secret Diaries, Infiltration, and Inside the Third Reich. This is in addition to the time I spent last week checking NCSU's resources on tanks and armored vehicles. I was not able to read anything cover to cover, obviously, but I scanned probable sections and checked indexes and I found no mention of the P-1000. In addition, George Parada of AchtungPanzer did not respond to my queries. I believe that if I spend several hours at a major university library, and I cannot find reliable sources on a topic, and none of the contributors of an article are able to present reliable sources, that information should be considered unverifiable and removed. According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, any editor can remove unsourced material, and the obligation to provide a reliable source belongs to the contributor(s), not those seeking to remove it. I understand that realistically, not every article contains reliable sources, and I wouldn't suggest that all of those articles be deleted. However, if an article cites <i>no reliable sources</i>, a source is <i>requested</i>, nobody is able to provide one, and several hours of research fail to turn up a reliable source, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 00:34, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Tom, and I've checked my copy of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> as well, without success. I've also gone back through my <i>Panzer Tracts</i> and other German tank history works, and find no references there, either. I don't see any documented evidence anywhere to support the claims of this vehicle's existence, and without either a detailed reference from Mr. Parada, or somebody producing direct quotes from the Grove book (which I listed above along with every library in the country that owns it), I see no reason to believe that this vehicle had any basis in fact. I am therefore changing my vote to <b>strong delete.</b> If anyone ever produces a copy of the Grove book, I might change my mind, <i>if</i> it seems verifiable and scholarly. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacxpert_3406.html" title="User:Sacxpert">Sacxpert</a> 08:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable tankcruft which wouldn't merit an article even if it could be shown that a sketch on a napkin or wooden scale model actually existed. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 10:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm persuaded by TomTheHand's argument that it shouldn't be this difficult to find reliable sources for a notable project, and Wikipedia's current editorial stance appears to be that unreliable information is worse than no information.
