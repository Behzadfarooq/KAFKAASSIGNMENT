<li><b>Comment</b> Basically, the reason it seems to be up for deletion is because you make no claim of notability or even really describe anything about the organization. It seems that you copied and pasted information straight from the website. If you want your articles to remain on wikipedia, you need to take a look at <a href="../../../i/a/_/WP%7EIA_4ccc.html" title="WP:IA">WP:IA</a> in order to ensure that your articles meet the minimum guidelines that have been agreed upon. Please also read <a href="../../../g/u/i/WP%7EGUIDELINES_2048.html" title="WP:GUIDELINES">WP:GUIDELINES</a>. I think that this organization is notable, given the number of unique google hits and that it is a major organization for russian speaking physicians in the US.

<p>Contested Prod. High school nonsense. Original version of the article claimed the events happened in 1999, but all the named students were members of last year's varsity football team at Rancho Cotate High School <a href="http://www.maxpreps.com/FanPages/TeamFrame.mxp/California/Boys_Varsity_Football_Fall_05-06/AreaID-89ae2e0f-e108-4054-9df3-329f0579f86d/SchoolID-3ed10994-ad13-48de-a0bf-8ddb12dd120c/Page-Roster/Sort-Jersey" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maxpreps.com/FanPages/TeamFrame.mxp/California/Boys_Varsity_Football_Fall_05-06/AreaID-89ae2e0f-e108-4054-9df3-329f0579f86d/SchoolID-3ed10994-ad13-48de-a0bf-8ddb12dd120c/Page-Roster/Sort-Jersey" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When removing the Prod notice (which pointed out these kids would have been in grade school), author changed the date to claim the events happened in 2005. The adult named in the article actually googles as a convicted hacker; the rest of it is totally unverifiable from any outside source. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 00:42, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually the storyline is valid, it occured in December 2005 after the football season had concluded. There are small articles about it in local papers, the boys involvement is obviously not as big as the article portrays it to be. They had a minor role in creating the trojan, google it, there is information about it in various forums.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tylerb1222 (<a href="../../../t/y/l/User_talk%7ETylerb1222_2e9b.html" title="User talk:Tylerb1222">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tylerb1222_cea1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tylerb1222">contribs</a>).</small></li>

No, it's just a variation on its predecessors, with slightly better battery life, a slightly faster processor, slightly more storage, etc.</li>
<li>Of course there are google hits for models of phones. There are google hits for every line of code in the Linux kernel.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This product isn't notable enough to deserve an article. Its features are tentative and evolutionary and not revolutionary.

<li><b>Question</b> Would a merged article of say, all motorola cell phones, all nokia cell phones, etc. be acceptable? While I agree that separate articles are probably a waste of resources, the information probably should be here.

<li><i>Comment</i> I have no problem at all with an article discussing the histories of major cell phone technologies, with appropriate examples. I just think it's inappropriate to have so many articles on so many individual phones whose uniqueness appears to exist only as a function of the way the electronics industry works. If individual models are notable, that's fine -- see <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola_International_3200_f67e.html" title="Motorola International 3200">Motorola International 3200</a>. But Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of electronics specifications.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The 1600 is almost exactly the same as the 1110; slightly different keyboard, B&amp;W instead of colour screen. Judging by the specs listed in the articles, The 1600 is also similar to the 6030. Dual-band GSM phones, slightly different firmware features; otherwise the same case size (within a millimeter) and same weight (within a few grams). Very similar to the 6010; again, just a slightly different case and a few firmware features. Otherwise, just another dovebar phone. 3310/3315 are nearly the same, too; a few firmware features and dual-band GSM. The firmware features that are different are enabled or disabled to provide some small differentiation for marketing purposes. They don't really mean naything notable about the phone at all -- no research or revolution; just planned obselescence to milk more money out of consumers and put more phoens into landfills.</li>

<p>During a large recent oil spill in the Artic BP blamed corrosion as the root cause. After much International debate on the National association of Corrosion Engineers (USA) NACE Corrosion Network" &lt;nace@nacecorrosionnetwork.com&gt; the true root cause was belived not to be corrosion but short term greed hence Denialasation. If the word is offensive then delete but I am sure that it will be used in the future by Corrosion Engineers for this worrying phenomenon and used in future technical papers. Sorry for the spelling impediment (I agree) I do suffer from dyslexia but try hard to correct mistakes. Not gibberish but I take the point for the move to the urban dictionary, maybe it has to reside there until in common use. Definately Not Denialisation.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I created the article; however, I did not have time to go back and fill in the specifics. I planned on doing it this weekend, but I was called away to family responsibilites. Gibbs is the endorsed canadidate for Tom Delay's former congressional seat. She was endorsed by the Fort Bend County Republican party precinct chairpersons over the weekend. As others have pointed out, this will be one of the most highly watched congressional races in the country in the next two months. Why is she a write-in if she is really the Republican choice? Because Delay won the primary election and then fought a court battle with the Democrats to have his name replaced and another official Republican name added. He fought through the court system and lost. So Delay pulled his name off of the ballot, but it was too late in the election cycle to replace him with an official Republican nominee. So the Fort Bend Republicans, not the only county in the district, met behind closed doors and endorsed Gibbs. Gibbs would qualify for her own Wikipedia article simply on her accomplishments so far (prominent doctor, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_City_Council_b21f.html" title="Houston City Council">Houston City Council</a> member, etc.). However, the fact that she is the endorsed Republican candidate for Tom Delay's old seat is enough for qualification by itself also. --<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 14:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This will be one of the most watched political dramas of the election season and Gibbs will be a big player in it. Anyone who is interested in who maintains control of Congress after the election is paying attention to this race.

<li><b>Comment</b> Being a prominent doctor and a city council member is usually not enough for notability unless she meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The city council members for a city, even as large a city as Houston, are not generally notable. Although, this information should probably be included somewhere. Is there an article on the 2006 Texas Congressional Race? Maybe a bit about her in that article, if it exists, would be sufficient, until she actually wins the election. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 21:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> With all due respect, you are mistaken. There are articles on each of the members of the Los Angeles City Council, and over half of the members of the New York City Council. In fact, there should probably be more articles related to the latter legislative body, since Larry Seabrook-a former state senator and well-known congressional candidate who now sits on the City Council-does not have an article devoted to his career. Furthermore, the fact that she is the de facto Republican nominee in what is one of the most volatile congressional races in the country would merit an article in and of itself, regardless of any other notoriety she might have achieved as a prominent member of the city council of the fourth-largest city in the nation. That being said, her record as a city councilwoman would also be sufficient to earn a Wikipedia article, per above.<a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 22:02, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a follow-up the above comment. There are fifty city council members (aldermen) on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_City_Council_8c58.html" title="Chicago City Council">Chicago City Council</a> and every single one of them have a Wikipedia article about them. Chicago is the third largest city and Houston is the fourth largest city. Also, there is no way all fifty of them should have their own Wikipedia article. Please read some of them. For example, I'm sure this person is a good person, but what qualifies this Chicago alderman with a Wikipedia article, other than simply being on the Chicago City Council? See <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pope_%28alderman%29_2fbc.html" title="John Pope (alderman)">John Pope (alderman)</a>. Based upon this article, I respectfully disagree that simply being on a city council gets you in Wikipedia. Sekula-Gibbs would be the first Houston city council member with her own Wikipedia article and there are a couple of others who probably should be covered also, but ALL of the Chicago aldermen??

<li><b>Comment</b> That is not the measure of notability. As has already been pointed out-several times-there have been a handful of write-in candidates who have gone on to win the general election, and even more who have waged extremely competitive, high-profile campaigns. She has the endorsement of large segments of the GOP within her constituency, and is the de facto Republican-endorsed candidate at this moment. Her campaign has earned media coverage in every national daily newspaper, and every major daily within the state of Texas.

<dd>Especially at the end, the article contains rampant uncited "facts" and extraordinary speculation. Examples: that the district is "heavily" Republican (could we see a link to an independent site with polling numbers?) and also that the "leans democratic" rating could change (okay, says which political expert?). Other examples exist. The article currently comes across as much more of an editorial rather than encyclopedic content. Support deletion or significant and substantial revision.

<p>hello, well you cannot judge how big the company is by searching google and see how many links the company has I can get a web page generator and get millions of page listed in google but thats not how you judge how big the company is goto msn and see how many pages goto any other search engine and type wholesale barmops and you will see we are no#1 our yearly sales are 5MIL.</p>
<p>So by search engine you cannot judge, if thats how you judge companies than its very unprofessional. Now you are using you are not a company directory well if you search ritz camera you will see they are listed to inyour web site so that means you are listing companies on your web site it just a matter who you like and who you NOT like.</p>

<li><b>KEEP-</b>why does this matter so much to you guys? It is just a harmless article about a group that made a pretty big impact on a message-forum that is no where near small. I will edit the grammar.--<i>Andy_duke</i>
<ul>
<li>Because we have to subject <i>all</i> articles to the same sort of standards. We regrettably have a some bar of inclusion and in order to keep the encyclopedia maintainable we <i>have</i> to separate wheat from chaff. The article may be "harmless" as in "doesn't need much server resources from Wikipedia", but it fails to tell how <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notable</a> the group is, and doesn't help a lot in regards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> either. If you look around, you'll see that most articles about groups are backed by telling why should we <i>really</i> care about them, and sources that tell exactly why should we <i>really</i> care about them.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would have to say that an article like this is like me creating an article "John Smith" and then listing all of the people who have the name. Unencyclopedic in nature. Maybe an article on the nickname "Zé" and how it evolved from "José", if there is a verifiable history and if it is a very common nickname.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really think that the article justifies deletion. One could be searching for someone known as "Zé Manel" and would find that page. Indeed it's a nickname, but it's a quite common one in Portugal. --<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">Húsönd</a> 13:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, similar to many disambiguation pages we have (e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Stevens_1a7e.html" title="Mark Stevens">Mark Stevens</a>), but with a short explanation of the origin of the name. Its not standard or often seen here on Wikipedia, but in principle nothing wrong with it (although it could use some cleanup of layout). <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>The article should be turned into a real disambiguation page, i.e. the rather lenghty description of the people should go or be merged into their respective articles (if they have none, just create stubs). <b>Keep</b> but cleanup.

<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. This is an odd one. The author requested deletion, and per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> it should be deleted per G7.

The nom and one of the Delete votes where basically based on "I don't understand what this is." I don't see think there should be any real problem understanding what this is, especially if it were rewritten. It is a rather odd case require a rather unique solution - a bio of multiple persons in one article under their shared name - but makes sense because for notability purposes they are linked to the one poem. Interesting case. A fairly clear Keep in my opinion <i>if</i> one discounts CSD G7, which I have chosen to do. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 00:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Articles on American Literature Appearing in Current Periodicals", in <i>American Literature</i> 1963, p. 123, includes a listing of an item by Gardner, Martin: "When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a Fish", <i>AR</i>, XXII, 332-340 (Fall, 1962), which is described as being 'On "Evolution" by Langdon Smith (1858-1908)'. I can't find the abbreviations, so I have no idea what "AR" stands for, but I guess whoever is willing to rewrite the article may be able to decipher that. <small>(I would have guessed <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Review_74cd.html" title="American Review">American Review</a></i>, but it doesn't seem to fit).</small> Frederick L. Gwynn, "The Functional Allusions in Conrad Aiken's Mr. Arcularis", in <i>Twentieth Century Literature</i> 1956, p. 23, briefly discusses a reference to the line "When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a Fish" in the work under discussion. (Both references courtesy of <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>.) Google indicates that this line has also been recycled in a song on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Muppet_Show_81a4.html" title="The Muppet Show">the Muppet Show</a> at some point.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am open to the possibility of this article being deleted. It is admittedly crudely presented and the information must be regarded as unreliable as it clearly conflicts. It is not an attempt at a disambiguation page. It is a start which I will follow through on and which I hope others will support me on. To clarify my intentions for this article, it should become a biography of Langdon Smith, the poet and whatever else he was (sources conflict horribly). He is noteworthy for having written "Evolution," a well-read poem. I've been looking for more information on the man. It seems many people on various internet forums have expressed interest in finding out more about him. For this reason, I feel this article could blossom into something quite valuable. Then again, maybe starting from scratch with more solid information is the best way to go about this, so long as someone does it. I would like to contribute. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooper_9361.html" title="User:Chooper">Chooper</a> 08:09, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Having done further research, it seems clear that this will be a difficult case. Langdon Smith's life does not appear well documented. There are several strong resources I may be able to enlist over the next week to dredge up more information on the man. It may ultimately be best to delete this entry all together, and begin a new one under the little "evolution," which might be appropriately referenced in a disambiguation page for evolution. In any event, interest in the matter is strong, but centered heavily around the poem rather than the man. Therefore, an article under that title may be better. Perhaps this is something some of you may be interested in helping with. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooper_9361.html" title="User:Chooper">Chooper</a> 09:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.

If, however, there is strong interest in his poem, I would not oppose the creation of an article entitled Evolution (poem). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielrocks123_a894.html" title="User:Danielrocks123">דניאל ~ Danielrocks123</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielrocks123_3980.html" title="User talk:Danielrocks123">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielrocks123_5c74.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielrocks123">contribs</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Danielrocks123_a345.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Danielrocks123">Email</a></sup> 18:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, if you are right about current consensus, <i>maybe</i> this should be merged. If so, it seems like a strange policy to me. That means that, as long as there is someone willing to input the text, <i>1000+ losing candidates</i> from <i>every Canadian federal election</i> can have 2-3 paragraphs of Wiki space devoted to them <i>with zero notability required</i>. When you think of all the other federal and provincial/state level elections run in all the other countries, we are now talking about millions of unnoteworthy, non-election-related bios.<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 03:01, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. For an emotionally charged subject, the article does a pretty good job of keeping the POV under control. Also, to rebut Tbeatty, the George W. Bush article is already long enough; this was split off to give the subject justice. There is a section concerning public perceptions of George W. Bush in the main page; however, that is somewhat of a rump, and should remain so for those who simply want an overview of the President. As another note, I fail to understand how the subject is not notable enough for Wikipedia, as Aeon suggested. Given the obsessive amount of attention given to Bush's poll numbers in the press and how his approval rating may or may not determine control of American politics for years, somewhat independently of actual criticism or support of his policies, the subject has more than exceeded notability threshold. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captainktainer_76e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captainktainer">contribs</a>).</small><br /></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That isn't always possible for a long page. For that matter, while I could see that being an important guideline for a paper encyclopedia, Wikipedia is not paper. Context can be aided by having one tab (or window, for those still stuck in the browsing dark ages) open with the main article and one open with the subpage in question. The George W. Bush page is just too long to go merging this in. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 17:48, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no reason all this content has to be on the main Bush page, but a more reasonable division would be foreign policy/domestic policy/Katrina/the Plame scandal/etc. Then each topic could be covered completely in the relevant article, with its context. The fact is that unless our actual articles on Katrina, the Plame scandal etc. are very poor, all of this material is repeated elsewhere. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 18:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- My suggestion for the article, should it go forward, would be to focus on the "whats" (i.e. what those mainstream media <b>reported</b> perceptions and <b>reported</b> poll numbers are), rather than the "whys" (i.e. piecing together his bad acts to show why he's a bad guy). In that way, we could objectively describe the current "public perception and assessments" as the article is named, and avoid argumentative synthesis.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If this article needs to be better sourced and less POV, there are specific templates that can be used precisely for that purpose, and indeed some are. There is a lot of interesting material, it just requires some more work to make it more presentable, sourced and NPOV. Deleting it would be a waste. This article is being attacked (in a biased campaign for deletion against anti-Bush topics) for the POV of the subject matter, independently from the POV within the article. Note that this campaign is being done in the name of NPOV, while clearly attacking a specific POV is POV in itself. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 05:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Living in Tokyo, you probably don't understand that some of Sydney's bus routes have historical information that could be added (being former well-patronised tram routes etc). There are also many other articles from Australia and other countries that have lists of bus routes. Sure, individual bus routes or stops would probably not be notable enough to have an individual page, but a list of them should be fine.

<dd>Living in Sydney, you probably don't understand that there is a larger world outside of city boundaries which doesn't have the slightest interest or use for information of purely local -- and a narrowly defined "local", at that -- and trivial detail best served up by the people in charge of it directly to their particular consumers and customers. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:18, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you understand my point - there is a place for having transport information about each city on Wikipedia. For some reason, a lot of Americans on WP seem to think that it is their domain. Australian articles and cities are underrepresented. Sydney is one of the world's biggest cities with a complex network of buses, not a country town with a few buses every couple of hours. Why can't we list some of our bus information on WP to demonstrate its coverage? WP is not running out of space - there is plenty of room for lots of articles. There is no need for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The short answer is per Metropolitan90, but I'll make some points:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The content of these articles is indiscriminate - the only criteria for inclusion seems to be that they once existed. It should be obvious that creating lists of all scheduled mass transit routes that have ever existed anywhere in the world is impractical, and of questionable value, so some sort of notability criteria needs to apply.</li>
<li>If the intention is that the criteria is "routes that currently exist" then there is an issue with these lists simply being a mirror (and WP is not a mirror) of information that is already available at <a href="http://www.131500.info" class="external free" title="http://www.131500.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.131500.info</a></li>
<li>While not usually grounds for (immediate) deletion, <i>not one</i> of the nominated articles contains a single reference. As the articles have presumably been assembled from a primary source (ie bus timetables or 131500) and not simply from the editor's remembered knowledge it is somewhat dissapointing that no effort was made to provide any references.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not against information on bus services per se, but think that the information needs to have some sort of context. They should be something that someone can read and learn something from, and not just dry facts that are about as interesting to read as a bus timetable. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 08:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bus routes don't change that much and there are editors who are happy to change them when they do. This is not an argument - it was already refuted in the first AfD nomination. You have not addressed the fact that there is valid historical information for some of these routes. And then there is the precedent that every other Australian capital city with buses has an article in the same manner, as does Hong Kong, London and other places as well, many of which have survived deletion attempts lately. I know there is no "precedent" policy on WP but it does give support to merging or keeping the information.

<li>The bus information in the form listed here is not available from any one web site. 131500.com.au is a transport info site for Sydney - you have to look up each bus individually, and it does not give "via" information that is located on WP.

There are at least 15 bus operators in Sydney too, so it is not as if it was taken from a single website (as might be the case for an intermodal transport system, which does not exist in Sydney.)

There are historical remnants of the old tram routes along some of these bus routes, like old bus shelters and bus-only lanes which were used as tram lines before the trams were torn up. Secondly, this is NOT a timetable or bus schedule. I have said elsewhere that the timetable-like information would be deleted leaving just the bus routes and where they go, which has been established elsewhere as being worth keeping. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. Why are its bus routes not worth keeping, whereas everywhere else is? Please answer that question and don't just quote <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> all the time. There has been no non-notability established for lists of bus routes. Individual bus stops are not notable, but that is not being debated.

<li>1. I don't see how the existence of historical information of <i>some</i> lines translates into a meaningful argument for keeping those lists. 2. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't exclude bus timetable or schedules. It excludes directories. And according to the definition of <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory_%28database%29.html" title="Directory (database)">directory (database)</a> it links to, this list falls squarely under that category. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:01, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. The historical information has been the way that other such articles have been kept. 2.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - If the notability of these routes is based solely on them following old tram routes, then that should be included in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trams_in_Sydney_11b4.html" title="Trams in Sydney">Trams in Sydney</a> (as it already is for some routes eg 308 and 309). If the intention is to discuss the areas serviced by buses, then wouldn't that be better as prose within <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buses_in_Sydney_3ffd.html" title="Buses in Sydney">Buses in Sydney</a>? For example something like "Sydney Buses serves the North Shore as far north as Chatswood and East Lindfield, Frenchs Forest and the Northern Beaches. Main routes travel along Military Road and Pittwater Road, and main terminuses are Wynyard and Manly Wharf". To me that seems a lot more elegant, and a lot easier to read and understand than a long list. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 11:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because wiki is not paper is not grounds for "all inclusiveness", which these lists clearly are. We've been here before.

<li><b>Merge all,</b> as recommended by nom. Such tables of bus routes on Wikipedia, while not the most exciting of articles, do serve several important purposes. Such tables provide a place for the history of such routes to be placed, such hisotries which can be quite intriguing and usually not readily found on the bus company's web site. Furthermore, placing the bus routes in a centralized article deters the creation of stubs about individual routes.

<li><b>Weak Keep and Cleanup —</b> The "Joy English School" deserves a place on Wikipedia, just as many other schools have. The problem with this article is its tone - as noted by the nom, it reads like an advertisement - therefore I would reccommend the cleanup (perhaps rewrite) of the article to portray the group more as a school and less as a corporation. Also, independant, verifiable sources are needed drastically for the article to on wikipedia. I'm in the middle with my decision on this article, but as it is an article about a school - and the way it is written has probably contributed hugely to this AfD (the tone is like an advertisement), I'm leaning towards keep - with a huge cleanup.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup —</b> There are many schools that have Wikipedia articles, and so an article about a school might not necessarily mean it's a public relations piece, and can be notable. However, all the school articles are written from scratch and not copies of the school's website, and this article must follow the same rules.

<li><b>Comment</b> As copyright violation, the old text has to go via that route. The current draft at the temp page does <b>not</b> look promising. Claims that the school was founded in 1981 yet is one of the oldest schools on the island of Taiwan.

<p>As far as I can tell, this has no basis in anything. The first results in Google for "tooth fairy rule," aside from copies of this article, indicate that this concept doesn't exist except as nonce. The examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>As she sets off to retrieve her first tooth she knows that the most important tooth fairy rule is to never waken a sleeping child in the process.</i></li>
<li><i>...we have a rule in our house that tooth fairy money cannot be spent on sweets - its the tooth fairy's rule!! My children get a pound but...</i></li>
<li><i><b>The Tooth Fairy Rule</b> The child in the family always witnesses the supernatural events in a movie first and knows what's going on, but any attempts to tell the grownups will fall on deaf ears.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In searching Google groups, there does seem to be a concept remotely related to the one described in the article, but both of them appear to be nonce, or something close to it:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>He notes that people such as Hapgood and Gallex have done similar work, but "violated the one rule that astrophysicist Richard McCray calls the 'tooth fairy' rule, which states that a credible theory can invoke a mysterious unknown agent ('tooth-fairy') once, but only once. The above-mentioined authors' works contained a number of 'tooth-faries'. As to his own tooth-fairy, and the says "The only unknown agent will be the postulate of transfer of Eskimo [Thule Inuit - he previously notes that these Inuit were historically called Eskimo and for that reason uses this term] geographical information to Europe via Norsemen... I endeavor to supply a plausible basis for every other implication of a given interpetation".</i></li>
<li><i>Larry Niven is generally considered a "hard science fiction" writer. His knowledge of science is good, he always makes an effort to make his stories realistic, and generally sticks to "one tooth fairy rule" - a SF story may break one law of physics, but only one.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting as it is, neither of these sound like general-usage concepts, and I can't find anything closer than that. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 06:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have a problem here. I <i>know</i> that there is a school of science fiction writing that has a (paraphrased) "Take the existing universe; change or add one thing; and extrapolate from there." maxim. I <i>know</i> that Niven, Asimov, and others write like this. Yet I'm having trouble finding the sources from whence I obtained this knowledge. I've just checked <i>Asimov's Mysteries</i> and <i>The Long ARM of Gil Hamilton</i>, whence I <i>thought</i> I had obtained this knowledge (and also mentioned on Talk:Tooth Fairy Rule), and it isn't actually there. (They both discuss rules for writing <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_fiction.html" title="Detective fiction">detective fiction</a>.)
<p>On the gripping hand, I certainly don't recognize this as the name of a rule employed by such a school of writing, and the article is <i>zero</i> help in my remembering sources, given that it cites none at all.

<dd><b>Response</b>. I hope you don't mind my slight reformatting of your comment. The former claim: As you may know, books of cheesecake photos (<i>gurabia</i>) come out in Japan very rapidly. There are so many that even the illustrious folk who dutifully write up articles for <i>guraidoru</i> (bikini models) usually don't bother to list them, but there <i>is</i> a list for the pneumatic <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanai_Miri_9dce.html" title="Hanai Miri">Hanai Miri</a>. Note how many books of photos of her there have been in just three years. This list is complete with the "Romanji [sic] title" of each, but the photographer isn't mentioned, probably because very few people care. Some of these photographers — e.g. Sawatari Hajime and of course Shinoyama Kishin — are of course known, and perhaps justly so. (I've seen excellent, non-cheesecake stuff by Shinoyama.) But the mere fact that Ishikawa has churned out the photos for a number of examples of this dubious species of photobook doesn't impress me at all. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC) ..... slightly rephrased 08:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>: please don't quote Fleabay descriptions such as "extremely rare" or "famous". Even via Abebooks, which normally is considerably more civilized, there's at least one US dealer of east Asian books, a member of various serious-sounding organizations, who systematically describes every single book as "rare", "scarce", etc. I never even glance at Fleabay for books, but for cameras, even the Zorki-4 is routinely "rare". But yes, some people are paying lots of money for some of Ishikawa's books. Is this because of their perceived <i>photographic</i> value, or their titillatory (or other) value? As for the comparisons, offhand I'm not familiar with the latter pair, but I am hazily familiar with the Sturges and Mann. They're published (other than by publishers of <i>gurabia</i>, they're discussed, and they're exhibited.

That's all that Gomez says about him. You make the notability of Gomez an issue. It's not fair to judge her merits by the single, Hallmarky photo on display at that second link, but "Violeta Gomez" (of course <i>any</i> "Violeta Gomez") gets just over a thousand Google hits, so she too hardly seems to be all that much discussed. And as for the question of whether to delete Ionesco too, let's stick to the issue at hand: Ishikawa. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC) (minor revisions 02:54, 22 August 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li>Ok, let me be more explicit. I think it should stay because it is an interesting footnote in the (awful) history of paedophilia in Belgium. I have found very interesting that this is a pre-Dutroux affair thing (I think that his 'collectible' body of work dates back from the early eighties), but when you look at the work he has done in Europe, it is always pictures of Belgian girls taken in bourgeois houses of Belgium, or in the case of Sophie, of Spanish holiday getaways.

<ul>
<li>I really don't know. But is it really a footnote in this history? If so, I'd expect to read this; however, Ishikawa is not mentioned in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Dutroux_6c38.html" title="Marc Dutroux">Marc Dutroux</a>, or in the articles about him in the languages of Belgium: <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(fr:) Affaire Dutroux</a>, or <a href="http://wa.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afwaire_Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://wa.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afwaire_Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(wa:) Afwaire Dutroux</a>, or <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaak-Dutroux" class="external text" title="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaak-Dutroux" rel="nofollow">(nl:) Zaak-Dutroux</a>. Indeed, Ishikawa is mentioned nowhere in French, Wallon, Dutch or Japanese Wikipedia. And even within en-Wikipedia, his significance to photography, paedophilia, etc etc is so great that not a single article other than a disambig page and a list links to the article about him. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's right. Nobody can <i>prove</i> that somebody is not noteworthy. There's always a possibility that that person is noteworthy, and that evidence for this hasn't yet surfaced. It's for the advocates of the article to come up with evidence that the person is indeed noteworthy. If that evidence comes after the article is deleted, a superior replacement article can then be created. Simple re-creation of a deleted article is of course grounds for speedy deletion; but if this article is deleted because of a lack of evidence that (i) Ishikawa has published books notable for his contribution to them, (ii) Ishikawa's work is more than minimally discussed, or (iii) Ishikawa has had no substantial solo exhibitions of his work, and if somebody later creates an article presenting plausible evidence that one or more of (i)–(iii) is mistaken, then that new article can be written accordingly and won't be speedied.

<li>"No deletion". The strongest points of a subcategory is the ability to breakdown a category that holds a massive amount of information. 'Mulatto' generates an extensive amount of information and people who fulfill that category. Mulattoes do not make up a signifigant amount of the population, just the entertainment culture. Excluding a mix such as this can almost be seen as discriminatory, as you are allowing certain mixes to qualify for catergorization and others not to.Americanbeauty925 07:59, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Several wrestling promotions are listed in Wikipedia. PWU has hosted matches unique to the pro wrestling industry &amp; uses many names recognizable throughout the world &amp; currently has more attendance than any promotion currently in the region. PSPhenom 03:19, 22 August 2006</p>

<dd>Yes several other promotions are, and those have ascertained notability to their subjects. Your claim it has more attendence is flawed considering <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_Zone_Wrestling_4dc5.html" title="Combat Zone Wrestling">Combat Zone Wrestling</a> does the most shows out of the ECW arena as well as being one of the top independent promotions in America.

<p>PWU was featured in Mexican wrestling press because of their working relationship with the native promotion XLAW. PWU also was featured in overseas press when they recently ran a show featuring Japan's Dragon's Gate wrestlers. Most recently they hosted a rare stateside appearence of Hayabusa and several Japanese fans attended as well as Japanese press. They are also worth noting because of their Crazy 10 match which was a first in Pro Wrestling history, not an easy thing to do. The Crazy 10 match featured 10 men, a steel cage arena, rope swings and more. This year's version featured even more elements like chain ladders, tables and ladders. -Asher Katz. 8.22.06 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.62.235.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.62.235.130_8e99.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.62.235.130">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep all except CRAZY 8; Delete CRAZY 8</b> - my views on wrestling as a 'sport' are quite unprintable. However, whatever its merits, it does seem to be very popular. These articles are mostly factual and verifiable. Also, there is reasonable coverage in the wrestling press. I think that a consultation on these wrestling promotions to determine some notability criteria would be a good idea.

<p>An entire article about a single Japanese interjection. This really does exist, although the first half of the explanation given for it in the article now is bizarre (or plain wrong). However, Wikipedia is not a Japanese–English phrasal dictionary, no matter how quaint the phrases. Although we're told that "The phrase was arguably made famous in English", its fame has eluded the editors of the English dictionaries at my disposal — and anyway, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a dictionary</a>. I don't recommend transwikiing, at least until it's clear that the phrase is used in English (other than merely among devotees of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</i>). Instead, I recommend simple deletion. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is a very strange article. It appears to have been created purely as a vehicle for a snippet of banal MGS-cruft trivia.<br />
If it is kept, the trivia needs to go; despite the weaselling "arguably", the phrase is not famous in English in the slightest, as witness fewer than 1000 ghits in English, and while I feel sorry for poor Volgin being struck by lightning, I really don't think references as obscure as that have any place in a general-audience encyclopedia.<br />
It also urgently needs a citation that supports the claim that it's "often used in Japan when something is felt to be 'out of place' or 'not right'", since the sources I can find only support the lightning-charm usage; and to be perfectly honest I've never encountered it in any context whatsoever, suggesting that even the "often" is dubious, though it's quite plausible that I just read the wrong books. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some things come up in researching this (in addition to the "Further reading" section of the article, q.v.) that appear to support the nomination: "<a href="http://keithdevens.com/programming" class="external text" title="http://keithdevens.com/programming" rel="nofollow">He advocates something called Table Oriented Programming (TOP), that I've never heard of anywhere else.</a>", "<a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000374.html" class="external text" title="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000374.html" rel="nofollow">You can tell that this came from a DB head.</a>", "<a href="http://www.dbdebunk.com/page/page/2516966.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dbdebunk.com/page/page/2516966.htm" rel="nofollow">Not only marketing speak, but Orwellian NewSpeak too: ignorance passing itself up for innovation.</a>", "<a href="http://www.kx.com/listbox/k/msg06372.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kx.com/listbox/k/msg06372.html" rel="nofollow">ah yes, the notorious "topmind" of comp.object, he of the non-terminating anti-OOP rants.</a>".

<li><b>Weak merge</b>. Filtering out any contributions (either to the article, or to the references) that were penned by Topmind and not vetted by peer review--there may be enough left to merge into an existing relational article (which one, I don't know--<a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-Relational_impedance_mismatch_9df0.html" title="Object-Relational impedance mismatch">Object-Relational impedance mismatch</a> might be a good bet). The use of relational tables and such as a dispatching mechanism predates Topmind; and there do appear to be at least one or two cites to reliable sources on the matter. I won't comment here on the merits of Top's ideas (I've commented quite a bit elsewhere), but the merits don't matter for this discussion. Topmind's theories don't appear to be embraced by anybody but Topmind and are for that reason not encyclopedic, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> for "pet theories" and stuff made up in school one day (or even over the course of several years). --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 17:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Although the principal proponent, specific terminology, historical pedigree and background of this article may be considered questionable (at least by some), some of the underlying principles do have independent merit. Certain aspects of "table-based" or "query-based" (or choose another term) programming methodologies have gained serious formal consideration beyond just the narrowly focused interests of one individual. For example, the introduction of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_Integrated_Query_1413.html" title="Language Integrated Query">LINQ</a> into the CSharp programming language represents one noteworthy example of "table-based" or "query-based" concepts used to augment an established programming language. It would seem this article (or a more neutrally-presented, better cited version thereof) deserves some consideration at least on that basis.--<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreftymac_20ab.html" title="User:Dreftymac">Dreftymac</a> 20:48, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral</b>: I am with Dreftymac here. The concept of using tables (relations, decision tables, ...) as the main structuring tool is employed in the real world though it doesn't have a catchy name as OOP. Having an overview article comparing OOP and other methodologies with TOP (whatever the name) would be ideal. (The OR-mismatch article is too specialized for this.) The current text is not much informative and deleting it would make little loss.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of anyone else but Topmind propagating use of the term "table oriented programming". It is, however, quite fitting term (compare with "concurrency oriented programming" invention by <a href="../../../e/r/l/Erlang_programming_language.html" title="Erlang programming language">Erlang</a> designers) and due to the trolling became known among those methodologists reading comp.object. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 20:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Denneval) So wouldn't this justify the removal of Windows Vista? I mean, I understand that Wikipedia is NOT a "crystal ball"; Opus exists. I just don't understand the reasoning behind deletion of this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Denneval (<a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenneval_6e38.html" title="User talk:Denneval">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denneval_94c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denneval">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Windows is an established company with constant press attention--it thus satisfies WP policies concerning <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">companies</a>. A product still in development by one of the largest corportations in the world is in itself <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, even if it is never released. The argument concerning your company isn't just that the product doesn't exist yet, but that the company has received no attention (that I can tell) from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<p>(Denneval) So a company with no media attention is therefore not a candidate for a Wikipedia article? In the real world, this is called "prejudice". I'm so sorry that 24 kb is hogging up bandwidth from the online servers. Thank God Windows didn't have access to a Wiki in the 80s or they'd be nowhere today.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I feel Wikipedia shouldn't cover every news story or rumor.

Need to identify who the group actually is and title them as such. Group may well already have an article and if so incident should be merged into at most a small section in main article, if notable enough to stand on its own. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Supposedly well-known city in Tasmania. Well I'm Tasmanian - I've never heard of this place, and neither has Google. This page was prod-ed as a possible hoax, and the prod was deleted by an anon IP. The logo was "created from scratch" by the uploader. The most famous feature of this alleged city is the "Rawson memorial beach", named after the city's current (and apparently still alive) mayor. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 13:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Advert-heavy promotional page about a greeting card supplier of no apparent encyclopedic significance. Anyone think maybe it should be deleted? Snacky 13:14, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b> - The main significance is the way the greeting card market is starting to change with the new digital print technology and the internet. Remind4u uses both of these to allow Charity donations on any card to a charity you choose. That Charities logo is then dynamically printed on the back of the card. It is also a breakthrough for the Environment as a card is only printed when bought. The traditional market sends about 1/2 of the cards printed back through the system, with most of them getting destroyed. I think this should stay but with more information on the change of the market, environment, etc. Milesclee 13:27, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

That's about two more mentions than it'd probably get in any other encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'd like to give my reasoning here: first of all, I may be new to this, but it seems to me that if the article has survived two prior attempts at deletion that it must be pretty solid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, the number of articles the OrthodoxWiki boasts stands by itself as a strong indicator of the site's notability.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we are are in fact discussing a Wiki devoted to an entire religious subgrouping, which I would imagine merits at least some sort of mention. I cannot conceive of why anyone would wish to get rid of this. To those voting to delete this article, I would ask you to please thoroughly explain what led you to your decision, that I may better understand where the debate is.</p>

If there is such renown/notoriety, then the articles should reference articles other than the government sources. I would disagree that there is nothing more to say; at least for Ibrahim, the link to the summarized transcript presents Ibrahim's statements during the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, allowing at least a bit more to be learned.

<ul>
<li>We do have specific sources. If you look more closely at the links described as summarized transcripts, they are to two different pdf files, and the text around the link specifies the pages within them. (Not the same link as described in the nomination.) I followed that link for Ibrahim and read the nine cited pages - Ibrahim at least is real. I didn' follow that for the other, but I expect you will find enough evidence that they are also a real specific individual. Given the general difficulty with putting names of Afghans and Arabs into the English alphabet, there may be difficulties due to different transliterations being used at different times, but if so, there should be redirecting from the different transliterations to the most accepted one. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I actually read the Kako links, not the Ibrahim ones, and found a no mention of his name anywhere in the nine pages of interrogation transcript. Besides, why were these two not on the WashPost list and the list the DoD released pursuant to some court order, which were used to put together our list here? - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 03:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know why the various lists are incomplete and/or inaccurate.

There is at least speculation that the DoD list is/was incomplete by specifying only military holdings, but that wouldn't explain people who had CSRTs. Also see <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_detainees_missing_from_the_official_list.html" title="Guantanamo detainees missing from the official list">Guantanamo detainees missing from the official list</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Checking further, Kako is also listed in <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detainee_list.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detainee_list.pdf" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> (page 10) and <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> (page 11). So they are both real individuals. I suspect the omissions from the list are editorial errors/oversight. They ought to be on the list, which for these I think should be via merge/redirect. I tested 6 of the others in the category and found only 2 of the 6 in the list. Not a statistical sample, but I suspect that we have a massively incomplete list, and merge/redirecting the ommissions would be the fastest way to complete it. I also think that expanding the list to include the detainee numbers, painful as it might be to do by hand, would be the best way to check for duplications due to name variants and omissions. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 04:15, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Crazy Russian, there are many things about your plan to delete Guantanamo articles that I don't understand. Let me ask you to answer one of the simpler questions. you wrote, right above here that you read the Kako links. Are you really saying that you read the link to his transcript and could not recognize that it contained a claim of a terrible injustice? Can you explain why you don't think this claim of injustice is "notable"?</li>
<li>I expanded the article now. I have read something like half the transcripts. But I hadn't read Kako's until now. He is the fourth guy whose transcript I have read who was rounded up, and thrown in Guantanamo, for managing or guarding an armory.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/i/z/Hiztullah_Nasrat_Yar_7737.html" title="Hiztullah Nasrat Yar">Hiztullah Nasrat Yar</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasrat_Khan_c62f.html" title="Nasrat Khan">Nasrat Khan</a> were not as articulate as Kako's boss. But the Tribunal told him they couldn't find <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahim_Wardak_eca7.html" title="Rahim Wardak">Rahim Wardak</a>, the witness they requested, who they said could substantiate their claim that they were hired by the Afghan Defense Ministry to guard the armory. The Tribunal described Wardak as "an official" in the Defense Ministry. He was then the Deputy Minister of Defense. He is now the Minister of Defense. Now maybe they are lying. But isn't it noteworthy when we learn that the US intelligence establishment hasn't made any attempt to substantiate -- or refute -- the detainee's claims of innocence?</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasibullah.html" title="Nasibullah">Nasibullah</a>, similarly, was sent to Guantanamo when he was found managing an Armory. He however was able to give a credible sounding description of the inventory control he maintained over his weapons, and he was one of the 38 detainees the Tribunals determined had never been an enemy combatant after all.</li>
<li>Now Kako, and his boss, may have been lying. I know Bush apologists assert that every detainee who claims he was tortured or abused, and every detainee who has a reasonable sounding claim of innocence, is really just an al Qaeda operative, who was trained to lie. But Kako and his boss sound like they had easily verified alibis. Surely it is notable that the US intelligence didn't make any attempt to verify their alibis? -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 23:16, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- Disclaimer: I started this article.
<ul>
<li>No offense to CrazyRussian, the guy who nominated these articles, but I strongly disagree with your interpretation that "<b>there is nothing more to say about these guys</b>". Of course there is plenty more to say about these guys. The articles are stubs, with a lot of room for growth. As GRBerry pointed out each of the references in these outwardly similar articles contains the information to find the detainees transcripts. There are transcripts for 354 of the 759 detainees.</li>
<li>Some of the Guantanamo detainees would be notable, even if there was total agreement, around the world, that President Bush was authorized to strip the protections of the Geneva Conventions from these prisoners. <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Mehsud_b9f0.html" title="Abdullah Mehsud">Abdullah Mehsud</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulvi_Abdul_Ghaffar_3c85.html" title="Maulvi Abdul Ghaffar">Maulvi Abdul Ghaffar</a>, for instance, former Taliban commanders, who "returned to the battlefield", following their release. Other detainees say they are simple farmers, or innocent humanitarian aid workers -- not combatants at all. Their notability arises because of the unbridgeable chasm between who the Bush administration claims they are and who their transcripts establish they are. The <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denbeaux_study.html" title="Denbeaux study">Denbeaux study</a> published a methodical, systematic, statistical analysis of the allegations against 517 of the detainees whose cases were considered by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. What they found was at odds with the grandiose Bush administration claims that the detainees are all terrorists. When the Denbeaux study researchers analyzed the allegations, in detail, they found that more than 55% of the detainees aren't even accused of association with a hostile act. (<i>Note, this doesn't mean the 45% who are accused of association with a hostile act are guilty of association with a hostile act.</i>) I was able to devote some time to start to flesh out Al Sehli's article since it was nominated for deletion. The allegations against Al Sehli are in line with the conclusions of the Denbeaux study. He is one of those 55% who is not accused of a hostile act.</li>
<li>Approximately a dozen articles about Guantanamo detainees have been nominated for deletion so far. People leave messages on my talk page, or on the talk pages of articles about Guantanamo detainees. So, I have read lots of comments about how many of the detainees are notable. One user made the assertion when voting to delete one of the earlier article on Guantanamo detainees that <b>ANY</b> articles about Guantanamo would be <b>inherently POV</b>. and just an excuse for "America-bashing". I think that is nonsense. I think any topic can be written about from a NPOV, but that some topics just require a bit more effort. Based on the opinions of Users like that one, I have a theory that there is an inverse relationship between how firmly one of my correspondents accepts the Bush administration line that since the detainees are all terrorists it doesn't matter if they are stripped of the protections of the Geneva Conventions and the rule of law.</li>
<li>Sorry GRBerry, I strongly disagree with the position you expressed that since we haven't heard the intelligence analysts (classified) evidence against the detainees we can't write NPOV articles about them. The cases of these prisoners are highly controversial, so, when I write about them I make the effort to prove Zoe wrong, and prove that someone can write about controversial topics from a NPOV, if they make enough effort. People do challenge me. And I reply to all civil challenges that I am showing bias with a request for my correspondent to be specific about the particular passages they find biased. Except for some very occasional, very trivial lapses, my correspondents can't be specific. I think this means I have succeeded. I think this means that, contrary to the fears of contributors who were afraid that Guantanamo article would only be an excuse for POV America-bashing, these articles are neutral. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 12:50, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, GS, way to go, but nobody has said a word about America-bashing. Why don't you write a comprehensive article about "the unbridgeable chasm between who the Bush administration claims they are and who their transcripts establish they are"? With this many sources, it could achieve featured status. You can even use examples from dozens of these guys' bios. But to make individual articles <i>about the person</i> - only if they respect <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li>I am sure you aren't being serious. I am sure we all know that an article about the unbridgeable chasm between who the Bush administration claims they are and who the transcripts establish they are would be much more controversial than the existing articles, which let the bald, verifiable facts speak for themselves.

<li><b>Comment</b> Somebody mentioned this above, but as there's a lot of indenting already I'll start a new comment. As I've just written on my talk page, I think that the <i>unique</i> information in each article merged into a list would be a definite keep. Indeed, as someone else has said, there's enough material here to make a Featured List.

<li><b>Merge</b> per GRBerry. Most of the content of this article would be identical with that of several hundred others - that has "merge" written all over it. The collected article would certianly be highly important and notable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:33, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> by the way, I would like to commend <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a> on his hard work. Not changing my opinion about the article, but the sheer effort in building, expanding, and defending <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_working_Guantanamo_related_articles_which_have_been_nominated_for_deletion_2c45.html" title="User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion">User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion</a> is impressive.

<li><b>Keep</b>, we have thousands of articles about American bank robbers, kidnappers and rapists - I forsee somebody googling the names of individual Guantanamo detainees sooner than I see somebody googling random North Carolinans convicted of 2nd Degree murder. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">Speaker for the Dead</a>)</sup> 14:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Regarding "solicitation"</b>
<ul>
<li>I have created a table summarizing the dozen or so previous nominations to delete article related to the Guantanamo detainees -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_working_Guantanamo_related_articles_which_have_been_nominated_for_deletion_2c45.html#Guantanamo_detainees_whose_articles_have_been_nominated_for_deletion" title="User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion">here</a>. Feel free to read the previous discussions. Executive summary? IMO a significant portion of the comments of those who did not want to keep the articles explained their votes in politicall partisan terms. IMO they wanted to ban articles that they felt reflected poorly on the current US executive branch policy, without regard to how well document it was, or whether it was written from an NPOV.</li>
<li>The Nominator has put notes following some of the votes, pointing out that I let some other wikipedians who had shown an interest in previous nominations to delete Guantanamo article know about this nomination. The nominator and I have had an exchange on our talk pages where he explained why he thought this was a mistake on my part. I am not sure I agree with his reasoning. But, in the interests of co-operation, if I learn of a new nomination to delete a Guantanamo article, or, if I learn of a nomination intended to serve as a test case to delete all the articles or some portion thereof, like this one, I will update <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_working_Guantanamo_related_articles_which_have_been_nominated_for_deletion_2c45.html#Guantanamo_detainees_whose_articles_have_been_nominated_for_deletion" title="User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion">this table</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The expansion was done (or at least doable based on my research previously) using only the second of the two links described in the nomination as stock. This implies to me that many of these could, given the time and effort, be so expanded. With 347 stubs remaining in the category these are a test case for, I certainly don't expect anyone to get all the expansion done right away. But, I also continue to believe that merging to the list is sufficient handling for those not meeting the renown/notoriety test and/or lacking other reliable sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>347? The 6,000 pages of documents the DoD released contained transcripts of Combatant Status Review Tribunals and Administrative Review Board hearings for 354 detainees. I know that a considerable number have already been expanded. I couldn't tell you if half have been expanded yet. Frankly, I didn't anticipate people would want to delete perfectly good stubs offering only the justification that they look too similar. Unless someone wants to count, the number of unexpanded stubs would be somewhere between one and two hundred.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lar, you say you are not sure whether all the detainees are notable enough, in their own right? Can I ask you if you have read any of the articles where the allegations against the detainee and/or the detainee's testimony had been included, that you could offer as an example of a detainee who was not notable enough to merit an article? It would be helpful to me to hear what other people think is insufficiently notable to merit an article. I expanded Kako's article this afternoon. His testimony claims a great injustice. Now that his article has been expanded, are there any of those who voted to delete who still think he is not notable enough to merit an article? And, if you still thinks he doesn't merit an article, I would really appreciate an explanation. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 00:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

By reading the article, you can see that the page was most likely written by Rico. On top of this, most of the article on wikipedia is a direct copy from the <a href="http://www.ricopuestel.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ricopuestel.com/" rel="nofollow">about tab</a> on his site. Definitely a candidate for deletion based on vanity. The links on the bottom of the page include two links where readers can buy records. Advertising gets deleted too. If the page wasn't vanity/advertising produced by Rico, my vote might change. Google search (<i>"Rico Puestel"</i>) yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=rjB&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Rico+Puestel%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=rjB&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Rico+Puestel%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">7970</a> results, and he does have several records released/upcoming. I would say that he would be more notable than several musicians which have been allowed to exist on Wikipedia.

<dd>I am NOT at all surprised by this harassment from editors who believe the World revolves around the US.</dd>
<dd>This is not something that you understand therefore you want to delete it. This site is not an Internet Marketer nor is it non notable. Rare interviews from remote SEO firms outsourcing to the 1st World. I believe that there a more people that want to read this than you.</dd>
<dd>Author takes his own money and time and travels into remote areas that are on the United States State Department travel warnings list to secure interviews of very remote and very inaccessible Search Engine Optimization firms / sweatshops and give poignant views of the discrepancies between the cultures and the spread between the 1st World and the 3rd. This site serves as a caveat to all who would use fraudulent SEO firms in the 3rd World to attempt to garner priority and end up with nothing but getting ripped off.</dd>

<p>Market News First is in the infancy of becoming competition to a blend of Yahoo and CNBC.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> A show can be notable, however contestants on the show are not inhertently notable enough in their own right to garner then own article. Yes, they are notable within the scope of the television show, however, their notability has not expanded to a degree outside of that show in which they are their own seperate entity like other notable characters. Give them time, and maybe they will expand into their own space, however, as of right now, they are not noteworthy enough outside of the television show to be on their own. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 19:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jeffrey Meshel's book sales are not as high as they were when he was featured on national television (several times) however, he is considered parallel, albeit newly emerging, to other "field experts" such as Keith Ferrazzi (who is listed in Wikipedia, very similarly to the way Jeff Meshel is listed), and Harvey Mackay.</p>
<p>I am a little confused why Mr.Meshel's page is considered for deletion, when Keith Ferrazzi's is not. The issues up for debate are that it reads like a resume, citing his companies and achievements, however, Keith Ferrazzi's does the same. In addition, Keith Ferrazzi himself has commented in complete support and advocacy of Mr.Meshel's book and message. All the information is verifiable via the book's website and the on the book itself.</p>
<p>The issue also is that it promotes his book, company and book's website by including external links, however, Keith Ferrazzi's does the same. And if Jeff Meshel is considered by many within the field he is in to be highly reputable and along the same caliber as Keith Ferrazzi, (and Ferrazzi is allowed a posting of this nature) then a Jeff Meshel entry should be allowed as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I see no need to invent notability policy when the existing policies cover the situation. A Google for "jeffrey meshel" gets only 183 distinct hits, mostly book listings.

<dd>Interesting, I hadn't seen that -- thanks. I picked four at random, and one I had actually heard of, one worked on many Rolling Stones albums, one worked on the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin, and KISS, and one seemed marginally non-notable to me. Based on this limited survey, I think Jason comes in lowish in the ranking.

<dd><b>Weak keep</b> I don't have a strong opinion either way really, although I would say that what we're really trying to determine is whether audio engineers in general are notable after having worked with major-label artists. I suppose I would say so, and at the very least having recording-engineer bios would make nice complementary material to our considerable coverage of music and records. Producers, remixers, and DJs with major-label work are considered notable, so this isn't much of a stretch.

<li>This information has nothing to do with Mr. Saks other than he is the composer of these songs. Anyone that has an opinion differing than the malicious ones on the "Talk Memphis" page is accused of sockpuppetry. According to the rules of Wiki, "Anyone can edit." It does not state that anyone can edit as long as it meets the criteria agreed upon by Vary and her cronies. Since February I have pointed out that this was never about Mr. Saks but about a heading for Official Songs of Memphis. As a former Memphian, this is both notable and of interest. The information has been verfied. This is why I contacted the Memphis City Council in February 2006, to verify how many official songs of Memphis there were. Sadly this has turned into a personal and childish attack against Mr. Saks by you, Vary, and your peers. It appears that Mr. Saks is the only name on the page that is not an Anon. I'd like to see you list as much about yourselves as we know about Mr. Saks. The malicious comments on the page are not "harmonious editing" (Saxifrage's adjectives to describe himself). As an Anon since February 2006, it was I who pointed out the following: 1. The name of the contact to the Memphis City Council to confirm Official Songs of Memphis 2. Voodoo Fest was not an annual event 3. Clarence Saunders is important to the history of the City of Memphis and should be listed on a Memphis page. Each time I tried to point out constructive crticism to you and your peers, you did not want to listen and continued to besmirch Mr. Saks's name. It was never about Mr. Saks but about Official Songs of Memphis. I can also attest the following should not be in the Memphis article: "William Faulkner wrote most of his literary works in Oxford, Mississippi." "Alex Haley, author of Autobiography of Malcolm X and Roots was from Henning, Tn." While interesting, this information has nothing to do with Memphis. The information pertaining to Official Songs of Memphis is of interest, verifiable and should not be deleted.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoodro_8931.html" title="User:Boodro">Boodro</a> 01:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've not made any other similar charges, so I'm not sure where 'yet another baseless charge' comes into play. En.Wikipedia articles obviously focus on European and American interests, or non-native topics of interest to European and American audiences (otaku, manga etc etc), because that's where most of the editors and users live. I think that because of that, articles outside of the expertise of the core audience should be considered more carefully than the obvious vanity and nn cruft that is more obviously prod'able.

<p><b>Delete</b>. A google search returns no content about 'Wessner star' or 'Wesner star.' The article cites no sources. It describes a procedure that students can use to randomly select a response to a multiple choice test, mentioning unverified evidence that it returns an average score of 86.3%. On a four-option format, the average score actually obtained by random guessing is 25%. The information in the article is not only false and non-verifiable, but also potentially harmful to naive students. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesbit_c111.html" title="User:Nesbit">Nesbit</a> 15:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I looked very closely at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and didn't see "seems to be doing some pretty cool things" listed among the criteria.

<li>I should have been more explicit. "A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." Please review the entries under "External links', including the article from the Cambridge Evening News and various trade magazines and exhibitions.

<li>Actually, they don't. WP:CORP specifically excludes the company's own press releases. The <i>Materialica</i> article, for example, has "Source: Thermoteknix Systems Ltd." at the bottom of the article. It's a straight re-print of a corporate press release. The <i>Cambridge Evening News</i> article is a re-hash of another of the company's press releases, too. You can see many of the company's press releases <a href="http://www.thermoteknix.com/content/english/misc/publications/press/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thermoteknix.com/content/english/misc/publications/press/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - (Nick Comber) the article originally did not at all follow Wikipedia's entry rules.

Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> as Mr. Mohamed has not been "subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."

The National Post article probably counts, but that's only one. A Google test turns up unimpressive results (863 hits, none that jump off the page). My guess is that the trajectory of this individual will make him notable from a Wikipedia perspective at some point, just not quite yet.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for pointing out the problem with the Google News link. It has now beein fixed. The Toronto Sun article is a non-trivial published work which appeared in the Toronto Sun newspaper, as well as on its web site.

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, this anon. user has never before made a contribution to WP except to support this AFD. Second, "We" have been around for two years, or three, or whatever, is not criteria for establishing that your organization deserves an article on Wikipedia.

That, in and of itself, is laudable and commendable, but not notable from an encyclopedic standpoint. Links to your *own* organization's Web sites do not help to esablish notability.

<li><b>Strong Delete, Comment</b> Don't vote Keep twice. It's obvious your anonymous posts are made by you. You're missing the point again. Because your organization does good works does not establish notability from an encyclopaedic standpoint. Have you been reading the references that have been repeatedly posted on your talk pages? The conflict of interest is born especially from the fact that you are the pages' creator. Understand that Wikipedia is not a place for promoting your organization, or your achievements. It's not meant for human interest articles, but factual representation from a neutral point of view. I'm sure your organization will survive without the publicity it's garnering from Wikipedia at the moment. Wait for someone else to write about you.70.24.144.235 02:59, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Maybe revise?</i> I'm not a regular enough Wiki user to know the exact criteria (even after reading them, it's unclear exactly where this entry falls). However, as a newspaper editor in Toronto who has no connection to the Pillow Fight League, I can tell you that it is real. Stacey Case is a (fairly successful -- his work appears in major US glossies such as Esquire) visual artist and musician, and the PFL is more of an indie rock art project than it is an actual sports league. Hence the confusion. Locally, the event is currently at least somewhat notable, but this article does not exactly put forward the entire obective truth about what the Pillow Fight League is all about. Hope that helps.</li>

It's a service (and, I'd argue, an encyclopedic one) to tell people which games will work on which versions of the console. I'd like to see a little more verification, but considering one can just pop games into Xboxes, that's sufficient verification without including hundreds of weblinks.

<p>Man-Faye has the same relevancy than other otakus from whom there are not articles about because they are not relevant. Crossplaying, being mocked up on tv, and being taken out from a convention are NOT reasons at all to be there (same accomplishments than the Narutard and many others). Goggle has tons of examples of men dressed as a female anime character, and none of them deserve a sole article. This article doesn't have anything to add that is not covered in the Crossplay article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 19:03, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Man Faye is notable, more so by far than any other cosplayer, and despite repeated claims that he is not, he has continued to pop up over and over in various media. Complaints of POV during the last nomination have been addressed, and the article is fairly solid as it is. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 21:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Man-Faye is the more noteable of the cosplayers.crossplayers out there. The fact that he's been seen in national media (as opposed to fan sites a/or imageboards) is more than crediable enough to warrant inclusion.--<a href="../../../2/9/3/User%7E293.xx.xxx.xx.html" title="User:293.xx.xxx.xx">293.xx.xxx.xx</a> 12:39, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Strong Deletion</b></s> - The reason for the deletion is the subject of the article, not the content. Man-Faye utterly fails at accomplishing <i>anything</i> that makes him unique. The only point at his favor&#160;? appearing on TV as a laughable random guy. Compare him with [<a href="http://www.manoloeldelbombo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.manoloeldelbombo.com/" rel="nofollow">Manolo el del bombo</a>], who appears <b>on the spanish News</b> everytime he shows on any stadium, has twice the google hits of Man-Faye, is well beloved, and yet doesn't have its own an article (nor deserves it). Infamous local figures should also do something remarkably and <b>positive</b> inside its small group to deserve an article by itself. Having <i>poor taste</i> is not enough.

<dd>You brought it up.

<dd>You still don't understand my words. My point is that people whose fame is limited to an aspect of society should have made something worthwhile inside that aspect of society. Man-Faye has done nothing thousands of people haven't done on carvanal every year.

<li><b>Delete</b> - At the end of the day, the Mr. Faye isn't a historical figure nor is he a beloved or despised person: Merely a mediocre footnote in passing trends. Half the memes on Wikipedia are passing trends. It might be interesting to note which memes can stand the test of time, but it would simply bloat wikipedia trying to list them all. What Man Faye does is nothing new or noteworthy or particularly shocking. Let's try to trim wikipedia whenever we can; the rest of the Internet can carry on Man Faye. Emil_lang</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There are some articles on Wikipedia that simply boggle my mind as to why they exist, yet I don't think they should be deleted simply because someone may come along trying to find information about it that may not be found elsewhere. For example, I bet there are very few people today who would remember a mediocre 80's cartoon like Turbo Teen, yet there is an article here about it. Knowledge is knowledge, even if it's trivial.Djseifer 12:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are a lot of articles about video game characters, like for example characters from Suikoden, you can get a synopsis on. I wouldn't say that this info is particularly important, but it is nice to have! So why not have an article about Man-Faye. The article is not about adulating man-Faye but to inform for example european cosplay fans about this "event" in american cosplay culture. Wikipedia is a source of information, so why delete information, someone might be interested in? The article on man-Faye is well written and neutral in tone, so I say we keep it. 217.235.178.60 14:07, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I haven't said so. I have claimed, however, that he shouldn't have a wikipedia entry if he hasn't done anything remarkable (and that just going to conventions or appearing on tv on an irregular basis is not). The only remarkable things I can read on the article (and in forums) is: a) His cosplay is awful. b) He is somewhat popular. I can put here a link right now to a page with more than 300 people with awful cosplays (including sumo wrestlers dressed as Sailor Moons, with tested media coverage). Your only alternative, thus, is defending his popularity, which is a rather vague and POW term. My empyrical experiments with Google shown very low results for him (lower than obscure local figures), and many pages calling him a fad and an old meme (just like <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> on the above analogy), so I suppose I have the right to question his <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> status. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 22:13, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia's notability guidelines are to determine if he is notable, not if he has done something remarkable.

<li><b>Objection</b> I wouldn't dismiss <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_News_Network_d66a.html" title="Anime News Network">Anime News Network</a> as a <i>rumor</i> website, given it's one of the bigger anime news sites out there.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seeing there are numerous "pointless" articles on Wikipedia (Ranging from insignificant car models like <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keicar.html" title="Keicar">Keicars</a> to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercars.html" title="Supercars">Supercars</a> that may never hit US shores ever to even TV shows that may never get seen on US shores as well), there is no harm in having this article on Wikipedia. It's not a vanity article like some would lead to believe, and i'm not seroiusly convinced that those that oppose it have provided a valid reason. One contributor nominated the article <b>twice</b> for deletion (This AfD and one that ended up as a no consensus) and even Man-Fayes <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EMan-Faye_bc3f.html" title="Talk:Man-Faye">talk page</a> has shown his apparent bias.--72.234.211.221 22:21, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wrong title, wrong content.

I'm sure we have scope for an article on government tenders or some such, but this is not it, and fixing it would require wholesale removal of the existing content. Rarely have I been so tempted to simply delete out of process an article written by an adult, and only the involvement of editors who <i>might</i> take the trouble to fix it during WikiWoo's 48-hour block for disruption persuades me to give it the five days of AfD. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b> and <b>delete</b>. This isn't ready for encyclopedia space yet. Under a general, non-regional title, the article would seem to be about public procurement policies generally.

<li><b>Reply</b> How can you read the nominator's mind to determine her motivation? Even you say that the subject's notability is probably borderline, so how is that a bad faith nomination?

<dd><b>Reply</b> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a>, you misunderstand.

The fact you can see the book with your eyes (or whatever you mean by "looking") is not the same a verifing its existance through citing reliable unbiased third party sources.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: The author seems to be well known in a fringe group. His higher profile exposure is pretty minimal. More to the point, the article suggests merely that he writes about magic (with a k, of course) and then lists places he goes. This really tells us very little about why he would be known.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've read his work and googled NLP, his name turned up almost as often as Richard Bandler's. Phil's work is very interesting and important on different levels. He takes into account the esoteric, but also says it can be dismissed for purposes of trying out his work without those particular mental conditionings. He writes for both the lay man and the scientific commnunity. Its not easy to explain NLP to people, but I always recommend looking up Phil's work when people ask me what NLP is about. beatrix216.194.56.15 16:20, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Phill has been active in publishing on the subject of NLP and Magick for over 10 years now. He was an Early adopter of the web as a form of online publication with the webzine Paradign Shift in the early 90's. He also has participated as a speeker at several national conferences on Hypnosis and NLP. His books are real and only his early works were published by a small press out of chicago called eschaton books. They still have a web site <a href="http://www.eschatonbooks.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.eschatonbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eschatonbooks.com/</a>, though I think they may not be doing much these days.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Citations are needed, but the basic claims are not false (I can't speak for specifics). Merging into the number article would be difficult; the number article already has a few sentences on the phenomenon with a link back to this article, and there isn't room for more without unbalancing it, so a vote to merge is effectively a vote to delete. The only <i>valid</i> argument to delete that I can think of is that "tetraphobia" is not a widespread term, and may be a neologism; that could easily be solved by renaming the article, rather than deleting it.<br />
Note that the only pure "delete" votes are all flawed: the nominator and Nishkid64 are mistaken in their belief that this is a hoax, and Arkyan's claim that this article is "nothing more than a dicdef" is simply incomprehensible; a dicdef is a one-sentence article that does nothing but define a word, while this article is nearly 400 words long and goes into considerable detail about the phenomenon, which is precisely what distinguishes an encyclopedia from a dictionary. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability is not conferred by proximity or relation. The article provides no sources for its claims, and even so, being a "forerunner" or "precursor" means what?

<li>By what, exactly? Not a single source has been cited to establish anything, either in the article or in this AFD discussion. All that we have are a lot of editors asking us to take solely their words for things. We don't do that here. Indeed, it is the underpinning of our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy that we <i>cannot</i> do that here.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've added some references as requested. Much of the material requested for citation is common knowledge in Scottish political circles.

<li><b>Comment</b> the thing to do, if one wanted the article kept, would be to demonstrate notability and verifiability beyond doubt by including references from reliable sources. The Herald is a reliable source, so if you have access to the archives get busy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> surely one item in a collection of more than <b>23000</b> cannot be notable simply because of its inclusion in such collection. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 22:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A quick guide to what <i>I</i> think about Debian popcon by_inst:
<ul>
<li>&lt;5,000 - probably very important</li>
<li>5,000-10,000 - likely to be at least somewhat important or popular</li>
<li>10,000-20,000 - probably only marginally notable, maybe a list entry or merge candidate</li>
<li>&gt;20,000 - probably nonnotable, or old version of something, or some other chaff.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Just a very very very rough breakdown. My point is, #9258 by install isn't <i>that</i> bad. If you peer down from the list, you still see articles for software that are worse than that, above 10,000 line, for example, <a href="../../../d/o/k/DokuWiki_7bf9.html" title="DokuWiki">DokuWiki</a> and <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom_computer_algebra_system.html" title="Axiom computer algebra system">Axiom</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> She charted one single at #54 on a hip hop-only chart. In my reading of WP:MUSIC (which uses the word "hit" in reference to a song which has charted, and I wouldn't call #54 a "hit"), that does not assert sufficient notability. And since there is (literally) no other notability asserted in the article, I have to say delete. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:48, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. agree "hit" is poorly defined, so would pass under a liberal definition.

<li>The whole purpose of the creating the page is to find out where the saying originates from. Using the example of "Nit Nurse", it has been in circulation since the early 1900's but has not been documented until the 1950's. This fact originates from a BBC 2 programme (2005) about entries into the Oxford Dictionary. Many older people say they can clearly remember the phrase when they were at school i.e. before 1950.
<p>The people in the Scottish Borders know the phrase "your cats dead" but have no idea how it originated or where it came from. Wikipedia is an excellent medium to find out if there is a solid base to the phrase.</p>
<p>The phrase maybe like Sweet Fanny Adams (SFA) which has now transformed into Sweet F@ck All. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Conspectus73 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConspectus73_4a2e.html" title="User talk:Conspectus73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Conspectus73_1945.html" title="Special:Contributions/Conspectus73">contribs</a>).</small> <small>(Copied from Talk:Your Cats Dead.)</small></p>

<li>Counting Google hits isn't research. One has to actually read the web pages that Google locates. In your Google search did you find <i>anything at all</i> that discusses buckets and spades?

And the external links in this article are to an unadorned picture and to an article that is actually about <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaside_resort.html#English_seaside_resorts" title="Seaside resort">British seaside holidays</a>, which we already have an article on.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In one sense, "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red-light_district.html" title="Red-light district">red-light district</a>" is a disparaging term, but the term is still a valid one and in common use. I am not sure if this thing <i>ought</i> to be <i>useful</i>, but it does complement the red-light district article. The North America entries still need sources, but the list seems to be in reasonable shape. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but primarily because I think this information, if it's really necessary, should be contained to a list rather than having a huge category with potentially hundreds of titles (just judging from the official site's list, which is by its own admission, incomplete), just to avoid the overhead of a huge growing category that I'm not sure even really needs to be created.

<li>Counting Google hits is not research. In the prior AFD discussion, several of the web pages that Google Web finds were put forward as sources where people are discussing this purported phobia. (See also the critique of several of those sources by <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a>.) It was also mentioned that a lot of the web pages that Google Web turns up are joke lists of phobias, where this phobia is defined as a "fear of the return of 1970s hair styles". So ...

Searching -"fear of the return" still gets over 100 hits. And as you said in the previous AfD, afrophobia isn't a real phobia, it is a political buzzword and the article should reflect this. It shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 01:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Even the sources cited in the article do not agree on the definition of this word. It can mean either fear of doing business/conducting foreign policy in Africa or racism. In other sources it's used as a synonym for racism.

<li>In the last deletion discussion, I argued that it should be sourced or deleted. Reviewing many of the recent versions, my concerns about sourcing and verification remain. While several references have been provided which use the term "afrophobia", they still do so in significantly different and inconsistent contexts. I can not yet find evidence that this is an accepted term with a stable definition. It appears more to be a neologism that each author makes up independently to highlight a point in his or her particular article.<br />
