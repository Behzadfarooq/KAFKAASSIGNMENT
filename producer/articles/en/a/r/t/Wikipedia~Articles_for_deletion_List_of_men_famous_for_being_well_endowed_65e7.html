<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <font color="red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></font> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Ok, so fur numerical purposes, the following are discounted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eamon84</li>
<li>Wikipedian2005</li>
<li>Telestylo</li>
<li>Simonrexfan</li>
<li>Promisekeeper2005</li>
<li>Thearticulator</li>
<li>Shadow demon</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Shard and Robin Johnson each have around 10 Wikipedia: space edits and I'm usually minded to numerically remove them too. Angr's actual vote is a little unclear, but given the current state of the list and the apparent lack of persuasion among other deleters (i.e. not referenced adequately for them), it sounds more like a delete. In any case, excluding <i>all</i> the names I mentioned so far, I get 25d-11k. Including them all I get 28d-11k (or 27d if Angr's a delete). Further, Brazilfantoo's Wikipedia: space edits are almost exclusively to this AfD and so I <i>could</i> discount on that basis. Given the considerable energy invested here by that editor, however, for the numerics they are counted, and it would be hard to give the debate a sound reading without taking account of what they say. Whichever way, we're numerically over two-thirds and there is lots of participation. So is there a good reason to raise the deletion threshold? Well, from reading the debate, it is illuminating that the list of 'references' that is cited twice are actually just <b>pictures</b> and to reach a factual conclusion from them <i>necessarily</i> demands interpretation. That has been demonstrated quite clearly here to fall below the standards of NPOV and NOR in the opinion of significantly many participants. The references in the article clearly haven't satisfied many people either, and they don't appear to actually deal with the individuals in the article, with one possible exception. Lacking that kind of verification, the list is evidently below WP:V too. It is also apparent that the deleters are not in the least, in a single case, persuaded by the keepers and so I do not think there has been a change of perception during the debate as sometmies happens. It is often telling when the first response to the nomination is <i>"invalid because I don't like the reason"</i>; you have to counter the reason, not put your fingers in your ears. I also have no time at all for the parts of the debate centering on accusations of wanton censorship: it's just such a bald assumption of bad-faith that it doesn't fly; and I know enough of Shreshth91 that I genuinely don't think s/he'd nominate any article for that reason alone. Short answer: I don't find any successfully formulated and defended reason to consider that something in the region of 70% or more is not a reasonable threshold as oftentimes used in AfD closures, and so the deletes have it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is totally <b>POV</b>. Should be <b>deleted</b> as nonsense.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Suggesting deletion on the grounds of either POV or nonsense are both spurious. Please give a proper reason why you think this article should be deleted. --DannyWilde 10:09, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this article should be kept, for the reasons I stated on the discussion page. First, the very first paragraph of the page about <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a> talks about the fact that penis size is important to men. Second, if there is going to be a page on Wikipedia about <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a>, then why not a page about the kind of men that the size queens would like? Third, this is not POV because some of these men have been featured in videos and/or movies that demonstrate that they are indeed well endowed; and this page is not truly whether these specific men <i>truly are</i> well endowed, but that they have become <i>famous for being</i> well endowed (the fact that we don't have any pictures of Milton Berle nude never intereferred with the fact that he became famous for being well endowed). Go look at the page on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Berle_5435.html" title="Milton Berle">Milton Berle</a>; everyone who knows about him knows that he was famous for being well endowed, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Talk%7EMilton_Berle_be8b.html" title="Talk:Milton Berle">but no one felt they could mention that on the page about him because they didn't think it would be "proper."</a> This page gives them a place to mention something about Milton Berle that he was very, very famous for! Why is it proper to have a page about <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nude_celebrities_on_the_internet.html" title="Nude celebrities on the internet">nude celebrities on the internet</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_enlargement.html" title="Penis enlargement">penis enlargement</a>, and not a page on something that is often discussed in popular culture? If anyone can give me a good reason, then I'll vote for deletion. Until then, I say <b>keep</b>. (Did any of you see the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> roast of <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Anderson_9466.html" title="Pamela Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a>? Half of that special was made up of the comedians cracking jokes about <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_1336.html" title="Tommy Lee">Tommy Lee</a>'s endowment! And from what I have heard, that special was the highest rated program in Comedy Central history, therefore it is <i>notable</i>!) -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazilfantoo_7e98.html" title="User:Brazilfantoo">Brazilfantoo</a> 10:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> again. This discussion should not even be taking place. No valid reason to delete this article has been given. The article obviously is <b>not</b> point-of-view, and it is obviously <b>not</b> nonsense. I would vote to keep the article if I thought this was a genuine discussion, but the AfD nomination itself has not been justified at all and should probably be regarded as vandalism. Further, the AfD nomination was not properly carried out according to the Wikipedia procedure, and this article still is not showing up properly on the above page. --DannyWilde 11:29, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We already have a page like that: <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queen</a>. This page is nothing but a list of women who like men with big penises. If this is notable, then why isn't a page on the flipside of this notable? You basically have a page here saying "These women are famous for liking well endowed men," so how is it not acceptable to have a page that says "these men are famous for <i>being</i> well endowed"? -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazilfantoo_7e98.html" title="User:Brazilfantoo">Brazilfantoo</a> 06:32, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. And what gives you the right to say that? Listen, you may not like it, but the issue here isn't your own moral tastes. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Berle_5435.html" title="Milton Berle">Milton Berle</a> was a Hollywood legend, and hardly anyone can ever refer to him without referencing the legend around his big penis. The same goes for <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_1336.html" title="Tommy Lee">Tommy Lee</a>. The same goes for other men.

<li><b>Comment</b>: you misunderstand, I have no moral objection to this (or homosexuality, pornography, bestiality or necrophilia...). The problem is that it is inappropriate for an encyclopedia. It is for appropriate for tabloids, as others have pointed out. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:10, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. By what criteria do you judge that it isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia? First of all, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Fame.html" title="Fame">fame</a> itself is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a> is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">Penis size</a> is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_enlargement.html" title="Penis enlargement">Penis enlargement</a> is encyclopedic. Lists of celebrities who fall into various categories is apparently an encyclopedic thing (because they're all over Wikipedia). So how is it "not encyclopedic" to combine all of the above into a list of men famous for being well endowed? This just boils down to your personal opinion. And while you're at it, please explain to me why a list of women who have had breast implants and who are <a href="../../../s/i/z/Size_queen.html" title="Size queen">size queens</a> is not encyclopedic either. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazilfantoo_7e98.html" title="User:Brazilfantoo">Brazilfantoo</a> 07:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For the same reason that a list of tall actors isn't encyclopedic. It's trivial and arbitrary. However, these lists are even worse because they are based on rumor and conjecture. An encyclopedia needs verifiability. It's hard for a celebrity to hide the fact that he's 4'10", but if he says he has a footlong penis, he gets put in an encyclopedia for it, which is essentially the evidence given in some of the names on the list (Bill Maher, for one). Even the ones for which there is visual evidence, you're just going on "it looks big." It should be quantifiable. Also, it seems that some of the men were flaccid. That's a problem because some men don't get much bigger when they have an erection. The implant list has the same problem. For some it is easy to tell because their breasts have big scars and look like plastic bags full of water. For others, it is just going by "they appear to be large, and if a woman isn't fat, they couldn't be that big" or "she developed too fast" kind of thing. For the size queens, it comes down to trivia as well. How about a list of celebrities who like bunnies or chocolate? (oh god, I hope we don't have one of these). As for this information being in the biographies, I would say only if it is an important part of the person's notability, like Tommy Lee or Pamela Anderson. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> only if "well endowed" can be specifically defined in terms of inches and centimeters and if all entries are verifiable. In other words, no one can be listed just for being rumored to have a big dick. Also, the title must be adhered to: List of men <i>famous for being well endowed</i>. Milton Berle was famous, and he may have been well endowed, but he wasn't famous <i>for being</i> well endowed. Men who are famous for being well endowed are almost entirely porn stars like Kevin Dean<a href="http://www.docjohnson.com/productImages/470.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.docjohnson.com/productImages/470.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Rick Donovan<a href="http://www.sexyadulthost.com/users/menofporn/gaystuff/videos/rickdonovan_big.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sexyadulthost.com/users/menofporn/gaystuff/videos/rickdonovan_big.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Milton Berle didn't become famous for his size, but his size WAS famous. It was talked about all the time, and it is discussed on the talk page of his Wikipedia page. Maybe the name of the page needs to be changed to something like, "Famous Men Who Are Known for Being Well Endowed" or something like that. But disagreeing with the title of the page is hardly a reason to delete the page. Renaming the page sounds more logical. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrazilfantoo_7e98.html" title="User:Brazilfantoo">Brazilfantoo</a> 07:42, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Several of the voters in this discussion have extremely short lists (in one case only two edits, in another only five) of "user contributions". Also, can someone explain why people keep saying the article is POV? I don't understand that comment. It doesn't seem any more "point of view" than a list of long bridges or deep tunnels to me. --DannyWilde 06:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply to comment</b>. User contributions may not necessarily affect judgement (even though their lack of experience may be unsettling) but the fact remains that all valid votes are counted, irrespective of number of contributuions. ALso, this list is POV because who gets to decide which of these men are famous for large endowments. For example, Milton Berle was famous and he may have had a large endowment, but he was not necessarily famous for it. Same is the case for Tommy Lee. Also, there aren't any sources or pics proving these claims. Most of the links are to blog sites holding discussions about these claims and nowhere is even one source stated.

<li>What you say about "equal votes for all" contradicts the official Wikipedia policy document on deletions. About POV, your opinion makes no sense; the same logic could be applied to any Wikipedia article at all. Who decides who is in the article is the editors of Wikipedia. As for verifiability, several of the claims, such as the ones about Tommy Lee, or Jimi Hendrix, in the document can be verified, and there are indeed pictures, so it is clearly not rumour mongering. --DannyWilde 07:25, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>I</i> keep saying "verifiably big" in response to others. If you want a definition of what "big" is, then read the page on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html" title="Penis size">penis size</a>. The more direct answer to your question is: the public decided who is "verifiably big". <a href="../../../v/h/1/VH1_84a4.html" title="VH1">VH1</a> has a special called "I Love the 90s." In that special, there was a man saying that <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_1336.html" title="Tommy Lee">Tommy Lee</a> was huge and a lot of black guys (this guy was black) were saying, "Oh, he's like us."

<li>On the contrary, the reasons you originally gave for deleting the article are spurious, so the motivation for the deletion is, presumably, censorship.

<ul>
<li>You seem to be implicitly admitting that the POV and nonsense arguments were invalid. That is some improvement in the quality of the discussion. As for verification, it is an important point, but that is more a matter for individual entries than an article-wide problem. I've added three entries, Jimi Hendrix, Errol Flynn, and Shunga. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> is clearly verifiable, since numerous Hendrix biographies mention the fact. Similarly for <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Flynn_9845.html" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>, at the very least David Niven's book makes the claim. Similarly <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunga.html" title="Shunga">Shunga</a> have been displayed at art galleries, etc. and published many times. That deals with the three entries I've made to the article. The other two mythical entries similarly should be easy to verify from printed sources. As for the rest of it, some of them, such as Tommy Lee, appear to be wrong and should be removed from the article or put into a different section. --DannyWilde 14:25, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

If <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubya.html" title="Dubya">Dubya</a>'s IQ is provably low, then I don't see any objection to adding him. If there is an untrue rumour that he has a low IQ, I also suggest adding him, and setting the record straight about the untrue rumour. However, as far as I know, there is no such published rumour. The only people I can actually think of famous for having a low IQ are fictional characters, the lead character of the movie "<a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawnmower_Man_b00c.html" title="Lawnmower Man">Lawnmower Man</a>" and the novel "<a href="../../../f/l/o/Flowers_for_Algernon_1f08.html" title="Flowers for Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a>".

</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. This page is an inherently non-NPOV contruct. There is an attempt on the list to define neutral terms for inclusion: "<i>having a penis bigger than what statistics reveal to be average.</i>" I'm not precisely sure of the exact figure, but I believe at least one clinical study has found the average length to be around 5" (in USA). This means that a man with a penis 5.2" long is eligible for inclusion. However, would the page's editors agree? Further consideration should also make apparent that the list's stated inclusion criterion is quite absurd: it means that as long as a man has a penis that is longer than the average, he is eligible for listing, ie. 50% of males. The addition of "famous for" in the title is unhelpful, both due to the vagueness of "famous" (should we include a man with a penis 5" long who is famous for it in his remote village in Obscureland where all the other guys have 4"?) and also because most of the men on the list are <i>not</i> famous <u>for</u> having large penises. A comment was made that the solution to POV problems is not to delete but to edit. This is perfectly true, except when the construct is such that it <i>cannot be brought to NPOV</i>. We routinely delete problematic categories for exactly this reason, for example. To state it another way, it's the same reason List of uncool countries is a red-link.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. This may be more obvious. How is the info being verified? Many of the Listees are "rumoured", "believed", or "said" to be "well-endowed", which is quite unacceptable for encyclopedic lists. There is a suggestion that videos are sufficient. They aren't, because A. most of the Listees have no video evidence, and if we delete them we'd have almost nothing, and B. it's untrue that videos would help, because of the WP:NPOV problems in 1. For example, the article claims that Tommy Lee is "famous for being well endowed [but] verifiably [isn't]". How do we make that decision neutrally? Was he acceptable per the alleged inclusion criterion of "bigger than average"? (ie. is he bigger than 5"?) If so, how was it decided that he would be labelled "verifiably not well-endowed"? Indeed, how was it decided what length defines "well-endowed"? If that length is X", would X-1" make the owner automatically "not well-endowed"?
<p>There are other WP:V concerns. Clinical studies always record the precise method measurement, and the state of the penis. How do we determine from the videos and images what the length actually is? Is it simply: "Oh... that's big. Ok, we can hereby claim that he's famous for being well-endowed?" That's not acceptable for an encyclopedia, IMHO.

<li>Some of those people clearly are in there because they made a lot of jokes about size, and there is no proof that they have any size at all. But, for example, if there was a page "comedians who make jokes about their oversized parts", what would be wrong with that in terms of bias? That is basically what is happening in that section. Also, some men actually are <b>famous for having large penises</b>. Errol Flynn &amp; Jimi Hendrix are good examples here, who fully meet the Wikipedia verifiability criteria. Also, the mythology section is actually worthwhile in itself, in my opinion; it is clearly a common theme in many cultures, and gathering a collection of mythological figures of this type is a valid exercise. As I stated before, I believe the basic motive for the delete votes is censorship, more than anything, and I feel that this censorship is what is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. --DannyWilde 14:24, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello Danny, thanks for your response. I must disagree. Hendrix and Flynn were not famous for their penises: Hendrix was an iconic pop musician, Flynn an early Hollywood star. They were famous—ie. people had and have an abiding interest in them—principally for those roles. They were not famous <i>on account of</i> their penises; that some people appear to care about their penises cannot be taken to mean that they were famous for them.

<li>As a matter of fact, my name isn't Danny. Anyway, you are incorrect, Hendrix and Flynn were both famous for being well-endowed. That may or may not be their principal claim to fame; however, the statement "famous for being well endowed" about Hendrix and Flynn is a <b>factually correct</b>, <b>neutral point of view</b>, and <b>verifiable</b>, statement. --DannyWilde 00:37, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello. I used Danny as a contraction for the username DannyWilde, not because I imagined it was your real name. As to your contentions, I'm afraid they continue to remain unconvincing. I suppose in response to your latest I could write about why, simply because David Niven wrote in a book about Errol Flynn's penis, the factual accuracy of the claim "Errol Flynn was famous for being well-endowed" is not, thereby, supported. Or I could say something about why, since "well-endowment" is an entirely subjective point-of-view, placing names (while explicitly excluding others with objectively very similar "endowments") under the List's title cannot be in concordance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Or I could point out that the sole inclusion criterion—silly as it is—is simply being disregarded in favor of non-NPOV judgements such as <i>Tommy Lee... became famous for his large endowment... However, in reality the videos and photos of Lee do not show a notably above average size</i>, and <i>Simon Rex... is famous for his above-average endowment... However, in reality the videos and photos of Rex do not show a notably above average size</i>. But I suspect further discussion with you on this AFD is unlikely to be productive, DannyWilde.

<li>Problem is the list is not neutral, arguably cannot be neutral in its present form, and has very, very serious problems with verifiability and the WP:NOR policy. A good argument could also be made that the list is unencyclopedic, ie. not deserving of a page in a good encyclopedia. I agree that the issue of penis size can be treated encyclopedically—indeed, you could write a book on it—but that is not what this list is. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>20:33, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>There is no particular problem with verifiability. The Wikipedia criteria for verification require that there is a published source for the information, from a reputable publisher. The entries which cannot be verified can be removed, but, as I have already stated, several of the entries meet and exceed the "verifiability" criterion. The "no original research" really is unrelated, yet another attempt to tag the article with a "boo boo" word; "Delete, because it's a camembert", without thinking about what "original research" means; in other words, more name-calling, attaching labels like POV, nonsense, etc. etc. in an effort to censor the article. As I stated at the beginning of this discussion, no genuine policy reason to delete this article has been presented. --DannyWilde 02:10, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As has been previously pointed out, there are profound problems with verifiability. WP:V and WP:RS demand that the claim being made be verified by reference to reputable, independent publications. Claiming that R.Kelly, for example, is "Famous for being well endowed" requires a reference attesting to precisely that claim. A grainy screen shot of a sex video, with his penis completely covered, simply does not do that. Of course, <i>any</i> kind of image wouldn't: we cannot verify "<i>famous</i> <u>for</u> being 'well-endowed'", whatever that really means, with reference to an image. Note too the injunction in policy: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If an editor wishes to claim that an icon like Hendrix is famous <i>for</i> being 'well-endowed', rather than being famous as an iconic pop musician who happens to obtain the usual adolesecent attentions of a coterie of penis enthusiasts, evidence that shows precisely that should be provided. WP:NOR and WP:V, which are closely related, do apply. What's happening here is a few editors are making claims on that page sans evidence; instead they reference images from unreputable websites, and then <i>interpret</i> the images according to a POV, and claim this as evidence (see what's been happening with the Tommy Lee claim, for example). Looking at an image purportedly of Mr. Lee's genitals—just the image—and then claiming in the article that "in reality the... photos of Lee do not show a notably above average size" is a misrepresentation of the source, and suggests a poor understanding of how to use references.
<p>To get from [image] → [POV interpretation, eg. "<i>XYZ is <b>famous</b></i> for <i>a large penis but in fact his penis is not very large</i>"] is to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>contravene NPOV,</li>
<li>contravene WP:V as the <i>claim</i> is unverified (read the claim and ask yourself how an image can substantiate it), and</li>
<li>probably contravene WP:NOR, because for this determination to be made not from a study or report or textual reference but from an image suggests these editors are making their own measurements and interpretations when deciding whether to include an entry (and how to word it).
<p>Incidentally, I second the call to close this AFD soon, as it is well past the standard 5 days. I hope we won't have to spend much more time discussing this trivial topic. I have felt ridiculous writing about this here, but soldiered on out of regard and concern for Wikipedia and the profound need to maintain encyclopedic standards for our project.

<li>"Silly list" has a grain of truth in it, but is that a valid criteria for deletion? For example List of famous bald people seems faintly silly to me; do you think it should be deleted? Or, since we have seen on this page an opinion that the word "famous" is a point of view word, should it be deleted for containing the word "famous"? Or, how about "bald"? Should we delete it because there is no standard definition of "bald", or should we insist on a verified maximum follicle count? The people saying the article is "unverifiable" or "point-of-view" or "nonsense" just don't know what the words they are using mean. The discussion on this page has not been much more convincing than "Delete it because it's an omelette". Once one type of "it's an omelette" name-calling has been dealt with, we move on to the next attempt to find any applicable tag to delete the article, "Delete it because it's a poached egg", etc. --DannyWilde 13:33, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
