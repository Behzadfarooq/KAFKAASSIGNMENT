<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>- It is difficult if not impossible when there is a story of this magnitude to grasp the enormity of it all at once. In any event of this scale, the stories that often hit home the most, and give the best perspective about what the people who lived through it endured are the stories that bring home the individual and personal tragedies and hardships such as this story does. It is unlikely that people will remember exactly how many people lived through the horrors of the Superdome, or the precise number of buildings destroyed, or even the total of how much money was lost. While those kinds of “metrics” might well be important, they don’t tell the story of the people who lived through the disaster. This is one example of a story that does.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Where else can I get all the facts about this? It's of great concern to those who understand what it's like to be closer to your cat or dog than anyone else in the world. It's not just the story of a dog, it's a statement of our society. An important one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The level of concern and activity it has generated (websites, organized search efforts, $13,000 in rewards/family donations) and the fact that it is ongoing, (Snowball has not really been found yet as you will find if you go to KatrinaPetfinders.com), is enough reason. There are many, many people who will not forget this story for a long time, if ever.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Merge</b> into one of the hurricane articles. the american media has a habit of making the most unnotable things notable, tho not being in the states i dont know how much effort theyre putting into snowball. certainly doesnt warrant more than a sentence. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 01:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. At this point, the dog is hardly known, and banking on some notability catching up to buoy the article later is too much. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news portal. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:55, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Interesting as a minor media phenomenon and one of the primary human interest stories to emmerge thus far from Hurricane Katrina. <a href="../../../c/n/i/User%7ECNichols_7db0.html" title="User:CNichols">CNichols</a> 02:12, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>KEEP - it is noteworthy because it has been so widely reported and talked about</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep, partly because I'm in an inclusionist mood, partly because Geogre's reasoning annoys me, since the whole notability of the dog is based on what has already happened, i.e. this news report this article cites—nothing to do with a "crystal ball" whatsoever. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:13, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Crystal ball" was about whether this particular media belch will still be noticed 6 weeks from now or 6 months from now. Let's establish just how widely discussed this dog is, then realize that in-the-news is not part of article space. This is just a soap bubble, at this point -- some red herring the media chased. When it establishes staying power, it would be useful to document it. There hasn't been enough time for it to establish itself yet, and we're not in the business of predicting which submania of the news services will last and which will not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But by voting to delete, you are putting yourself in that business. Right? The correct policy to follow if you don't want to be in that business is to let someone make the article if they want, and re-evaluate later. Everyone's notability changes over time. This is a living encyclopedia, and if Snowball is forgotten in a year, delete the article at that point. As you say, it's silly for us to try to predict notability. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 23:34, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should point out that this is not the general understanding of notability. We generally view notability as independent of the passing of time; something can't be notable one day and non-notable the next. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:46, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable enough to have major coverage with multiple segments on CNN, MSNBC and FNC subsequent to the initial AP reporting. Further, this incident was key in evacuation officials re-visiting the "no pets" policy, and has been used by SPCA and the Humane Society to raise funds for pet relief and evacuation which has already topped donations for Tsunami relief raised earlier this year. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 11:01, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>delete</b> per Geogre or <b>merge</b> per Nateji77. If the long-term policy effects suggested by Nicodemus75 are shown to be based on this one dog rather than the general situation, I would change my vote to "keep", but I'm inclined to consider those orgs' use of this dog as their "sad cute face of the week", with no more individual significance than one child in an ad for Save the Children. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This noteable incident reflects the hardships that people suffered as well as animals in a catastrophic event. I would hate to have to compare this to any World War but the human emotion, loss, and surrounding circumstances should reflect in our history. Should we delete the naked Vietamese girl running screaming down the street because no one would remember her name a few years later. Or should we recognise that the true meaning behind our civilization is the fact that we can write read and remember our feelings emotions and history. --User:choolio@rocketmail.com 10:45, 9 September 2005</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I was surprised and pleased when I put "Snowball" into Yahoo search and found a link to Wikipedia plus a nice list of links. Snowball is the 'poster dog' for all the animals separated from their families and left behind to suffer and die. It's wrong, it's inhumane and traumatic. Many people died rather than leave their pets in New Orleans and along the Gulf coast. We need legistlation and new rules in place, so this entry will show continuing interest in the topic. Please keep it!! 1:20 PM 9/17/05 LLL</li>
