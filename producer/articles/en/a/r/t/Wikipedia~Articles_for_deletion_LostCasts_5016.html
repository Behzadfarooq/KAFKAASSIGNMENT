<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is the podcast that has frequently been referred to as the "podcast for the serious Lost fan" by the Lost community and even by other popular Lost podcasters. This is not a podcast that is based on reviewing episodes and entertaining (and there are some excellent podcasts which do those things very well;) this is the one podcast that deals with Lost mythology and literary references on a deep level. It involves considerable time and research by these intelligent and dedicated podcasters who also inspire their listeners to research the mythological and literary references within Lost. This podcast was one of the very first Lost podcasts and has remained a pillar of the Lost community. That alone makes them noteworthy. Then add to that, their distinction as the podcast that created the standard for the "grad school level Lost podcast" and their "notability" within the Lost community is cemented. These podcasters put a lot of time and research into each show (often quoting wikipedia; thereby boosting the popularity and growth of Wikipedia.) Their i-tunes standing testifies to this. How can they be considered anything but one of the most outstanding and noteworthy of all Lost podcasts? }This is my first post on Wikipedia. However it is not a single purpose account. I have frequently used Wikipedia (and yes, I learned about it from LostCasts) for research. It is the first place I turn to find answers or to learn about something. I think Wikipedia is as close to a universal all *purpose library as this world can ever know. I have never posted before because I never felt like I had anything important to add. I do today. LostCasts is an excellent podcast and deserves to be noted as an important part of the Lost community. I am proud to make this my first post.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This podcast is the best Lost podcast to date. It holds discussions on theories, themes and characters along with book discussions. It is intelligent and a major contributor to the Lost community. This podcast is better than most because it delves deeper into literary themes than any other Lost podcast. I have known people who, through listening to Lostcasts, have become interested in different kids of literature. My neice who previously hated to read, became interested in reading because the podcast mentioned several books that have a relationship to Lost. She has since read Watership Down and loved it and is now reading other books. And podcast that inspires children to read cannot be bad and others should have a chance to learn about it on Wikipedia.Laureletsage 04:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Laureletsage (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Laureletsage_7c78.html" title="Special:Contributions/Laureletsage">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is notable through general information, biography, and popularity within ABC's Lost pod casting community. This discussion is stalling any new information that would make this a more informative and indepth article. If being one of the most educational, informative, and popular media out there doesn't deserve notoriety, then wikipedia needs some serious spring cleaning. Please explain yourself in more depth, instead of just writing "not notable". Also, noting on people's non-activity, does not render their opinion "non notable" either, wether they heard it on a forum or not.

<li><b>Keep</b> Not even close to 'just another fan podcast'. Notable for the following:
<ul>
<li>pioneering an unique non-recap review style - with the exception of the literary reviews in the programming break, the program will not recap or summarize any plot material</li>
<li>the conduct of extensive philosophical, literary and technical research for each edition</li>
<li>provision of the podcasts and hompage enitely without recourse to advertising revenue</li>
<li>the LOST actor Jorge Garcia has contributed audio comments twice. The content of those contributions indicates, as he has posted on the Fuselage website, that he listens to each edition</li>
<li>extenisve listener contributions and collaboration with respect to theory development, especially by listeners in locations featured in LOST locations outside the United States: e.g. Sydney and the United Kingdom</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A simple search on Odeo or Itunes will show that this podcast is ranked fairly high for the independent podcast community.

<li><b>Keep</b> This podcast is listed in the iTunes music store (which can be accessed through the itunes program) as the seventh most popular lost podcast - this is out of over 150 lost podcasts, including several official lostcasts. Alexa traffic results (<a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?url=lostcasts.com" class="external free" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?url=lostcasts.com" rel="nofollow">http://alexa.com/data/details/main?url=lostcasts.com</a>) also ranks the site fairly high. Beyond all that, is the obvious popularity of this show really the reason it should stay? I think the simple fact the producers are being referenced for an upcoming book on the theory gives it some credibility. Of many many podcasts, this appears to the number one strictly theory/spoilers lost podcast (in order of popularity on iTunes). The goal of wikipedia is to expand knowledge. If you're insterested in the show lost as well as podcasts, this is a very notable one and I can't think of a single reason it shouldn't be included.VKX 03:55, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (don't edit this thankyou): The uniqueness of the format is sufficiently noteworthy. If it were the 10th template copy of an established format and addednothign new then yes, it would not meet the standard, but it is patently a groundbreaking approach to online interaction on a topic that itself warrants inclusion. The context of the subject proves this: there are many LOST podcasts, but the vast majority are templated 'fan review' offerings. This podcast is primarily a review and critique of online reaction to the initial medium. It was the first to use this approach. This is precisely the reason why entries such as the one for <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucker_Max_6cdf.html" title="Tucker Max">Tucker Max</a> don't attract delete campaigns. Tucker Max really is unnoteworthy as a participant in his chosen area of activity (online media, with apparant sidelines into fornication, alcoholism and getting sued) but is noteworthy because he was a principal pioneer/early developer (but, interestingly, not even the inventor) of the 'fratire' literary genre. If the LOSTCasts entry were allowed sufficient time to mature, the uniqueness of the format could be properly documented and explained, as could its impact on other on line activities. The fact that it is also very popular is not a disqualifying factor. Many of the 'delete' entries assume (quite wrongly) that popularity of itself raises a presumption in favour of deletion. If that were true, huge chunks of Wikipedia should be cut right now. At the very least, a decision on deletion should be deferred for the balance of this year to allow the question to be reviewed after development of the entry. The entry is far too new and underdeveloped to allow a final decision on deletion at this time. In addition, one really has to ask if this delete campaign has any merit at all? It appears to be based on borderline, subjective views about noteworthiness that really have no means by which they can be tested, and therefore can't provide the rigorous basis required to apply the relevant policies in this case. Besides all that, no one on the Internet has a bullet proof ego, and I certainly include myself in that thought. My point being: would this delete campaign have been prosecuted so viciously if the word 'clueless' had not been used on the LOSTCasts website to refer to some Wikipedia contributors to begin with?--60.227.230.22 12:53, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Defenders of the article here (driven to this page by the comments on the LostCasts site) have taken offense by being called not notable, but that's not meant to be an insult.

<li><b>Comment:</b>For what it's worth, the wikipedia page wasn't set up for advertising purposes. The podcasters directed attention to its deletion, which is pretty borderline, but they never set it up. Personally, I think there's a difference between the average fansite, which features recaps, pictures, etc, and the podcasting LOSTcasts does. Podcasting is an inherently more personal, creative endeavor than a regular fansite. It goes beyond a reflection of the original and becomes unique. It's the difference between a photograph and a painting. Does that make this important enough to deserve it's own page? I have no idea. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyrice_13_9440.html" title="User:Chunkyrice 13">Chunkyrice 13</a> 02:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> Lostcasts is not for every LOST fan, but for someone like me, who is interested in going beyond watching the show, this is a great resource for news, commentary, and fascinating speculation on what is behind the creative curtain for this show. These podcasters have given up a great deal of time to try and offer an entertaining resource that has at times overlapped with the actual production of LOST. The nomination for deletion of this article is spiteful and obviously from someone that wants to be a petty irritant rather than genuinely being concerned with the accurracy of content on wikipedia. I suggest the folks in favor of deletion subscribe to other podcasts and allow the great many listeners to be more than enough validation for an entry here. This entry is not a mere plug for a podcast. This podcast is as valid as a television or radio program and for me is a fabulous wealth of information. Devaluing this by stating it is made by fans is ridiculous. You want people producing a podcast about LOST to love the show enough to do their best. Please do not delete this entry!

<li><b>Keep</b> We're big fans of Wikipedia. Anyone who's listened to our podcasts knows that we often use it as a resource, from The Philadelphia Experiment to Aldous Huxley. I have always had great faith in the concept of Wikipedia, and have defended it on many occasions.</li>

<dd>That's why we were honored when, on August 14th, a commenter on our site (Loren), posted that she'd created a Wikipedia entry for us. You can see that comment here. Just a few days ago, a comment on our site let us know that the entry was up for deletion. The reason was that several Wikipedia editors said our podcast was "non-notable."</dd>
<dd>Yeah, that upset us. We know that we're one of the top LOST fan podcasts out there, but I don't expect everyone to be familiar with us. In defense of the Wikipedia editors, if they had not heard of us, they would have no basis by which to judge our "notability."</dd>
<dd>I started some bad blood by calling the Wikipedia editors "clueless", which was irresponsible. In fact, Wikipedia editors spend their free time doing something they're passionate about, with no compensation. This is something we can identify with, because that's what we do. But we have to make an argument for our notability. Here's a shot at it:
<ul>
<li>LOSTCasts has appeared regularly in the iTunes top 100 podcasts. We were consistently in the list when season 2 was on the US, beginning in November 2005. Of course, during the off-season, this has been intermittent. One additional item of note is that the iTunes top 100 is not based on total number of subscribers, but on the number of new subscribers within a given amount of time. We'll breach this top 100 again when season 3 starts.</li>
<li>Most podcasters don't publish subscriber statistics, but we do have a glimpse from an AP article published in May of 2006. LOSTCasts is also cited in this article. In terms of numbers, The Jay and Jack podcast subscribers are cited in this AP article at 13,000 subscribers. In the month of May, our subscribers started the month at 18,000 and grew to 22,000. This would make us the most popular LOST fan podcast being published at that time. Of course, this is the only window since that we've had into other LOST podcast subscriber numbers. But everyone would agree that once the Transmission left, it was really just us, and Jay and Jack.</li>
<li>ABC and LOST listen to us. As noted in the articles of deletion, Jorge Garcia, who plays "Hurley", is a regular listener and has called into the show numerous times. As well, we have been personally contacted by a number of other official LOST folks.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As I said, we're honored to have had a Wikipedia article written for us, and we'd love to see it stay. But it's up to the Wikipedia community to accept or reject claims of notability.</dd>
<dd>If you are going to comment on the articles for deletion, make it a logical argument for notability, not a flame. If you don't believe we're Wikipedia material, then say so! That's your right... and it's what makes Wikipedia great.</dd>
<dd>The outcome won't affect the future of LOSTCasts. We validate our notability through the voice of our listeners. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.136.57.214 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.136.57.214.html" title="User talk:69.136.57.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.136.57.214_1e34.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.136.57.214">contribs</a>) .</small><small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 69.136.57.214 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.136.57.214.html" title="User talk:69.136.57.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.136.57.214_1e34.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.136.57.214">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> re: podcast notability: It appears that podcasts have a disadvantage under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as a fairly new medium that is relatively rarely featured as content articles in the traditional press, thereby decreasing chances for notability. 1) WP:WEB notes that <a href="../../../a/w/a/Category%7EAwards_ea71.html" title="Category:Awards">Category:Awards</a> may suggest notability, but there are no podcast-specific award categories, (and if any are added, they should be added to WP:WEB IMHO). 2) Traffic ranking sites such as Alexa (used in older versions of WP:WEB) also do not accurately reflect podcast traffic, which may be directly downloaded by music applications rather than web browsers. In general, I am left wondering if discussion for a WP:PODCAST article would be of merit (but I'm too lazy to embark on that endeavor), but consider that if one were to exist, it seems that an iTunes Top 100 ranking would be a reasonable criterion for podcast notability, a criterion that does not exist for other media in the umbrella category of WP:WEB. Yes this vote has attracted an array of single-purpose accounts and puppets voting "strong keep", but look beyond that and consider what podcast-specific criteria you would choose for notability. <small>(My previous comment moved here with minor copy edit)</small> --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 20:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: For everyone out there who is unfamiliar with this pdocast, <i>Lostcasts</i> is one of the best podcasts out there for the hit drama "Lost". They have been called the "Thinking Man's Lost podcast" and I strongly agree with that description. Starting way back in September of 2005, they were already delving into possible mythological connections with the constellation Apollo and eastern religious connections to the usage of Dharma and the phrase "Namaste". If anything, <i>this</i> Lost podcast deserves a page, and due to the visibility caused by this deletion attempt, I believe many of us can add much more content to the page now.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This podcast should definatly have it's own page. I listen to many different Lost podcasts and LOSTcasts is a very strong contendor. It always has a very high level of discussion, think of it as a 500 level Masters class opposed to an 100 level Undergrad class. I think that if this podcast gets any negativity associated with it, the reason is that it may be above their heads and people are lashing out. It should stay. - 222.7.5.133 11:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)Katmarie24 <small>— 222.7.5.133 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_222.7.5.133_6a97.html" title="Special:Contributions/222.7.5.133">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep - possible merge</b>: This is a great podcast which goes beyond just fanboy drooling. For heavens sakes, they are doing book reviews of books seen in the show and discussing how the creators drew inspiration from them. They've had cast memebers sorta on the show. This is not just another "Gee...I hope Jack and Kate hookup" cast. However, I think a large page of Lost related podcasts may be in order and a better location for these.<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabalon_793d.html" title="User:Sabalon">Sabalon</a> 13:01, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually meatpuppetry is "highly inappropriate or unacceptable" according to official policy (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Meatpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry#Meatpuppets</a>)). --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 14:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Amen. This incident of inciting non-participants to supposedly "vote" here is antithetical to Wikipedia's encyclopedic goals. Moreover, as the above referenced policy states, "Neither a sock puppet nor a single-purpose account holder is regarded as a member of the Wikipedia community." Let's not leap to their defense in some misplaced spirit of egalitarianism. Their actions here are disruptive and rude, plain and simple. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 15:39, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't realize I'd stir up a hornet's nest like this in regards to this AfD. With that being said, new contributors are always welcome in Wikipedia, but not in the respect that it's to prove a point or to save an article simply because you've been asked to. Whethere an article exists about your podcast or not does not make it any less of a good program, it's just not worthy of mention on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 15:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Really a question. In Wiki articles about entertainment entities, in this case a podcast, are the editors judging the entertainment value of the podcast? Using another example, if I were to post an article about the 70s band The Goodrats, would editors remove it because they think it was an non-notable band because they never heard of it? If so, then so be it. But if not, I don't understand why you want to remove this article. It is a podcast. Some people enjoy it. Ten years from now, long after the Podcast is gone, somebody will turn to their friend and say - hey, what was that podcast we used to listen to with the great theories about lost, and that friend will turn to Wiki. Isnt that what Wiki is for?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This podcast is extremely well produced and serves as a great tool for those of us who are too busy to do the work of keeping up with the shows details ourselves. I believe it is a great aid to the Lost community and its Wiki article should be kept in good standing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.145.214.100 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.145.214.100_2ebe.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.145.214.100">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 72.145.214.100 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.145.214.100_2ebe.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.145.214.100">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I'm a big fan of the lostcast I think a full article on it is not appropiate for an encyclopedia. As other people have commented I think the most noteworthy lost podcasts should be mentioned in a section of the Lost article with a description and a link to them. And obviously Lostcast should be in there as the best theory lost podcast out there.
