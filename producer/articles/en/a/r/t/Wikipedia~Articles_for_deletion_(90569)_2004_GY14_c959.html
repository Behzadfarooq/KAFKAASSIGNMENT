<p>While I appreciate this may at first sound noteworthy, there are a surprising number of these so-called 'minor planets' (e.g. big asteroids) in our solar system.

<li>Change to <b>Keep</b>, for now, now that the page actually has some meaningful information. However, I do think that we need to have a proper debate over whether we want thousands of stub articles on individual asteroids.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notability is a bad criterion in science, and certain types of things are inherently worthy of articles (i.e. any species can have an article, every random town can have an article, et cetera) - the general precendents on this kind of front are clear. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem that I see here isn't notability or verifiability, but a complete lack of information. How well are these rocks studied? Is there a chance that they'll ever become more than stubs? I'm not an astronomer, so I have no idea how well documented minor planets are.--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, uh - roughly speaking, it depends. The infobox already has a fair amount of information in it. The "most important information" is there with a few exceptions (colour, at the very least). There's always a chance it'll be more studied - but really <i>this article is a stub</i> isn't a very good criterion for deletion, given considerations like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she is a harsh mistress, but she ain't paper</a> and the like. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Additionally, given that this asteroid was only discovered in 2004 and isn't super-special like 2003 UB313 or the ilk, it's unlikely to come all that fast. But, we know it's magnitude, semi-major axis, eccentricity, as well as some of the less exciting orbital paramatres. What are you looking for, exactly? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I'm not <i>looking</i> for anything per se. I was just wondering about how much information could ever be gained about this asteroid- I was thinking about the beetle comparison and figured "Hell, at least we can look at a beetle any time. To study this rock we'd have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars." Anyway, I'm entirely neutral on this article precisely because I understand that Wikipedia isn't paper, so even though it's a rather minor article, it shouldn't be deleted on the basis that it's a stub. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not really - if you were particularly interested, you could get telescope time for ~$10000, and get some nice spectra, figure out a lot more information.

<li><b>Merge</b> to appropriate list. I initially thought 'keep' because it verifiably exists and chunks of rock have some inherent notability; however, I think the data about it could readily be transferred to a tabular list of similar objects.

<ul>
<li>FWIW, no such list exists (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> contains much less info per asteroid) and reading such a list would tempt one to bleed from the eyes. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge, or Delete</b>. You have to merge it with notable other asteroids; it can't stand alone, as it says nothing about why, of all the asteroids in the solar system, it is particularly notable. Is it its size&#160;? I have no idea, but I'd imagine that was the case. But even if it were really big, I would still think <b>merge</b>, unless it were going to hit the Earth sometime soon. That's the problem with modern Copernican stuff--yes, we can no longer have a geocentric view of the galaxy, but we can still have, and should have, a geocentric view of our encyclopedia.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A geocentric view is definitely a failure of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>&#160;;). But seriously, how many articles have all the failures you ascribe to this? <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Valley%2C_Arkansas_8191.html" title="Cherry Valley, Arkansas">Cherry Valley, Arkansas</a>, for instance - we don't merge it - but it's just a regurgitation of census data. There are thousands of other articles on American cities that are just regurgitated census data. That's the kind of precendent most of us are looking at. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:58, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respect that. I think that precedent should not be applicable. People live in Cherry Valley, Arkansas, there's an atmosphere there, in which there is breathable air. I don't think it's overly anthropomorphic to state that Cherry Valley, AR is a lot more notable and important to an encyclopedia than an asteroid article that doesn't give a single reason why that particular asteroid is notable outside of a statistical box. Everything in space cannot be on webspace. At least here. Of course, I could go the hyper-anthropomorphic route and argue for deletion based on the fact that this asteroid could only be notable because it's close to us, and an asteroid passing through space 350 billion light years away, about which we know nothing, that's not notable because we know nothing of it--and so it comes back to geocentrism again. It seems like a circle. I just think that people have to have been, or still are, or will soon be, in a place of a given size, for it to be notable to those same people, with few exceptions. If that's anthropomorphic, it's at least a great degree less anthropomorphic than the other argument I just gave for deletion.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 04:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The important issue is notability, but verifiability, which is limiting us. Notability is rather a pointless criterion - if you ask only <i>Is the content encyclopaedic</i> and <i>Is the content verifiable</i> you'll end up with the right result in every AfD (except in highly unusual cases, like POVFORKs. My point I think still stands, that every Assbacks, Ontario can pass through AfD unscathed, every Cedar Meadows High School passes through AfD unscathed - there's a certain "class" of things that are inherently encyclopaedic. At a certain point solar system bodies are intrinsically entitled to pass through AfD. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and I don't see a pressing need to delete this content. It's verifiable and encyclopaedic. It conforms to a neutral point of view.
