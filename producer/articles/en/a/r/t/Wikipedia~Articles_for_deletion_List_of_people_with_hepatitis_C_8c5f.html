<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This list was created at my suggestion. It follows the same format as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_brain_tumor_patients.html" title="List of notable brain tumor patients">List of notable brain tumor patients</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a>, both of which are <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">WP:FL</a> featured lists. This information has value as an educational tool for putting a human face on a serious illness and for awareness-raising. Before I became a Wikipedian two charities requested an earlier version of the brain tumor list from me. It's good awareness information. Also see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a>, which is now in peer review and close to <a href="../../../f/l/c/WP%7EFLC_1027.html" title="WP:FLC">WP:FLC</a>. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 14:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. There are problems with all sorts of lists as articles in Wikpedia which are regularly aired, but in addition this involves personal medical information which I think adds a moral dimension. Apart from HIV and brain tumours already mentioned, I have only found two other similar articles: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_heterochromia.html" title="List of people with heterochromia">List of people with heterochromia</a>, the latter with only 15 real people.

<dd><b>Comment</b> all of these entries are people who meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and whose cases have been confirmed through published sources. Since medical information is legally private (in the U.S. and probably most other countries), these are individuals who have chosen to make their cases public. The brain tumor patients list met an eager reception within the patient/caregiver/charitable community before it came to Wikipedia. On a purely human level this information is comforting - people who face a serious life-changing (or life-ending) ailment like to learn that they aren't alone. There's also a value to parents and educators: several of these diseases are common among children (brain tumors are the leading form of childhood cancer death in the U.S.) and this sort of list is a resource to teachers who want to develop innovative classroom lessons so that affected children aren't unduly stigmatized. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 02:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Comparisons with Hello magazine or secret police files are unfair. The sources used are from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> media, not tabloid tittle-tattle and gossip. If you look at this list, plus the HIV/Epilepsy/Brain Tumor ones, you will see that many of the (still living) notable individuals involved <i>want</i> this information to be very public: they give interviews and go on awareness campaigns The stigma attached to certain chronic conditions gives grief to those with the condition and may well be leading to people remaining undiagnosed. Charitable organisations actively seek out celebrities to give a known face to their awareness campaigns. I can appreciate the <a href="../../../y/u/c/Yuck_factor.html" title="Yuck factor">yuck factor</a> reactions to seeing such a list on a "drive-by AfD". Hep C is the leading cause of liver transplant in the US and known as a silent killer - since many are unaware of their infection and discover only when in end-stage liver failure. Those two facts are given examples in this list. Listing undisclosed "personal medical information" is not the intention or purpose of this list. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How can you ascertain the original source of the information? Maybe some overzealous paparrazi... In any case, I still don't see the benefit to society of posting this type of list on WP.

<dd>The first point is hopefully covered by using reputable news sources, who have editorial teams and lawers checking what they write. The list generally uses old news, so anything legally unsound would have been pulled off the web site a while ago. A negative tabloid story should definately not be used (but a "Sold my story to the tabloids" interview or biography might). Your last point is true of all of Wikipedia and other media: only the famous get noted. We don't list the members of your local cricket club, and your gran is never going to get an obituary in a national newspaper. Celebrity, whether you like it or not, is a fact of life and does have its uses. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
