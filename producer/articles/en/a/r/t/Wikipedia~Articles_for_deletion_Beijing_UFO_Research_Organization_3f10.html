<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <small>changing&#160;!vote - see at the bottom</small> I vaguely remember stumbling upon a similar page once, but cannot find it in my contribs now... I am inclined to believe that it was the same organisation, so this would seem to me the article's a recreation (can't back this up with a link to a log/diffs now though).

Its members all come from different government and university institutes (they don't just pick random people, you have the match a criterea and be qualified). What links do you want? The website has all the links and data, and it is branched on a server of the Chinese government. I do not know who created this similar article you talk about in the past but they made their mistakes by not providing you with factual data, and it has been provided, just look at the links for one.

<li><b>Delete</b> TIME article says that "China UFO Research Center" broke up into "competing factions three years ago". It is not clear if the subject of article (Research Organization) is that described in TIME. I do not believe that any of the organizations are "run" by PRC government- tolerated perhaps and maybe including some former government officials/scientist in administrative roles. The yahoo email address and blank page for forum also makes me suspicious to the claims.

<li>I thought their input was wonderful, and many had good thought to their reasoning. Even those who said delete said irrelevant things yet I loved the input they gave. It just gave more thought to this debate (:O) Yet I never claimed the votes of the delete or keep from anyone to be meaningless ... on the contrary they all count in my eyes and people did a <b>wonderful</b> job helping contribute to Wikipedia, even if they are new and still learning (:O) --<a href="../../../n/i/m/User%7ENima_Baghaei_0bdc.html" title="User:Nima Baghaei">nima baghaei</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/m/User_talk%7ENima_Baghaei_a5d4.html" title="User talk:Nima Baghaei">talk</a>) 03:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Keep</s>Move to Chinese Wiki/Neutral</b> <s>for now, I say give it a chance to be expanded. The article has indeed established notability as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> and it satisfies <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>. It has more than one third party source on the subject. The issue is not as much notability as it is content. I think the article deserves a chance to be expanded before it gets the chop.</s> Also, it appears there is a lot of actions on this page in violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, please keep it civil and don't bite the newcomers. After looking at these sources they are in Chinese, perhaps this article is better suited on the Chinese Wikipedia if that is an option, as it does have reputable outside sources, but they are not in English. Also, it lacks content and if it is to be kept on any Wiki it needs a mass expansion other than see the homepage.<i><b><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthgriz98_7610.html" title="User:Darthgriz98"><font color="#084B8A">Darth</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarthgriz98_697d.html" title="User talk:Darthgriz98"><font color="#FF0080">griz</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Darthgriz98_3948.html" title="Special:Contributions/Darthgriz98"><font color="#04B4AE">98</font></a></sup></b></i> 04:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, Nima Baghaei, but this article just is not notable. Please note that this is the <i>English</i> Wikipedia. All of the 'sources' for the article are in Chinese, or question mark language as they would originally appear on <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox</a>. Also, the article barely has content. There are a few promising sections, but all the article says about them is to visit the main site (which could be used as a source for future reference), instead of giving information right there, like you're supposed to find in an encyclopedia. Nima Baghaei, you asked me to help...unfortunately I don't think it's in the way you wish, and I'm sorry. This article simply isn't notable. If it went under a miracle of a clean-up...maybe. But right now, there is just no way. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 04:11, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changing my stance from up top to <b>conditional week keep</b>. I have just now given this thing some thought. This discussion had grown quite substantially over the past few days (evidence suggests that this is thanks to Nima's actions, but I guess if the article'd be placed on some List of UFO-related deletions then the situation'd be similar), and maybe there is something to it. My suggestion is to keep the article for now, however on conditions that Nima provides sources, be they Chinese or English, and expands the article so that it is something more than just a list of names and links. Lists to prose. Let's wait it out, give it a few months, and watch. If the article does not grow, let's come back to it in a few months and discuss it again. --<a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOuro_8ad2.html" title="User:Ouro">Ouro</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/u/r/User_talk%7EOuro_6623.html" title="User talk:Ouro">blah blah</a>)</small> 08:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Im in the minority with that choice, but why cant this article just be expanded. If its that well known and documented whats stopping someone writing more info about it. I have to say in the way it stands, its just a list of various pieces of data, but if someone could put some more meat on the bones it could be a worthy article. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 13:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - I am assuming that references were added after the afd nom.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I made a snap decision and upon further review, I think it fails wikipedias notability guidelines. I looked at the sources in english and the references I found do not reinforce notability for me. <a href="http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0718/vo2-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0718/vo2-2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is about somebody who works there, but the article is not about the organization. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,488900,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,488900,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is the same story, the article is not about the organization in reference. This leads me to believe that most of the articles are probably mostly related to the UFO Phenomenon with a brief mention of this organization. I dont think that this meets notability standars because it is not the subject of the third party trivial sources.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
