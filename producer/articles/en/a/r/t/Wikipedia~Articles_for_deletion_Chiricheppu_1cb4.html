<li><b>Delete in this form and if verifiability is not fully achieved after this discussion ends</b> totally non-notable and non verifiable. The so called advocate from high court who has supported this seems to have no knowledge on wiki norms and seems to be a sock puppet. Also the remark on political interference is a general sickness of all malayalees. Whenever something happens which we do not like in kerala, we blame it on politics and the "hidden political hand". So these arguments are very stupid. Wiki cannot be controlled by such sick thoughts. Also the argument on "malicious intentions to defame" is silly as the magazine as such has no repute in the first place! Here all wikians have a right to defend what we feel and this does not paramount to any malicious intentions to defame and is outside the purview of any court.Since the editor of this magazine himself put this article here there is no case of "malicious intention to defame" as nothing objectionable has been published against him or the magazine here on wiki. I doubt this Sreekumar is an advocate. If he was he would not have made such foolish threats. Let him make such observations in the court. This is cyber space not a court! If he is so passionate on what he reads let him provide verifiable proof on the claims that it has 50000 circulation and such. This magazine does not have any state or national repute. It is just one of those yellow journalism magazines. Wiki is no place for such magazines. There are thousands of such magazines in Kerala. If all the editors of such magazines start to adverise their own names and their magazines on wiki we all would have to hang our faces in shame. Request to the advocate to come up with more solid material on web for supporting his claims. I will surely rethink my opinion if this article is well supported by the end of this discussion, instead of silly hollow claims. If you are an advocate prove it by doing some research and work on collecting evidence. See how the artcle on <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pradip_Somasundaran_cf58.html" title="Pradip Somasundaran">Pradip Somasundaran</a> was retained after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pradip_Somasundaran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pradip_Somasundaran" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> gave way to the much needed evidence.Take this for encouragement. <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 02:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>'Don't delete'.....because the cartoon lovers accepted the magazine as their pulse to gag the society. Chiricheppu stands as a good social worker to keep every malayalam readers in smile. We are using it as a panacea for every tensions. We don't forget their endievour and contributions in the field malayalam publications. So my suggession is that do not cancel the grate canvas of our cartoonist and the laughing canvas of over mind. Rajkumar Kuruppu59.93.8.209 10:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: From the above comment, one would think that those recommending deletion are trying to get rid of the cartoon itself instead of the article. At any rate, unfortunately, without any sort of verifiability as to the claims in the article, it cannot stand. I suggest spending more trying looking for sources indicating any sort of notability, rather than trying to sway us with anecdotal generalizations as to how great the cartoon itself is. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 14:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks a lot for that - the magazine does exist, which is a big step forward. That site also has a section for <i>publishers claimed circulation</i> but Chiricheppu doesn't seem to make any claims for itself. All the above <b>established</b> Indian editors seem agreed that it is non-notable so, unless some reliable sources can demonstrate notability, I'll leave the AfD nomination stand. I'll be happy to withdraw it if even a relatively weak demonstration of notability can be made. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 17:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>- Dlyons, that it has been listed as a magazine is not the issue. Any indian magazine has to be registered with "Registrar of Newspapers" for official recognition and legality for publication in India. There are thousands of such magazines. So this finding is not big game. Even I have seen and read the magazine and have liked it! "Crime magazine" a yellow magazine is more notable than "Chiricheppu". So will we all support an article by its Propreitor tomorrow on Wiki? Wiki is not a place for self publicity and praise. It's also not a place for free publicity. There are norms here. We all should entertian articles only on wiki norms. There is no place for sympathy or it being good for health or society. Wiki works only on facts not on personal emotions. This is an Online Encyclopedia. Not a Malayalam Daily for putting ads!

If it does not sell in the main bus stand in the largest city in Kerala I am surprised that it sells any, let alone 50000, copies. There is also a possibility that it had sold out everywhere, but that is a little far-fetched. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 04:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete.</b> it is crystal-clear that someone who have vested interest who are trying to attack and defame this cartoon magazine.all the people who have good reading habits know this magazine.balrama comes under the category of childrens magazine. not under the category of cartoon magazine.someone who commented here that chiricheppu is a yellow magazine.what a stupid comment.most of the commented person are introduced themselves as people from other countries such as ireland ,australia.someone are forcing them to comment on this people. how the people from other countries can judge a magazine in malayalam.we -the kerala people is familiar with this magazine.chiricheppu is the unique political cartoon monthly in malayalam language.someone thinks that defamation is not a crime in cyber space.calling a cartoon magazine "yellow magazine" is highly defamatory.the cyber crimes in the country were booked under the Indian Penal Code,(sec499and500) rather than the Information Technology Act. computers were used to commit acts of crimes such as defamation is punishable both under indian cyber law and indian penal code.any person has the right to edit wikipedia.but no one has the right to spread defamation against a reputed magazine.the aim of wikipedia is great.one who is doing research on the history of cartooning it is really worthy to read the article published about Chiricheppu in wikipedia.how many political cartoon magazines are now available in malayalam...? please tell me friends...!Only Chiricheppu.that is why we the readers of chiricheppu is against deletion.any type of imputations published will hurt thousands of readers of chiricheppu.recent defamation case on cyber space is also cited hereunder:Fighting cyber crimes</li>

<p>Conviction in a cyber case in Pathanamthitta recently has increased the confidence of the public to file more such cases, writes Anand Haridas(The Hindu news paper reports)</p>
<p>After a couple of arrests of foreign nationals on charges of spreading defamatory matters, more people are coming forward to file complaints, say city police officials.another case: TRIVANDRUM - The Kerala police have made a mark in dealing with cyber crimes with the arrest of a 45-year-old former pastor and his son in a case related to the alleged defamating the chief of the Indian Pentecostal Church T.S. Abraham by using the new technology. The former pastor, T.S. Balakrishnan Nair alias T.S. Balan, who was associated with the Sharon Pentecostal Church, was arrested from his residence at Perumbavoor by the Pathanamthitta Police for spreading defamatory matters about Mr Abraham and his family members, including his daughter, through cyberspace.recently both the accused were punished for an imprisonment of 7years.</p>

<p><b>DONT Delete</b>.The vested interestsmhas been doing some foul play for deleting the contents.They should be banned from these henious work against a noble magazine.The notability and the reach of a magazine is measured through the popularity &amp; its circulation,the credibility of the editor &amp; management and its stand in social issues.in all these repects chiricheppu is at par with any magazine in india.Among the cartoon magazines, its a boon to cartoonists and readers comprising different tastes and intellect.whether the entertaintment part or the social cause,they have done their job magnificiantly.its the requiremnet of the generation that more people speaking different languages and lives across the globe be aquainted with this flag bearers of humanity.the reach &amp; notability of the magazine is evident from the support its getting from the notable personalities and readers in this issueFundoomal 04:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, a widely circulated and critically acclaimed magazine would probably be notable. But that's exactly the thing -- I haven't yet seen any evidence that this magazine is either of those things.

<p><b>Don't Delete</b>From the interest only particular users of wi-kipeadia for the deletion of the article its evident they have personal interest in deletion.i have been to ernakulam and from the railway station i bought chiricheppu.if my dear frnd tintin din't get it from there that means <b>all the copies were sold out</b> .guys why you want to delete this genuine article.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> That any fool can edit wikipedia is just a wish. The wikipedian admins are experieced people who constantly monitor it's content and they have all rights to decide on what is right, and what is wrong. It cannot be decided by some ignorant guys who pose themselves as IAS officers sometimes, and as Advocates some other times. It's a shame to the official community that those who are holding high positions do not even know how to write good english! So stop playing games here. Even if you put hundreds of comments here under different names, you will be still be caught red handed by the poor quality of your english! Please spend this valuable time in trying to improve your writing skills, and finding proof for it's notability instead of foolish legal threats. These threats will not hold as it's not in your right to put any stupid article here. Wiki has norms and will work only on norms not emotions. Regarding defamation, it's you who put this article here in the first place and now you are threatining those who oppose it's inclusion! Opposition does not amount to defamation. No one has said that your magazine does not exist or is not a cartoon magazine. There are thousands of such magazines in the "petti peedikas" all across Kerala which are bought by the layman, just to kill time. These do not contribute to any new knowledge of the reader. If you want real quality, read and see R.K Laxman's works. Where is he, and where is S.Jithesh of Chiricheppu! In Kerala there are only a few cartoon magazines. "Hasyakairali" is a better cartoon magazine than Chiricheppu. In the begenning Chiricheppu started off with much fanfare using inputs from the literary world. But now the state of this magazine is really alarming with most of Jithesh's cartoons not up to the mark. So the claim of 50,000 copies is not true. Support your claims, instead of resorting to lame threats and sock puppetry. I am from Kerala and so your allegation that all those who oppose this article live abroad is totally baseless. <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 07:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Please don't make it a personal issue.

</ul>

<dd>
<ol>
<li>There is a magazine called Chiricheppu, published every month in Kerala</li>
<li>There is a person called Jithesh who draws cartoons in that magazine</li>
<li>One of the independent editors of Wikipedia (not a single purpose account) has read for a long time that he has noticed that <i>In the begenning Chiricheppu started off with much fanfare using inputs from the literary world</i> and <i>now the state of this magazine is really alarming with most of Jithesh's cartoons not up to the mark</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>That settles the notability issue at least to me. As far as I know there are no fixed criteria (like circulation of 1 lakh - readership of 50 lakh etc) for including an article about a magazine in Wikipedia. Hence, we have to follow the dictum of <b>If in doubt, keep</b> and hence <u>I am changing my vote to <b>Strong Keep</b></u> Also it is very clear that this magazine is non-notable in Uganda, Canada and Sikkim. What is the logic behind deleting an article about a malayalam magazine telling that it is not notable among Mr.Singh, Mr.Adolf and Mr.Hamaguchi. We should only see whether it is notable among Thomas, Varghese and Nair, it does not matter whether the standard was "once good" and "now bad" Notability does not differentiate between notable yesterday and notable today. Please note that I have not seen or read the magazine (I don't know Malayalam) but I am giving my opinion based on the opinion given by one user from Kerala <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 10:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Dr. Bruno, you are trying to slam my mouth down with wild imaginative meanings that you cooked up from my words. I have never said that I used to read this magazine regularly. Do not force words into my throat. Have you read this magazine? No. Then do not decide for others on whether this is notable or not. There are thousand of such magazines in Kerala, that I may have seen or read once in a while. This does not mean that all of them are notable. I have seen lot of "yellow magazines" on railway platforms and bus stands. Just because I have seen them, know the names and know about them does not make them notable. Most of them may be trash. Are you saying that we ought to host articles on every comic book, children magazine, cartoon magazine and trash from Kerala just because they exist? This is not what Wiki is for. So let malayalees in kerala decide on what is notable and what is not in their state. One who has not even seen it cannot decide on our behalf my friend. Let them come up with solid proof. Let some leading news paper comment on the "fighting for justice" aspect. Has this magazine received any awards? Has the cartoonist of this magazine received one? Well none of the protagonists(prtagonist) above are giving any proof except blindly stating that "do not delete". Lets decide this issue based on the out come of solid proof. Not just because it just exists. Mere existance is not a stamp of notability. Am not personally against this magazine or the cartoonist. Let's just follow Wiki norms. Personal opinions do not count. We have a job to do. If they come up with relevant information including citations keep it or else not. That's all. By the way the usage "vested interests" has now become stale. Every fool in Kerala who is not happy with his own state of affairs blames it on "vested interests". That's the root cause of all stagnation in Kerala. It's a lame and lazy excuse for your own shortcomings. We do not try to find what's wrong with ourselves. We blame it on others! <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 11:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Cool down..... I am also not personally for this magazine. Just giving my view. I have clearly said that I have not read or seen this magazine. Please don't misunderstand me. And I fully support your view that <b>let malayalees in kerala decide on what is notable and what is not in their state</b> If you can see this is what I meant when I had alread said <i>only see whether it is notable among Thomas, Varghese and Nair</i>. This is a policy (notability decided by persons from that field only) which I would like to be on Wikipedia. But I am a little amused and curious when this advice (<i>Then do not decide for others on whether this is notable or not</i>) is said ONLY at me and not for others who might have never visited Kerala but has voted for deleting this article for the past few days. So if I am voting for delete, I can be any where, but if I am voting for keep, I should be a malayalee in kerala....

<li><b>Comment</b>hai! here is the evidential fact which you asked for, to quench your doubt about 'chiricheppu'..see the famous article named "jeevitham enne enthu padippichu" of SAMAKALINA MALAYALAM (Weekly owned by INDIAN EXPRESS) published on 15 october 2005 and I think it is suffice to appease your dubious attitude against CHIRICHEPPU and I strongly suggest you to restrain from the delibrate enimical attitude against the Chiricheppu.

<p><b>DONT DELETE</b>---CHIRICHEPPU- The humourous leading monthly in Malayalam plays a wonderful role in the history of malayalam journalism. It has developed a unique style of constructive criticism on social, political and cultural issues with brave,bold and brivity.This magazine is available in almost all leading libraries,press clubs, educational institutions and book stalls.With my long experience as an editor and cartoonist in leading news papers and journals, I strongly recommend the name of CHIRICHEPPU should not be deleated.

<p><b>Comment</b> Dr. bruno, your plea for evidence seem to be falling on deaf ears. The same person seems to be commenting under different names as is clear from the bad english usage. See the "Editor in Chief" of "The Analytical English magazine of India" who gave his valuable time to comment here, and see the standard of English he uses here! I would definitely fire such Editors, if I were the owner of the magazine! I think it's due time to take a decision. We are not going to get any evidence and nor are we going to have genuine users giving their opinions.</p>
