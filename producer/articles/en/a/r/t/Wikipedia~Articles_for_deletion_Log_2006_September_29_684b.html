<p>A veritable mess of an article, with lots of claims but no actual evidence of notability. No entry in allmusic.com (The C.O.R.E., which he seems to be a member of has its album listed, but no actua; entry); zero news hits on Newsbank; Google finds are mostly myspace links; awards (if he got them) are local; no evidence on mtv.com that he had a visible role in "Made". I don't see anything that puts him over the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> threshold, but if there is, maybe at least this AfD can result in cleaning up the article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:03, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

No real media coverage that I can find, not listed on stock exchanges, page reads like an ad (and everything from "Rinascimento" onward is a copyvio from <a href="http://www.dgform.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dgform.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Copyvio means that the user thinks the article is a copyright violation, but I don't think DGform will complain for quoting the plot of their game. Second, DGform is based on "Rinascimento" series, so it would be useful to identify the team with the project. You can't find media coverage because the game is still being developed. Nevertheless, you can't help noticing the Team really exists, so you can't blame their presence in the "List of video game developers". - Armonite, 19:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.55.67.175 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.55.67.175_38b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.55.67.175">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>We can't know whether they'd object or not, and the DGform page cited clearly states "Copyright (c) 2006, DGform Multimedia" at the bottom. As for the company itself, if its existence can not be confirmed via multiple independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, then it doesn't belong here. If the game hasn't been released yet, and hasn't been the focus of significant attention during development, then the article violates our policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">speculation</a> as well. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 02:57, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, you can sign your posts by adding a dash followed by four tildes, like so: -~~~~. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:08, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>We could write them and ask for a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">primary source</a> such as a document stating their actual existence in formal and legal terms. After all, minor developers need more support than major ones, particularly operations like these, trying to merge videogame industry, arts and culture. It's likely they follow a different way to promote their product, that's why you can't find them on the ordinary promotion channels. Cultural oriented means like Wikipedia should be supposed to spread games like Rinascimento, more than the ones orientated to entertainment only, right? -151.55.89.241 19:41, 21 September 2006 (UTC) Armonite</li>
<li>Two points in response: First, no document provided by the company will meet our sourcing standards (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which states: "In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material...We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a reliable publisher."]). Second, Wikipedia should not be used to "spread" anything. It's an encyclopedia about things that are already notable, not a vehicle through which one can make non-notable things notable (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox</a>). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 20:32, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, but encyclopedia has the precise purpose to spread culture, Wikipedia included. And when you spread culture, you usually spread info that not everybody know. Anyway, if you speak about renaissance period, florentine siege and Cinqucento life, culture and architecture you speak about "thing that are already notable". Moreover, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox</a> provides Self-promotion and Advertising if you manage to keep an objective point of view: I can't find any trace of propaganda language in DGform article! -151.55.70.199 23:22, 21 September 2006 (UTC) Armonite</li>
<li>The top section of the "article" is written entirely in the first person from the company's perspective, which doesn't give it the appearance of even-handedness. Neither do passages like "Each DGform production is based on a powerful and captivating idea, a believable background and a well-conceived plot", or "In-depth research and superior attention to detail ensure the outstanding quality of DGform products." It also seems that you've overlooked the section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox</a> which states, "Furthermore, <b>all article topics must be third-party verifiable</b>, so articles about very small 'garage' or local companies are not likely to be acceptable." -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 23:56, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article clearly fulfills the requirements as a biographical site, notable web content, etc. The Viking Youth Power Hour produces valuable research and interviews with high profile individuals of popular culture and discusses current events. Looking at the article shows how many of their shows have reflected the lives and cultural events of many of the subjects of articles from Wikipedia. It seems difficult to say that Wikipedia's validity as an entity is very discernable from the validity of the Viking Youth Power Hour's presence on Wikipedia as they spend much of their time extrapolating on similar subjects.

Not to make this a discussion on what makes an award well-known and independent but I think the Grammys are a sham but it's not up to me to dismiss that award as not fitting into <i>my</i> idea of an award.

<b>Advertising</b> - users only contributions seem to be to puff this company.

I am also nominating the following related pages because they're similar puff pieces on the company, its owner or founder:

<i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 17:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</i> I'm not associated with Soni Motors in any way and have no interest in advertising them except history. I happened to live in India in the 90s and am an auto buff and learned about unique contributions of Indians to auto history and learned about Ahmed Quraishi and Sir Dorabji Tata. If there are articles about Tata and their whole family with links to their websites and descriptions of their businesses which are commercial in nature then IMHO, Ahmed Quraishi who was a true automobile industry pioneer should not be ignored. I've now moved to Thailand and by sheer coincidence I end up buying a Vigo from Soni Motors and was amused to discover that they were a descendent of Ahmed Quraishi because the trail had gone cold in India and I was unable to find out what had happened to him after his emigration from India. As I said, I have no interest in promoting them as I gain nothing but I do feel that his contributions to Asian automotive industry have been ignored. He is as much a legend as Tata in India, DAT founders in Japan and DeZousa in Sri Lanka - all visionaries in their own right who were instrumental in promoting auto industy in Asia. There is a feeling among Indian Muslims that Ahmed Quraishi's contributions have been ignored because of his religion and I don't agree with them. Perhaps the real reason was because he migrated to Pakistan after his showrooms and buses were destroyed during the violence that were precipitated by the Partition of Indian Subcontinent.

<dd>According with what could it be read on the definition of <b>notable</b> is: "The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports..." In this case, the market research can be, in my opinion, considered valid. Additionally the VON association, objective and independent, dedicated a publication to edgeBOX, as well when edgeBOX won the InfoVision Award 2005 to the best Broadband appliance or as a finalist to the Techworld award 2006 to the best product oriented to SMEs. <small>—The preceding comment is by Emilio ines (<a href="../../../e/m/i/User_talk%7EEmilio_ines_9794.html" title="User talk:Emilio ines">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Emilio_ines_a290.html" title="Special:Contributions/Emilio ines">contribs</a>) 20:15, 18 September 2006: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Please sign your posts!</a></i></small></dd>

<p>I am aware of that; and if you consider this a dictionary definition there is nothing I can do about that. I thought an article was necessary as there was a red link from "polymath". Excuse my error, if it is an error; I have little experience of writing encyclopedia articles. The entire article in the Encyclopedia Britannica for "a posteriori knowledge" reads "knowledge derived from experience, as opposed to a priori knowledge (q.v.)." I take it Britannica's editorial team don't think they are writing a dictionary. This attempt is not a complete product. How I am to begin an article other than with a definition I do not know. DJMitch 13:38, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Wikipedia is not a dictionary</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionary or a usage or jargon guide. Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<p>1. Dictionary definitions. Because Wikipedia is not a dictionary, please do not create an entry merely to define a term. An article should usually begin with a good definition; if you come across an article that is nothing more than a definition, see if there is information you can add that would be appropriate for an encyclopedia. An exception to this rule is for articles about the cultural meanings of individual numbers." DJMitch 13:40</p>
<ul>
<li>OK, the article is not purely a definition. But I am unable to find any definition in any dictionary or encyclopedia that I own that refers to pantomath in this context. Even a search of google returns no relevant results for pantomath within any related context to polymath. In brief, I am not even convinced that the word or concept has any wide existence. Please try to convince me otherwise.<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordingdong_b1d0.html" title="User:Senordingdong">Senordingdong</a> 13:46, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither do I think that the word has any wide existence, any more than the concept it represents. "famous pantomaths" and "notable pantomaths" give 0 results on Google; "pantomaths" nothing relevant. However, before questioning this, or even whether the word ought to exist, perhaps one ought to question some of the statements in the article "polymath".</p>
<p>(I'm rather enjoying this. I've never had a threat of deletion before.) DJMitch 13:52, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I fully agree, it would be wise to check the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> article first. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordingdong_b1d0.html" title="User:Senordingdong">Senordingdong</a> 13:57, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have done some research, and I think the reference to "pantomath" in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> article was both redundant and unnecessary. The word has never been in any wide usage (if at all) amongst speakers of English, so I deleted the sentence. It detracts nothing from the article, so I feel that this was justified. But if you disagree, feel free to revert. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordingdong_b1d0.html" title="User:Senordingdong">Senordingdong</a> 14:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

OK, How about we start with the definitons of "Dictionary" and "Encyclopedia" so that we can see what the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dictionary</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Main Entry: dic·tio·nary Pronunciation: 'dik-sh&amp;-"ner-E, -"ne-rE Function: noun Inflected Form(s): plural -nar·ies Etymology: Medieval Latin dictionarium, from Late Latin diction-, dictio word, from Latin, speaking 1&#160;: a reference source in print or electronic form containing words usually alphabetically arranged along with information about their forms, pronunciations, functions, etymologies, meanings, and syntactical and idiomatic uses 2&#160;: a reference book listing alphabetically terms or names important to a particular subject or activity along with discussion of their meanings and applications 3&#160;: a reference book giving for words of one language equivalents in another 4&#160;: a computerized list (as of items of data or words) used for reference (as for information retrieval or word processing)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Encyclopedia</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Main Entry: en·cy·clo·pe·dia Pronunciation: in-"sI-kl&amp;-'pE-dE-&amp; Function: noun Etymology: Medieval Latin encyclopaedia course of general education, from Greek enkyklios + paideia education, child rearing, from paid-, pais child -- more at FEW</p>
<dl>
<dd>a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think we can see by these definitons that the main difference is in the objective. That an encyclopedia links branches of knowledge. Obvously they both use words, it is in how the knowledge is organized. The Dictionary is discrete, has nothing to do with branches of knowledge. It is the linking of the term that raises it above mere dictionary status.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> So in conclusion I think we should keep the article and make it a stub until it can be further expanded per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary</a> as I see it now it violates no wiki rules and there is no merit to deletion<a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETstrobaugh_0402.html" title="User:Tstrobaugh">Tstrobaugh</a> 17:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable term. Unless we get some referenced material (remember, Wikipedia is not for original research!) discussing pantomaths, or articles which are likely to link to pantomath, there's no use in an article. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 18:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What does "non-notable" term mean? Since when do "terms" have to be notable? Cite some policy that this derives from.<a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETstrobaugh_0402.html" title="User:Tstrobaugh">Tstrobaugh</a> 19:12, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I in this context, where I've probably used the term "non-notable" scruffily, I mean that the term is pretty much unused. For example a search of the Wikipedia shows it's only referred to as a derivative of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a>. We have plenty of illustrative articles and scholarly discussion of polymaths (much-referenced), but if you look out there, almost nobody uses the word "pantomath". It's practically a neologism. There's nothing to build an article around. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 02:36, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It's not so much a neologism, in fact it's ancient, it's greek. I see it as an alternative prefix to ..math, sort of like neoconservative, ultraconservative etc. It's a qualifier that creates a more distinguished subset of polymanths, the pantomaths. I mean that's what the word polymath does, distinguishes the highly gifted people from the ordinary, pantomath is simply the logical endpoint beyond which there can be none higher.<a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETstrobaugh_0402.html" title="User:Tstrobaugh">Tstrobaugh</a> 16:09, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, I'm having a lot of trouble picking appropriate words lately. My point is that it's a term which is very seldom used, as it refers to something essentially hypothetical. I'm strugging to think how we can build an encyclopedic article of any real length around it, so I think it should be left as a note in the polymath article. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 18:07, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, You've stated that this program isn't note-worthy however it is one of the very, very few Visual Basic classic programs using DirectX to produce commercial looking quality without relying on another engine such as TrueVision. That in itself is note-worthy. As obviously this is prerelease I cannot release any screenshots publically though if you believe that this project isn't actually real I can send some screenshots to Wildthing on the understanding that they are not forwarded. If you still believe this article should be deleted you might as well go ahead. --BarnabySmith 15:37, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>CORP's introduction notes its purpose as removing spam/advertising. This isn't the case here. Following the letter of CORP when there is no violation of the spirit of CORP is just mind numbingly stupid. In this case a company is stealthy and flies under the radar, but is the parent company of various famous brand names. At least one of the brand names is famous enough to have its own article - but the parent company (allegedly) fails CORP. In a case like this CORP should be ignored. Also, any "Guideline" that proclaims that a company with ~5,000 employees not notable is fundamentally flawed and should be immediately deleted (assuming that Blyth actually fails CORP).--<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 02:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I've heard of it, and it's reasonably popular. The article also avoids many of the common problems with online-community articles, such as thankfully not listing every admin, banned user, forum drama, every time the servers went down, etc. But the only reference is a thread on its own forum, so verification with reliable sources would be a problem. Delete unless some strong reliable sources are found. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to comment as the author of this article. Having studied the rules on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a>, I cannot claim that the article meets the requirements. I had not realised this when I wrote it and apologise for that. There may have been magazine reviews of this product, but as I am not aware of them at this time, I cannot make a case. What I do strongly object to is the claim that the article is an "obvious advert". The article makes no recommendations and does not make statements about how this product is better than any other product. It objectively describes what the product does, no more. It is not an advert and I am a technologist, not an advertiser (this product is free by the way). What I want to get across is that merely bringing to the attention the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a> rules and mentioning that the person nominating the article for deletion is not aware of any published reviews would have been sufficient and appropriate. I would have studied the rules closer and realised that there was a point - end of story. Accusing me of writing an "obvious advert" is completely unnecessary. Similarly, the comments about Google hits: where exactly is number of Google hits mentioned as a Wikipedia metric for notability? I suppose I could now accuse you of writing an obvious advert for Google. By the way, whenever the likes of Google or Yahoo launch a new product, there will for sure be a large number of hits for this product on Google in no time. Does this mean that the "world at large" has recognised the product as being significant? I think not. This is why the Wikipedia rules for notability use metrics such as independent magazine reviews, not Google hits. In conclusion: I accept that the article does not meet the requirements for notability. I do not accept that I wrote an advert and I do not understand the need for making such an accusation against me. CoffeeBreak 08:18, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Sempra_Energy_7c4c.html" title="Sempra Energy">Sempra Energy</a> had many CFOs and none of them have their own Wikipedia articles. The current CFO, Mark Snell does not have his own Wikipedia article. Sempra Energy has numerous officers, and they frequently change. Lloyd Levitin is not even the CFO anymore, and he did not have any notable accomplishments while he was a CEO. I think that he should be mentioned in a page listing all past officers of Sempra Energy. Also, if you read the source about Lloyd Levitin persuading the US Departement of Justice, you will find that it was not intepreted correctly. <a href="http://www.jurecon.com/news.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jurecon.com/news.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Lloyd Levitin was one of the many people involved in the case, and his name should be included in a related article.

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not seem to talk about businesspeople in any great depth. We have lots of articles on minor celebrities, politicians and jurists, but we seem to lack articles on engineers and businesspeople despite the impact these people have on our everyday life. Maybe the best solution is to work towards a guideline on businesspeople.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is more a criticism of how some people measure notability than of actual notability. Once somebody retires from a company, the company will normally remove his or her biography from the company's web site. And someone who makes multi-million dollar decisions (which seems like a good definition for notability) won't necessarily show up with lots of hits on Google. We should try to measure notability, not fame, because a business executive could well be notable (as I argue here) but not famous. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 07:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The argument by Ineffable3000, that he doesn't have a lot of "Google" hits is unconvicing; people shouldn't be evaluated solely on the basis of their Google tally. Having a large number of Google hits is a positive argument for inclusion, but having a low number is not a positive argument for deletion or non-inclusion; there are many well-respected sources for information that pre-date the internet era, and a trip to a brick-and-mortar library can clear up any doubts. This guy was listed in "Who's Who in Finance and Industry," "Who's Who in the West" and "Who's Who in America" for many years. These sources indicate he was the President of the American Gas Association, and of the Financial Executives Institute. Taken together, this looks to me like a significant person whose influence cut across industry, lobbying groups, and public policy.

<ul>
<li>Your assertion that journalists use Marquis titles to "look people up" is highly questionable at best. Can you provide an example? I do not believe any reputable journalist would use a vanity pub to establish the significance of a person, and nor should we. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 20:27, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Journalists use Marquis titles with all their faults because, on balance, Who's Who in America and its related titles are a reliable source of information about notable people. Granted, there is a vanity aspect to these directories, but most of the people listed in them <b>are</b> notable within their field. Ask a librarian or journalist you trust whether they would use Who's Who in America to get background about a notable person. And if you don't know any journalists, phone the city desk of your local newspaper and ask. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 20:55, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is not "whether they would use Who's Who in America to get background about a notable person", the question is "whether someone being listed in Who's Who in America confirms that person is notable absent any other reliable, reputable sources". Don't obfuscate the issue to support your inclusionist agenda. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 22:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue debated is not whether <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a> is notable but rather whether <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Levitin_c514.html" title="Lloyd Levitin">Lloyd Levitin</a> is not notable. --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 22:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are correct, of course, but a component of that issue we are debating is whether <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_Who%27s_Who_acb8.html" title="Marquis Who's Who">Marquis Who's Who</a> is a credible, third-party source with a reputation for fact checking and accuracy, and thus whether it can be used as a source to establish the notability of Mr. Leviten. And the answer is no. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 23:41, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is a wonderful irony here, because Who's Who is being accused of being just as much a vanity publication as Wikipedia has often been (and that is what we're here to fix)! The reference librarian at our university library said that although there are questions about the extent to which the Marquis editors go to verify a person's own account of their biography, the inclusion criteria are still somewhat strict. He told me that some professors at our University tried to be included in Who's Who and were rebuffed by editors, or cases of others who wanted to be in "Who's Who In America" and didn't meet the notability criteria for that, but did for the smaller, regional, "Who's Who in the East." This suggests that there is something to being listed by them. As to the issue of whether Lloyd Levitan should be listed, I would think that listing the officers of the Top 100 corporations in the U.S. (and his was one of them in the 1970s and 1980s) makes sense for WP. And not everyone testifies before congress...do you consider that notable? --<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClydeC_ea72.html" title="User:ClydeC">User:ClydeC</a> 14:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This would have been an A7 candidate if it'd been caught when it was added. It's been around for 9 months or so, however, so rather than speedying it, I'm taking it to AFD. The subject is non-notable. His claim to fame is that, via a vanity press, he's self-published a single book about homebrewing beer. He also has a website with the text of his book on it. Pretty much a bog-standard non-notable bio. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a>|<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a></sub></font> 04:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the original author of the page so obviously I'm biased, but I'll argue against two points above. 1) Fails WP:BIO: Mr. Palmer is a published author with multiple independent reviews of his work. You may not know who he is, but he certainly is respected and very well known in the homebrewing community. I met him this weekend at the <a href="../../../g/a/b/GABF_0f59.html" title="GABF">Great American Beer Festival</a>. He was a featured author and was signing books with many other authors, including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Papazian_416b.html" title="Charlie Papazian">Charlie Papazian</a>. Again, you may not have heard of him, but he is obviously important enough that they put him on show for 25,000+ people. 2) Brewer's Publications is a vanity press? They publish all of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Papazian_416b.html" title="Charlie Papazian">Mr. Papazian's</a> books. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStangbat_5901.html" title="User:Stangbat">Stangbat</a> 01:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> MnementhVII (Streamerp2p coder) How do new things get posted on Wikipedia?, sometimes it's going to be by somebody connected to the topic, as is the case here. How long is the 'grace period' for such a post to exist, without somebody not somehow connected to it posting, before it gets declared 'from a single purpose account' and nuked?. The current contributors to the article are admittedly all listeners to the stream and not completely independent. (but are not sock puppets). RadioX/streamerp2p is creating something that could be a new internet meme, that of 'live podcasting', and especially that of broadcasting live skype conferences to do chat shows. This has not previously been possible without bandwidth for streaming servers, and the accompanying constant donation begging they require. It currently seems to be a popular thing to do and is rapidy attracting new contributors. RadioX now has a full live schedule every evening, and some currently established shows from elsewhere are also appearing on their own channels, Chaos theory radio being one. I say it is worthy of having an article here. On the other hand, 'TalkRadioX - banned from Wikipedia' is a cool parting gift&#160;;-) If it is deleted, can it be re-added at some later date when it has grown more? <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: MnementhVII (<a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnementhVII_87ed.html" title="User talk:MnementhVII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MnementhVII_7a70.html" title="Special:Contributions/MnementhVII">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Okay, I have read all the comments on the "main page" and on the "delete" page ... some of which are my own. I guess I should be noted as a Wikipedia virgin "trying" to understand what is going on here. Obviously, many view Talk RadioX and the streamerp2p as "not notable" and "single purpose" ... well as for not notable, if everything "new" was "not notable", how would technology ever advance??? .. AND as for "single purpose", what else is it supposed to be? Maybe I'm wrong, but I consider the Wikipedia like a dictionary and when i'm looking in the dictionary for "one word" .. thats ALL I want to see. Could someone that knows the ins and outs of Wikipedia please explain what exactly it is that needs to be done, changed or ammended to "keep" this post. May I also add, on the Radio Dan and Intern Jessica show, they have made MANY references to "Wikipedia" and use this as a valuable "search tool" for many of their discussions! If it wasn't for the broadcasters of Talk RadioX, I still wouldn't know that Wikipedia exists. For all those that wish to "delete", I encourage you to tune in for the shows and if you wish to verbally discuss your point of view and give some valuable tips to help save this post, call Radio Dan at 8pm EST, we will all be listening as we are all concerned about the "delete" discussion and process. /I personally would appreciate any assistance that you could give. / Jackie Jack <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.93.22.148 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.93.22.148.html" title="User talk:65.93.22.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.93.22.148_0c18.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.93.22.148">contribs</a>) 2006-09-30T17:59:59 (UTC)</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia is not here to promote new technology - it is an encyclopedia. We have a number of notability guidelines which can be used to determine if a subject is notable enough to warrant an article, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> for a relevant one.

<li>MnememthVII Mine is definitely a single purpose account. I opened it to post in this discussion, rather than being an anonymous IP. I see it earned a 'single purpose account' tag, which actually appears worse than an anonymous posting. I think people outside of Wikipedia perceive it to be a 'peoples encyclopedia', where anybody can post things they think may be of interest to others. But that isn't really how it works, there is a heirarchy of sorts operating here. Correct? How would an article about the Streamerp2p app/network/community itself be accepted?. After several years of it's existence, nobody else has created an article, so it's likely to be me and my 'single purpose account' that does it. I see the other p2p radio system 'peercast' is on here, the article also having been created by it's developer, and that is marked as biased (but not pending delete) even though it contains factual innacuracies that are detremental to peercast.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MnementhVII (<a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnementhVII_87ed.html" title="User talk:MnementhVII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MnementhVII_7a70.html" title="Special:Contributions/MnementhVII">contribs</a>) 2006-09-30T18:52:31 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>I have removed any emotive words, and every POV point made is footnoted with a source (as per Wikipedia policy). I am currently searching for people and arguments which agree with the detention of children. If you know of any please feel free to add them. Children have specific problems as associated with detention, and should be treated separately from adults or from a general mandatory detention article. Children are specifically dealt with under CROC. The HREOC report that I refer to throughout the article was commissioned by the government itself. I have reported the government response, a two line statement, denying the report's 900 page findings. I came to Wikipedia because what has happened to these children is being systematically deleted from national memory. I thought perhaps here they might have a chance here.[[User:DabooksterDabookster 9.41, 2 October 2006. Please re-read the article and let me know what else I can do.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nick belongs to the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_community.html" title="Seduction community">seduction community</a> and appeared at cliffslist.com the worlds greatest seduction PUA in montreal. If you search for the term "Playboyskool" you will get over 31,000 hits. If you go <a href="http://www.cliffslist.com/page2sif.pl" class="external text" title="http://www.cliffslist.com/page2sif.pl" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you can see all the PUAs that attended the cliffs convention and he is only mentioned as "Nick" under "Playboyskool". So let's sum this up real quick: He has media coverage, both in europe (TV, magazine articles) and in the states (cliffslist DVDs). He is a notable member of the seduction community. There are over 30k results for "Playboyskool" (that's why I redirected the page). Playboyskool is even listed on amazon.</li>

You say that the argument that "just because some articles are in german" is nonsense. Yet it's not just "some" articles that are in German or another non-English language, it is <i>all</i> of them. If you can add to the page <i>one</i> English news article on Nick Shane, I will change my opinion. As for the 31k google hits, the vast majority of these are not in English. I strongly suggest that you do not remove the template from the page, because that is a violation of wikipedia policy. Once an article is put on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">articles for deletion</a>, the process must run its course, and the fate of the page is decided by a vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I know of one english reference: The british daily record (October 19, 2005). Since it isn't available online, and only offline, you will have to go check out the archives by yourself. What I do know though is that he IS featured in the motion picture The Last Blast (2007) and he is on cliffslist DVDs 2006. If we delete the page now, the page will simply reappear in a couple of months time when the new cliffslist DVDs are out, and when we know more about official press releases from the motion picture. Given the media coverage he already has from europe (which can be reviewed online) and the fact he is american and will be featured on the worlds greatest PUAs by cliffslist, he deserves a page on wikipedia.86.140.57.90 02:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. As per THE KING. A German Wikipedia article may be justified, but his notability within the English-speaking seduction community is questionable. Furthermore, with the current media frenzy on seduction, anyone claiming to be a 'Dating Guru' is given coverage. As stated above by SecondSight, what makes David DeAngelo and Lance Mason (of Pick-Up 101) notable is their mention within the community. Even a search of Thundercat's blog reveals three hits for 'Playboyskool'; two mentioning his presence at Cliff's List '06, another being a passing slate of the material on the site. Searching Fastseduction.com with Google turned up nothing for either Playboyskool or Nick Shane. -- <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> 11:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There seem to be two different arguments floating about. 1. If Nick should have an english page at all, and 2. if he is a notable member of the seduction community. So far we have come to a conclusion that he has media coverage in the english speaking world, which justifies him to an article on wikipedia. Now according to wikipedia rules, if coverage exists in the media and you can prove the references, you can add the page. So in my humble opinion and as I understand wikipedia rules, the page about Nick Shane on the english wikipedia can stay and should not be deleted. The next debate would be his connection to the seduction community but that's another debate and shouldn't coincide with whether this article should be deleted anyway or not. Therefore we should add to the article page: "His connection to the seduction community itself has not been as established as other members may have". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Rocketfingers_e378.html" title="User:Johnny Rocketfingers">Johnny Rocketfingers</a> 19:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have been a user of so suave, fast seduction, thundercats lair, and mysterys forums for years now and have no idea who Nick Shane is. I was stunned to see his name alongside the likes of Ross, Neil, Mystery, Badboy and Tyler. This article appears to be an adervtisement for a little known dating coach, not a notable member of the seduction community itself. Donny Whiteman 05:36, 3 october 2006(UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Allright, here's what I would suggest we do: Apparently, he hasn't made his full mark inside the "seduction community" yet so we should add that either to criticism or under the part seduction community in the article. However, since he does have media coverage in europe and the united states, he should have a page on wikipedia but it needs some cleanup. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Rocketfingers_e378.html" title="User:Johnny Rocketfingers">Johnny Rocketfingers</a> 23:35, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Let me just mention here that Alexa numbers aren't representative enough for a country like India. Although I don't know what is the actual usage nos for this site, I don't think they have published any numbers yet. As far as I know Bixee is the first Web 2.0 startup of India and the first vertical search engine for India and thereby does deserve a mention here. They have been covered in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Today_61c4.html" title="Business Today">Business Today</a> and Business India, the two popular business magazines of India. Bixee is serving a good need as a job search engine product and India job seekers like me do use it on a regular basis.

Someone said it was covered in <i>Business Today.</i> Okay, please provide a link to an actual dated article? Did the magazine cover it as a formal profile, or just include a mention of the site in a list? If the latter, that's what's called a "trivial mention", not real press. But if someone can provide proof that this site is notable enough to have <i>non-trivial</i> coverage in third-party sources, I might change my mind.

She is more 'notorious' than 'notable' and is big among people who believe 'in that kind of thing' and follow 'that kind of site' even if she does lack credibility in some areas (hey, even non-credibly people can have wiki articles, sanity isn't a prerequisite for inclusion).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>LMH deserves a biography at the very least due to her prolific spewings of things written and filmed.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While the skull has a relatively substantial number of google hits, virtually none of them count as acceptable sources in a Wikipedia article. Given it is of borderline notability I'd say the door should be open to recreation in the event of verifiable sources being created, but until then it is probably beyond being salvaged. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 16:35, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's disappointing to see an article with so many facts and figures and no references, but unfortunately that is also true for the majority of article on wikipedia. This article is not bollocks, there actuallly is a skull that has excited some debate among fringe scientists and people with an interest in such things.

<li><b>Keep</b> The shear size and scope of this website makes it rather notable. Its spawned 2 sites, and in a very short time has taken a very large part of The Sims fanbase. While Alexa rank isn't a criteria for inclusion, it does indicate that the website is popular and the information should be present. WP:WEB is only a guideline and not an a binding policy. It certainly doesn't seem to be written to address websites or other internet based things that would garner massive attention on the internet, but not the attention of mass media. Mass media isn't our litmus test anymore than google or Alexa are.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:09, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Regardless of what Alexa ranks and the Google test indicate, this <i>still</i> fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

Yes, there may be other website-related articles on Wikipedia which are trivial in nature, and they deserve to be deleted just as much as ModTheSims2. But I only contribute to websites that fall within my scope of interest, and seeing as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sims_2_4964.html" title="The Sims 2">The Sims 2</a> is one of my interests. ModTheSims2 may be a notable website in the Sims community, and can perhaps be mentioned in a blurb as a significant website to the modding community. But articles such as these will eventually be rendered obsolete and useless to both the Sims community, and the mainstream community at large, and therefore, in my opinion, has no place in Wikipedia as this article has no historical value, and the article provides absolutely nothing to those wanting to learn more about the Sims modding community. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillygostly_3a85.html" title="User:Sillygostly">Sillygostly</a> 03:46, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Most of the content was written by the site owner. Which in itself, may not be a problem, but there are things like the mentioning that the adult sites were split off, but the reason was likely because paypal threatened to drop them.

It's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">not neutral</a> but adding an assumption that the reason was because of paypal is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>--pulling the reason off of an internet forum doesn't jive with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> documentation.

<ul>
<li>I wouldn't go so far as to call the article advertising, but it does have an unencyclopedic tone in places (such as "<i>You'll want to watch for great products and services...</i>" and "<i>It's a win-win situation for everyone that way.</i>"). It's also the same essential topic as <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliate_marketing.html" title="Affiliate marketing">Affiliate marketing</a>, which is better-referenced and more comprehensive. That's why I think a merge there makes sense, so the good parts aren't sacrificed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Is it? I work in a university full of professors. I certainly hope I dont have to add them all to Wikipedia? Many of these professors are chairs in various departments within the University of Sydney and on academic panels advising the government.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Vastly incorrect. Boston.com actually acquired BostonDirtDogs, and pays the maintainer. And Boston.Com is the Boston Globe.

<dd><b>Comment</b> As a daily visitor to Boston.com I've always been under the impression that the site and the Globe are separate entities with the same ownership -- that Boston.com has the exclusive rights to publish online Globe content, but it's not <i>the</i> Globe website like nytimes.com is for the Times. Boston.com's slogan is "your connection to the Boston Globe" (as in, Boston.com is a third party) and there is a distinct difference between the sections that appear in the newspaper and general content (travel, real estate, some A&amp;E). Either way, we're probably getting off-topic in hashing out trivial details. My question stands: is the site notable beyond its connections (whatever they may be)? Remember the guidelines on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> -- even if BDD is distributed by a major site, that does not automatically confer notability on it (otherwise, we'd have a page for every Boston.com message board.) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 01:57, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> if you go to bostonglobe.com, it takes you right to boston.com and the paper's logo is right there. Apparently, breaking news and updated stories are available on that site.. I did remark on how the parent company of the Globe (the NY Times) is the 2nd largest shareholder in the Sox, which led to some interesting discussion about the site's editorial independence. You're right that we're quibbling over small details, but I still strongly believe that it satisfies <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as the article now stands <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 02:17, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, WP:WEB #3: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]" BDD has, for the most part, complete autonomy from the Globe/Boston.com, meets it easily. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The company at least seems to do some major business: it bought one of the first video advertising spots on google videos. A google search returned over 45,000 results, most of which seemed to be relevant. It certainly seems that this company is UK-based, which explains why I've never seen an advertisement.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I'm dubious.

<li><b>weak keep</b> (from nominator) - I probably should slightly elaborate on my initial reason for listing. The initial version that I listed came off, at least in my opinion, as containing little in the way of buzzwords and what basically boiled down to light-on-content marketing blurb, without giving a particularly goo dargument for notability. Honestly lacking any expertise in the area, but rather dissatisfied with what I felt was more in-line with a marketing brochure than an encyclopedia, I made this listing (when in hindsight I probably should have raised it on the talk page first, since my problems were more about the content than the existence of the article altogether, even though I felt it met vfd criteria). Having seen the changes made by the article's author since then, I'm fairly happy in that it comes off a lot more neutral, rather than as an endorsement, and contains a lot more factual content. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_8397.html" title="User:Plasma">Plasma</a> 14:57, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was nominated for deletion yesterday, but it was made a "speedy keep" after very little discussion. I re-nominated it for deletion because it does not appear to meet Wikipedia standards. As noted on it's discussion page, the article is not sourced. The single source in the article is in Hungarian. The small section of the source that is in English makes no mention of the subject of the article.</p>
<p>Also, (as I noted in my comments on the discussion page) why is this dog notable?</p>
<p>This article would probably be wiki material if it was just improved. Real sources and some kind of evidence that the dog is notable is a must. I'm not trying to be a jerk, let's just make sure the article meets the standards.

<p>We should have copied the previous discussion on this page to the article's talk page. To renominate it for deletion was not a fair thig to do, as I noticed nearly everybody (except the nominator) voted for keeping it.

<b>Here's the Deal...</b> <b>I</b> nominated it for deletion the second time. I don't necessarily think the article should be deleted, but it definitely did not meet Wiki standards when I read it on the main page. I saw that it had been nominated for deletion and then "speedy kept" all within an hour, without any legitimate discussion. That's simply not right. The article was UNSOURCED! It was a stub, and a poor stub at that. I've never nominated an article for deletion before, but I had one of my articles nominated, and I didn't like it. In hindsight, however, my article didn't meet the standards. I fixed it (with the help of some other people), and now the article is a good article. I didn't nominate this article because I wanted it to be deleted, I nominated it because I wanted it to be improved. Without the attention that it got by being nominated for deletion, it wouldn't have gotten the attention that it needed to be improved. Martylunsford 02:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mancs was nominated for deletion the second time by user:Sam1174 on that account's first edit. You state above that you in fact made the nomination. Why then not in your own name? Why hide your identity? If you wanted Mancs to be improved and not deleted, then why not edit it or simply put some such request on the talk page? It got speedy keep because others thought it met standards (sometimes "short" equals "concise" and not "stub" and it WAS sourced).

<li><b>Delete</b>, just because I can. I object to the common practice of discounting an AfD, (or anything else for that matter) because of the nominator or editor's lack of an edit history. When I first started editing at wikipedia, I was accused of being an SPA, and told that my opinion was to be ignored several times. It is an elitist attitude, and should be reserved for cases where there is clear evidence of a conflict of interest.

<li><b>Comment</b> the nominator's lack of history isn't what is troubling... what is troubling is the fact that the nominator put forth no reason for deletion other than a vague <i>"...does not appear to meet Wikipedia standards"</i>, a claim that a native language source isn't good enough, and then states that this could be a Wikipedia article if this was cleaned up.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Mancs obviously is about as notable as a working dog can get. (For a scholarly reference to the furry guy, see my recent addition to his article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mancs&amp;curid=7124744&amp;diff=78544791&amp;oldid=78442521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mancs&amp;curid=7124744&amp;diff=78544791&amp;oldid=78442521" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>).

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There's nothing wrong with <i>either</i> the speedy keep <i>or</i> the renomination. Per <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html#Applicability" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep#Applicability</a>, clause 6, pages should not be nominated while on the main page. Therefore, it was perfectly appropriate to speedy keep while Mancs was a front-page item, and perfectly appropriate to re-nominate once he wasn't.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I wish people would stop attacking the nom as an SPA or for having "bad faith" -- the RFD shouldn't turn on whether or not the nom sucks, and debating that issue here isn't constructive to the discussion.</li>
<li>On the gripping hand, the nom is wrong -- AFD shouldn't be an accellerated clean-up request. Mancs looks reasonably notable, so at the <i>very least,</i> it would have been a good idea to engage in more talk page discussion asking for verifiable evidence of his notability.</li>

<dd>Bad faith nomination? Your original speedy keep was a bad faith speed keep. I explained my reasons for the second nomination, but my primary reason was that the original article, which did not meet wiki standards, was speedy kept by you. If you had simply allowed the discussion to take place, the article would have been improved and there would have been no need for the second nomination. The people who are voting to keep it now are looking at the improved article. Of course they are going to vote to keep it. If they had looked at it a week ago, it wouldn't have been so clear-cut.

Secondly, I will point out to you that it is considered out of process to nominate an article for deletion simply because you think it needs improvement, at least not before slapping some sort of {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} tag on it and giving other editors a reasonable amount of time to take action on it (and a lot of admins would argue it's <i>never</i> a proper reason to nominate). --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:26, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article should be <b>deleted</b> based on the speculative nature (POV) of the references provided and the author’s further misquoting of these references. Alpha Kappa Nu has been out of existence for 100 years. The only authentic proof of its existence at all is the picture provided. Membership roster and bios can be deduced by this picture, if one is desirous to labor in that original research.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, and of the utmost importance, since there’s no written documentation to be found anywhere in the form of a Constitution, preamble, or mission statement, it’s speculative to conclude whether or not Alpha Kappa Nu was a club, society, fraternity, exclusive membership based on race, gender, or social status, academic, social, or service oriented (“strengthen the Negro voice at the city and the university”? Says who?), or otherwise. Presenting any such evidence as 100% fact on this or any other site, as well as any and all journal and newspaper publications should be avoided.</dd>

<p><small>Black-sponsored Greek letter organizations on the Indiana University campus might well have begun in 1903, but there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization. In that year, a club was formed called Alpha Kappa Nu with the purpose of strengthening the Blacks' voice at the University and in the city of Bloomington. There is no record of any similar organization at Indiana until the chartering of Kappa Alpha Nu, a forerunner of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, in 1911. <i>-The Story of Kappa Alpha Psi by William Crump, Copyright 1991</i></small></p>

A girl in Norway, a man in Finland, tons of people in America, a chinese kid, a woman in Bangladesh...the list goes on. I have been doing some research and I actually got to talk and meet with him. He was a very interesting person who lead a troubled life. Renegade1116 is an underground icon. he isn't something that you'd find in a magazine or in print. Like an urban legend. He isn't as famous as a movie star, but people know of him. A surprisingly large amount of people. I figured it might do him a little justice to put something up about him on wikipedia. I think you guys are making a way bigger deal of this than really exists. You have multiple articles way worse than this that you let survive.

<li><b>Comment</b> he is NOT notable online. That's the entire point of this. Think of movie stars for a second, ignoring the comparison. They had their start somewhere else. They got inducted into wikipedia after they had done notable things OUTSIDE of it. They didn't appear on wikipedia all noteable online already. Someone must have seen their acting/movies and decided they belonged online in wikipedia. This is exactly what this is. Usernames have nothing to do with it. Results of "searches" don't matter. That's the whole point I am trying to create this...so there will be more informaation available. And anyways, why do you guys seem so harsh? Is one article wasting wikipedia's space so significatnly? Renegade1116 is noteable outside of online places. THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE ARTICLE!

I am hoping I will learn from this to avoid future mistakes. I realized the article was wrong as defined by Wikipedia a long time ago. I just wanted to see if I could possibly get around it in some way. I guess userfication is the only way to do that. I hope you'll all forget me that way I can start posting decent, wiki-rule following wikis in the future. Thank you all for putting up with me, and thanks for at least discussing it instead of automatically deleting it. I love wikipedia and I apologize for any inconvenience(s) I might have caused.

<p>Over one million people have downloaded the BibleReader utility, maybe someone could help us in how to present it, other wiki items are very similiar such as: <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos_Bible_Software_6080.html" title="Logos Bible Software">Logos Bible Software</a>, e-sword, and PhotoShop (software), thanks Drew Haninger (Drew444)</p>

<dd>He's got a point. If we're going to allow the first two examples (PhotoShop isn't relevant here) we should probably allow this one as well.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The assertions of notability for this family are based on folklore (founding a temple), hosting cultural events, two or three family members who haven't got their own articles, and a building. But a Google search in English easily confirms existence of the family as landowners, and for example Poomulli Neelakanthan Namboodiri seems pretty notable for elephant care, <a href="http://www.keralatourism.org/index.php?source=desti&amp;destid=2132065952&amp;zone=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keralatourism.org/index.php?source=desti&amp;destid=2132065952&amp;zone=1" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> and <a href="http://www.elephantcare.org/manauthr.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elephantcare.org/manauthr.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> so I don't see a good argument for deletion.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Being an avid gamer and clan leader, i am always looking at games to keep my clan active and happy. PoE 2 has given us so much that it would be criminal to remove their page from wiki. The PoE 2 team have spent nearly a year making the MOD for no money, just the love of what they do and to see so many gamers enjoy their work.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. This is an extremely popular mod. This would be akin to deleting the wiki articles for Counter Strike, Team Fortress, or Natural Selection. To me, this seems like a pointless vendetta grudge. I see a lot of stuff going on about vanity, software, and the like. Of course wikipedia style guide says that if you see something you don't like, you don't delete it, you make it better. Prose would be the exact word they use. In fact, the only reflection of vanity I see here is a pathetic "who can drop the most wikipedia jargon" penis measuring contest amongst the people recommending a delete vote. You may not like it, but what reeks of vanity is the bleating and chest-pounding of the users here. Add to that the borderline stalking of other users including the helpful tips as to what contributions they've made in a sad and transparent effort to somehow slander their position (and yes, I know that "<i><b>per</b></i>" (look, I can drop the jargon too!) what wikipedia is not, this isn't an experiment in democracy so their opinions may somehow count "less" in your eyes towards consensus) and you have what is sadly becoming endemic to Wikipedia: the hard nosed clique of "editors" who wear their barnstars like a crooked sherriff's badge and attempt to enforce their own mishmash ideas of what wikipedia should be, no questions or protests.

<p><b>AHEM</b>. Let's look at these, shall we?</p>
<dl>
<dd>WP:SOFTWARE: And I quote, "<i>The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, user guides, television documentaries, and full-length magazine reviews 2 except for the following:<i>"</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore POE meets WP:SOFTWARE. WP:SOFTWARE is no longer a concern. POE has been written about in magazines. Therefore, notable for software. Any further statement involving its violation of WP:SOFTWARE will be met with a simple copy and paste of this paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>WP:RELIABLE SOURCES. This one is bullshit. You guys are obviously stacking the deck against POE. All of the problems with this article in fact stem from the fact that it does not cite its sources. You then extrapolate this into WP:S and WP:RS claiming that because it does not cite its sources, it therefore does not have reliable sources (a truism) and because WP:S requires that it be written about in those sources, you're attempting to chuck a WP:S violation in with it (another truism).</dd>
<dd>WP:VERIFIABILITY The only problem here is a lack of citations. Once the magazine articles are reproduced (I have seen them myself with POE featured in them) then this is no problem. The article is verifiable, it is just not <i>verified</i>. There is a difference.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what do we see? We see that the only problem here is that the articles in question have not been linked. Instead, you guys use that to pile on multiple accusations and when the people who want to keep this article has to be done, you toss some abbreviated jargon down at them and say "find out for yourselves." You guys, especially <i>you</i>, Whispering, are terrible editors. You bite the newcomers (and please, fuck the whole single purpose account, we all got into wikipedia editing by finding an article on here we had an interest and knowledge in, these newcomers are working to save something they care about and rather than acting like meat puppets indefensibly defending something non-defensible, they are <i>COMING TO YOU AND ASKING FOR SPECIFICS THAT YOU WANT DONE</i>. Here's what's going to happen. If you want it changed, rather than the textual diarrhea that is the jargon you spew forth every time somebody asks you for specifics, respond with specifics. Because I can find no other reason <i>except</i> for bad faith to assume that in the 140 characters you have written in reply to this AfD, you haven't found the ability to, for example, write "If you would only link to the magazine articles that have written about POE, you would have satisfied all criteria." You know what's crazy? That's only 115 characters! You would have actually saved time by being helpful instead of being an obstructionist. Same goes for <i>all</i> the other editors here. When it is empirically verifiable that being helpful and not violating WP:Please Do Not Bite the Newcomers would have taken <i>less</i> effort than doing what you're doing, I can't help but assume bad faith on your part. And when I assume bad faith, I start going through edits finding every time it's ever been empirically verifiable that you have put more effort into obstructing something than helping, and therefore committing bad faith (and god knows what other breaches) and then I gotta kick it up to RfC. And I don't want to do that because the evidence I dragged out in an RfC was already responsible for an indefinite ban on a user, and I don't like getting people banned at all, for any reason, because I don't believe in it. But I do believe in giving bad faith violators a slap on the wrist. So. Please. Next time, take the time and effort to write out specifics because as we have seen without a shadow of a doubt, not only is it more helpful, not only does it take less effort, but it pisses less people off too, so we can only assume good faith. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 19:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; the fact that the article has been edited by an acquaintance of the subject need not disqualify it. For one thing, this editor has been up-front about this, as shown above here; the pertinent question is whether the subject is worthy of inclusion: I say he is, based on his book alone (<i>The Hype about Hydrogen</i>). +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 01:51, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

For the bio in question, the two notability items for which the strongest case can be made are 1) political figure; and 2) author. I believe it meets neither. With regard to political figure, I don't see that being acting head of a small part of the Department of Energy satisfies wikipedia's guideline: <i>"Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature."</i> The second item we could argue to make a case for inclusion is as a popular author. Here Wikipedia/notability suggests: <i>"Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work."</i> I'm not aware of any awards his books have received, and these publications are neither peer reviewed nor published by an academic press. For comparison, consider how many recipients of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Prize_for_Environmental_Achievement" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Prize_for_Environmental_Achievement" rel="nofollow">Tyler Prize</a>, the biggest award for energy and environmental policy, do *not* have corresponding Wikipedia articles.

<p>This article was first nominated for deletion in June, and the AfD was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1980s_retro_movement_052a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1980s retro movement">closed as a "keep but cleanup"</a>. However, in the three months since, not only has it not been cleaned up, it's gotten much worse (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1980s_retro_movement&amp;diff=78184101&amp;oldid=61949663" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1980s_retro_movement&amp;diff=78184101&amp;oldid=61949663" rel="nofollow">see diff</a>). Basically, the article is a gigantic <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> violation; there is no inherent evidence that society is in the midst of any "1980s retro movement" whatsoever, nor does the article even attempt to assert this as a fact. (There's been a cite tag on the first sentence of the article since the end of the first AfD; we're still waiting for that cite.) Most of the single-line "events" listed in the article are uncited, and many of them strain credulity past the breaking point (<a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a> is reminiscent of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty_%28TV_series%29_bd31.html" title="Dynasty (TV series)">Dynasty</a>?

Are you kidding me?) In addition, the entire article is America-centric, without admitting it. And on top of everything else, the article has a name that almost nobody will come to Wikipedia and search for in the first place. As this AfD is certain to get a number of blind "keep" votes from those with a strong personal interest in the page's survival, I strongly urge the closing admin to examine the article itself and the discussion here; please don't just count votes on this one. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:37, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Nom is right that the list doesn't prove there is a "movement" or anything, and with the current title there are OR issues, but as a list, it just needs some basic editing. I volunteer to edit the list down to very clear examples if it is kept (whether or not it is moved). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unverifiable matter of opinion and, in a way, original research. I think it would be pretty easy to compile a list of things that make it look like there's currently a "retro movement" for any decade. Really, how can there not be a 70s retro movement <i>now</i>, what with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Dolls_3326.html" title="New York Dolls">New York Dolls</a> having recently released a new album and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Simon_8aab.html" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a> out on the road plugging his new work (or would that be the current 60s retro movement?). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Follow up</i>: As embarrassed as I am to admit that I was "reading" the <i>Vancouver Province</i>, today they printed an article about Audrey Hepburn and how there's a big trend these days with fashion and pop culture emulating her (including the current GAP ad campaign built up around her). As a part of that, the article quoted someone in the local fashion industry as saying that Audrey's big right now because there is a big 50s revival going on. It just brings home the point that it's pretty easy to say that there's a particular pop-culture movement on at any time. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but just barely. I personally believe 80s retro is a definite trend, and a quick Google search for "1980s retro" suggests I'm not alone in that perception. As those proposing deletion have (rightly) pointed to the lack of citations, I will mention that one of the sources turned up by that brief search included a BBC News article<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4745635.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4745635.stm" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. It would obviously be preferable to have citations to some scholarly sources. It seems entirely correct however to suggest that the current "article" is really a list, and if kept it needs to be either massively overhauled or moved to an alternative title, with a number of the examples either cited or deleted. --<a href="../../../o/b/j/User%7EObjectiveBrit_38b3.html" title="User:ObjectiveBrit">Matthew Humphreys</a> 20:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Weak Delete</i>. My position is similar to that on the deletion of the 1970s retro movement, there could probably be a good article on this topic, but this isn't the one. Some verifiable prose on the movement in general coupled with a <i>shorter</i> list of examples and a category for other examples would go a long way toward improving this. But, per the nomination, if no one has cleaned it up since the last AfD, why would they do so now? So, unless someone comes forward and either <i>greatly</i> improves this article or volunteers to do so in a reasonable amount of time, I think Wikipedia will be better off without it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 18:39, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article, I've been reading through all of the complaints and deletion requests you and your comrades have made against videogames and mods in particular. It is quite clear you have some personal vendetta and opinions against the gaming world and you are taking it out on defenseless independent developers. Most of the articles more than fit the requirements requested of them and those that don't are willing to adjust to do so, but your unwillingness to compromise shows that it is personal. Stating that the official site from the developers themselves isn't sufficient citation, based solely on the fact that they are an independent developer and thusly aren't mainstream, is like saying Salvador Dali isn't a reliable source for his "Metamorphosis of Narcissus" painting, or Ryan Little isn't a credible source for his "Saints and Soldiers" film. Whether, you like it or not videogames are a huge part of and have great impact on today’s culture, and are strongly considered by those you love and work in the industry as an art form. I can understand not wanting Wikipedia to become an entertainment news website, it's an encyclopedia of the modern era. But taking videogames out of the picture is like wiping out history, or like deleting music from culture. Forgotten Hope, and several other mods have greatly contributed to the lifespan and cultural significance of the Battlefield franchise and gaming as a whole. If you disagree I suggest checking out a paper called "Am I a Mod or not? - An anaylisis of First Person Shooter modification culture" in which Forgotten Hope and several other mods are mention. The author (David B. Nieborg) even uses the official sites in his references along with several Wikipedia pages that are currently up for deletion... so don't let your personal opinions against videogames cloud your judgment of well collected factual and cited information.

<dd>But don't you agree that mods are bit different than some historical subject for example, or do you suggest me to mark all articles on your user page, which are mostly music, because they have no references? Forgotten Hope have been reviewed in maybe three magazines briefly. I can find up my copy of Tilt.tv magazine to reference the claim that Forgotten Hope is a Battlefield 1942 mod if it's going to change the article dramatically. Still, I prefer removing the parts that are "need sources" and mark it as a stub instead of removing 30 kbs of hand-written material. --<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudeo_0b6c.html" title="User:Pudeo">Pudeo</a>
<ul>
<li>As it is, I don't see what distinguishes this mod from the hundreds of other mods out there as far as third-party coverage goes. While primary sources (the game's website) can be acceptable sources of information, it is inappropriate for them to be the <i>only</i> source of information. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So what exactly are you looking for out of these third-party references... do you just what proof that it exists from some one other than the developers. Such as a highly reputable website <a href="http://mods.moddb.com/4402/forgotten-hope/" class="external free" title="http://mods.moddb.com/4402/forgotten-hope/" rel="nofollow">http://mods.moddb.com/4402/forgotten-hope/</a> or a vastly viewed and edited forum <a href="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?t=97722" class="external free" title="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?t=97722" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?t=97722</a>... Wikipedia defines verifiability as "that have already been published by reputable publishers" so the question is what is considered a reputable publisher. If PC/video game websites and forums aren't considered reputable publishers since they could be considered bias towards games... than music sites such a billboard.com or scientific journals such as the ones at worldscinet.com can't be considered reputable since they are bias to what they report on... I’d figure that these sources are the best sources since they do report on those subjects and as a result would know what they are talking about. Wikipedia's rules of verifiability are put in place to prevent people from publishing "original theories or original thoughts" on the site. Forgotten Hope neither an orginal theory or orginal thought by the editor, the primary link to the official website more than clarifies that. Any additional links are only reiterations of an already stated fact. ~ Remick</li>

<li>Ok, I figured the forums link was going to be a bit of a strech, they are usually opinion based and not factual based, so rarely work as a credible source. I guess what I don't understand is why delete the article for such a minor and fixable problem as insufficient amount of sources. You said that primary sources can be acceptable, but you just want more. It has a primary source where the vast majority of the information is coming from anyway, these mod articales aren't opinionated or harmful, and as I said before mods are a major part of the gaming industry which is a huge part of the worlds culture. Under 'unattributed material' it states "
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of removing such material immediately, editors are encouraged to move it to the talk page, or to place the 'fact' template after the disputed word or sentence, or to tag the article by adding 'not verified' or 'unsourced' at the top of the page".</p>
</blockquote>
So why ask for deletion, why not just mark as unsourced until the editor can obtain sufficient sources, there are plenty out there just takes a little looking. There are dozens of wikipedia pages with only one primary source if any. so why deny people of knowledge they may be looking for? Remick 23:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is an incomplete article on a valid topic. I know, it's not encouraging that the 1980s retro movement article hasn't improved, but I think there's ample evidence that <i>this</i> one really happened. The period in which the retro movement occurred is over, so at least now this article isn't covering current events. I don't even see the need for a cleanup tag, particularly; just mark it as a stub. Also, this article hasn't been subject to the same attempt to have it improved that the 80s one has. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is on a proposed type of battery technology that appears to be of highly questionably legitimacy. Unlike all other articles on new battery related technologies, the article contains no references to reputable peer reviewed journals; in fact, I am not able to find any references that I would consider reliable and reputable, making it impossible for this article to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. The only sources given are the corporate website, which is currently unavailable, an article which I believe was written by an employee on a website, a questionable wiki, and a distinctly unreliable and disreputable magazine. For the latter, other articles from the same edition, as listed on the linked website, are "Flying Saucers Alive!", "Quantum Leap Technology", and "Discover the Truth about Suppressed Inventions". I believe that these titles speak quite well as to the nature of the publication. All but the four latest edits on the page have been made by a single user, <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a>, who is James Salsman if the information on his user page is correct. I do not have any evidence that he is related to the company in the article. There is a variety of information and citations on the talk page, but the majority of the content does not appear to be related to the subject of the article - in fact, while I have little knowledge of the particular subject, having merely noticed the article while searching for standard energies of D cells, it does not appear that any of the independent and reputable sources on the talk page have anything to do with the article. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantine_Evans_2b64.html" title="User:Constantine Evans">Constantine Evans</a> 13:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

While the figures here don't make sense when compared with the figures there, my reasons for nominating it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size 0 can mean many different things in different contexts. The choice of meaning that has been taken is arbitrary. It would also seem pointless to try to round up every meaning of size 0 into one article.</li>
<li>The article gives no real useful information above what should be on <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_standard_clothing_size_c960.html" title="US standard clothing size">US standard clothing size</a> anyway. Indeed, that article should be expanded - at the moment it only goes down to size 6.</li>
<li>There are no other articles (that I have found, anyway) that focus on a single size in a single sizing system. OK, so some names of standard paper sizes are listed, but the ones I've found are dab pages or redirects. OTOH, I don't see anything that this can be redirected to that wouldn't bring us back to the statement that the choice of meaning is arbitrary.</li>

<p><b>KEEP and Correction to my Comment and Close AfD bad faith</b> After further digging I've determined that FairHair and Gene_Poole are two different people. However, this article was nominated for deletion by FairHair because he followed Gene_Poole to this page checking his user contributions. Figuring that Gene_Poole had an interest in this page, FairHair nominated it for AfD. Apparently, FairHair and Gene_Poole follow one another around taking opposing positions editing various pages. As a result, FairHair's latest nomination for deletion is Gene_Poole's own Empire of Atlantium page. Given that this page was nominated based solely on an act of retribution it should remain. Further, I recommend that both FairHair and Gene_Poole be blocked.--Freddulany 21:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Vikesland has been published, see <i>Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Self-Proclaimed Nations, Lonely Planet, 2006. ISBN: 1741047307</i> --DukeofAntwerp 21:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— DukeofAntwerp (<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDukeofAntwerp_0721.html" title="User talk:DukeofAntwerp">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DukeofAntwerp_063c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DukeofAntwerp">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li>The Principality of Vikesland is a micronation and meets the criteria for statehood set forth by both the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montevideo_Convention_6445.html" title="Montevideo Convention">Montevideo Conventionand</a> the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Community_a343.html" title="European Community">European Community</a> Opinions of the Badinter Arbitration Committee. The main criteria being a defined territory, permanent population, government and the capacity to enter into relationships with other sovereign states are the only foundation requirements for a sovereign state. None of these requirements necessarily has to conform to a certain size or standard, but their general characteristics should be taken into account.--DukeofAntwerp 21:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those have nothing to do with the criteria for having an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:26, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further, following the link to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronations.html" title="Micronations">Micronations</a> page, one will find several micronations that have no defined territory or territory that is far less than that of Vikesland...all of which currently have had Wikipedia pages running for some time now.--DukeofAntwerp 21:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, the Micronations book makes fun of these nonsense places (the description at amazon.ca, for example, reads <i>This is a fully illustrated, humorous mock-guidebook to the nations that people create in their own backyards--most of which can be visited.</i> ). And the book itself isn't even available through amazon.com. There is no notability of this place. It's not like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>, for example. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Zoe statements are false</b>, first, this is the link to buy the book on Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Micronations-Travel-Guides/dp/1741047307/sr=8-1/qid=1159566696/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4182735-0895352?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Micronations-Travel-Guides/dp/1741047307/sr=8-1/qid=1159566696/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4182735-0895352?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Micronations-Travel-Guides/dp/1741047307/sr=8-1/qid=1159566696/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4182735-0895352?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books</a> . Second, the authors of "Micronations" state, "Although a newcomer to the micronational world, Vikesland's government has been working hard to establish a system of sustainable government...with a comprehensive constitution (including a chapter of fundamental rights and bills renouncing war), a royal council to oversee government, and outward-looking policies, <b>the principality is well positioned to take it's place at the forefront of micronational affairs. ... The name Vikesland honors the adventuring spirit of the Vikings, while also highlighting the principality's physical land base.</b>" However, with all due respect to Sealand, Zoe is correct in that the royal ranch land alone is 650,000 sq meters. Again, this all according to "Micronations," the book.--DukeofAntwerp 22:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize, then, when I plugged in "Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Self-Proclaimed Nations" nothing came up at amazon.com, although it did at amazon.ca, but the amazon.com description itself tells us that this subject is nn - <i>For lovers of humour, <b>trivia and ephemera</b></i>.

<li>I am David Howe and a member of Vikesland's Royal Council.

It was only founded in 2005 and doesn't really seem to have done anything in the real world except mint 1 coin (and that was produced by someone in Spain).

</ul>
<p>Correction: again posting without any research, Vikesland Clearly states that is has no true sovereign territory and is considered for the most part as a non-territiorial entity. All lands are declared, not claimed which means that they privately own their land of influence, but are still under another governments laws. Yes they have been in contact and talks with real macro government entities which will be proven in the next month or so via undisputable video documentation. They were not escorted of the premises by security. Vikeslands sovereign political authority is over it's own internal affairs and citizenry, much like Atlantium. Your statement also discounts Atlantium's sovereignty. Please do your research before posting such material. Chris Beyette 216.36.157.25 17:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>'Not a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>' Reporting Micronational claims to sovereignty aren't a violation of WP:SOAP. to Quote WP:SOAP "Propaganda or advocacy of any kind.

All micornation claims to soveriegnty are considered silly by the 'real world' otherwise, they'd mot be micronations.. The <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible_Pink_Unicorn</a> is taken to be silly by its advocates even, but it still gets an article: 'silly' isn't really grounds for delete.

<li>The article at the moment states "Vikesland meets the criteria of both the Montevideo Convention and that of the Badinter Arbitration Committee." Sounds like micronation <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> to me. My main grounds for deletion are that this is a vanity project with no claims to encyclopedic or non-trivial notability. And silly nonsense is deleted with good reason from Wikipedia all the time. Your argument that challenges to original research POV statements are themselves original research and "not very Wiki" (not sure what you mean by this) seems rather illogical. I was basing my criticism in terms that the article's own description of the convention/committee criteria. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC) *** POV, I'll admit to - I didn't try to present both sides of the 'Original Research' issue, Sorry, I should have at the least included 'seems to me ' before the 'not very wiki'. Calling you for making statements that aren't sourced from verifiable outside sources isn't "Original Research'. &lt;NI&gt; I hope I corrected the NPOV problem around Statehood (the article now states the Vikesland "Claims" to meet the Standards of Montevideo...., and that the standard is not used by other states to grant recognition....And no UN member nation has recognized them.) BTW The article is a LOT shorter than when I saw it, &lt;NI&gt; Yes, silly nonsense is deleted, but not just because its silly.<a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_4034.html" title="User:Bo">Bo</a> 04:43, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Atlantium and other micronations are not recognized as well, does this discount them too?

Granted, Atlantium has a few more articles on it, more than one, but let's be serious here, what has it done that Vikesland has not except being founded earlier. This isn't meant as an attack on Gene Poole or Atlantium, instead it's to illustrate a point. If Vikesland doesn't meet the basic threshold, which seems to be in rapid flux here, then there will be a lot more candidates for deletion. The mere controversy it's creating right here dictates that it stay up. When this documentary is released, then what will be the issue? Keep it!--Drewdaily 14:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>And, yet, there are several notable micronation listings on Wikipedia that are nothing more than just that, Mr. West. I'll refrain from listing any others as the last example is now being consider for AfD by the misguided. Folks, I don't know if some of you have an agenda here other than making Wikipedia a better place. Only each of you knows your motivations. The only thing I wish to stress is that you must consider not your own opinion, but the opinion of others as well. People that don't have an opinion to voice here at this time. Obviously, not everyone thinks alike and shares the same opinion. A couple of people have addressed the issue of being fake as the foundation for being deleted. I'm not sure what that litmus test is for a real or fake nation -- that seems like a slippery slope and the examples are many. It seems like there are many people that would disagree with Vikesland being fake. A minority of people, perhaps, I don't know. But, you may not like <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_Tap_1486.html" title="Spinal Tap">Spinal Tap</a>. It's a fake rock band and was the subject of a fake documentary.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Fascinating topic, but putting limits and conditions to this sort of list is difficult. It <i>could</i> be argued that this isn't OR, on the grounds that specifying what spelling you use and deriving the pronouncation that way is syllogistic.

<li>Geez, if it will prevent you from sleep at night. I guess I am new to editing wikipedia but I don't really understand the problem of there being an article on this game. If people only wanted to learn about nationwide popular stuff i dont see why wikipedia even exists! Isn't the point of a wiki that people can share more unique information and ideas? Mainstream stuff doesn't need individuals, it is the small things that need the smal people. and i think wikipedia is for the small people <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scmcverry (<a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScmcverry_d1c0.html" title="User talk:Scmcverry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scmcverry_d761.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scmcverry">contribs</a>).</small> <i>Please sign all your comments with four tildes (~~~~).</i>

<b>Codeweavers article should stay</b></p>
<p>This was a short article to illustrate the facts about Codeweavers ltd as a company. It is claimed the the article should be deleted due to it not conforming with <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but in the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> it states that:</p>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</p>
<p>Codeweavers has been the subject of several published works, most recently an article by 'Automotive Managment magazine' discussing Codeweavers ltd and it's Parent company Jigsaw finance ltd involvement in the new 'Utopian' motor finance concept. Codeweavers Ltd have also featured in other magazines such as 'Motor Matters magazine'.</p>
<p>If proof of these publications is required, please request.</p>
<p>In closing, the Codeweavers ltd article in Wikipedia should be allowed to remain as it it a valid and relevant article. Neilbeardmore 14:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand your concern about offering high quality content that reflects the topic at hand, but the discussion forums offer the information on the residual and money factor that you need to see when determining how to calculate a lease. I will edit out the lease compare thing, but the others offer substantial advice on the subject. The articles that you referenced are theory and are not practical. I'm just curious if any of you have ever leased a vehicle? If you have then you would know that the material I have provided is all up to date, and accurate. I have no business editing an article on RNA, but I do know this subject.<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicko_72ff.html" title="User:Sonicko">Sonicko</a> 23:00, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Your question ("have any of you ever leased a vehicle?") is a prime example of why this article doesn't fit Wikipedia's guidelines. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>; your original research is not appropriate for the encyclopedia, and in general the personal experiences of editors should not form the bases for articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> So Wikipedia is used for offering info on members of bands like "Mike Shinoda" yet is unacceptable when it comes to vital information for what most people is the biggest financial decision besides buying a house? Sounds like great logic to me. I like how you judge what is valid and acceptable based upon your limited at best knowledge of the subject at hand. There are plenty of discussion forums on "Mike Shinoda" as an example as well, but I don't see that article up for deletion, or people discussing the merit of that. 24.24.212.240 17:04, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks which is where I think "consumer how-to" stuff like this belongs. Then <b>Rewrite from scratch</b> The topic is encyclopedic but the article should really take a broader perspective. For example, car leasing is a relatively new phenomenon. Until the 80's (or so), car leasing was not a common means for acquiring a personal automobile. What changed to make it more attractive? Then, for a while, it became less attractive and now it is making a comeback. What was behind the drop in popularity and the current return to popularity? These issues are more in line with the encyclopedic mission of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 05:12, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Two of grounds for deletion are incorrect. It's certainly verifiable, given that you can check the titles against the publisher's catalog, which is certainly reliable enough. Not to mention the Library of Congress, Amazon, and whatever else is available to the book ordering trade. So we have only WP:ISNOT, particularly 1.7.3 to argue about. And that's where I can say as a list, this has some potential use, if any of the titles warrant further elucidation, even a whole article. I'd suggest making this part of the main article, but then we'd have problems with that growing unmmanageable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as I advocated before. This is a mirror of a list which is available online from an authoritative source. The list at the publishers is complete, accurate and up to date - our list is not guaranteed to be so as new books are published all the time. Previous and present keep arguments often rested on the fact that ...for Dummies books are notable; that is not questioned, but <b>we already have an article on ...for Dummies books</b>, this is just a list of them at an unspecified date. There are precisely zero bluelinks to individual books, making this list considerably <i>less</i> useful than the one on the publisher's website, which has a short synopsis for each book. This list violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as both a directory and an indiscriminate collection of information (why this particular publisher's catalogue?).

<li><b>Keep</b> per the previous AfD. This is one of the true publishing success stories of the last 20 years. We obviously need the list if we want to be a serious reference work, that goes beyond video games characters, obscure porn stars or irrelevant diploma mills. Nominator cites wp:not without referring to a specific clause- not really surprising since none apply. Concern over lack of sources may be valid, although nothing prevents the nom from adding sources. In fact, few of our hundreds of book lists have sources, essentially because the publication of the book proves its existence. Examples include <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cookbooks.html" title="List of cookbooks">List of cookbooks</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_memoirs.html" title="List of political memoirs">List of political memoirs</a>, or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_books.html" title="List of fictional books">List of fictional books</a>, etc. Ongoing discussion on talk page showed interest in improving the list, something this nom ignored when making this nomination. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are comparing a list of political memoirs and fictional books? Those lists contain notable authors and political figures created by wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Those lists are incomplete, lack clear inclusion standards and have no references. This list has the potential to be complete and has clear inclusion standards. Otherwise, you are certainly entitled to fail to see the significance of the Dummies series, but the significance is clearly implied, not the least because we have an article on the series. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point was that this list, unlike those, has fewer problems with the completeness of the list. If it's missing a title or two, that is easily correctable, and more likely because a new title was just released than any actual problem.

<dd>The series is notable that's why it has an article: <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a>.

<dd>and since people may have an interest in knowing whether a particular book in the series has been published, well, I see the purpose of this list.

<li><b>Keep</b> or delete the entire Wikipedia database. To say an article should be deleted as its somewhere else on the web is ridiculous, as practically the only way Wiki verifies articles is if you can find alternative sources that back up that information on the web!

<li><b>Delete</b> - If the publisher's list only included current in-print books and we listed out-of-print books, AND we included ISBN references and listed authors for each individual title, AND we had articles on individual books then I might be inclined to change my mind. But right now it's just copyvio listcruft, and according to the article it's over six months out of date. It seems like the logical thing would be to delete this and just add the external link to the <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a> page. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 09:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>On a personal note, I am apalled by the lack of civility in this AfD discussion. But I agree with JJay; the clause of WP:NOT needs to be identified if it is to apply as evidence for supporting deletion. And while he has contributed subsequently to the downfall of civility in this discussion, I don't agree that JJay's original Keep vote insulted anybody. His points were all rational regardless of anybody's judgement on their applicability. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/t/User_talk%7EKitch_10d3.html" title="User talk:Kitch">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kitch_c2c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kitch">Contrib</a>)</sup> 12:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
