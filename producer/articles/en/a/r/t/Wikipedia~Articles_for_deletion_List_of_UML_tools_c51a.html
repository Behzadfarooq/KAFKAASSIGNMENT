<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. If you delete this, there will be a great pressure to create a separate article for every entry.

As per the "link spam": If it helps to overturn the delete request, I would propose to remove the external links on those entries that do have an article. But please note that then that should be done on all articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_software_5eec.html" title="Category:Lists of software">Category:Lists of software</a> as well (please note that on several software articles there has been no consensus to do so in the past). Please also note that these kinds of lists previously resided in their respective article (For example I split off <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Petri_net_tools_61a8.html" title="List of Petri net tools">List of Petri net tools</a> from <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petri_net.html" title="Petri net">Petri net</a>. The question is, will this be moved to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petri_net.html" title="Petri net">Petri net</a> back then?). This here will be a precedent. So I would recommend to take due care on this. Thank you for your careful consideration. --Adrian Buehlmann 09:41, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> There is sufficient debate not to have a "speedy" keep. I think that any notability should be prerequisite for list inclusion in lists such as this, so several stubs wouldn't be a bad outcome to this: they would provide an instant test over whether a product was useful or just more link spam. I have started cleaning up the lists that are in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_software_5eec.html" title="Category:Lists of software">Category:Lists of software</a>, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wiki_software.html" title="List of wiki software">List of wiki software</a> (partly by rming external links and non-notable products). But one list at a time! Some of the articles in the wiki list need to be stubbed. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a> is my most controversial List AfD, but it also has:
<ul>
<li>one of the highest level of link spam</li>
<li>so many programs which are non-notable</li>
<li>very little effort to clean it up and keep it clean has been made (people have even thwarted past efforts to remove the external link cruft)</li>
<li>an unmaintainable (or at least unmaintained) breadth of focus (see discussion page on last question of AfD)</li>
<li>the category includes all of the programs in the list and some which aren't in the list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Petri_net_tools_61a8.html" title="List of Petri net tools">List of Petri net tools</a> does need a clean-up, but people have been making efforts to do so. I haven't yet touched it. Again: One list at a time. There's no reason to move these lists back to the original articles. But that's not an excuse to keep poor lists. Categories should be used when they can provide enough information. Lists should be kept to the same standard as if they were kept in the original article. This list hasn't been kept to that standard; the link spam is just terrible.</li>

<dd>"one of the highest level of link spam" do you really talk about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>?? "an unmaintainable (or at least unmaintained) breadth of focus (see discussion page on last question of AfD)" there was nearly zero discussion about deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>. "very little effort to clean it up" - whoops?? how that. As you can see I have kept that list quite clean without much discourse among contributors. I'm really asking are you really talking about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>? Puzzled. --Adrian Buehlmann 15:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>46 external links when only 17 articles are in wikipedia. Even rming external links for blue links, this is 29 external links &amp; 17 internal ones. Since notability should be a criteria for inclusion in the list, a list shouldn't have more external links than internal ones. If you can clean up the list &amp; it is useful beyond the category, I'll gladly change my vote. Right now it is more spam than not. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 16:15, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. The elinks for softwares that have an article can be removed. No problem. What I see a problem is, with "non-notable". Who decides that? I can tell you: this is very slippery ground, especially for such a low edit traffic article as this is. If you remove a certain product, the contributor can be very upset if you have not a clear concept what goes on the list and what doesn't. They will quickly create articles. I don't think this is very helpful. --Adrian Buehlmann 16:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The external links for blue linked software should go. At least some of the external links in the External links section should go. Notability should be dictated by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability_(software)</a>. This is one reason why I'm in favor of a cat, rather than a list: the notability of every tool (article) would be tested through an established procedure, rather than turning to a spam-filled list. If a tool doesn't warrant a stub article, it doesn't warrant inclusion in a list. Contributors should not be upset by any bold removal--they can create stubs or argue notability. Without this figure of merit, my vote will stay delete--the list would be uncomprehensive and unmaintainable. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 17:52, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The list is valuable. The cat doesn't really replace the list; even the redlinks (which wouldn't show up in the cat) have value, since they point out tools which don't (yet) have wikipedia articles.

<dd>I look a little time and started looking closer as some of the redlink entries. Take GNU Ferret, for example. Looking at the Ferret web site, there's really nothing that deserves an article of its own. It's a work in progress, and statistically, most projects at Ferret's level of development are doomed to wither and die. It certainly doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a>, for whatever that's worth. But, as one example in a list surveying the field, it certainly deserves a mention. I could write a GNU Ferret stub, which would certainly improve the blue/red ratio, but it would be making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/Wp%7Epoint.html" title="Wp:point">wp:point</a> for no good reason. As time goes on, some of the red links will turn blue, and new entries (of one color or another) will get added. I don't see anything bad about that -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 23:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
