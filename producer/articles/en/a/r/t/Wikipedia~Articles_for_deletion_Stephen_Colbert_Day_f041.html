<dd>I've cast my vote already but allow me to expand. If Colbert, tomorrow, in an act of pure comic genius, sticks his finger up his ass, I would not expect there to be an WP article on Steve Colbert's Ass. There should, however, be a mention of this meritorious incident in the Colbert article. That's what this "day" is. Citing article after article mentioning the "day" only proves that the show has promotional weight, it does nothing to establish true notability. It's a stunt, not a true civic holiday, so mention it in all its detail in the main Colbert show article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 01:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me compare this to another Colbert event that made the news this month: when Colbert and his victim of parody, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, [<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/09/tv.oreillyvscolbert.ap/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/09/tv.oreillyvscolbert.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">swapped guest appearances on each other's shows</a>. In that case, it received similar attention to Stephen Colbert Day (may I also suggest, in a side note, that non-Canadian editors may not grasp the relatively grander levels of attention this story is getting in this country, and Wikipedia is not just an American encyclopedia. Although as "Of Montreal" is indicative, this does not affect your view. This note is merely for others). However, where O'Reilly and Colbert's guest appearances were a similar promotional event, they did not affect the world in any way outside of their respective shows. As such, information on this still fairly notable event was relegated to their respective show's articles. In the case of Stephen Colbert Day, however, this stunt does have effect on the real world: Oshawa, Ontario is now made to celebrate Stephen Colbert Day every year as a result. Again, may I suggest that your extreme dislike for Colbert's shtick and the recent Colbert-inspired Wikipedia vandalism you aided in preventing (I saw your request to have Stephen Colbert Day locked from editing on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStephen_Colbert_6f25.html" title="Talk:Stephen Colbert">Talk:Stephen Colbert</a>) is such a strong bias it makes you ignore these notability factors and differences to some promotional stunts? -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 02:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, reverting vandalism is a... <i>bad thing</i>? As is asking for a block to stop further vandalism? Bizarre logic. What should I have done. Celebrated it?

<dl>
<dd>I'm saying your bitterness over the vandalism, and sarcasm here, isn't helping your case. As for am I a fan of the show? Yes. But it is not affecting my vote. Should another nomination for deletion of List of neologisms on The Colbert Report come up, for instance, I would vote for deletion, whatever that is worth. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 02:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And I probably would not vote for deletion of List of neologisms on The Colbert Report because in that instance, <i>the article is not claiming to be anything its not</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. What the hell is wrong with another definition? The site has a definition on "The Friend Zone", yet having an article on this is bad? It sounds to me like you're all just sore that, once again, he trashed the site on his show. Now, I'm not saying he should do that, I'm merely saying that your whining HERE is only serving to give him more material, which makes his "lame show" more popular, which means he'll just CONTINUE making wikipedia-based shows. I don't see how having this definition up in general serves any discredit to wikipedia, nor do I say how it could possibly be a bad thing - it's a "Day", it's not like it's saying "Stephen Colbert LOL!" made for every thing he said. I admit, he has a lot of stuff here, but that's like saying Martin Luther King (No, I'm not comparing Colbert to King, it's just an accurate analogy here) shouldn't have a definition for Martin Luther King Day but instead should just have it under a little heading in his full definition of him. Or, for a fairer comparison, that International Talk Like a Pirate Day and Day of the Ninja should not exist as articles, but should rather just both fall under Pirates vs Ninjas. Yet, of course, NONE of you complain about that - you only whine about this day because, boo hoo, Colbert insulted (in his SATIRICAL CHARACTER, might I remind you) your precious wikipedia. And remember - the definition for both DotN was up MONTHS (or at least weeks) before the actual day was first celebrated, so your argument of "it hasn't been scheduled yet, it's not a crystal ball omg!" doesn't work here.</li>

Second, comparing Martin Luther King Day to Steve Colbert "Day" is absurd, if not racist: Martin Luther Kind Day is a national holiday, full of historical social importance. You're making the same claim for Steve Colbert "Day"? Wow. Mind-boggling. I'm not familar with the last two days mentioned but I'd be happy to entertain a deletion vote on those two, sure. Lastly, there <i>are</i> a lot of people who <i>do</i> happen to care about "our precious Wikipedia" and don't enjoy seeing it hijacked for a silly promotional stunt. Sorry if you can't get that.

<dl>
<dd>Yep. For what it's worth, I reverted about 5 similar edits to other pages before searching "commodity" to see if there was any vandalism of obscure commodity-related pages, and I was curious as to how long it would take to see a revert on a fairly unedited page (the last few of only a handful edits were in December and November). It was low level vandalism that affected an obscure page as part of an experiment, and mentioning it here, I thought, would be blown out of proportion, though I'll thank Shawn in Montreal for not doing so. I was curious as to the result and decided it would harm no one, though it was wrong. If that rebukes all my valid arguments about the notability of Stephen Colbert Day, so be it.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. It's misleading to suggest that Colbert Day is a holiday observed in Oshawa, since at present the "holiday" really not <i>observed</i> by anyone. The mayor lost a bet, and now there's an obscure city holiday somewhere on the books -- that doesn't really make it much more than a legal technicality, and an amusing anecdote about Colbert, Gray, and the Generals. There's really not much to the story, and the relevant bits of it could very easilly be accomidated elsewhere. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ironically, this article makes no mention that the challege by Mayor Gray was a publicity stunt initiated by <a href="../../../c/j/k/CJKX-FM_589d.html" title="CJKX-FM">KX96</a>, and disc jockey Terry Archer. The challenge was broadcast live during a morning show on the radio staion.

It's an amusing anecdote which has recieved some national attention in Canada.

<li><a href="../../../i/n/n/INN_fa03.html" title="INN">Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>. We're still talking about a single-city "holiday" with zero history of observance. A more accurate comparison might be to Miami's "Nintendo Fun Day", which was made a legal holiday in 1991, yet does not have or need an article of its own. Like Nintendo Fun Day, Stephen Colbert Day has no real impact: No one celebrates Stephen Colbert Day. No one gets off work on Stephen Colbert Day. There are no traditions attached to it, and even in Oshawa, it's fair to assume most people haven't heard of it. A holiday that exists only on paper is not a holiday at all. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>A Google search reveals that International Waffle Day, silly as it might sound, might actually be recognized by UNESCO as a national holiday (this comes from a blog, however, so its not worth citing). Citing other "odd" or trivial-sounding days in defense of "Steve Colbert Day" does not establish notability for the article being voted on here. If Waffle Day is a true Swedish national day, then of course it deserves to stay. If it's a bit of nonsense, then in time it will be voted on, too. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 15:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and merge unless adequate references provided for verification</b> My only problem with this article is that the references are entirely inadequate. The only acceptable source provided is the MSNBC article, which only covers the very bare bones details. The great bulk of the article is currently entirely unreferenced and unsourced. Delete and merge the basic facts into Colbert's main article unless the references receive a major cleanup. Note that I do not have a problem with "potential notability" or "fancruft", so if the reference issue is corrected then I will probably change my recommendation to keep. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Crystal-ballism. Hasn't happened yet, no indication it will be noteworthy when it does, definitely no indication anyone will remember it in five years, let alone 100.

<dl>
<dd>FYI, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a> only comes into play for future events that aren't verified by published sources. You can, for example, write articles about future planned events, albums, films, and so on provided that there are good, verifiable references to show the information in the article is accurate and not simply editorial speculation. Also, note that notability doesn't "expire". So if an event is notable enough for inclusion now and provides sufficient references for verification, it can be kept for historical purposes on Wikipedia even the public loses interest in the even at a later date. (Otherwise what would be the point of writing historical articles about subjects the general populace doesn't know about?) <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, I'll reiterate that I think this article as it currently stands doesn't have adequate references. So on <i>those</i> grounds, I still support deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know, but I don't feel this has been verified by published sources. The hundred-year metric is shorthand for considering notability of current pop-culture events: Will anyone remember them in a hundred years? It does have its flaws, of course, but I find it useful to keep in mind when considering this sort of thing. Could've sworn it used to be mentioned at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, but if so, it seems that's gone away some time in the last few months. Anyway, its main thrust is that a current event that gets some media play is not necessarily notable in the long term. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Notability doesn't expire with time, and far as I know there isn't a "hundred year metric" in policy. Rather, it follows as a means of showing that there is a suitable level of verifiable information and interest at the time the article was written. If Wiki was only intended for articles that people remember after a hundred years, there would be little point in writing historical articles about esoteric subjects that aren't currently widely discussed but that still offer interesting or possibly useful information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course there isn't. There isn't a notability metric in policy; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is a guideline. It is, however, true that there is consensus that passing media notice does not equate to notability. That's part of the reason Wikinews is separate from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm afraid the burden of proof of the statement that there is consensus regarding handling media notice for notability purposes is on you. Far as I know no such consensus exists or is discussed in any existing guidelines or policies. But I'm certainly not perfect, so if I missed such a consensus discussion or guideline, feel fere to post a link. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As the main original author, and a resident of Oshawa, I request that this be kept. It gives more detail as to how Stephen Colbert Day came to be. I took the picture of the newpaper to show how important it is for the city of Oshawa. The day will be celebrated annually, therefore, detailed information, specifically a separate article, is desirealbe.</li>

<dd>Actually, there's no evidence that the day will be <i>celebrated</i> at all, let alone annually.

<dd>Actually, the reference I recently added included a quote from the mayor of Oshawa inviting Colbert to visit them for the holiday, and offering to do several things to accomodate him (including declaring a "bear-free" day and other things in line with the humour of the event) --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 23:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course the mayor issued an official invitation, and I'm sure some members of the community will turn up at whatever event they have and get videotaped for that night's Colbert Report. That doesn't mean that anyone is going to care even a year from now. It's a publicity stunt, not a holiday, and certainly not an even remotely important one. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Just because a few people really, really care does not make the topic encyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 00:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I say, forget the metric system. As I stated above, perhaps too colourfully for my good, I don't even agree that the number of media hits or geographical spread of coverage even <i>matters</i>. Certainly it's proof of the popularity of the show. But I don't believe it does anything to establish the reality of this "Day" independent of the show and its hype, hence my vote to include the Day in the main show article.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 21:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think something that is being missed here is that it isn't important whether or not the actual holiday is "celebrated", or even officially recognized. The question is whether the <i>news story behind</i> the holiday is notably verified. Even if the mayor in the story welches, the article only has to show that the news story about the bet behind the holiday meets notability guidelines. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
