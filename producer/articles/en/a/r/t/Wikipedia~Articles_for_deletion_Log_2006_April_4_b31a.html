<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to me the fact they were supposed to have a team and it collapsed is still somewhat notable.

<p>I have decided to renominate this to generate a clearer community consensus for lists of this type; A <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_NFL_Draft_Steals_8c5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of NFL Draft Steals">previous AfD</a> failed on what perhaps could be considered a technicality. It seems to me that the term "steal" is much too subjective still, although the list has improved since it was nominated all the way back in October. If this AfD succeeds, we should take a look at similar sports lists, such as List of NFL Draft busts, List of NHL Draft steals, etc., so don't use the existence of those lists as a reason to keep this one. <b>No vote</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 00:35, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not a sports fan, but it seems to me that there is an article here, just as it is a surprise when a low-seeded player wins Wimbledon. The NFL draft is a sort of ranking of players, and occasionally someone way down at the bottom will prove to be a star; this would be a noteworthy detail about such a player, but also about the draft process itself. Surely it would be possible to present this information in an NPOV fashion, even if the article, as it presently stands, misses the point (it also fails to explain to the lay reader what it is about). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 12:43, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Winning Wimbledon is an objective standard pretty much agreed upon by everyone as an "upset" in that event. Whata is the comparable objective standard for "career success" on this list? I suppose we could restrict it to Hall of Famers who were drafted on the second day or something like that... (<a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a>)<sup>(<a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a>)</sup> 14:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. If nothing else, this article suggests there might be merit in something along these lines, if you can come up with an objective standard. I defer to those of you who actually know something about football, though, and you might also reasonably conclude it can't be done. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 18:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there are no objective criteria to define a "steal" (e.g., a second round QB with a season rating of 80 or higher? Why not 70? Or 90?). Even media sports analysts can hardly be considered objective references, since <i>they</i> would disagree with one another. Any attempts to maintain a list like this are POV disasters waiting to happen. In that regard, I would say delete the other sports' lists mentioned above as well. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 00:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant delete.</b> Most people who follow the sport would have a consensus definition of "steal" rather like Potter Stewart's "I know it when I see it" definition of obscenity.

<dd>Well, your attitude is disapointing. There's nothing 'random' about it. It's a public monument. I don't see why you get to choose what people can read about, and I don't see anything about 'notability' in the deletion policy. Sure its an encyclopedia, and anything that is verifiable and real should go into it. Not just what you feel is important. Your approach leads to huge disputes over what is or isn't important to different people. To someone living in the area the monument is probably more notable than something like Slashdot. To someone who browses slashdot, that is more notable. Both are verifiable, so let them stay. For great justice. 23:43, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. My attitude is irrelevant. Wikipedia is about a consensus. You seem to think your opinion alone should take precedence. Wikipedia was designed not to be a giant repository of every known fact in the universe -- and to achieve that, information would necessarily be random -- but like any encyclopedia it was designed to encapsulate more notable information. You say, <i>Sure its [sic] an encyclopedia, and anything that is verifiable and real should go into it.</i> I'm sorry, that's <i>not</i> what Wikipedia is. That approach is in direct contradiction to Wiki's stated purposes. Have you read <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a>? Your arguments strongly suggest you have not. I live in metro LA; I've never met anyone who said the Hollywood cross was a notable monument. No one seems to have linked anything here which verifies that it is, in fact, a notable monument. It is your <i>opinion</i> it is a notable monument, but opinions are not fact, and your opinion carries no more weight than anyone else's. If you think this is a notable monument, where is the proof that it is notable? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 02:48, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The definition of notable is subjective. I can't 'proove' it's notable any more than I can proove that I want to keep it. That's the problem with your attitude. You don't like it, so you think no one else should have access to that information. That's wrong. For great justice. 05:15, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Of course notability can be proven or disproven. Others have already done so in this very discussion. That's what the whole AfD process is about, to review collectively the notability of flagged entries. And nowhere did I say "I didn't like it" so please don't put words in my mouth. You're making value judgments about me out of thin air. And it's not about restricting access. You're free to start your own free webpage on Geocities and talk about this particular cross, where you can provide all the information and photographs you want, which will be found via search engines. The entry simply is not encyclopedic nor is the subject notable at this time, as the consensus here seems to be showing. That's not to say it might not be notable in the future, although I do find that hard to believe, considering how small this particular cross is and how difficult it is to see. So please stop trying to make this into some martyr issue or some free speech issue, when it is neither. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 05:52, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The issue is that 'notability' is a concept that does not appear in the deletion guidelines. It means nothing more than 'things I don't like or don't approve of', and, if a majority of people who post on AFD are also not interested, then no one can look it up here. That's a terrible editorial policy. In fact, if you read the deletion guidelines, it ISN'T Wikipedia's policy. For good reason. For great justice. 06:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing special about it. It barely has anything about it on google. It's only claim to prominence is that the cross originally on the LA seal was actually a picture of it. The problem is that all the sources I have seen which claim the cross was included on the seal to represent the "Holywood cross" seem like they'd do anything to strongly push forward a certain point of view( namely that evil atheists are trying to take over the country). What seems a better source, <a href="http://lacounty.info/old%20seal.htm" class="external text" title="http://lacounty.info/old%20seal.htm" rel="nofollow">the LA website's page for the old seal</a> claims that the cross on the seal represents, "the influence of the church and the missions of California." This would seem to mean the seal of LA has nothing to do with the holywood cross, thus destroying it's one claim to notability. If anybody can show otherwise (through a reliable source), I'd be willing to change my vote. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> why is this different than Digital Spy? It's basically a large forum with a news output attached to the front page <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.178.213.35 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.178.213.35_1cda.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.178.213.35">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>(Reply to above) Firstly digital spy contains more than one forum. Secondly a huge difference in stats; Digital Spy: "Threads: 354,413, Posts: 7,795,690, Members: 143,546"; Metropol: "Threads: 1,800 appox, Members: 835". Thirdly it is not nearly as widely known, Digital Spy for instance is often used as an external link on BBC.co.uk. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrollachan_c970.html" title="User:Brollachan">Brollachan</a> 18:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. I'm going to ignore the vanity allegations for a moment because while it is bad form I'm not of the opinion that vanity is always a deletable offense. Besides in a way it is its own punishment; look at it this way: someone had to create an article about themselves or their work because nobody cared enough about them or their work enough to create a wikipedia article; while there are people out there that care enough about a topic to create <a href="../../../b/o/t/BotCon_1902.html" title="BotCon">BotCon</a>. That has to sting a little... but back to <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Searching Google I find quite a few references to <i>Nature: An Environmental Cosmology</i> (1997) by Joseph Grange, a book about the environment. In fact most of the returned results are for that book. The term is also used in relation to cosmology and inflationary theory <a href="http://www.ishipress.com/cosmos.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ishipress.com/cosmos.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The usage of the term in reference to the book and theories by Mr. McRitchie are from his own website, and the book listing on Amazon. I can't find any information that the term "Environmental cosmology" has been used to refer to McRitchie's theories by any reputable 3rd party source. If not deleted outright, this should disambiguate to an article on the book at Environmental Cosmology (book) (and other uses of the term) and just have a write up of the book rather than a full explanation of the theory... at least until it can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> proved that these pseudo-scientific theories gain wider acceptance.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Do not Delete</b></s> per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Although Joseph Grange has authored a book with Environmental Cosmology as the subtitle, I don't think his subtitle does very much to explain his philosophy, or even that it is some sort of philosophy, which is along the lines of Whitehead. You would have a difficult time determining that this book is about the environment or cosmology from reading it, so there is a certain ambiguity in the title that Grange has chosen. "Cosmology," as used in this Wikipedia article under discussion refers to the structure and space-time relationships of the universe, just as you would find in a dictionary definition. That the universe is an environment should be self-evident. There is nothing new here. The subtitle of the book Environmental Cosmology indicates that this is an examination of astrology using the approach of how astrology structures the space-time environment. I don't believe this is ambiguous or making up new words. After all, these are fairly ordinary ideas that have wide and enduring acceptance. The Wikipedia article is far from a full explanation of the complete theory, but just a summary of some of the more salient features, just as you'd find in many other Wikipedia articles on any subject. Astrology has often been described as pseudo-science, but that does not eliminate astrology from Wikipedia or from being accepted, so there is nothing special along that line that needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> verified. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_McRitchie_4244.html" title="User:Ken McRitchie">Ken McRitchie</a> 15:28, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Second vote removed... please only vote once. Can you produce any evidence that the term "Environmental cosmology" is widely used for the theories expounded in your book by anyone other than yourself, or in reviews of the book, etc. If not then it is a neologism. Also, I'm not saying that pseudoscience is not appropriate for Wikipedia - there are tons of pseudoscience articles here - what I'm saying is that for this to be in any way notable as a theory it needs to be proven that this theory has gained wide exceptance... and the fact that it has gained wide acceptance needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:13, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term and the concept of environmental cosmology are gaining a wider acceptance as more people read the book and reviews are written in publications. The term is not as new as it was two years ago, when it was first published. I suppose that being deleted from Wikipedia would bring some added notoriety if that happens, although I hope the article can stay. The article refers to numerous works and authors that have very wide acceptance. These works are incorporated into the ideas discussed in the book and the article. The only thing that is new is that these ideas are brought together, compared with each other, and compared with astrology, which itself is nothing new. The article and the book are basically a comparison of a simplified form of basic astrology (which is where the term "environmental cosmology" comes from), which has wide acceptance, with similar ideas in the social science, which also has wide acceptance. Critics of astrology are continually asking for theory and comparison with the social sciences. It would be a mistake to remove an article for which there is a demonstrable need and which is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> well-referenced with widely accepted and verifiable sources. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_McRitchie_4244.html" title="User:Ken McRitchie">Ken McRitchie</a> 16:53, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A great way to support retention of the article in something close to its current form would be to reference a discussion of "environmental cosmology" from somewhere outside of your book. If not, references to a professional review of the book would at least merit the article's retention (as Isotope23 notes) at Environmental Cosmology (book) and a disambiguation page Environmental cosmology (disambiguation) could link to it. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodasmith_9e4e.html" title="User talk:Rodasmith">☎ Smith</a>)</small> 20:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the article you will see criticism of both the astrologers' and the critics' cherished beliefs. Obviously this does not allow me to speak for all astrologers or all critics, so I cannot call it "Defense of Astrology" or "The Delusions of Astrology." "The Common Ground between Astrology and the Social Sciences" does not identify anything in particular, even though this is my aim, so I've tried to identify that common ground based on its structure. The fact that other recent thinkers have alluded to the term environmental cosmology suggests that there is some currency to this term and it is not entirely new. In the article you will also see acknowledgement of the limitations of this common ground theory. I am aware of its problems. I did not come up with the idea for writing a theory of astrology myself, but it was suggested to me by a skeptical professor who saw a need for it. I understood that need and tried to fill it as best I know how. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_McRitchie_4244.html" title="User:Ken McRitchie">Ken McRitchie</a> 03:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a notable phrase. Vary: The first nom was mistaken in thinking that it was only an edit war, but it's really an edit war over whether it should be deleted (and redirected), which would make AfD the place where we should have gone instead of the edit war. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 18:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Additionally, TYM doesn't transcend the original game outside of two references - one in a sequel to the game, and another in an MMORPG. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's quite a few more references than that - just google "Thank you * but our * is in another *" and you'll come up with tons of stuff. Most of it's just on webcomics and ytmnd stuff and whatever, but if that stuff is noteworthy enough to merit an article on AYB then it's (arguably) noteworthy enough to merit an article on TYM.</dd>
<dd>That said, I wouldn't object to this being merged into a new "List of memes originating from Mario series" article, because I'm sure there's plenty of other ones that haven't been noted on Wikipedia yet. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassandraleo_bb7c.html" title="User:Cassandraleo">Cassandra Leo</a> 21:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a non-notable in-house TV show shown during homeroom in one public high school. Someone added a speedy delete tag; that was deleted. I did a merge into <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Stream_South_High_School_f5f0.html" title="Valley Stream South High School">Valley Stream South High School</a>, and put in a "mergeto" tag, but the original poster deleted the tag without explaination. Tried a "mergeto" tag again. Also deleted. It fits well as part of the high school's main entry, and in fact, it's in there now.

<p>As far as original research goes I have a list of little known nature trails within fifty miles of my home. It took me most of last summer to find them and they are not all listed in one book or pamphlet anywhere. I have only listed two of these places so far. It was never my intention to list every dinky nature trail in the world by myself. I was hoping other people would join in and supply their favorite spots. That's why I linked to various cities and states and articles about hiking. Some of those articles have lists of long trails. I'm interested in shorter trails some of which have no name. My "research" is... well, it's not a theory. These places exist. It's just a listing with directions on how to get there. Not much controversy in that. The trails are too short for an article called "long distance trails". - Socially Isolated Hamster</p>

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b>. Encouraging people to compile lists of favorite short trails? There has to be any number of bulletin boards and forums out there devoted to hiking for which this would be terribly useful and appropriate.

</ul>
<p>Seems to me the real issue is that in my efforts to get people to contribute their trails I put links in other articles connecting to "Walking Trails". This then ticked someone off who removed every one of my links in about twenty articles and submitted "Walking Trails" for deletion without saying a word to me. Except for the links and the shorter length of the trails my article is no different from "Long Distance Walking Trails".</p>
<p>Is there some reason why there shouldn't be a link to a list of walking trails in each of the cities and states I had linked to? Is there some reason why Wikipedia should have a list of longer trails but not shorter trails?</p>
<p>Given a chance I think the article is valid. Without the links there is much less chance that people will drop in to submit their trails which is what would have made the article more "encyclopedic". - Socially Isolated Hamster</p>

Now, about the notability: they seem have just enough notability to be on Wikipedia; e.g. their Heraldic section seems to be semi-officially in charge for designing &amp; approving coats of arms of Serbian municipalities. However, I'd prefer it to be deleted and recreated with decent context (with creator spanked) than to be improved (well, maybe I'm biased but I'd like some kind of revenge for my wasted time&#160;:-) ).

<li>We would then have to do that with <i>every mod</i> for this game. There's already 30-odd mods with their name and website link in the article (of which this is one), which sets a dangerous precedent.

<li><b>Keep</b>.I swear, id love to know why so many people care that we use those 2kb of the Wikipedia space. And saying that US Intervention is non-notable is just plain incorrect, we're one of the most popular Battlefield 2 mods there is. -David2999 17:07, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Upon what do you base claims of popularity, when your mod hasn't even been released yet? Do you have any links to critical reviews we might see? Download lists? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This mod hasn't even been released yet and I've heard absolutley zero buzz about it on numerous battlefield 2 forums. If it becomes popular when it is released.

<p>Long story short, when going back to his Katrina-wrecked neighbourhood, the road to his home got blocked by Cheney's security personnel for the convenience and security of Vice President Cheney's vehicle. As a result, Mr. Marble had to take a longer route back home. To protest for having his road blocked, he says "Go fuck yourself Mister Cheney!" However, as far as issues go, a road being blocked by security seems to be a rather insignificant issue to be protesting about.

<p>Well I have stated in numerous interviews that was only one minor part of the reason I said what I did. After seeing the lame response of the govt. to the disaster I know I was speaking for a hell of a lot of people. If my '15 minutes' have already expired why is it that I just finished shooting 3 days worth of footage in New Orleans on the set of the upcoming Denzel Washington/Val Kilmer movie "Deja Vu" and will be filming an interview in the upcoming Spike Lee movie "When the levees broke" in a week or so? Try doing a Google search for 'Ben Marble' and see exactly how many results you get. Last time I checked it was over 4 MILLION! Besides you all have admitted that I did in fact have '15 minutes' i.e. you are admitting the fact that I AM FAMOUS! So basically for whatever reason you don't like HOW I became famous. Seems to me that the motive for deletion is primarily fueled by the BUSHEEP and/or jealousy so to all of you who say to delete me I say...GO F*** YOURSELF!

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Dr. Marble i.e. it is obvious all the people who have responded so far have admitted he is famous they just don't like how that occurred. So there motives would certainly seem to be political in nature. As for this comment: "zero Google hits on CNN, BBC News, and Google News. Also, judging from the video that he filmed, all the reporters ignored him" I don't what kind of crack that person was smoking but I just googled the name 'Ben Marble' as Dr. Marble suggested and there were over 3 million results. And those reporters should all be fired for not following up on Dick Cheney's comment that it was the 'first time I've heard it' because everyone knows those were Dick's own words. --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.129.88.30 (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.129.88.30.html" title="User talk:12.129.88.30">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.129.88.30_bfda.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.129.88.30">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Borderline case, but on the right side IMO. Is reasonably known in the internet because he was an editor in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricinfo.html" title="Cricinfo">Cricinfo</a> for six years and ran the daily <i>Cricinfo 365</i> which was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s (discontinued when the internet boom got over and cricinfo cut costs).

<li>Perhaps so, but this still looks like a NN blogger to me.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Since the main notability claim here is based on his pact activities, the argument that his current blogging isn't notable is something of a red herring; even if correct, it's irrelevant. The fact that author X's last six books have come from vanity presses is similarly irrelevant if his first six came from legit publishers and met audience requirements. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:59, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Rick Eyre is a buddy of TinTin, who seems hell-bent on retaining his entry, despite the fact that Rick Eyre was fired from Cricinfo and hasn't worked on that site for years, he now does nothing other than maintain a couple of niche blogs.

<p>As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28academics%29_e884.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (academics)</a>. Seems to be a vanity page created by the subject, as the only 'real' information is a link to his website. No real information about his work in mathematics is given, and the fact that he's a prize winner is already referenced on the prize page. That's the only real content. I suggest simply deleting this and referencing the field for which he got the prize on the prize page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Drnj85 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Drnj85_59ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Drnj85">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Maybe not, but do you make the same statement every time a new user with no edits who participates in AfD is essentially branded a sock puppet? Where is the AGF in that?

<p>This appears to be one of a series of POV forks on Biblical or Christian topics created by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlubberbrein2_ce30.html" title="User:Blubberbrein2">User:Blubberbrein2</a>. The first sentence, betraying the bias of the author, originally was:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The time of the Messiah's appearance to the world, as predicted in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testamant) is defined by a number of concurring circumstances, that fix it to the very date of the advent of Christ."</dd>

<p>This was later changed (by the same user) to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The time of the Messiah's appearance to the world, as predicted in the Tanakh is defined by a number of concurring circumstances, that fix it to the very date of the advent of the Messiah."</dd>
</dl>
<p>That change made the lead pseudo-NPOV and tautological ("the Messiah will arrive at the time of the arrival of the Messiah" - uh?).

<p>The first version was deleted as a copyright violation. The author reposted the material, leaving a note on the talk page. I don't know if this is sufficient proof of ownership, though. Also, the article is partially how-to and while it provides some information about property records, it is more practical information than encyclopedic. Also, the information only applies to the United States. I brought it to AfD to decide its fate: report it as copyright violation, delete or keep/cleanup. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:05, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article seems to be about me, and, although it is accurate, I'd rather not have an article entry on Wikipedia, so I have asked for it to be deleted. Thank you. Rfmcghee 11:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not a lot there, and you might just as well throw Beyond the Mist onto the fire, as it's the vanity-press-published novel by the subject. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 12:11, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You'll need to provide some verification of that claim of professional publication. Besides, novels aren't more famous than their authors: if your biographical article goes, then the book article goes, too. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:48, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect</b> to Beyond the Mist. People don't necessarily have a choice about whether they are listed on wikipedia or not. However, it'll help both articles here if they are merged into one article focusing on the book, and mentioning Mr. McGhee's lineage only as a footnote. It'd also be best to preserve the article history in the redirect, as who ever goes around creating these articles about British nobels might care about the article history for some reason. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 17:03, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would be a backward merge: novels aren't more famous than their authors, so any possible merge would be in the other direction. But given it's a vanity-press book, how to merge is moot: both should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:48, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect</b> to Beyond the Mist. Jeff Burdges' solution seems best. I was not aware that I had to provide PROOF of professional publication! After all, I didn't even make either of the articles! But I can assure you that a deal has been secured with a professional publishing house: perhaps its page could be updated to show the history of the book and its publication. I do not wish this to descend into any sort of arguing, because I refuse to take part in any arguments. I simply requested for my biographical page to be deleted, and this is my last word on the matter. Whatever happens, I'd just prefer if the biographical article were deleted.

<p>First let me say that I'm not trying to criticize earlier editors of this page; trying to make an acceptable Wikipedia article out of such an ill-defined topic is difficult by the very nature of the subject. Of course, this is exactly why I am putting this article AfD. The history of the road to AfD of this article is: I prodded it about a week ago, Monicasdude unprodded it, in the meantime Crawford went half-way towards putting it up AfD, so now I'm going "whole hog".</p>
<p>All in all, I would say that if I were going to write a parody of an article which egregiously violated <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>, I don't know if I could do better than this. Nowhere does this article even make an <i>assertion</i>. Consider, e.g. "it is supposed", "the notion ... is undocumented", etc. What is this article saying, really? Some people [we don't know who or how many] have a belief in a conspiracy theory [which we've sort of vaguely defined], presumably enough people believe this to make it notable [we guess], and finally this is not surprising [since we all know people think this way]. And if you don't believe us, here's an article from The Onion. C'mon. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 14:12, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nobody seriously argues that the subject isn't a commonly enough held belief, that it's not a staple among right-wing chatterati, or that it's undocumented. This is a bad article, so fix it. Wikipedia is not censored on behalf of politically correct sensibilities, and notable right-wing crackpot theories should be given the same coverage that notable (often marginally notable) left-wing crackpot theories get. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:33, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are significant google hits for this concept from the religious right such as <a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/231041.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://atheism.about.com/b/a/231041.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Homosexual+recruitment%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Homosexual+recruitment%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. This was the thinking behind controversies back in the 70s involving gay teachers in the public schools. Instead of denying that this was a controversial political issue, which I think cost people their jobs, the article should be expanded and improved. I also wonder why this nom, who seems to raise a number of editing related questions, did not start on the article talk page?-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:32, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Conditional Delete</b></s> per lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sourcing. This is another case of "yeah I know this exists", but where is the sourcing in the article? I actually have a strong desire to keep this article on the basis of the subject, and I'm 100% willing to change to keep if someone takes the time to actually source this better. The AIM source is fine... but credibility is hurt by The Onion reference (though I love The Onion). Post at least one more reputable source.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I did want to put this up for deletion, but I decided I needed some more time to think up exactly what's wrong with this article. The main problem with it is original research. There's no evidence to support the idea that "Homosexual recruitment" is the term actually in use by the vast, right-wing conspiracy. I'm a real stickler for correct terminology, and the fact that the term "Homosexual recruitment" isn't demonstrated to be in use by those that are supposed to engage in this activity makes me think this article ought to be deleted. Also, I'm aware of parents who are afraid of their children being around gay authority figures, not because they think the children will be turned gay, so to speak, but because they are afraid the children will be sexually assaulted or abused. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Delete</b> I am with Brian on this one, but even more so. First, I have never heard this term. Second, with Onion, Christian and Schools removed from a google search on the term<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Homosexual+recruitment%22+-onion+-christian+-wikipedia+-schools&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Homosexual+recruitment%22+-onion+-christian+-wikipedia+-schools&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, the results fall to about 300. More notedly, just removing Onion pares away about 90% of the hits, which means this is basically an article about an Onion headline. I also love the Onion, (God Answers Boys Prayers: Says No), but this is not the place to substantiate Onion humour. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 16:53, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With all due respect, there is nothing humorous about this. Homosexual recruitment has been used as a catchphrase by the religious right to attack homosexual teachers since the 1970s. This has been reported by nearly every major newspaper in the United States. Furthermore, your google results are completely distorted by the removal of schools and Christian from the search. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not sure what you mean or how I have misinterpreted you. You said: "<i>this is basically an article about an Onion headline</i>". I've tried to show that this has nothing to do with onion or any other humour magazine or comic book. I really don't think the religious right, or some of the other groups or politicians I've cited below, get their marching orders from Onion or Mad magazine. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:22, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. A search for the term "homosexual recruitment" in Factiva over the last decade throws up ten articles. One of them is about the Onion story and reactions to it. Most of these are a group of stories from Viriginia in 1998 when the Christian Coalition launched ads that concern "homosexual recruitment in public schools" (the quotes are in the article, meaning that they are part of the CC's campaign). That seems to me to suggest that this particular rubric is not particularly widespread. It also seems to me that the term "homosexual <i>recruitment</i>" is irredeemably POV. With JeffBurdges, I think that a redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choice_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Choice and sexual orientation">Choice and sexual orientation</a> is best. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 18:09, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No one denies that this is a POV concept, not unlike the many articles that can be found in Category:Pejorative political terms. However, it is far more widespread than you, or others are trying to claim. I get far more than 10 article hits. Here are 10 excerpts over a 20 year span:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>...Senate debates surrounding the bill, and a House committee deliberation of the similar HB393, sponsored by Rep. Aaron Tilton, R-Springville, focused on the merits of gay-straight alliances. Some called the alliances a safe place for homosexual students that foster tolerance in schools. Bill supporters called them <b>homosexual recruitment</b> tools inappropriate for public schools...<b>Deseret News</b> (Salt Lake City), 2006</li>
<li>...Queer Action Network spokeswoman Lauren Mellor, an organiser of the rally, accused Mr Caltabiano of opposing funding to the gay youth service Open Doors last year while he was a Brisbane City councillor. He had said the Fortitude Valley organisation acted as a "<b>homosexual recruitment cult</b>" when he was allocating grants to youth services, Ms Mellor said. "We are opposed to Mr Caltabiano due to his record of homophobic remarks - it is well known he is outwardly homophobic... <b>AAP News (Australia)</b>, 2005</li>
<li>...But late last year public meetings with administrators exploded with complaints about the decals from small groups of parents. Biblical injunctions against homosexuality were cited, along with fears of <b>homosexual recruitment of children.</b> As the debate roared on, some parents related fears about a connection between gays and bestiality, or blamed the brouhaha on Internet pornography. A young woman who rose in defense of the decals was questioned by angry parents about her own sexuality.... <b>Chicago Tribune</b>, 2003</li>
<li>«&#160;Press ignoring real problem in church: <b>homosexual recruitment</b>&#160;», <b>New Hampshire Union Leader</b> (Manchester, NH), 2002</li>
<li>"It is my hope and insistence that the Senate heed the plea of Massachusetts families and families across America," Keyes said in a written statement. The failed presidential candidate also blasted Cellucci for "his promotion of the <b>radical homosexual recruitment</b> of our youth." <b>Boston Herald</b>, 2001</li>
<li>Another ad, published yesterday in USA Today, talks about ``the truth about the nongenetic roots of homosexuality <i>and ``the truth about <b>homosexual recruitment</b> in public schools.</i> If the ads succeed in stimulating open discussions about homosexuality, they can be applauded. But that is improbable. <b>Miami Herald</b>, 1998</li>
<li>Then she was disturbed to hear that he promised to hold hearings on <b>alleged homosexual "recruitment" in public schools</b>. If school districts are penalized for encouraging acceptance of homosexuality, she fears, young people who are coming to terms with their sexual orientation might be driven toward suicide. <b>Washington Post</b>, 1995</li>
<li>Porter, whose North Shore district has one of the nation's highest concentrations of public television viewers, wanted to open the hearings to all comers. He was rewarded with a daylong parade of witnesses whose complaints ranged from charges that taxpayers' money was funding <b>homosexual recruitment</b> programs in Akron to warnings that the popular "Masterpiece Theatre" could be dropped by many public television stations. <b>Chicago Tribune,</b> 1995</li>
<li>This argument is being advanced by such groups as the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition (TVC). According to these groups, the numerous non-gay educators, health professionals and religious leaders who favor such a program must be either <b>advocates for homosexual recruitment</b> or else dupes of the gay and lesbian community. <b>Press-Telegram (Long Beach, CA)</b>, 1991.</li>
<li>RealWomen distributed a pamphlet on "sexual orientation legislation" which says, falsely, that many people would be hurt - athletic associations, schools, daycare centres, boy clubs, parents of school-age children. The pamplet rouses fears by warning that because of AIDS, homosexuals have become a medical threat to the population at large; that homosexuality involves sadomasochism, bestiality "and other perversions"; and that the new legislation would make <b>homosexual recruitment of the young</b> permissable and acceptable. <b>Toronto Star,</b> 1986</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. JJay's examples demonstrate that the phrase "homosexual recruitment" is used, but the fact that the words are used together doesn't mean there is anything more to say about them than about any other <i>adj. - noun</i> comination. The article is dramatically POV, and the non-POV parts of it have nothing more to say than we learn from the words "homosexual recruitment" themselves. This is not a movement, or an organization, or a unified concept; it is a dicdef. I don't think there's anything that needs to be said about this. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 19:09, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Concerns about sources don't make a case for deletion, nor do concerns about wording: what fixes that is <i>editing</i>. A decent article could be written about this; in fact, JJay's material is a start. This stub is not completely unhelpful. Besides, everybody knows it's the food. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong (but conditional) keep</b>. Its a hard call. There is little material in the stub at present, but it is a term that's known, a concept that's probably encyclopedic in the end, and an assertation that it isn't just some authors invention is certainly capable of <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a>. It's also for me, more to the point, a notable subject (no matter if minor), might potentially be of broad interest, and "just generally worth a place". I'm not involved in that issue, yet it's a term I have heard in use. My concerns are mostly that as others have said, it's at present poorly documented and completely unsourced. But many articles start off that way. Conditional keep... let's keep it and see if it can be improved to standard before anything else, as it does have good potential to meet Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> (<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a>) 21:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this article can very easily be improved.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is about a claim or argument, not a term. I have heard this argument many times. It was the main argument used in the late 70's, at the beginning of the anti-gay backlash, by Anyta Bryant in Florida, and it is till widely used by the Traditional Values Coalition. You can't judge notability of a topic or concept just by searching the two words of a phrase exactly. For example, Google gets 109,00 hits for "homosexuals recruit" excluding onion and wiki. "Gays recruit" gets 341,000 hits when onion and wiki are excluded. Excluding Christian and schools skews the results since the argument is usually made by Christians who say that homosexuals recuit in schools. <a href="../../../w/u/z/User%7EWuzzy_9768.html" title="User:Wuzzy">Wuzzy</a> 23:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>The Manifesto of Mortarism/Maisonneuve/Marc di Saverio Please see MARC DI SAVERIO, and perhaps you may like to to write an article based on the stuff left on discussion board. Just a thought. Take care.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>this is Marc di Saverio. I can't see why I don't deserve a stub article. This is not SOAPBOXERY, as YOU understand it. After you have read the manifesto, you will understand that self-righteousness and literally going into the streets and standing on platforms is a part of changing the world. Soapboxery, eh!? That is a funny one. You have SO many other articles on wik you could be picking on; why mine? There are several articles that should be erased because they are inconsequential and many written of people who will never even come close to being immortals, or even surviving 20 years as important or substantial figures of time. The Manifesto of Mortarism/Marc di Saverio is history. I am manic, but I am not psychotic, and I am speaking absolutely honestly and with righteousness. WIK policy that I read said something along the lines of if an article stub SEEMS it COULD be POTENTIALLY important, "EXPAND!", or at least leave the article, or even shorten it; but DELETE!? That is simply the jealous spirit of wik writers who can't stand a man who will likley be important, and is not afraid to believe that, and is not afraid to go into the streets of Hamilton and stand on platforms to read his manifesto -- being a championed English undergrad -- or at McMaster, or wherever. MORTARISM will be one of those immortal philosophies. THE article OBVIOUSLY shows the subject is quite LIKELY going to be important, esp if you read the talk page -- and considering I am still a student for Chrissake. DELETION?! Pure Wikwriter jealousy? It's uncalled for to delete that page, and you all know it. You are acting</b></li>
</ul>
<p>unprofessionally by putting your inferiority-complexes, Artist-envy, Genie-envy, before WIKIPEDIA, and PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>tell me freply, what is the "outside world". What the hell does that mean? Are you telling me a lot of those articles on wik describe people IMPACTING OUTSIDE WORLD. SURRRRRRE! Ok! Whatevah. Go bother with deleting someone who SHOULD be deleted. I impact the outside world every day on the streets, and I have ALSO DONE SO WITH PUBLICATIONS, and will with MAJOR FORTHCOMING PUBLICATIONS. A total deletion of my article would be extreme, uninspired, and ridiculously 21st century. O you Ice Agers! O the Age of Ice. O the Age of Passionlessness being fashionable. O the power of propaganda and media. We are living in the Age of Cutesypoo, the Age of Verveless and fashionable distance. Whatevah.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You know, a bette<b>r tactic would be to read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, particularly the crystal ball clause, and provide evidence why these articles meet those criteria. Diatribes attacking those who have rendered opinions here is likely to fall on deaf ears. Expansion is only called for when an article could be potentially important based on existing information. Your statement that <i>THE article OBVIOUSLY shows the subject is quite LIKELY going to be important</i> shows that the Mortarism a</b>nd The Manifesto of Mortarism in particular violate the crystal ball subsection of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If this movement become important or influential at some point in the future, a wikipedia article might be in order then.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As far as "likely to become notable"" or however you put i<b>t, Isotope23 is right to cite the crystal ball clause. Anybody can claim future notability, but it's a practice that means nothing in the grand scheme of things, and in fact is oft</b>en a defining motif in what we might call outsider literature.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a notable phrase. Vary: The first nom was mistaken in thinking that it was only an edit war, but it's really an edit war over whether it should be deleted (and redirected), which would make AfD the place where we should have gone instead of the edit war. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 18:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Additionally, TYM doesn't transcend the original game outside of two references - one in a sequel to the game, and another in an MMORPG. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's quite a few more references than that - just google "Thank you * but our * is in another *" and you'll come up with tons of stuff. Most of it's just on webcomics and ytmnd stuff and whatever, but if that stuff is noteworthy enough to merit an article on AYB then it's (arguably) noteworthy enough to merit an article on TYM.</dd>
<dd>That said, I wouldn't object to this being merged into a new "List of memes originating from Mario series" article, because I'm sure there's plenty of other ones that haven't been noted on Wikipedia yet. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassandraleo_bb7c.html" title="User:Cassandraleo">Cassandra Leo</a> 21:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I stumbled across what appears to be a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a> related to an obscure local cable TV channel in the UK, with repeated namechecks of the same names - as if nobody else was involved, in fact. One, Colin Toms, was mostly an attack page and I listed it separately, but the balance are essentially a series of articles which are rnotable only in relation to each other. My parents live in the target area and have never heard if this lot, not that this is conclusive. The entire set of articles is uncited, and appears unverifiable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google for West Herts TV gets 40 hits, mostly mirrors <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22West+Herts+TV%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22West+Herts+TV%22" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></li>
<li>Google for West Herts Sports Round Up gets nine hits, all Wikipedia, all within this walled garden <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22West+Herts+Sports+Round+Up%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22West+Herts+Sports+Round+Up%22" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I can't find a single reliable source to support the idea that this lot ever existed at all, let alone that they were worthy of note. Virtually every mention is either one of these articles or a link to them placed in some other Wikipedia article.</p>

<dd>Yes, I thought hard about it, but oin the end the whole lot is a walled garden and they can safely be considered as one, since none is apparently notable except by reference to the others. As you note, the channel is not a full-time channel, and it's not even in the listings my parents have (they live in St. Albans, where I grew up - and I've never heard of any of these either). There is a vast difference between an local US cable channel and a local British one, in terms of audience (both potential and actual). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is a patently commercial link and has questionable encyclopedic value and notablility</li>
<li>The article purports that the site is a service provided by Google, however the site itself states that it has no affiliation with Google.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, 80+-year-old independent theater group (which seems to control its own theater, unusual enough for a supposed student club) which happens to be be run by students from a single college. The organization's website makes reasonable claims to notability (notable alumni working in professional theater). This Afd nomination, while the original author was apparently still writing the article, with no effort at research or attempting to contact the author to ask for improvements, is a perfect example of a <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> violation.

<li><b>Comment</b> Monicasdude: While I appreciate your comments, accusing me of WP:BITE ing and being a "busybody" editor is rather uncivil.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: A student-run theatre company like this <i>could well</i> be notable because of its age, notable alumni, and local significance in a setting which in itself is notable in national culture, in this case a university which is significant in American culture. See <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Footlights_136e.html" title="Cambridge Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a> for a British example. I do not think keeping an article like this opens the door for every short-lived theatre club at <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada_State_College_4d89.html" title="Nevada State College">Nevada State College</a> and every other minor educational institution in the U.S. I agree with Monicasdude that tagging something like this within a minute of creation is not a good practice and not unlikely to scare a serious contributor away. The current article isn't really much more than a placeholder for the link, but I am voting "weak keep" as I think this topic should have been given a fair chance before nomination. If actually deleted, re-creation in a new &amp; improved version should be allowed without some cumbersome DRV debate (I actually don't think a DRV is required if it is a new article on the topic, but I think it should be stressed anyway). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I knew I recognized the name; it took a couple days to make the connection.

In the late 1920's it spun off a short-lived summer stock company, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Players_2bec.html" title="University Players">University Players</a>, which already has its own Wikipedia article, because its early troupe included Stewart, Logan, and Henry Fonda. Quite a few other notable members in later years, too.

Nominations like this are bad practice, and the resulting deletions damage the Wikipedia project. We have gotten to a cultural state where "Gee, I never heard of this" seems to be a good enough excuse to nominate something for deletion, RATHER THAN raising legitimate issues on the talk page first to see if anyone can help improve the article. In this case, the nominator should have said "Gee, I never heard of Theatre Intime, and I looked in Google and found only n listings for the troupe, so I wonder if there's a problem here. Then, pop a note on the talk page. "Hey everybody, I don't know much about comics, but I never heard of this guy and had trouble verifying the information.

<li>I differ. While the website may not be as notable as other web forums on Wikipedia, and for the mainstream could be considered "non-notable" for the mainstream, the PlanetFurry website and community *Are notable* within the furry fandom. There are several fairly high-profile furry stories stemming from the PlanetFurry community.</li>

<dd>And the problem is, while the furry community as a whole is notable (barely), and this site is notable (maybe: Alexa says otherwise) within the furry community, this site is NOT notable within the world community which, unfortunately for the article, is what matters here. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 18:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You continually reference how it's "well known", and "notable" within the genre. Two problems: a) There's no attempt to assert HOW it's notable. Has the website been on tv? Has the website won international awards? Was it presented as a sponsor of FurCon? Does it have the requisite amount of users listed in WP:WEB? Does it have over 10,000 forum members? Has it made Wired magazine, or any of the major (and by major I mean top 500) internet blogs? No. It has an abysmal alexa ranking over 1 million. I'm sorry, but it's just not notable. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> quite plainly sets forth the standards for online notability.

<p>Maybe an idea might be to shorten the PlanetFurry article to just cover the general overveiw of what the site is about. Then add links on the main Furry article that leads to all the Furry forum articles who should all be short basic descriptions with a link to the actual site. So that way a person wondering about the Furry fandom could read that article then click on the links to lead them to articles with info on some forums then if the description of the forum sounds good they can click on the link to lead them to the site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.53.160.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.53.160.247_ee0b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.53.160.247">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>comment</b> Googling is not "research". Because of my ignorance, I called for afd, rather than asking to speedily delete it because the article (still!) does not "assert the importance or significance of the subject" (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion</a> A7).</dd>
<dd>If the "missing women" problem is not important or interesting enough to have an article on Wikipedia, then Emily Oster is not important enough, either. But please, contribute your knowledge to Wikipedia, and at least add some relevant links to the article and not only here. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustrian_d99f.html" title="User:Austrian">Austrian</a> 08:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>. Frankly, this argument makes no sense to me. The fact that Wikipedia <i>doesn't</i> have an article on a particular subject in no way establishes that Wikipedia <i>shouldn't</i> have an article on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>. No, it means , at most, she's non-notable as an academic. Einstein published his first set of major papers (including the one which got him a Nobel) very shortly after getting his doctorate; are you saying they weren't enough to establish notability for the good professor? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 23:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We've had this discussion before. A little minor media coverage does not constitute notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

Despite just receiving her Ph.D., I think her involvement with this issue has reached the point where she and her thesis are key players.

<p>I highly doubt the investigative or academic value of this entry...the fact that I have never heard of the expression "Knobbler" doesn't necessarily mean that it does not exist as a colloquial usage, of course, but the provision of atleast a basic etymology would give more credence to the entry. The rather heated emotional tone of the piece, with the climactic insertion of a reference to 'clueless Cluster customers", which is in no way foreshadowed or explained, would lead me to believe that the entry is some sort of backhanded invective against, well, god knows what. Perhaps someone could shed some light on this...Kenneth Tyrone</p>

<dd>By asserting notability, I meant that the article asserts that the debate around him by historians is notable, while the person themselves may not be notable without that kind of attention. I did not think to search out said historians, and I find a lack of references to them far more damning. While I'm still not sure it's a hoax, that kills notability, and I changed my vote. Also, I rather prefer the first half of my username for shortening purposes.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharm</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">bum</a> 20:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although the florid language and multiple references to ‘controversy’ and ‘a great debate’ may indicate an exaggeration of the importance of this participant in the most major events in Irish history, it would be erroneous to dismiss McPeake’s story lightly. If the article is factually accurate, this figure, in my opinion, is worthy of, at least, local significance if not universal interest, and, though it would be a fallacy to directly compare this man to any of the hundreds of notable American's wikipedia articles, it should not go unsaid that many of these are of similar wider significance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">user:SigPig</a> regarding the notability of this admittedly enigmatic person. It is stated that 'the records of his birth are conveniently missing.' I would argue that the records of his birth may well have been kept in the Public Record Office at the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Courts_9e27.html" title="Four Courts">Four Courts</a> in Dublin, and that there was nothing convenient about the loss of a vast swathe of Irish historical records when this building was gutted by an explosion and subsequent fire in June 1922. Furthermore, I feel that it is negligent of <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">user:SigPig</a> to say 'the article does not indicate any notability other than <i>participation</i> in this battle or <i>membership</i> in that group.' This disregards the extraordinary record of this man, potentially belonging to a number of organisations, participating in a number of key battles, and making a significant contribution to republicanism, and the foundation of a fledgling democracy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I fully acknowledge that there is little evidence available through Google, however, Wikipedia's own criteria for verifiability warn of the bias of this method. In my opinion it is unscientific and practically worthless in researching an Irish historical figure. This is clearly demonstrable by <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">user:SigPig</a>'s admission that the National Aid Society is not referenced. The sheer deficiency of information on Google regarding a fairly important group in Irish modern history indicates the unreliability of ‘The Google Test’ in this instance. (According to M.E. Collins in 'Ireland 1868-1966' the Irish National Aid Society was founded by Kathleen Clarke, wife of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Clarke_4a8b.html" title="Tom Clarke">Tom Clarke</a>, to, among other things, 'provide a cover behind which people who had escaped arrest could begin to rebuild the Volunteers and IRB.' This detail is fully continuous with the account given in this page.)</dd>
<dd>The distinct lack of verifiable sources tempers my attitude to what is, otherwise, a worthy addition to the wikipedia, containing rare personal information on a member of several secretive groups. It can be, in my opinion, only detrimental to this encyclopaedia if colourful, personal histories like these are met with such immediate and strident criticism. JMcCann 19:41, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> I'm a native speaker of Greek and I inform you that this article, while on a valid topic, Metropolitan Athanasius <a href="http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/iera_synodos.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/iera_synodos.shtml" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, is a hoax. It translates as:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Athanasius was the Metropolitan/Diosean Bishop of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limassol.html" title="Limassol">Limassol</a> and is the Archbishop of Cyprus since 2006 (since he expelled the forces of evil from Kykko). As he himself said, "in satan they are different..." Now he enjoys the throne of Cyprus.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Athanasius is indeed the Bishop of Limassol, but according to the website of the Chruch of Cyprus <a href="http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/iera_arxiep.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/iera_arxiep.shtml" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> and the Wikipedia list <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Archbishops_of_Cyprus_de42.html" title="List of Archbishops of Cyprus">List of Archbishops of Cyprus</a>, he is not Archbishop. This article is a hoax (I don't know if he ever will be Archbishop). What Wikipedia does need is a biography of the present archbishop. His bio here <a href="http://www.iak.org.cy/index.files/Page1333.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iak.org.cy/index.files/Page1333.html" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> should be translated. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwy_c447.html" title="User:Edwy"><i>Edwy</i></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwy_Active_d51b.html" title="User talk:Edwy/Active">talk</a>)</sup> 23:45, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's only one source which doesn't cover half the content in this article, and googling (e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22color+or+country%22+OR+%22colour+or+country%22+-race+-creed+-%22country+of+origin%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22color+or+country%22+OR+%22colour+or+country%22+-race+-creed+-%22country+of+origin%22" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>) seems to imply that this isn't notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Like The Game (game), this article has verifiability issues. The previous AFD argued primarily the notability of Color or Country and its appropriateness as a game, not as an article. (This current AFD seems to be headed that way too). I'm not inclined to delete an article based on its notability; I do not think, however, that we should allow unsourced articles to continue living in article space--especially if they do not seem sourceable. As the article stands, the only thing that has been given a source is the rules, a very small portion of the article. I've looked for more information than that, and been generally unsuccessful. Regardless of my opinion of the game itself, the article is unlikely to ever meet the criteria set forth in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 02:35, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I actually think the article (well, the top section, anyway) is adequately sourced. The last paragraph is false, by the way: this game was not introduced for the <i>first time</i> at Mathcamp 2002, I have firsthand knowledge.. and the business about "Functor or category" is a mathcamp in-joke. This game is simply not notable enough... it's basically a case of <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 14:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
