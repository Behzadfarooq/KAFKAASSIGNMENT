<p>Several supporters of these article have argued that these guidelines don't apply, therefore AfD debate is needed. Probably <b>all 85 articles</b> need to be deleted (and perhaps some info merged) but I am testing the waters first. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 09:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please read our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> to see what you should do before nominating an article for deletion on the grounds of unverifiability. Did you do the research to see whether any sources on these subjects exist? What did you find? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unverifiability is not specifically one of the reasons for this AfD. The reasons concern <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">WP:R</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>. Two editors involved with these articles have said the bullet points above do not apply here and any tags requesting that editors establish notability etc have been promptly removed. My efforts to encourage improvement have been rebuked. Not every episode of every show deserves an article, agreed? I respectfully say I am under no obligation to research and improve upon 85 articles that I don't think should have been created in the first place. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 11:24, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>On this basis, I nominate half of Wikipedia for deletion. Especially for the violation of <i>Redirects</i>. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELars_T._6a81.html" title="User:Lars T.">Lars T.</a> 14:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If that's the case then this should probably be listed as a copyright problem rather than an afd.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's an episode of a TV show. The show is running with good ratings. How the hell does it lack notability? And how the hell do the quotes both prove OR and copyright violation?

<li><b>Keep</b> — Notable television series, episode is inheritly notable. Consensus is episode articles are perfectly legitimate, nominator has been disruptive with canvassing, etc. I'd like to point out the discussion page the nominator quotes also states "Generally, articles on episodes of television should not be listed for AfD (unless they are completely unverifiable, original research, etc.)" – nor does it appear to be (completely) non-sourced, an episode articles <i>is</i> the source, the <i>primary source</i>, although yes, it does require secondary sources, that is, of course, not a valid criterion for deletion. Addendum: nominator states "Several supporters of these article have argued that these guidelines don't apply" - this is actually an <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_ad_ignorantium.html" title="Argument ad ignorantium">argument ad ignorantium</a>, no one has suggested they do not apply, just that you are not <i>totally</i> interpreting them correctly. <span style="font-style: Tahoma; font-size: 84%;"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></span> 16:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an article on a TV series episode and it has already been estatblished that individual episodes of notable TV series are admissable. Any content issues can be resolved without deleting the whole article (i.e. if there are too many quotes or copyvio material, then delete <i>this material</i> and replace it with new, original text). The nominator will find that there are far more than 85 articles -- not to mention a Wikiproject -- that would have to be nominated for deletion of one feels episode articles are improper for Wikipedia. In which case, a better plan would be to lobby for a policy change, though I think <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> would apply. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — It's a TV episode like many others. The "List of..." article couldn't have more than a short paragraph on each without being absurdly long. What's the original research involved? The Quotes section does run on some. <a href="../../../w/w/o/User%7EWwoods_7169.html" title="User:Wwoods">—wwoods</a> 17:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge and redirect</b> to the parent article. Per <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a>, articles for individual episodes should not be created until there is enough independently published, verifiable information on which to base the article. The current contents of the page are a short plot summary and a series of quotes which are 1) excessive, 2) inappropriate (per above) and 3) <s>probably violate <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a></s>. No sources (other than the primary source of the show itself) have been offered either in the article or here. We may use the primary source as support but it can never be the sole basis of an article. Encyclopedias are by definition tertiary sources. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Correction: On investigation, it appears that this entire article is a copyvio of <a href="http://www.tv.com/ncis/switch/episode/483200/summary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/ncis/switch/episode/483200/summary.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I have replaced the copyvio content with the standard copyvio warning. Users may still see the disputed content in the page history pending conclusion of this debate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete as copyright violation</b> As noted above, article appears to have been a cut-and-paste copyright violation. I'll reconsider if a <i>new</i> article is written about this episode, keeping in mind that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> specifies that plot summaries should include "real world context or analysis" and not simply list plot details. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or merge and redirect. Episode is not notable enough to warrant an article. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 22:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
