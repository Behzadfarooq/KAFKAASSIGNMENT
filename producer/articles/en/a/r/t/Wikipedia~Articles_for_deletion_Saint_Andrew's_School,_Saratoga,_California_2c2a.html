<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. We aren't going to be able to get rid of any schools (hell, we were barely able to see off a <i>nursery school</i>), and by constantly trying all we're doing is generating bad feeling in the community. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 19:28, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> not that I think it will do any good. I <i>surely</i> do not see the point in saying something I don't believe as mooted by howcheng above. Keep nominating schools, or wrestlers, or battle ships if you feel it's the correct thing to do. Shouting down dissenting voices is anti-wiki. <b>I</b> do not nominate schools, and I don't go out of my way to find the nominations, but when they show up on my watch list I contribute. It doesn't take long, I am usually polite (well, recently at least), and if people want to keep doing this I'll keep doing it. I think that calls to "stop nominating" while at the same time blocking all attempts to reach some <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>-like accord are <b>foul</b>. If there was any sense of compromise, we could avoid all this nonsese. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 23:40, 3 November 20</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; a small private school is plainly not automatically encyclopedic, and nothing in the article claims encyclopedic worth.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the latest in a string of <b>bad-faith</b> nominations and actions by this editor. This type of behavior is disruptive in the extreme and completely ignores WP policy and guidelines. Creating a stub article which has the sole content of "<b>Saint Andrew's School</b>, is a private co-educational <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_1bad.html" title="Episcopal Church">Episcopal Church</a> day school in <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga%2C_California_26e8.html" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a>" then waiting for another editor to improve it in order to nominate for AfD is outrageous, especially given this editor's previously stated positions on the notability of schools and the value of one-line school stubs. This is preceeded by the creation of hoax schools, preschools, grocery stores, etc. all for the purposes of making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> and being generally disruptive and absuing the AfD process. The claim that the "article was created before I realized there were notability issues that should be taken into account for an article" in August of 2005 is patently false and deceptive, since this editor's views on schools are and have been well publicized long before the creation of this article. I think it is high time for an RfC and conceivably further action to prevent this editor from so callously abusing the AfD process.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Find me proof I'd developed a concrete opinion on or before August 10th. Also if you'd bothered to read the posts above you'd realize I didn't nominate this because it had been improved but because it never should have been made in the first place. The improvements were made days ago. I would have nominated months ago had I remembered I'd made this article.
