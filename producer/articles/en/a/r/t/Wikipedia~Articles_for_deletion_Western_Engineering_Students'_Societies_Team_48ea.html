<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> Not-notable, doesn't merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdenn_1d2f.html" title="User talk:Ardenn">Ardenn</a> 05:54, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lists of <a href="../../../f/a/q/FAQ_1fe9.html" title="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</b> Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s). You may want to consider contributing FAQ lists to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>.</li>
<li><b>Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics</b> such as quotations, <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphorism.html" title="Aphorism">aphorisms</a> or persons. If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a>. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous <i>because</i> they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic. Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference.</li>
<li><b>Travel guides.</b> An article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> should mention landmarks such as the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a <i>café au lait</i> on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es_373d.html" title="Champs-Élysées">Champs-Élysées</a>. Such details are, however, very welcome at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.</li>
<li><b>Memorials.</b> It may be sad when people die, but Wikipedia is not the place to honor them. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives.</li>
<li><b>News reports.</b> Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many <i>encyclopedia articles</i> on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples.</li>
<li><b>Genealogical entries,</b> or <b>phonebook entries.</b> Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Relatively unimportant people may be mentioned within other articles (e.g. Ronald Gay in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_gays%2C_lesbians%2C_bisexuals%2C_and_the_transgendered.html" title="Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered">Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered</a>). See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipeople" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipeople">m:Wikipeople</a> for a proposed genealogical/biographical dictionary project.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory.html" title="Directory">Directories</a>, directory entries,</b> or a <b>resource for conducting business.</b> For example, an article on a radio station generally shouldn't list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, etc. (although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable). Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article.</li>
<li><b>Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( <a href="../../../l/e/g/Wikipedia%7ELegal_disclaimer_595c.html" title="Wikipedia:Legal disclaimer">legal</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedical_disclaimer_7dd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer">medical</a>, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Main_Page">Wikibooks</a> is a Wikipedia sister-project which is better suited for such things. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_draw_a_diagram_with_Dia_4471.html" title="Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia">Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia</a>.</li>

<li>The principles of Wikipedia are being corrupted by rampant deletionists. Check here for why the definition of notability is constantly misinterpretted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The principles of Wikipedia are interpreted and put into place by consensus, and that consensus is firm on the undesirability of cruft. Cruft is certainly a bad thing in any encyclopedia striving to be accessible and useful. Now if you want random infinite collectors of trivial information, they already exist; they're called "search engines." They're about as useful as Wikipedia would be if we let in anything anyone wanted to post. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> WESST is a notable orgainzation. It represents 8 schools on the national level to CFES. WEC is a huge engineering competition that gathers thousands of engineers together.

<dd>Well, for example confirm that thousands of engineers gather for the competition they sponsor, instead of a few dozen as might be the case with some student societies. Or that the competiton is viewed significantly by people that hire engineers (are there "scouts" or recruiters there?) Or that former members have gone on to become famous or notable in their post-graduation lives? You might call it the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater_intime.html" title="Theater intime">Theater intime</a> test, in which a student run theater group at one college was kept because of its long history and the famous actors who got their start there. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:09, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems notable enough to me - an intercollegiate association carrying out significant activities. Why is this association any different than some of the intercollegiate debating societies with entries? It seems there is too strong a trend lately to indiscriminately oppose student societies (of any stature or notariety) having entries. In a wiki-world where elementary schools are deemed "notable" enough to have entries, I see no reason why university student societies of significance cannot.
