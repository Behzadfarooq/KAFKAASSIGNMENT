<li><b>Comment</b> although Wikipedia is not a memorial, there are actual memorials that are themselves eligible for Wikipedia articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia and the insensitivity to the need to acknowledge those that give their lives to service is of great concern. Admittedly, these articles need to be expanded, which is a task that will be done over the coming days. Please respect the notion that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit but not everyone has the time to immediately update. These pages were created out of respect for both living and fallen warriors and the desire to delete them post-haste concerns me You have made this a political issue, which it is clearly not. As you can clearly see by this category here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers</a> , there are others who are working to provide information on both living and deceased police officers. Please do not delete pages before you are aware of the full political implications of such an action. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> 17:59, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a memorial</a>, as Zoe correctly notes, and CelebritySecurity, just because "there are others who are working to provide information on both living and deceased police officers" does not make them any less misguided. As for "the full political implications" of abiding by our well-established precedents on these matters, there aren't any. You might not <i>like</i> the fact that Wikipedia doesn't consider someone's death to automatically make them notable, but if dying in the 9/11 attacks doesn't make one encyclopedically notable, it is not sufficient to be a law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty either. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:51, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Despite Wikipedia being the "free encyclopedia that anyone can edit", a group of rogue vandalizing admins is now going to be given the editing power of deciding who is "valid enough" to recieve their own biography? I hope those that feel these entries should be deleted also begin the process of deleting the biographies of all law enforcement officers on this website. Clearly, the open-source foundations of the Wikipedia project are starting to crumble based upon the very clear bias and inconsistent editing/deletion policies that are emerging here. If this page is deleted, the Wikipedia foundation will be making a very public statement that the contributions of law enforcement officers across the English-speaking world are not welcome here. If these pages and these pages alone are deleted, the credibility of this project will be seriously undermined. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> 00:03, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> To those that suggest these articles and infobox be deleted, Should the process of deleting all entries of all law enforcement officers from this website also be undertaken in order to ensure fairness? Also, please note that the infobox has been written with proper code designating whether or not the officer is deceased or not. It is not intended as a memorial, merely something written to acknowledge the contributions of law enforcement officers, much in the same way celebrities and politicians are listed on this same website. <small>(this unsigned comment was made by <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a>)</small>

<li>of <i>all</i> law-enforcement officers? no. of law-enforcement officers who, like Valérie Gignac, fail to be encyclopedically notable? Yes, actually. ... I hasten to add, because the kind of person who tries to vote three times in the same discussion seems like the kind of person who needs this warning, this is not encouragement to go on a vandalistic rampage slapping deletion tags on all articles you can find on English-speaking law enforcement officers, no matter how notable, to avenge what you misperceive as a bias against law-enforcement officers who speak other languages. That would be disrupting Wikipedia to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a>.

<li><b>keep</b> There are plenty of articles in Wikipedia that are borderline as to been noteworthy. I'm thinking politicians that have no portfolio and have only served a term or two. The article is about a police office that certainly warrants some merit of consideration to stay. It's all good; even those lackluster politicians that only fill an empty chair when parliament sits.

<li><b>Keep</b> her death received widespread media coverage, which establish more notoriety than someelement included in Wikipedia. Death of police officers in theline of duty is much more unusual in Quebec than in the US, an caused a renewed fear among the constabulary.
