<p>I originally nominated this as a copyright violation, however, by the time an admin looked at it the offending text had been removed and a short stub replaced. Immediately afterwards, the text was replaced with the current. Although I have not looked at it in detail, it still seems to have been copied largely from <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/history/biographies/sahaabah/bio.ABDULLAH_IBN_ABBAS.html" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/history/biographies/sahaabah/bio.ABDULLAH_IBN_ABBAS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/history/biographies/sahaabah/bio.ABDULLAH_IBN_ABBAS.html</a> and the talkpage also suggests <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/mohamed/1424/companions/article07.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/mohamed/1424/companions/article07.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/mohamed/1424/companions/article07.shtml</a>.

<dd>The people who keep putting the information back refuse to recognise that it is a copy vio. This is why I have listed it for deletion because they fundamentally fail to understand what the article needs. Why don't you bring it up with them? The best outcome of an AfD is an improved article, so someone improve it or vote to delete it; don't just assume other people will (and I think i have put enough effort into this article myself) <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 17:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would help if you <b>start</b> by explaining what <b>portion</b> is a copyvio, instead of just giving sweeping accusations. And while you are at it, if you are sincerly interested in building a encyclopedia, you could just paraphrase the alledged copy vio or ask somebody to paraphrase it for you, instead of wasting peoples time here. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:36, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable and mostly encyclopedic. I made some edits (as per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Islam-related_articles%29_b44f.html#IslamicHonorifics" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Islam-related articles)">Manual of Style on Islamic Honorifics</a> to make it more NPOV: "the Prophet Muhammad" to "Muhammad". As for the copyvio that apparently keeps coming back, that is an issue but I don't think the way to resolve it is by deleting the article. Copyvio material needs to be removed. If it's not a good faith addition of info <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, then the posters need to be contacted and, if they persist, a block on them needs to be taken up.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a content dispute... no reason to delete. I've tagged it for cleanup though becuase it could stand a major rewrite. Some sections are unecessary and the whole thing reads way to close to it's source material even if it isn't a direct copyright violation.

Just for example, the paragraph "During the lifetime of the Prophet, Abdullah would not miss any of his assemblies and he would commit to memory whatever he said. After the Prophet passed away, he would take care to go to as many companions as possible especially those who knew the Prophet longer and learn from them what the Prophet had taught them. Whenever he heard that someone knew a hadith of the Prophet which he did not know he would go quickly to him and record it. He would subject whatever he heard to close scrutiny and check it against other reports. He would go to as many as thirty companions to verify a single matter." <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 02:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: People who have been suggesting that this matter is copy vio rather than AfD are missing the reason I nominated it; I DID nominate for copy vio, whereupon the material was removed, and as soon as the admin checking copy vio said there wasn't a violation (because he didn't see what had been deleted), the copyright violation was immediately put back on, <i>and added to from the same source</i>, as it stands today. The article is unreferenced, it is biased, and it is a copyright violation. This surely breaks as many WP:Policies as is needed. I am tired of having to push this point, simply because I am outnumbered by the people who want the copy vio to remain on the article (though Mr. Striver is unaware of what constitutes copyright violation, he still has no right to continually replace what various admins agree IS). I want this article, like all articles, to be a GOOD article, and it seems to me that as it stands it is a disgrace to everyone. So, please, I beg you, either vote to delete, or take on this article's improvement instead of simply calling for someone else to do it. I have tried every avenue now and I don't have the will anymore for a protracted edit war.
