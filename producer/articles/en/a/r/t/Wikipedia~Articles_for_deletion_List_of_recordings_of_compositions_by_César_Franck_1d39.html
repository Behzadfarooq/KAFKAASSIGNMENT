<p>This discography is ridiculously small. My guess is that it is the contents of someone's private CD collection. Unless this page is going to expand to something close to a complete discography of Franck (which would be a mammoth undertaking) it should be deleted <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 02:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> it needs expansion, but that's not a criteria for deletion. This list has definite, objective criteria for inclusion, and a finite limit. seems fine and potentially valuable, if one wants to see all the recordings of a work, for example. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:30, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I generally think discographies are great and would agree with you if there seemed any remote prospect that this list would improve. However, given that the list currently contains only 14 recordings, while <a href="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" class="external text" title="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" rel="nofollow">ArkivMusic</a> lists 581 recordings of Franck currently available for purchase, and that all the listed recordings are of organ music with no mention of his orchestral, choral, vocal or chamber music, I seriously question whether this is ever going to happen. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 15:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Ridiculously incomplete, and if anyone tried to make a serious list, it would be completely unwieldy - Amazon lists over 1000 hits on his name. Franck is a fairly major composer, there are hundreds of recordings of his work. Particularly notable recordings of his work should be listed in the César Franck article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - same arguments as above - it is very unlikely that this discography will ever be complete: the discography itself had only 3 edits since april. A short discography with milestones, historical recordings, etc., that would be interesting though.--<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Friendly_2e1b.html" title="User:Dr. Friendly">Dr. Friendly</a> 18:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"<b>Weak Keep</b> If I go to the library and get a book about a composer, it may well have a section of "essential repertoire" recordings of the composer's works. I assume that at the time the book was written, these were the best performances on record: that they represent an acknowledged interpreter of the works, well recorded. I would appreciate the same thing in a Wiki article about a composer. The problem is, if Wikipedian Joe Blow writes the list, and says "These are the best recordings of Franck's work" that is obviously OR. The article would have to come from a verifiable source, such as a music book or music magazine, or at least a reputable website (and how is that detremined?). Then there would be the problem of copyright infringement: The list is the property of the magazine or book. One out is to include in the main article on the musician a link to a website listing essential recordings. Then some deletionist is likely to complain the website is spam, if they also offer products for sale. Checking a few musicians randomly: I don't see such a discography for Beethoven or Carl Czerny, just a listing of compositions. For Wagner, many compositions have their own articles. Lohengrin lists 6 recordings chosen by someone. Is their inclusion OR? Why not 6 other recordings? For Gershwin, the article on Rhapsody in Blue identifies 6 recordings as "Notable" without citing a source for that opinion. Clearly the precedent is set for an inclusion of "Notable" recordings in the Franck article itself or in a split off article such as this, or go to the other articles and remove the discography as OR. For Wagner's Die Meistersinger, the article has an external link to a Geocities blog where someone in 2000 listed the best recordings (in his opinion)of the work. That site does not offer products for sale, so does not appear to be spam. If such a site had reviews or selections made by someone with credentials such as a distinguished conductor or professor of music, it would seem to meet general Wiki requirements of verifiability, and to be a usable approach, preferable to the editor just listing the recordings he owns. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this list doesn't even claim to be a list of "notable recordings". As I pointed out above, it doesn't attempt to cover such well-known works as Franck's <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_in_D_minor_%28Franck%29_9ca4.html" title="Symphony in D minor (Franck)">Symphony</a> or Violin Sonata. It is restricted to organ music. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 00:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point was that in any article, for the editor to say These 6 recordings are Notable or The Bes is OR unless they cite some verifiable external review or list to say so. Such lists should be deleted as OR unless tyhey have an outside source for the selection. It would not matter if the Franck articlelisted a couple of recordings of every composition by Franck. Still OR. But for consistency, why disallow a list of recordings ONLY in this article? Surely there are collections of reviews such as John von Rhein's: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story" class="external free" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0608110217aug11,1,1683241.story</a> which identify the most notable recordings, old as well as new, of a given work<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:48, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but writing a discography generally takes a significant amount of work. If anyone was really serious about making this article more complete, they could, for a start, add entries for the 581 recordings of Franck available at <a href="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" class="external text" title="http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Namedrill?&amp;name_id=3961&amp;name_role=1" rel="nofollow">ArkivMusic</a>, and then investigate out-of-print recordings. Does anyone seriously expect this to happen? If not, this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 00:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See above. Other articles list perhaps 6 "Notable" recordings of a given work by a given composer, but I challeneg th editors' selection of those 6 as OR, the equivalent of the editor saying "Here are my favorite recordings" unless they cite, say an article by a music critic listing those as the critic's favorite recordings.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:57, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We seem to be drifting off-topic here. If you want to challenge lists of "Notable recordings" in other articles that are not backed by references as OR or "Citation needed" then go ahead. I'm not sure what relevance that has to this particular article, which does not claim to be a list of Notable recordings, but rather a "List of recordings of compositions by Cesar Franck". Imagine as a thought experiment that I created an article entitled List of all recordings of anything ever made and populated it with two CDs from my collection. That list would also have clear and verifiable criteria for inclusion and a finite limit. In fact, all the arguments that are being used to defend this Franck list would also apply to my imaginary article. It would need a bit of expansion, to be sure, but so then does the Franck list! Yet surely no-one would deny that <i>that</i> article should be deleted because it is hopelessly overambitious and pathetically incomplete. The same points apply to this Franck article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 16:08, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Checked at my public library and found 2 guides to classical recordings. They do not list hundreds of recommended recordings for Franck. In fact, Rough Guide only selected 5 of his works other than organ works, and had a few recordings of each. "A Basic Music Library" by the American Library Association only chose 3 of his works other than organ works, and listed 1 to 4 recordings of each. Obviously there is zero merit to listing a duplication of Schwan's catalog with every recording in print, then supplementing it with all out of print recordings. But there is a place for "Notable" or "Recommended" recordings. So rename the article to avoid the accusation that it does not include every recording ever done, and either include representative selections from such guides as are found in a library, or from a reputable online website. Please take a look at my additions, which include 1 or more recordings of each of the works recommended in either of the 2 guides found. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
