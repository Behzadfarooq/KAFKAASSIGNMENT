<dd>This page is in its early stages and is one of my first contributions to wikipedia. As regards the film, this might not be a hollywood blockbuster release but it is very much an available, well received film and distribution is continuing to grow. This film is important as a true reflection of the experiences had by the hundreds of thousands of young people who travel to this area every year.</dd>

In either case there is no reason to reject this based on the fact that it is a university choir. Academic choirs are often among the main upholders of choral traditions (I know that to be the case in Sweden, at least) and, despite a dubious assertion by Newyorktimescrossword above, many choral groups do have their own articles on Wikipedia already. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Category%7EHarvard_University_0543.html" title="Category:Harvard University">Category:Harvard University</a> alone contains <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Choirs_176a.html" title="Holden Choirs">Holden Choirs</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radcliffe_Choral_Society_0cf9.html" title="Radcliffe Choral Society">Radcliffe Choral Society</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Glee_Club_2d07.html" title="Harvard Glee Club">Harvard Glee Club</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Radcliffe_Collegium_Musicum_ae34.html" title="Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum">Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Radcliffe_Chorus_b668.html" title="Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus">Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> this is a bit of a vanity page...but - I go to Durham myself so I do know the group but the group is important - there are lots and lots of little groups like this in the university and merging it with the university as a precedent would give us lots of problems in the future because we would have to do this with lots of other groups. My suggestion (however humble) is to create a topic page entitled Category:Durham University Music Societies or even Category:Durham University Student Socities and place all student societies ( defined as 'affliated to the Student's Union' - in the case of Durham) in there, and link to it off the main page, and edit the main page accordingly. This might be a good way (as a precedent) of dealing with Student societies from any other university.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuccent_1d29.html" title="User:Luccent">Luccent</a> 12:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC) Further to what I said before...I had a root around on the categories to Durham University - the Univeristy itself has a category Category:University of Durham and we can put whichever category we want into that category. We then start to follow the example of Harvard - thanks to Uppland for showing that. We also have the secondary question of whether the article is worthy - I think it is - although when other student socities want to be added; I'm not sure how worthy 'Durham University <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> Society will be!&#160;:s --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuccent_1d29.html" title="User:Luccent">Luccent</a> 12:43, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Author Comment</b> It's a shame you feel this qualifies as vanity. Although presently an officer of the choir, it was there before, and I also assume it will be after my tenure, and the article is not associated specifically with the present time or activities. The article is there because I genuinely believe the bredth of university information is enhanced by it's presence. The Chamber Choir has been in existence within the university for over seventy years (although not always as a student society) and as thus probably can be deemed more important than the neighbours soc. Thank you for your attention to the matter Phillip, I hope you've found some time to do some organ practise. --nde575 01:41, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Radio_Stations_b292.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations">Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations</a>, Wikipedia policy explicitly permits articles on broadcast radio stations. The fact a station is two days old has no bearing on this policy. This would be a slamdunk except for one thing: <b>I already wrote this up at <a href="../../../c/i/l/CILV-FM_9a1d.html" title="CILV-FM">CILV-FM</a> a few weeks ago</b>. (Even licensed-but-not-launched stations are allowed articles, if their call sign, owner, frequency, format and expected launch date are known, and Wikipedia policy also expects the radio station's article to include the -FM suffix.) <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/i/l/CILV-FM_9a1d.html" title="CILV-FM">CILV-FM</a>; I've already copied any content that wasn't already in the other article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:09, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Radio_Stations_b292.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations">Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations</a> is not policy, and a number of projects involve creating articles that end up being deleted (sad but true). But, you're still basically correct (in terms of defacto policy), in that AFD precedent for some time, has been to keep broadcasters (radio and TV) even if they're "just" local stations. I recently added a comment at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_cd39.html#local_broadcasters" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Precedents#local broadcasters</a> suggesting we updated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Entertainment" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents#Entertainment</a> to say that such stations are now deemed notable according to more recent AFD precedent. The only reason I didn't change it myself, is I would like to see some agreement before changing it unilaterly. Nominations, like this one, are likely to be repeated if people are under the impression stations like this are being deleted (which they're not). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:49, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is this a "crystal ball" article? The project is going on right now, and can be easily seen by anyone. As for notability, Las Vegas is visited by millions of people around the world, and many are interested in the ever-changing face of the strip...which this is a part. Furthermore, there are already several links to the article, which will go red, causing the article to be recreated sooner or later. Do we just keep deleting and recreating the article until this opens? Finally, what about motion pictures in production. <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a> has an article, and it's not released yet...should that deleted too as a "crystal ball" article?</li>

<dd>The preparations for the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Tower_a8ea.html" title="Freedom Tower">Freedom Tower</a> have received national press coverage. Those for The Cosmopolitan have not—or, if they have, you have not cited any of that coverage. I personally do not think <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Tower_a8ea.html" title="Freedom Tower">Freedom Tower</a> comes under the "crystal ball" rubric. <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a> is borderline. If someone were to nominate it I personally <i>would</i> vote to delete it. But I won't bother proposing it myself because my experience is that once a movie has a listing in imdb there will not be consensus to delete. If you honestly believe these articles come under the "crystal ball" policy you or anyone else can nominate them for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I should note as a matter of record that I was the creator of the article. However, it was created only because the property was already included in the Las_Vegas_Strip template, and I thought it looked bad to have a broken link in an otherwise informative template. I have no subjective attachment to either The Cosmopolitan or the article itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, I don't think that the crystal ball argument for deletion holds water. This is a major project that is already funded and has already broken ground. It is not "going down the toilet". I don't believe Wikipedia needs an article about every proposed condo project in the Las Vegas Valley, but this is a major undertaking on prime property on the <b>World Famous</b> Las Vegas Strip. It has an appeal that reaches far beyond the local. It will surely merit an article once it is completed, so why delete it now? I can see a use for the article as it exists now, say if a visitor to Las Vegas witnesses the construction and is curious as to what lies in the future of the ever-changing Las Vegas Strip. What better place to sate her curiosity than Wikipedia? <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuck_O%27Nollege_791e.html" title="User:Buck O'Nollege">Buck O'Nollege</a> 07:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I can understand that if this was a rumored project or a minor construction, then maybe it would be CFD. But this is a MAJOR construction project that has already BROKEN GROUND.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a $1.8 billion project. How many cities have a private construction project that large? The <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardwalk_Hotel_and_Casino_0440.html" title="Boardwalk Hotel and Casino">Boardwalk</a> will be closing next week to be replaced by <i>Project City Center</i> to be completed in 2010, likely the most expensive private construction project in history. I suspect that project will get an article also. Projects in Vegas do fail! They also can change a lot before they are actually completed. Many interesting facts about these projects are only easly available during construction, so that is a great time to write the article when many of the technical details are readly available. Much of this data would be encylopedic. Construction projects like <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttle_Ptichka_630b.html" title="Shuttle Ptichka">Shuttle Ptichka</a> that never were completed are considered encylopedic after they failed, should we delete these? Maybe the question is under what conditions do construction projects become encylopedic? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred.' This opening sentance clearly allows article about major projects. One could even argue that the Ivan Condo, which looks like it has failed, could still get an article. Even if press coverage is minimal, how many people can say they saw it under construction? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:38, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The question is not whether Wikipedia should have an article about abuses of rights which the Foreign Soil Freedom Act is intended to prevent. Wikipedia already covers that issue in articles such as <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_controversy_150c.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act controversy">USA PATRIOT Act controversy</a> and possibly others. However, the Foreign Soil Freedom Act is just one private citizen's proposal to prevent abuses, and it would not itself become notable at least until it is introduced into Congress, and more likely not until it actually passes Congress (lots of bills are introduced into Congress which never get anywhere).

The perpetrator of such character defilement, through the lens of creating an actual issue when none exists, is, in and of itself, a key reason that Wikipedia can never be what it seeks to be: a fact-based collective of information on a subject. As one might expect I am a filmmaker and fervent supporter of George Lucas' works and his contributions to the cinematic arts. If I were to write a section on the praise of George Lucas, as a seperate, "counter-article" I could fill over 100 pages of stardard Microsoft Word documents and post them on Wikipedia. It is disgusting that the author of such trash would post it on a public site which they do not own nor have personal claim to. No one has the right to criticize another in public ENCYCLOPEDIA. The author already mentions briefly that some do not agree with George Lucas' filmmaking techniques, and this is documented. But his or her creation of this so called "movement" against the filmmaker is not only ridiculous, it is libel. If the author of the document feels that there is actually a large enough group of people who "bash" George Lucas, I suggest he pay actual money for his or her own site, where they can freely write and distribute whatever information they please. But to corrupt the information of other people who seek out this entry for educational and/or academic purposes, the presence of this section is an affront to the very purpose of Wikipedia. It is an Encyclopedia, not a forum for one's agenda or opinion. I demand, if this encyclopedia is to be of any value to anyone, that this entry be deleted with all haste, and the entire article be evaluated, or even better, rewritten, to properly reflect a factual, untarnished, and uncircumspect article, which this entry has failed to become. I also suggest close monitoring of this entry, for any further attempts at the injection of libel into the biographies of the world's notable people. I was accused of "defacing" Wikipedia when I first deleted this section after having read it in anger. I have since become acquainted with the policies of Wikipedia regarding such actions, and have learned to my dismay that it is in fact easier for someone to publish untrue and bogus information on Wikipedia than it is for those who seek the truth in entries, to delete it. This is most disconcerting, and unfortunately, the most unique aspect of the encyclopedia is its most flawed. I will no longer delete anything in this entry, but in protest pending its removal, I have written a brief commentary contra to the perspective in the article. Please understand I expect this to be deleted along with the nonsensical opinionative information which it opposes.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please <i>sign</i> your comments and comment <i>below</i> other comments. Also try to keep page edits within Wikipedia style (the article was already marked as possible POV -- this is why someone removed your disclaimer). I realise it's hard to neutrally document vehement arguments but try to recognise that the article is just a record of the existence of gushers and bashers (at least this article isn't as bad a nightmare as NPOV in pro-life and pro-choice articles). The article is fully sourced and is as close to a reflection of the analyses made by the sources as possible and it tries where possible to discuss both sides (read the discussion: the article has actually been edited to keep as close to the consensus of sources as possible). My bias on this article is listed below. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisgoo_6d27.html" title="User:Mattisgoo">Mattisgoo</a> 04:00, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This artice used to be very POV. Since then, a lot of work has gone in to provide references to source materials that discuss Lucas bashing as a real phenomena. I disagree that it still has an issue with POV. It may be merged, but Fan criticism of George Lucas was actually created to remove unreferenced material from Lucas bashing and to split the article after it grew too long.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The arguments put forward for deletion are:
<ul>
<li>POV</li>
<li>Not notable enough to deserve a separate article</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Neither of these two points qualify under <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>. POV is explicitly something which does not qualify for deletion, merely an "article needing attention".</dd>
<dd>The test which is closest to "notablity" is "original research". Do the references and other sources support the content article. The article has journal, media, reviewer and colloquial support of definition and all major subject headings and topic points. In this respect, the article cannot be considered for deletion under this test.</dd>
<dd>The test for justifying the merging of an article is less clear. Let's look at the Google numbers anyway:
<ul>
<li>As stated in the article, most references are contextual. i.e. Bashing or Gushing are normally used in context without a qualifier. This is why "Lucas bashing" returns so few hits. Without the quotes, it returns 181,000 and Lucas gushing returns 81,000. 32,000 and 17,000 using Lucas basher and Lucas gusher respectively. 469,000 for '"Star Wars" bashing'. It goes on. It is an informal term used in subculture venues -- testing it too rigidly is faulty research.</li>
<li>Should the Khazakstani opposition party the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_of_Kazakhstan_Bright_Path_19a7.html" title="Democratic Party of Kazakhstan Bright Path">Democratic_Party_of_Kazakhstan_Bright_Path</a> be deleted or merged because only 65 Google hits exist? No, because the sources support this entity as a separate subject. This is why the number Google hits should not be used for justifying Wikipedia articles. The sources should.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Further looking at arguments for merging:
<ul>
<li>As Zukeeper said, the "Fan Criticism" article was spun off from the bashing/gushing article. This is because it is unsupported, unreferenced, one-sided and rambling. To merge the two articles would diminish the identification of Lucas bashing and gushing as a real phenomenon.</li>
<li>The article is about "bashing and gushing" not about criticism. i.e. It is about the behaviours of the people involved, not about any criticism itself. In this way, the "Fan criticism" article is not properly related.</li>
<li>The combination of the two articles would be bigger than the maximum recommended article size.</li>
<li>Lucas bashing contains more points than <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegory.html" title="Allegory">allegory</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catachresis.html" title="Catachresis">catachresis</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable.html" title="Parable">parable</a> combined and yet no one would suggest merging them all into <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>. I have to suggest that people here are biased because the article is on fan subculture rather than linguistics -- a bias which is improper and not supported by Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>On whether or not the article is "inherently POV":
<ul>
<li>This article has been listed as having POV issues for some time. Since major revisions were made roughly a fortnight ago, no one has identified an aspect of the article that is POV. The article clearly and carefully details boths sides of a vehement debate. It does not support bashers or gushers. It avoids giving one or the other more attention. It does not support or decry George Lucas or Star Wars. There is no identified aspect of the article which forwards a point of view. Arguably the name of the article itself is imbalanced and I agree that it should be Lucas Bashers and Gushers.</li>
<li>It does not help Wikipedia or it's content to declare "inherently POV" without support. If you cannot say what is negatively affected by the article, if you cannot list the biased slant of the article, then nothing will change.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To summarise my points: no argument has been made in favor of deletion. Only the claim of "not notable" has been made in favor of merging, but the request is that a large, fully referenced, balanced article on a specific topic be merged into an already ungainly, largely unrelated, unsupported, one-sided, rambling article.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Whoops, I didn't pay attention to Coffee's point that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bush_bashing_765a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bush bashing">Bush Bashing</a> was deleted. Valid point to consider. I don't know how to view that deleted article, but from the deletion votes: that article said little more than the title inferred and was really just a generic discussion of bashing. My opinion is that this is not the case for this article -- it gives an investigation into reactionary ideology that is specific to Lucas bashers/gushers -- plus, there isn't an article on bashing in a generic sense (gay bashing does exist and is cross linked from this article). <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a> is another inferred but not explicitly stated criticism of this article that is not without merit -- again this is not immediate cause for deletion but relevant to notability concerns. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisgoo_6d27.html" title="User:Mattisgoo">Mattisgoo</a> 03:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Indeed it is not. But a POV title and the fact that this is clearly a fork in an existing article <i>is</i> a reason.

</ul>
<p>Hi there. I'm PacifistPrime, the orginal writer of this article (although it has now been split and so heavily rewritten by others that it no longer strictly represents my original). I don't want to get into a protracted argument about this; you guys seem to be doing pretty well on your own. Just a few points:</p>
<p>-I agree with Mattisgoo and others that there are no real grounds for deleting this article. Much of the discussion here is the province of a NPOV dispute, for which this article already has a specific talk page in which these arguments have already been exhaustively discussed ad nauseum, and not been added to in some time. Furthermore, I think it should be quite obvious to everyone that the only reason this article is being discussed for deletion is because of the outrageously biased reaction of the first commentator at the top of this page. His long, vitriolic rant clearly demonstrates that he is utterly biased on this matter, is not familiar with the workings or purpose of Wikipedia, and most significantly, has entirely missed the point of the article. Which brings me to another thing...</p>
<p>-With all due respect to everyone, why do so many of you seem to fail to understand this simple point: DESCRIBING criticism of Lucas DOES NOT constitute IMPLICIT CRITICISM ITSELF?! This article (nor Fan Criticism of George Lucas which was split from it) is not, nor ever has been condoning, supporting, promoting or enacting Lucas bashing. It is DESCRIPTIVE, pure and simple. An article descirbing the KKK is not automatically a racist tract. Writing an article about America does not make the author pro or anti-American by defult. So, if you don't agree that this phenomenon exists (despite the considerable evidence to the contrary), that's fine, but PLEASE! Stop accusing the article, the title etc etc of having an anti-Lucas bias. In actual fact, this article isn't even ABOUT George Lucas, it's about other people's reactions to him.</p>
<p>I really hope this bickering will conclude soon. Don't we all have better things to do?</p>

Because of this, I think that it is important to have this article to put some insights and perspective to it (though the article does need work and attention). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 11:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disagree</b> (<b>Weak Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>). I think Folkspraak is a significant conlang (as far as conlangs go) and the article should be preserved. The project is quite old and has many adherents, and is successful as an inter-German auxlang. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 10:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please define "successful". Where are the dictionaries of, grammars of, self-study guides for, and published works written in this language? Where are this language's equivalents of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 067174559X</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0939785013</a>? Indeed, where are the primary source materials in this language? Where is this language's equivalent of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/eo" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/eo" rel="nofollow">this</a>&#160;? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When it comes to conlangs, "success" is rarely determined by speakership or publications. Folkspraak is well-known among conlangers, and fairly well appreciated. I can not argue against claims of "original research", as very little has been published (outside of vanity publication) on <b>most</b> conlangs, even well-known ones (such as Dr. Dirk Elzinga's "Tepa", which was considered one of the best 10 conlangs ever made at www.langmaker.com). If you must delete most of the article for original research, that may be unavoidable, but I think Folkspraak is a significant enough conlang to warrant an entry in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 00:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that definition of "success" is unrelated to the existence of any secondary source or even primary source materials, then it isn't an appropriate benchmark to use in determining inclusion in an encyclopaedia which <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">requires sources</a>. If this language <i>is</i> "well appreciated", then some <i>evidence</i> of this appreciation needs to be provided. If, for example, someone had written and published a formal paper documenting the failure of the inventors of this language to even agree on its grammar, then that would be evidence that could be provided. Indeed, that would be a secondary source from which an encyclopaedia article could be constructed. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that's one of the real snags, and why I'm not more vocal about keeping the article—the project isn't yet completely unified, and is far from finished (thus the several "dialects"). It's just one of the bigger "projects". However, I expect that if it were deleted it would resurface as a new article within several months. I understand the reasoning behind the VfD. I still think it'd be an article worth having around, but I do understand that I have little beyond my own experience and knowledge to support its notability. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 08:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

The GeoCities page contains a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrestomathy.html" title="Chrestomathy">chrestomathy</a> that contains 5 texts and a plea for more. I apply the same rationale as at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Interslurf_6e91.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Interslurf">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Interslurf</a>. The paucity of the chrestomathy indicates that no-one speaks or writes this made up language to any significant degree. Indeed, the article and the externally linked web sites tell us that no two people have yet fully agreed on what this language is, even. There are no printed dictionaries, grammars, <i>Teach Yourself</i> books, or other resources for it, and no printed works written in it. There appear to be no secondary source materials for this language at all. The article is unverifiable and original research. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Have you looked at the Yahoo! Group, and its contents? I fail to see how this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The alleged indication "that no-one speaks or writes this made up language to any significant degree" surprises me, considering that variants of the language are used regularly for communication in the discussion group. The paucity of the chrestomathy merely indicates that the GeoCities page in particular is dead. Again, cf. the Yahoo! Group. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 11:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Verifiability does not involve readers repeating primary research. If the only way for readers to verify the content of the article is for them to trawl through all of the messages in a discussion forum (which <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Bulletin_boards_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">are not considered to be reliable sources</a>, by the way) and piece together the history/grammar/vocabulary of the language from their contents, then the article is <i>not</i> verifiable. An encyclopaedia article synthesized from such messages is original research. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On a sidenote, I think applying the recommendation against bulletin boards on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to this case is a bit rash, considering that we're discussing a project developed entirely in such a medium. If we were to apply the cited guideline blindly, we would prevent ourselves from having articles on any notable Usenet personalities or newsgroups, to make another example. Anyhow, nobody needs to rummage through messages to verify anything here. Proposed grammars and dictionaries are in the "Files" section, and no original research is necessary. I hope that we can dismiss the verifiability issue, and discuss notability instead, since that, I suspect, is really the important issue. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 17:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. Notable Usenet personalities and newsgroups are documented independently of the raw postings in discussion fora. Usenet newsgroups have FAQs on <a href="http://faqs.org./" class="external free" title="http://faqs.org./" rel="nofollow">http://faqs.org./</a>, for example. And no, the verifiability issue has not gone away. Notice the word "proposed" in "proposed grammars and dictionaries". As I said before, no two people have yet fully agreed on what this language is, even. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Correct, the language is not unified, and all available grammars and dictionaries are proposals. How does this affect the verifiability of anything? I admit that my Usenet analogy was not satisfactory, but I am still of the opinion that the mentioned guideline does not warrant blind application to all subjects, and similarly that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although I would not call Folkspraak a unified language, it's a very interesting language group, and it has a very active community. True, there is little consencus and chances are low that a final language will emerge soon. But the discussions, the common interest for some form of inter-Germanic, is very much alive. The article needs to be edited to reflect this. I would go as far as to not call Folkspraak a language but a community which is interested in IAL's and Germanic languages. FYI: I'm the admin of the www.tidingkonien.com website, but I have no stake in the development of the Folkspraak language itself. -- Evert Mouw 10:10, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's true. I was a bit amazed when I saw this, because actually there are grammers, dictionaries, and so on. They can be found in the files section of the yahoo group.

<li>The existence of dictionaries, grammars, self-study guides and published works seems like a notability issue rather than a verifiability issue to me, as I've already implied above.

<ul>
<li>It's a verifiability issue when it comes to writing an article on a language. I pointed this out above. An encyclopaedia article cannot be written if there are no sources to verify it against. (An encyclopaedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, remember.) If there are no grammars for the language that have yet been agreed upon by people and published, an encyclopaedia article on the language cannot be written that gives a grammar for the language.

<li>As was mooted on the FS Yahoo! group, perhaps an article on Germanic-based IALs in general would be more appropriate? It could explain the issues people have had when designing such languages and compare them to each other. With regards FS dictionaries etc. there ARE dictionaries for individual 'dialects', which are thus just as valid as any created for one-man-band auxlangs IMHO, but there is no unified dictionary as there is indeed no unfied FS language as yet.<a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXipirho_2f16.html" title="User:Xipirho">Xipirho</a>

<li>Hey, Xipirho. this is Wakuran_Wakaran. I wondered if you'd like to delete the section about Middelsprake. I don't think it's particularly interesting, and Ingmar has moved on to Folkspraak now anyway. I haven't registered yet, so I don't want to delete the section myself. About the discussion, I agree that there is no standard form yet, but I fail to see how that counts as "unverifiable", mostly the info in the article is generally true, albeit slightly outdated. I agree in Eldkatt's comment that the information is verifiable, and that if something, it's the notability that matters.81.232.72.53 17:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi. With regards that section I certainly think it should be shortened a bit or the rest made longer so that there's not more about MS than FS, which there's getting close to being at the moment!&#160;:-) I'd like to ask Ingmar first though. With regards verifiability versus notability I agree, as you can see. - <a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXipirho_2f16.html" title="User:Xipirho">Xipirho</a> 17:59, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree to EldKatt -- Folkspraak is an umbrella term and as such not a one-man-thing. Also, I do see the general problem: that it is a running project in development, and as such does not have definite outcomes yet, nor independently published articles on it. It is a 'problem' that other conlangs also have. But the community itself, the plan behind it, the commonalities of intergermanic conlangs, and the relation to other family IALs, are interesting and hard enough to consider the Folkspraak project and the dialects existent, potential, notable, and for us to write about it. There is enough visible of it to see that it is not just a myth, nor that it will die a quick death. -- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 16:11, 4 January 2006 (UTC) (On the side, I do hope those Folspraakers will hurry the hell up with the finishing of their project)

<li><b>Keep</b>, most definitely! Folkspraak is very well-known, it has its own (rather large) Yahoo! group, numerous people speak it, and it is interesting for several reasons (its design principles, the fact that it is a collaborative project with quite some people involved, the fact that it has several "dialects" instead of one standardised form, just to mention a few). Sure, it is never going to be the IAL to end all IALs, but then, neither is Ido, or Interlingua, or Novial... No, Folkspraak is definitely a significant language; just imagine, it even survived an AfD in the German wikipedia <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:L%C3%B6schkandidaten/5._Mai_2005#Folkspraak_bleibt" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:L%C3%B6schkandidaten/5._Mai_2005#Folkspraak_bleibt" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which in general is not exactly tolerant towards constructed languages! Besides, it's easy to say "merge it into an article about Germanic conlangs", but the truth is that there is no such article yet, and I don't see it coming too soon.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Why are you saying that it is "nonsense" and that it does not exist when in fact a quick look at the pages the links point too shows a compiler and a bit of details on how it works. I agree that it is questionable if the article should be kept. But I think that you are voting for deletion for all the wrong reasons. As some of you state "attack" as the only reason you want it deleted. Doesn't that go against being npov? Should you not disregard that it mocks wikipedia and look at the other aspects of it?<small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 130.243.161.198 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.243.161.198_d7fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.243.161.198">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. Al-Azhar is an important Islamic university, and its rulings are taken very seriously.

<li>While this has nothing to do with systematic bias, but one could make the argument that every fatwa issued by Al-Azhar is important by virute of it being "an important Islamic university".

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wouldn't want to see an article for every fatwa, but this one, in which Shia Islam is recognised as a valid form of Islam by Sunni scholars is important.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sarah Ewart, since you asked, there are but two things I am unsure of the accuracy of - although I did not as such make either of them up. Firstly I am unsure as to the veracity of Hugo's mother's claim that restrictive Australian quarantine regulations made it impossible to import Hammy the Hampster - she may just have been breaking it gently to young Hugo that she was not paying for a cabin berth for Hammy. If someone cares to research what the quarantine regulations actually were, we can verify that. Secondly, I am not sure of the strict accuracy of calling farting a hobby. Hugo does fart an awful lot, but whether or not that consitutes a hobby may be, now that you mention it, debateable. Anyway, someone already removed that from the hobbies section, so it doesn't really matter.User:SunKing1 11.56, 1 January 2006</li>

<dd>So what you're saying is that if the content of the article were improved, and if it focused on, say, the claims that there have been fascist or neo-fascist movements in the US, or the use of "fascism" as an epithet in American political discourse, or the recurrent claims that political leaders like <a href="../../../h/u/e/Huey_Long_16fe.html" title="Huey Long">Huey Long</a> were fascist, you would vote to keep?

<dd>Personally I think a clean up and expansion of the United States section of the Neo-Fascism article would be a better start, once that section gets too long them you fork it out leaving a main article link on the Neo-Fascism page. By doing that, you would get more editors involved since there seens to be a group that actively works on the fascism articles on that page. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 15:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>An Internet search shows that the group is well known and performs widely in Filipino and Asian Pacific American cultural festivals, and that it is one of the more active and well regarded hip hop groups in the Filipino American hip hop subculture (probably the third most important hip hop subculture in the U.S. after African American and Puerto Rican American). Further, the group's work frequently appears in Filipino and Asian Pacific American print and radio media. Has also toured throughout the U.S. and Canada. From WP:Music:

<li><b>Keep</b> the article on the Native Guns should not be deleted on the grounds that they are a not only a staple in current Filipino-American hip-hop culture, but of independent (indie) hip-hop music and are also well known activists for human/Asian Pacific American rights. They are known within that community and yes while they are NOT on allmusic.com, so aren't Francis Magalona, or Andrew E. who's impact in the history of Philipppine-based Filipino hip-hop cannot be disputed. Neither are even "Asin" or Florante who are national stars and heroes and whos anti-Marcos songs such as "Upuan" and "Balita" played a big role in the inspiring the famous 1986 EDSA People's Power Revolution and also have had their songs along with Freddie Aguilar translated into more than 20 languages and have become hit songs in other countries other than the Philippines. What these artists meant to Philippine-based hip-hop and rock then is exactly what the Native Guns mean to the Filipino-American hip-hop community now. It should also be noted that the Native Guns' Kiwi, (born Jack DeJesus) went to high school with the world famous Black Eyed Peas' Apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda) as well as Will.i.am and was one of the influences young Allan had upon moving here from the Philippines. Furthermore the Native Guns have been featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles, and were named one of L.A.'s "Top 10 Most Intriguing Bands" by the L.A. Alternative Press. Links:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hey this is Kiwi of the Native Guns. i just found out about all this recently, so bear with me. anyway, as far as the article, yes there's some cut-n-paste, but whatever's written about us looks satisfactory. not sure how else to go about this. we're also mentioned in an article on wikipedia regarding filipino hip hop [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy_hip_hop" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy_hip_hop" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>]. i can clean it up if need be, but for the most part, it's accurate. if you need me to add or clarify anything let me know groundworkmusic@yahoo.com. as far as whether or not we're 'worthy' of being on here well that's not my decision but i think the track record speaks for itself. sorry if i didn't follow the format, i never even heard of wikipedia until now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.131.4.166 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.131.4.166_a924.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.131.4.166">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Some people make bad-faith copyright violation nominations, in order to do an end run around the {afd} procedure. An article I started was on the receiving end of someone willing to take advantage of the three week long backlog in addressing copy-vios. So I checked this assertion. The copy-vio assertion is solid. I went back to the beginning of the article, to see whether rhe article could be saved by reeling back to an earlier version that was not a copy-vio. The very first contributor's version incorporated material from its external links.
<ul>
<li>This does not mean there should be no article about this band. If the original author of the material on the myspace web-pages that has been incorporated into this article releases it under an appropriate liscence, or puts their material in the public domain, the copy-vio concern goes away... -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 22:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As Ali Sina says himself, his credentials are not relevant to the truthfulness of his claims. And these claims are true. And truth should be voiced. When Muslim countries will start to treat religious minorities as it should be, there could be a talk about "Islamophobia". For now, it is only the "Kafirophobia" that is strongly present. If there is an article about Islamophobia here, there should be one about Kafirophobia as well. Also, Mr. Sceptre should know that "best friends" cannot change Quran and Ahadith.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ali Sina is notable enough at least for thousands of sites that mention his name and quote him. He has also been interviewed in radios. In no place he has said Ali Sina is a pseudonym. This is something Wikipedians have written about him and he has neither confirmed it nor denied it. <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/sina51227p2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/sina51227p2.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Despite that encyclopaedias cover totally imaginary personages including mythological figures. The fact that a personage is imaginary is not reason for him not to be reported. There is more evidence that Ali Sina exists as a real person than there is for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaxagoras.html" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclitus.html" title="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximenes.html" title="Anaximenes">Anaximenes</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">Democritus</a>. These ancient philosophers are only mentioned by Plato and there is not even a book left from them. All it takes to dismiss their existence is to doubt Plato and yet no sane person would do such thing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let us face the truth. All these vilifications and belittling of Ali Sina are motivated by religious hatred. It is basically the same editors who constantly censored anything I wrote on Islam who are now claiming this Article should be deleted. This is another attempt to censorship and silencing the views contrary to Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia has articles about less notable persons than Ali Sina. There is no pandemonium about deleting them because those people do not criticize Islam. This commotion is about Islam and not about Ali Sina. It just shows the intolerance of Muslims to even acknowledge the existence of apostates and critics of Islam. Sadly these people come here with a religious agenda and not to promote knowledge and impartiality. Denying this fact, because it may offend these people is like hiding our heads in the sand and not willing to see the obvious. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> Jan 5, 2006 23:16</dd>

<dd>Firstly, mythical figures are noted as mythical. I really don't think you want us saying Ali Sina is mythical. There is also tons of literature written about Zeus — this is not true about Ali Sina. Also, it's not because he is an ex-Muslim. The Ibn Warraq article is not up for deletion because just about no one thinks he is not notable. So, we shouldn't exactly oversimplify this to being Muslims against non-Muslims. My personal opinion is that a lot of people are voting delete because this article has attracted loads of anons and unfortunately there have been calls on the FFI forums to come here and edit... well, when people come to get into edit wars on an article that is most definitely not necessarily encyclopedic then people will want to delete it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 05:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Ali Sina is not nearly notable enough to be a necessary entity for this encyclopedia. However, this is wikipedia and we are not paper. We have pages for minor porn stars, really non-notable albums and I'm sure I could dig out other articles. Ali Sina is about on that level. The only thing that makes him different is that he has an internet following and that makes his article prone to edit wars.

<dd>Rudra, I'm just not very computer-literate, I thought I did sign my comment if not my user name is (م). My intention is not to censor anyone. My objection to this racist's entry are basic. First, I don't know how popular this "guy" is, but the first time I heard about him was on wikipedia. His name was constantly thrown around by someone on the Islam discussion board. That user has since been blocked for his racist/hatefilled/islamphobic comments (Gren I think you know who I am reffering to&#160;;). Hence, I do not want wikipedia to be used as a platform for "his" hatred. The second reason has to do with "his" identity. I know that bios are done on everone, good or evil. But no one knows who this "man" is. He could be one person, he could be an entire hate group. Wikipedia can not rely on this idiot's words for its main source. By the way Kwnl I wonder if the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment realizes that this bigot(s) main, and stated, purpose is to eliminate all muslims from off the face of the Earth.م 06:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your personal opinion that this person is a "bigot" does not make him any more or less notable.--Pecher 09:27, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not just <i>my</i> personal opinion, but let that pass. If this was a known, credible person, or if the column were sindicated in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> I'd have no problemwith it. But we don't know who "Ali Sina" is; all we know is that there is a website (which appears to me to fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but that is debatable since there is some evidence of external coverage). Since "Ali Sina" is not known to be a real person, this is really covering the website (really more of a blog) not the person. I don't think either the website or the fake "Ali Sina" persona is notable. There is precious little which can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. There is, after all, no world shortage of <s>bigots</s> opinionated cowards (if you prefer), we don't need to cover them all just for fear of offending some islamophobes. Many of the arguments here (not yours) seem to be based on "X has no right to say this" or "we may not prevent X from saying this" - that's a diversion. This is not about the opinions or their merit, it's about the article and its subject. In my opinion this bigot is no different from all the other bigots pouring out hate speech on the Internet. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 16:25, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Quick Explanation - Discussion on <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">Railfan</a> suggests moving the jargon section, was either UK or US based I started moving the UK stuff to that article and made a link for a future US one, the aim being to reduce the overall size of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">Railfan</a>--<a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnotayokel_530e.html" title="User:Enotayokel">Enotayokel</a> 12:55, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> As stated above, it's a subarticle of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">railfan</a> because the list was getting too long to remain in the article itself.

<li>Ok, how about this: Wikipedia is not a democracy, and we don't determine things by voting. We attempt, though discussion, to reach a meaningful and rational consensus. By fully explaining your reasons for supporting a particular course of action, you not only demonstrate your respect for the other parties invovled in the discussion but may sway those whose opinions do not match your own.

Fiona Sit's achievements boggle the mind. She is a supremely talented international recording star. We should all send a letter of thanks to the editor who brought Fiona to our attention. I am also tired of the consistent bias demonstrated against Asian pop stars. The abuse of CSD is a further cause for concern.

<p>I came across this in a review of edits by a particular user. This was previously AfDd <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Francis_Muir_5bfa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Francis Muir">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Francis Muir</a>, with a slew of suspicious-looking anon votes. It was relisted for further consideration, and several editors I know voted delete (and one or two I also know to be genuine voted keep). The debate appears to me to have been curtailed amid misunderstandings regarding relations between two named users, now subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>In the mean time, my investigation of this article's subject suggests he is not actually that notable. A few academic publications years ago (list is very short by academic standards) fewer Usenet posts than me by quite a large margin, and not that many rlevant Google hits either.</p>
<p>Since the last vote seems to have been overshadowed by arguments re sockpuppetry and individual users' good or bad faith, I'd like to submit this for a second consideration, <i>on the merits of the subject</i>. Apologies to anyone who finds this objectionable, my motives are simply to have a proepr, clean discussion so that it is either klept or deleted based on the <i>content and the subject</i>, which (to my admittedly rather jaundiced eye) is not what happened last time. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 15:37, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisheva_Federman_3580.html" title="Elisheva Federman">Elisheva Federman</a> contains a picture from an unknown source, an introduction with virtually no information (the wife of... continues to be active) and an interview from the Israeli daily <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maariv.html" title="Maariv">Maariv</a>. The inclusion of the interview in Wikipedia and perhaps also the picture seems to be a serious breach of copyright law.

<li>I've removed the interview, which certainly isn't fair use here. This leaves a three-sentence substub that may or may be deleteworthy; I have no opinion on the matter. If kept, the article's history will need to be deleted to remove the copyvio, which extends back to the first revision.

It appears to me that some people are confusing the concepts of encyclopedic value and news-worthiness. Many topics make the news, even at a national scale, that have little or no encyclopedic merit. In my opinion, the Saugeen stripper made the news simply because the story was sensational, rather than the story having any social value.

<li><b>Keep keep keep</b>. All of the sources are legit. It is a legitimate pop culture occurence that has received tons of national and international press. This deserves an entry, absolutely and without question. There may be moral questions, but those who have a problem with it can cite nothing other than personal feelings for the subject. Should we start allowing subjects of wikipedia articles based on true events determine what is said here? This is a SOURCE for information based on real happenings!! ... clearly, those who are pushing most ardently for the removal of the page are doing so based not in any violation of wikipedia policy, or lack of relevance in information, but rather due to personal relationships with the apparent subject of the article. Deletion for these reasons and these reasons alone is a slippery slope. THAT to be seems to be the most dangerous precedent of all. That said, I will defer to the decision of the admin, but I strongly believe deletion would be wrong.<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 19:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The story is more the mainstream propogation of the story, and how quickly that happened (granted over 2 months after the event), the actual events are a footnote compared to that, furthermore, reporting on the speed of how quickly a story spreads, in the mainstream media, is effectively giving the story a very large booster shot, which in my oppinion makes it a conflict of interest, as then the media sources are directly involved in the story on which they are repeating.

<li>To the admins, when making your final call, I ask that you consider the that a number of those on the delete side seem to have an agenda other than providing Wikipedians with information. IF the story is legit, and has spawned national and internation interest, and has spread onto over 22,000 websites, then it IS A STORY and it belongs here for people to know about. As of now, no real names are used, and while I think that it would be a valid piece of information to the article, the fact is, it can stay that way if needed. But to keep the story off of the pages here for some arbitrary moral reasons that fly in the face of the provision of information is not the answer.<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 01:25, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm wondering, other than the fact that you made the article, what is your stake in this? Do you really believe that wikipedia must educate the world about how some nameless girl stripped for a room full of guys one night in unversity? Why is this worth reading? If you live in saugeen I'd love to sit you down and ask you in person why you feel it is so completely important that you educate the masses on exactly what happened that night in that room. And if you don't live in saugeen, why is this so important to you? It would just be some drama that happened "over there" at the UWO. I knew far more about the story than is posted in the article <b>the day after it happened</b> and you don't see me vehemently defending the article I created about the incident. I'm sure I've said this before, cause I think it's pretty catchy and illustrates the point very well, but please, show her the respect that she (arguably) didn't show herself that night and just let it go. I really have nothing else to add. I sincerely hope that you see where I'm coming from with this. -<a href="../../../o/x/x/User%7EOxxiox_0825.html" title="User:Oxxiox">Oxxiox</a> 01:13, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I too am wondering about Tokyojoe2002's fervor on this topic, as well as those who are fervently arguing for its deletion.

I certainly think it qualifies as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> but I don't understand all the emotion surrounding it.

I suspect this is a <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>. The reference for Martin Halderson is "<i>Copenhagen Cathedral Guidebook</i>, 2003", but the <a href="https://rex.kb.dk" class="external text" title="https://rex.kb.dk" rel="nofollow">catalogue</a> of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_Royal_Library_ccef.html" title="Danish Royal Library">Danish Royal Library</a> finds no book with that title, which makes the reference either false or at least (if it is an obscure brochure) useless for verification purposes. I can't find either this bishop or Martin Halderson in <i><a href="http://runeberg.org/dbl/" class="external text" title="http://runeberg.org/dbl/" rel="nofollow">Dansk Biografisk Lexikon</a></i>, the Danish National Dictionary of Biography (the link goes to a digitized 19th c. edition, but the age of the edition shouldn't matter in this case).

<li>Having trouble verifying this one. And I'm not sure I believe in the "Copenhagen Cathedral Guidebook"-- apparently the present cathedral in Copenhagen was built in the 19th century.

There were 3 subsequent keep votes (one as NO REDIRECT) signed by Jhyancey, those were discarded. All IP address votes were discarded.

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> Patent Jock is a real term, and is not a "gross hoax" as asserted by Edcolins. Indeed, I first learned of this term while studying law several years ago. Please also see previous deletion attempt for evidence of usage. As for notability, please re-read this page and note that "widespread usage" is not required for so-called notability. For example, I know nothing about "Action Directe", but it received a wiki entry (See: <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a>). This means that just because one does not know about a wiki entry that it should be slated for deletion. As for the results of a internet search, this means nothing. Just because the results of an internet search engine does not produce a plethora of results, does not mean the term is not well-known. It just means that google does not list a page using this term. Also, no "burden" is required under wiki deletion policy and if one is required, it was satisfied in previous deletion attempt. Jhyancey 19:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)]]</li>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b> Never heard of such a term? How many of you have heard of omphaloskepsis (meditation while gazing at one's navel), gamp (a large umbrella), ferruminate (to unite; solder), effulgent (shining brightly), pelmatogram (a footprint), jentacular (pertaining to breakfast), ecophobia (fear of home), ultrafidian (ultracredulous; extremely gullible), karimption (a crown, a mass), or savate (fighting with the feet). I guess if we delete this term, then we should delete many other words and phrases that people have "never heard of" from older dictionaries and encyclopedias. Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think any of us are omniscient enough to know everything about everything. We should be asking patent agents and patent attorneys whether they have heard or use the term, not whether Joe Schmoe off the street has heard of the term. --Jfredericks 21:26, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That page (as I explained to the other puppet) doesn't provide enough context to verify anything about the phrase 'patent jock'. If I were to guess I would say you got lucky that some law firm's website happened to have that phrase indexed by Google. Another idea is you have a conflict of interest in having your phrase be "more official" since the registration of patentjock.com on 2004-06-22.

<li>The article cites no sources. I, like two of the editors in the original AFD discussion, can find no sources. The article's author, when asked for sources, points to a news report that uses <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jock" class="extiw" title="wikt:jock">jock</a> colloquially, and that provides nothing whatsoever to support any part of this article; and to an empty web site that appears to be a site for a patent attorney to advertise xyr services under the trade name of "Patent Jock" (notice "Our Rates"). Given that, and the promotional tone of the article, it seems that this article's purpose is to mis-use Wikipedia as an advertising platform for a patent attorney who styles himself a "patent jock". The article is unverifiable, original research, and an apparent advertisement. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:47, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While the discussion has been interesting, puppets aside, I repeat my earlier posting that I am familiar with this term. I don't know about the rest of the wikipedia users, but I believe the strength of wikipedia is to provide <b>everyone</b> with descriptions of terms that are not only common, but also those that may be somewhat rare and used in certain circles. Otherwise, this tool is useless and fails. I may not be familiar with what terms an astronaut or garbage man uses, but I do know patents. I have worked in Boston, Atlanta, Los Angeles and New York. In each of these locations I have heard patent practitioners use this term in same fashion as the description provides. Just because a websearch provides minimal sources should only be A factor in deciding if this term is a neologism. Baker Botts is a reputable and well-known patent powerhouse, and they used this term in 2002. And I find that just because the author failed to define the term "patent jock" in his article to be a ridiculous argument. One skilled in the art, ahhm...a patent jock, understands this use usage as should a lay reader. I find jyancey to be on point, as is Jfredericks.

<dd>Patent attorneys/agents can generally recite portions of patent law from memory.</dd>
<dd>Patent attorneys/agents have historically been in high demand by both government and private industry.</dd>
<dd>Patent attorney/agents come from diverse backgrounds. Most learn their skills from working under the guidance of more senior practitioners. Most also take formal training courses, such as those provided by the Franklin Pierce Law Center.</dd>

For all of you urging deletion on this article, please see previous post and in particular read the baker botts cited article. (See it here: <a href="http://www.bakerbotts.com/9/infocenter/publications/Detail.aspx?id=98609148-a306-4faa-8b42-1f0e376f15d0" class="external free" title="http://www.bakerbotts.com/9/infocenter/publications/Detail.aspx?id=98609148-a306-4faa-8b42-1f0e376f15d0" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakerbotts.com/9/infocenter/publications/Detail.aspx?id=98609148-a306-4faa-8b42-1f0e376f15d0</a>) Jhyancey 12:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the reference to the Baker Botts article and also I thank you for the initial effort you put in composing this article. As someone who has had his own articles marked for deletion, I understand the initial anger of having your efforts tagged as perhaps being “not worthy” of inclusion in Wikipedia. It appears to me that you’ve put a good faith effort into this article in an attempt to make Wikipedia more useful to the general public.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That’s one of the reasons I’m recommending that “patent jock” be a redirect to patent attorney. At least according to the Baker Botts article, it is a term that’s used as slang for at least patent attorney/agent or perhaps any other person with an interest in patents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article, for example, states:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>While the nation’s patent jocks eagerly await the Court’s decision in Festo, the copyright folks can start clearing space on their fall calendars for Eldred v. Ashcroft (01-618)…</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It appears that “patent jocks” is used as slang for patent attorneys/agents just as “copyright folks” is used as slang for attorneys specializing in copyright law.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>NO REDIRECT</b> You "deletionists" just do not understand. I will re-post patent jock again in the future after preparing additional support to satisfy the desire and craving to remove from wiki a useful entry. For those of you supporting Keep and Redirect, thank you very much, but please take note that only a select few patent attorneys ever make it too Patent Jock status. It is not a slang term, rather it is the highest level of competency all patent attorneys strive for. I will keep entry alive in my sandbox for those who wish to contribute to this useful entry.

I'm sorry, counselor, but you just haven't made the case that your term is really that notable or distinguishable from other classes of patent attorneys; all you've done so far is (increasingly heatedly) assert that.

<li>Yo "Just zis", the wiki cause should not be about winning or losing and fighting over entries. If the "deletionists" do not take the time to understand the term and assert it's a "gross hoax" then so be it. The purpose of the entry was to edify you and every other wiki user about Patent Jocks. Have you ever heard of Judge Giles Rich, P.F. Federico, Herbert Schwartz, The Telephone Cases, or Doctrine of Equivalents? Patent Jocks know much about these terms. Thus, the purpose of this entry.

<li><b>Delete - No Redirect</b> I'm changing my vote slightly to "Delete - No Redirect". I maintain "delete" since I've not seen a preponderance of evidence to indicate that "patent jock" is either a formal or informal designation that is commonly aspired to by registered US patent agents or attorneys or the patent agents or attorneys of any other jurdisdiction. I change my vote from redirect to "no redirect" in respect for the original author's assertion that "patent jock" is not slang for patent attorney. --<a href="../../../n/o/w/User%7ENowa_1a25.html" title="User:Nowa">Nowa</a> 18:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also was temporarily inclined to change my vote to "Redirect" since it appeared patent jock(ey) might be slang for patent attorney. We delete articles as "non-notable neologism" every day which are far more verifiable and less vanity than this. I maintain my Delete vote and recommend the author of the article copy it to his user page until he can build a credible case for the phrase. If the author is a lawyer, or knows lawyers, it should be easy to build a credible case and survive AFD next time. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <span class="user-sig-date"><small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">12-31</a>&#160;00:10<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></span></i></span></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This lengthy discussion has provoked far more heat than light, but it seems clear to me that even if the phrase is used, it is not of sufficient currency to merit its own article, and in the single case presented as evidence of its existence, it could be an on-the-spot invention by newswriters. And there are enough sockpuppets here to fill a locker room. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 04:11, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak/Delete</b> This wiki term is less about patents and more about the term "jock." I'm a patent attorney, and I have heard the term used in conversation, but only in the same way one would call a Washington staffer a "policy wonk," i.e., someone who's really into a particular intellectual subject, and measures his prowess according to their knowledge in that field. List under "jock"? --Phlaemenbicz <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/2/2E/User%7E12.4.231.134.html" title="User:12.4.231.134">12.4.231.134</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.4.231.134_fafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.4.231.134">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>No vote</b> This link was posted to a patent law board, presumably to draw support for the article. However, patent attorneys are generally too smart to bother with such things as the foolishness that is the wikipedia community. Baseless accusations of being socks is second only to baseless accusations of POV. Baseless accusations of being a hoax is a new one to me, but I gave up on this place a long, long time ago. Patent attorneys have both law degrees and technical degrees. As such, they tend to adopt techie terms -- such as "jock" (see <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg443.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg443.txt" rel="nofollow">the jargon file</a>. That being said, the article, in its current form, is crap. Mentioning Franklin Pierce is pure self-promotion as it isn't even one of the top three, as reported by <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/law/brief/lawsp05_brief.php" class="external text" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/law/brief/lawsp05_brief.php" rel="nofollow">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>. Not all patent attorneys are jocks, only the ones who (1) know caselaw in and out, (2) have a huge patent grant rate, and (3) deal primarily in patent preparation. I have never heard the term applied to a litigator, as stated in the article. Patent prosecuters (of which I am one) are geeks and patent jocks are the geekiest of the geeks. But what do I know, I'm merely a POV sock perpetrating a hoax. 71.129.147.6 00:11, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey there -- I authored the article. I decided to write the piece when I found an article on <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_L._Nancy_63ef.html" title="Ted L. Nancy">Ted L. Nancy</a>, who is rumored to really be Jerry Seinfeld. This author, done in the same format of the Nancy books, down to the Seinfeld foreward, I thought should be included as well as it part of the "series" of books which are already a part of Wikipedia (i.e., there is an entry on the author of the first three books in the series, so I thought an entry on the author of the fourth supposedly entry should also be included). I will let the moderators decide, as I agree that Broth -- assuming its not a pen name for Seinfeld or someone else -- is not noteable. However, I always thought that obscure entries are what seperates Wikipedia from other online reference sources. Thanks for listening! --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 19:13, 29 December 2005 (UTC) Oh, and I just updated the article with links from Variety noting that Broth is pending a forthcoming animated series based on this book. At some point, whether now or when the cartoon is released, there is going to have to be an article on Broth. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 20:22, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pdoyd04, I appreciate your feedback and have reviewed the policy referenced in your deletion recommendation. However, the "Not A Crystal Ball" policy states, "It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, provided that discussion is properly referenced.". I have properly referrenced the link to Seinfeld promoting the animated series, as well as referrenced the link stating that Broth has earned a "six figure deal" and is writing the pilot. As well, the link is to Variety, which is a reputable source and not a fan listing. As such, respectfully, I disagree that the "Not A Crystal Ball" argument would apply in this situation.--<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 22:09, 29 December 2005 (UTC) Further, I wish to reference <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, which states that a living author could be included if "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more". As such, Ed Broth would qualify as notable, and the article should remain. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 22:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> for the time being&#160;: Looking for precedence, I looked around in the articles about the four metros and apart from the eight listed in Category:Medical_colleges_in_India I couldn't find any other hospitals. Even in Chennai, there are bigger and more important hospitals - Madras Medical Mission, Vijaya, Malar, Apollo, RMC Porur etc none of which seem to have articles about them. For articles about places, there is an unwritten rule that if the real is place is real, it can have an article. Unless there is some such convention, I don't know why this should be kept. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Talk</a> 18:15, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sometimes the argument "articles less-notable-than-this are kept" is an argument to keep, and sometimes "articles more-notable-than-this have been deleted" is an argument to delete, but I don't see how "articles more-notable-than-this haven't yet been created" is an argument to delete. If you know about those hospitals, why not create articles for them? <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <span class="user-sig-date"><small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">12-31</a>&#160;00:19<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></span></i></span></li>

<li>My personal opinion is that except MMM (who pioneered heart transplant in India and is headed by the finest heart surgeon in South Asia) none of the others are significant enough to deserve an article.

<p>The Ethiopian monarchy was deposed in 1975. Although Ethiopia has gone through various upheavals and changes of regime since then I am not aware that the monarchy seems likely to make a comeback. There are indeed "line of succession" articles for several other countries. However as far as I am aware they are all for reigning monarchies, this is the only one we have for a deposed monarchy. There are pretenders to the thrones of Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, and probably a few other countries, should we have articles on all these lines of succession? The existence of a pretender to the Ethiopian throne is just about notable, but not this level of detail.</p>
<p>Also, this article is not sourced. It says that there are complex rules governing the succession to the Ethiopian throne, which could easily lead to disputes about who is the "legitimate" claimant. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 19:33, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ok guess this article is not suitable content? I thought that since I saw other articles about surnames on Wikipedia such as <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_%28surname%29.html" title="Smith (surname)">Smith (surname)</a> that such information would be useful. To answer Quarl, nothing makes the Skinner surname more notable than others but I thought Wikipedia would want to gather history and info on all surnames? I guess I should stop working on the article since it appears it will just be deleted anyway. Sorry. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_R._Skinner_e5e0.html" title="User:James R.

<li>I understand now. I will move the approproate content over to the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Skinner" class="extiw" title="wikt:Skinner">Skinner</a> article under etymology. Not sure where the right place for the crest info is? I am a bit confused though as to why <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_MacGregor_cc22.html" title="Clan MacGregor">Clan MacGregor</a> is appropriate for Wikipedia given that Skinner isn't? Is this based on notability?
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_clan.html" title="Scottish clan">Scottish clan</a> is not the same thing as a simple group of people who just happen to share a family name. See our article for details. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:25, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To whom does this <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a> actually belong? The article gives the impression that the arms belong to all people by the name of Skinner, but this must obviously be wrong; Skinner is, after all, not an uncommon nam. I assume all persons of this name do not belong to the same family and do not have the right to the same arms. (You also need to be clear about the distinction between a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crest.html" title="Crest">crest</a> and a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a>.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:36, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think there should be an article about <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thread_necromancy.html" title="Thread necromancy">thread necromancy</a> on Internet fora. For starts, <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necro.html" title="Necro">necro</a> should be turned into disambig page, not about some obscure rapper. However, the term "necro poster" is probably quite rare, because the poster who does nothing but necroing old threads must be really bored... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:18, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> A necro poster is a nowadays internet phenemom like the Internet troll which got a page in Wikipedia, too. I made this page because i came across the term necro poster during browsing a forum. I didn't know what that means and my first stop to search for that term was Wikipedia. Here it was nowhere to found, but after using Google and browsing through douzens of Websites i had my explanation. Afterwards i made this page to help people who come across this term and think Wikipedia could help them. SixthHokage 15:31, 26 December 2005 (GMT+1)</li>

<li><b>Qualified</b> Ochieng's appearances on WBZ radio have proved popular over the years. He has met the qualifications to be part of Rotten Tomatoes, MovieEye, SF Crowsnest, etc. Frank's reviews are witty and informative, and he's well-respected amongst</li>
</ul>
<p>other film critics. As someone who has interviewed him numerous times on my own radio show (WMWM Salem MA), I can testify his knowledge and insights on film and television media do qualify him for WP inclusion. (raccoonradio)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Qualified</b> Frank Ochieng in my opinion deserves to be part of Wikipedia. He has been a major contributor to many on-line, and various print publications over the years as expressed (above). I have been reading Mr. Ochieng's work over many years and there are few writers like him in-depth, informative, and more than qualified to be part of your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can also say this as well because of his numerous appearances on my TV interview program 'A Time To Review' on <a href="http://www.batv.org" class="external text" title="http://www.batv.org" rel="nofollow">Brookline Access Television</a>. He is a great writer and he has proven this because I have worked with him personally (<b>The Voicemakers</b>). Daniel Berman, Newton Magazine</p>

<li>The book reporting the deathbed confession wasn't published for 20 years after the confession, if I'm following everything correctly.

<li>From what I can tell, the confession was published shortly after Valance's death in 1848. <a href="http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/aEmery%22+%22John/aemery+john/1%2C9%2C13%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=aemery+john+l&amp;1%2C1%2C" class="external autonumber" title="http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/aEmery%22+%22John/aemery+john/1%2C9%2C13%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=aemery+john+l&amp;1%2C1%2C" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>. It has since become part of the case, discussed in later pamphlets, newspapers and every book on Morgan that I checked. It is part of the historical record surrounding the Morgan case and can not be ignored. Of course, that does not mean that the confession was true and/or even took place. That is a completely different problem. But Valance should be mentioned on the Morgan page -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:14, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

There are some areas where this tendancy has been a problem with regards to wikipedia articles.

<li>At the very least you would have that it is a future book by Dan Brown, which is already enough for an article that will grow in the future. Secondly, it should be pointed out that much of the speculation is not Wikipedians speculating, but speculation that has already been recorded elsewhere, and hence is verifiable. Finally, there are many facts, the relation to Kryptos is fact (the coords of Kryptos were on the dust jacket of his previous book), the web quest is all fact as it comes from the publishers website, etc. Whether these relate to <i>The Solomon Key</i> is debatable, but outside sources have made the connection, not Wikipedians speculating. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 00:37, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>None of that is "fact". It's pure media hype generated for something that doesn't even exist, yet. I see no reason how Wikipedians should report on this in a NPOV-manner suitable for an encyclopedia. And no, you would not have at the very least the "fact" that the book <i>will</i> be out in 2006 because you don't know it will be. It might be, but then again, it might be not. It's just a plan. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerofoks_be6e.html" title="User:Zerofoks">zerofoks</a> 00:52, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I never said anything about 2006, I said it is a future book by Dan Brown. The term "future book" obviously doesn't mean that the book is sure to come out, as no on can predict the future, Dan Brown could die suddenly and the book would not get published, but right now he is alive and his intention is to publish the book in the future. The publisher may be trying to hype the book with a Web Quest, but it is still a fact that a Web Quest existed. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 01:04, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article is not speculation itself but a record of the speculation of others. I imagine that the book will be published whether or not Dan Brown is alive to see it. In the event of its non-appearance, the content of the article can refer to the book and media hype in a neutral way. --&#160;<a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title="UK"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="UK" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 01:17, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
