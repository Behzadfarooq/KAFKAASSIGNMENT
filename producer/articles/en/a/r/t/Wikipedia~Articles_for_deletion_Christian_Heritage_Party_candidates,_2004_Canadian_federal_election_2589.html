<li><b>Keep</b> While I <i>strongly</i> feel that individual minor party candidates don't deserve their own articles, it is a good idea for an encyclopedic type production such as Wiki to keep a list of former candidates.

<li><b>Keep both</b>.

<li>This whole idea was first proposed <i>by AFD'</i> as a solution to a very real and otherwise unresolvable debate. It's not an ideal solution, I grant, but it's the only way anybody's found to date to balance a very real and legitimate difference of opinion on the notability of electoral candidates. So, considering that this approach was AFD's idea to begin with, <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as status quo compromise. This 'List of...' article is a proactive alternative to individual candidate pages that spring up every election. Theoretically (in my mergist fantasy), all candidates get a redirect page to this kind of list page (or, more practically, as it is practised, all candidates get merged/redirected to such a page once someone creates an article on them). This page solves some rather annoying things, like endless afds on electoral candidates who just want the free ad space and get it for at least the 5 days the afd takes (hint: don't take it to afd, just merge/redirect it to the list pages) and a one-stop shop to monitor for abusive or peacock descriptions of the candidate (opposed to monitoring hundreds of pages during that grace period candidates are normally given during an election). This topic had a centralized discussion here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>; and this proposal came up here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html#A_mergist.27s_solution" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates#A mergist's solution</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 07:01, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not a solution since we just keep the (non-)information somewhere else! What does it matter which title you put it under? If we get a bunch of politico-vanity-adverts every election, then that's fine. Delete them every election. I do not see, like Steve block below, that that discussion has any particular 'consensus' so strong as to overrule ordinary notability standards and to justify a dismissal of this entire AfD on the basis of it, as some seem to be suggesting. -194.247.247.60 19:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not a "solution" to the problem you are posing, but it is a solution to the problem posed at the centralized discussion. This is an unofficial compromise, not a 'concensus' that emerged from centralized discussion (it never went to a straw poll). The reason the title matters is because it is much easier to deal with one article than a dozen. These are just little bios that illustrate what kind of people are running for these parties. They are not full-blown biographies that require hours of research. One of the reasons the centralized discussion occured was because the afd process was not working, some were <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Simon_Strelchik_2025.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik">kept</a>, some <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cindy-Lee_Robinson_a889.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cindy-Lee Robinson">deleted</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Kenneth+Montgomery+Keillor" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Kenneth+Montgomery+Keillor" rel="nofollow">(some repeatedly)</a> but most ended with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Niki_Ashton_8e1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Niki Ashton">'no concensus'.</a> --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 01:29, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not convinced, reading <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>, that this compromise has any more consensus than any other. I'm also not sure we need seperate lists for each party, when they are of these lengths. I think I'd be inclined to keep merging these lists to a point where they aren't unwieldy and aren't potential forks and aren't granting undue balance. On the last point, do the major parties <b>also</b> have lists of their failed candidates? If not, we are creating articles on an undue balance basis. At the moment, <b>delete</b>. I could see a value in Candidates in the 2004 Canadian federal election, but we're not debating that here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 07:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems totally appropriate to me.

<ul>
<li>How does keeping them get rid of them? Why do we need a place for below-average losers? One article per party that is actually relevant to the world outside their pub crew, I can understand. But an article just for signing a form once? That's a bit much. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm at a loss why a party that got way way less than 1% overall (yes, individual ridings varied but they competed in what, 15 ridings tops???) needs an article about a particular election outcome. I think merging this stuff with the main party article is the way to go. To those that cite other party articles, as examples that it should be done this way, I suggest perhaps that other minor party articles need the same merging/purging treatment too. Nothing much more could ever be said here, could it? As much as it pains me to do so, given my extreme detestation for Mr. Brenneman and his deletionist ways (KIDDING!) I must suggest that the right thing to do here is <b>Merge with redirect</b>... <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as irrelevant to the local community, the national community, the world community, the election, the other candidates in the election and as a grouping together of a whole bunch of utterly non-notable bios, each of which would be a near-speedy candidate if it weren't masquerading as an election result. There is little to no information in these articles that is informative of politics and there is no reason to spend time writing about a collection of literal losers. Losing by a stonkingly huge amount is something that Joe Anybody can do without even leaving their bedroom: literally. Add a passing mention to a main article or two, or a table of percentages somewhere. No need for a full-blown merge and redirect. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I did. And I imagine my comment sounds quite harsh to the author of the article. But really, <i>did</i> they have any impact on any of the things I mentioned in my first sentence? Are they likely ever too? Did they even get any significant media coverage, apart from some presumable stuff about being a fringe party (or whatever the terminology appropriately is)? Is the detailed info on the candidates actually of connection to anything other than this article? If you cut that out, at least we'd get a more focussed article. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't create the 2006 article -- someone else did. As has already been noted, the list system is a compromise: the candidates don't need to be individually important to qualify. To the party's importance, it might be noteworthy the Stephen Harper, Canada's current PM, once wrote about adding the CHP's support base to a broad "right-wing coalition" (not that I'm suggesting that the page should be kept for this reason alone). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where has everyone got the idea that Wikipedia should onlyu include things that are important or "notable" (which is as vague and useless a term as one could imagine)? The main advantage that Wikipedia has over paper encyclopedias is that is can cover the nooks and crannies of the sum of knowledge in this world. There is no consensus that "notability" should be a criterion for inclusion. See the grounds for deletion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, and, for interest, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Jimbo Wales' view on notability</a>, as expressed in the poll where notability failed to become an accepted reason for deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 20:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an endlessly rehearsed argument. It fails on several key counts: Jimbo's ordinary opinions, whilst of great interest, do not form policy or guideline absent some authority being granted to them, or him speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>. Also, "non-notable" is <i>such</i> an accepted deletion criterion that non-notable bios, bands etc, can be deleted on sight per CSD A7. "Non-notable" is a frequently successful argument for deletion because it is simply a collecting-together of many different things: WP:NOT a collection of indiscriminate information, of unencyclopedic information, etc etc. It is not as simple "i don't think he's interesting". It is clearly enough not a "useless" term, it is actually a usefully adaptive term that is just oft-debated as people differ on individual items. The nooks and crannies of the sum of knowledge indeed; it is questionable whether the school-days employment of a random loser qualifies as knowledge. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:39, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And the counter-argument is that there are hundreds of articles on minor characters in Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Buffy, Pokemon, video game and lots of other <i>fictional</i> universes. There are articles on weaponry, spacecraft, battles, religions, languages and institutions of these universes <i>that do not exist</i>. These articles exist because people are interested enough to write about them, and because Wikipedia is willing to be the host for information about them. Here we are talking about real world candidates of real world political parties for real world political offices in a county that is, for the most part, a real place. There are people who are interested in writing about and reading about these people. How is Wikipedia diminished by allowing the stories of these real people sit alongside all of the articles about the stories of minor fictitional characters? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 21:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely Strong Keep</b> per Ground Zero's excellent argument. If we can have articles on every single damn pokemon that (N)ever existed, this should be a no brainer. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 21:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that records on small party candidates are important for historical reasons. Also, CHP canidates tend to run multiple times and in multiple ridings. This info will almost certainly be useful for future elections. Just nbecause you didn't get a lot of votes doesn't mean that a candidate didn't make an impact. <a href="../../../n/d/p/User%7ENdpjohnny_a6bf.html" title="User:Ndpjohnny">NDP Johnny</a> 23:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete both</b>. While an article about the <i>party</i> is perfectly acceptable, these "list of failed candidates" pages are not appropriate to the encyclopedia.
