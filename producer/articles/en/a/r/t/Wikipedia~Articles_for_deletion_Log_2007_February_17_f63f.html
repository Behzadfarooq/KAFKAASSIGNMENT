<p>I noticed this page while it was protected. Apparently it has been the subject of much edit warring. Anyway, the article claims to be about an unreleased album by Beyoncé. I actually don't doubt the claim, but the problem is, there doesn't appear to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to verify it. It has good Google presence, but most of the sites are either references made on message boards or MP3 piracy and purchase sites, but not the sort that could be called reliable as sources of information or as retail outlets. Some of the hits are unrelated (e.g., references made to Beyonce and the site's writer speaking his or her mind). I tried to search a newspaper database and came up empty. All of that said, I believe this should be deleted. GassyGuy 01:00, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be some confusion. There's no claim that this album is ever being released. Rather, it's about a scrapped compilation album.

The article was speedied before, but the article was evidently blank at the time, so that is probably not relevant to this discussion. <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:09, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><u>The problem is that no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> exist to verify that the article contains true information.

Since no such reliable sources exist, this article does not pass the requirements set forward in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Even if it the article was verifiable, there are many who believe that articles on Wikipedia should meet a certain threshold of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. If you believe Wikipedia should have articles about football teams in America, where do you stop? Are adult amateur teams notable? intramural college teams? How about <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Warner_Little_Scholars_c736.html" title="Pop Warner Little Scholars">Pop Warner</a>?? Even though Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">is not paper</a>, it does rely on a an all volunteer group of editors, and they would be quickly overwhelmed by tens of thousands of articles that would need to be evaluated against the basic Wikipedia criteria. The system would quickly break down, and would turn into another clone of Myspace, without the ugly backgrounds and annoying music. Notability is determined by consensus, which is why I feel like a discussion should be started. I personally believe that only current and defunct teams in the top professional league of any given variant (turf, arena, Canadian rules) are notable, including officially associated farm leagues like <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Europe_1fe0.html" title="NFL Europe">NFL Europe</a>. I can't think of any reason to include any other semi-pro or amateur team.

But even so, that discussion will have no bearing on this debate - if the article can't pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it wouldn't measure up to any other criteria, present or future. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 20:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</u></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unless sources are provided since there are absolutely none. In response to Jayvdb, having no sources <i>is</i> a valid reason to delete.

<li>I should have explained myself more in that regards. I have just worked on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathmandu_University_High_School_%28second_nomination%29_49ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathmandu University High School (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathmandu University High School (second nomination)</a>, adding sources. For this region of the world, they are pretty hard to find, and the Afd process is too short to be sure they will be found. I would prefer that in cases like this, tags are used first, and if after due course no sources are provided, then it comes to Afd. Listing it here as a first port of call smacks of having no <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>. To be fair tho, Cybergoth did welcome the newcomer and notify them about the Afd. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I understand your position, but policy generally holds that anything that is unsourced can and should be deleted. Information, quite frankly, shouldn't be added unless sources are provided <i>when it is added.</i> Nominating something for deletion because it violates policy is not a violation of WP:Faith. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:38, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> is a principle that has made Wikipedia what it is. If a newcomer writes an article that violates policy, it is beneficial to the project to be gentle. Let me put it this way; if the article had of been tagged before being listed here, I would have voted delete because the article and editor had been given a chance. I have added three sources; they are not real good ones, but it is a start to put this subject in perspective. It looks like <a href="http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/reviews/pb/page002.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geradts.com/anil/ij/vol_007_no_001/reviews/pb/page002.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the person the original contributor is referring to, however I havent had much luck verifying that person is involved with <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathmandu_University_Medical_School_df78.html" title="Kathmandu University Medical School">Kathmandu University Medical School</a>, simply because their website is down again (or the link into that region of Nepal is down). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 13:32, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Antoine melancholy edited a number of Victoria Cross-related articles to claim that a Filipino named Michael Juarez won the VC in Iraq in 2003, and created this article claiming the same. This is a blatant hoax. All the other articles have been reverted, but since even being total rubbish doesn't qualify an article for CSD, I bring this AFD here.

The webpage is slightly out of date, not listing the 2006 VC, but states that as of June 2004, only one VC was awarded after the Falkland conflict of 1982, to the abovementioned Mr. Beharry in 2004. If Mr. Juarez had been awarded a VC in 2003 as the article indicates, I believe it would have been listed on this site. Beharry's VC is, according to BBC News, the first to be awarded in 20 years (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4358921.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4358921.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4358921.stm</a>).

I know this is probably where the article started, but I'm sure most of what's in the article is verifiable, even if not currently verified. I suggest merging non-trivial popular culture references to <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, tagging them with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} and deleting them if they remain unsourced for more than, say, 2 weeks. I think this could be a stand-alone article, but it would require adding a lot of context, performing a great deal of cleanup, and sourcing every claim made.

<li><b>Strong Delete or Incredibly Weak mini-Merge</b>, as per the precedent listed above. I would actually consider an article like this even less encyclopedic than a list of Rush references - Aerosmith is just too gigantic for something like this. It would be similar to the color blue in popular culture, List of country songs about loving someone, or List of UPC codes divisible by two. A few of the more defining uses (i.e., the earliest known use of an Aerosmith song in a mainstream movie, some factoid involving <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_X_c2c1.html" title="Revolution X">Revolution X</a>, and the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_First_%28Aerosmith%29_8dca.html" title="Head First (Aerosmith)">Head First (Aerosmith)</a> download) could be placed in the main Aerosmith article. As a side note, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_X_c2c1.html" title="Revolution X">Revolution X</a> trivia blurb is a prime example of how <b>not</b> to write trivia - the game came out for several consoles at once, and the "focus" of the blurb should probably be on the arcade game, which came first and was the most successful.

<li><b>Keep</b> What's with the Aerosmith hate-fest lately?? I sense some extreme bias against this band on Wikipeida and it disgusts me. We can have an article for every song the Beatles wrote, an article chronicling Madonna saying the F-word on Letterman, an article about the Beatlemania, a list of Christina Aguilera's B-sides an unreleased material, and even AC/DC can have their article about pop culture, but God forbid Aerosmith (a band that's been around making music for nearly 40 years and sold more records than any other American rock band) has a few specialty articles. Considering many kids today only know of Aerosmith because of their soundtrack contributions, their being featured in a rollercoaster attraction, and their appearances on Saturday Night Live, I think it's important to have this section. Otherwise, the band's history section is going to become incredibly long as we incorporate (merge) many of these important items into the band's history section, making the Aerosmith article, which is already too long, even longer. But who am I to say anything. I simply want to expand knowledge on Wikipedia, the rest of you seem to want to hinder it. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 04:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>First off, I am unaware of any "Aerosmith hate-fest" on Wikipedia. I am aware of two articles relating to Aerosmith being nominated for deletion recently, this one and one about outtakes. That does not amount to a "hate-fest" under any reasonable interpretation. Second, you are expected to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> of your fellow Wikipedians and accusing them of orchestrating a campaign against your favorite band fails to do so. Finally, if you believe that articles on Madonna's swearing of Aguilara's b-sides or whatever else do not belong on Wikipedia, then put them up for deletion. The existence of one crap article does not justify the existence of another crap article, so arguing in favor of this one by pointing to other shitty articles is a poor argument. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 06:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Did I ever say that I thought they were all shitty articles? No. Don't imply. I think they are all good articles and should stay, especially considering how prominent these musicians are in pop culture, and the fact that their main articles would be incredibly long if they weren't broken into these sub-sections. Aerosmith is no different, and it seemed as since their articles were all being gone after at the same time, like people were suddenly denying Aerosmith's importance or notability. And that's where I took issue. But now that I realize this is an artist-by-artist thing, I'll back off a little. Since many of these bulleted items already appear in the main Aerosmith article, I'm backing off a bit, and I think that we should just merge most of the rest, either into the Aerosmith article, or into the appropriate song articles. This isn't a matter of shitty articles, it's a matter of what appeared to me to be double standards. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 00:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reasons I support the afd on Stephen Hawking in Popular Culture. I would make the argument that <i>any</i> article with "in Popular Culture" in the title should be deleted. Such articles are going to necessarily be original research and you have the added (and significant) problem of defining what, precisely, constitutes 'popular culture.' Essentially, "Aerosmith in Popular Culture" equals "Aerosmith in American Culture." This is unencyclopedic and US-centric (or at least Western-centric).

It gives both the 1990 and 2006 rankings on how common the 100 most common Chinese surnames are, it gives the romanisation/pronounciations of several different Chinese dialects for each, and it lists the Vietnamese and Korean equivalents for each, if applicable. It's not just a simple list with no other information. As the article explains, the commonality rankings is a researched and published list. A plain list of Chinese surnames would actually be much much larger.

<dd><b>Keep and cleanup</b> (and maybe rename) List of Hmong surnames. It's actually a listing of the Hmong clans, of which 18 exist; this can be cited (e.g. "18 hmong clans" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">GBooks</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:zh-TW:official&amp;client=firefox" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:zh-TW:official&amp;client=firefox" rel="nofollow">Google</a>). So this one has definite criteria for inclusion in the list, as well as being at least a weakly notable topic. However, <b>Delete</b> the others (including List of Japanese surnames which I voted weak keep above) as being collections of random information without any particular sourcing or criteria for inclusion, and also being fairly useless for navigation given that half the links in question go to placename articles or disambiguation pages instead of articles about the surnames in question. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 14:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sure, Chinese characters are used for Korean and Vietnamese surnames. But are we to assume that people with these surnames are related to their namesakes in China? If yes, please give a source for that claim. Or are they listed for no other reasons that they correspond to the Chinese surnames.

<li>Well firstly, that article has been delisted. But secondly, perhaps that article was misnamed, but it's not a list that's been gathered together by WP editors like most other lists. That list is actually a researched and published list in real life, and the article is about that list. The fact that it gives a commonality ranking for each surname for both 1990 and 2006, so readers can look at the rankings comparatively, already makes that article encyclopedic. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I beg to differ and I want to relist the article. This article is a hodge-podge of unencyclopedic assumptions. Most common surname where? In the PRC? Taiwan? In the Chinese-speaking world as a whole? It seems that the list of common surnames is based on the PRC, which begs the question why Korean and Vietnamese names should be ranked according to the commonality in the PRC. If this article should be kept at all he only way this article should be moved to List of common surnames in the PRC, because that is what this article is about.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 18:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the burden of showing how an article meets criteria for deletion falls on the nominator. Also, without further research by WP editors, there is no evidence that the list is applicable <i>only</i> to the PRC.

<dd>Don't make the discussion more confused than it is, and please respond to my substantive arguments. I have already told you what policy I think this group of articles violate and I have also stated why I think this article is inappropriately named. To the extent that the burden of proof is on me, I have already fulfilled my part. Now the ball is in your court.</dd>
<dd>As for applicability to the PRC, I note that the article for 2006 states "调查涉及全国１１１０个县和市，得到了２．９６亿人口的数据，共获得姓氏４１００个。" I also note that the book quoted for 1990 is published in Beijing and I think it is reasonable to assume that this book is based on PRC data only.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 21:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um... You haven't really said anything substantive. You've cited <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, but as I've said, the listing is a researched and published list, it has comparative commonality rankings, etc etc. More than one editor have stated that this is not just a mere list with no other information. And this article is not a genealogy. Please actually read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, the genealogy clause pertains to biological articles or listings of persons to show only genealogical relations. It doesn't even apply to this list because it's not a biographical article, nor is it a genealogy. And again, believing that the article is misnamed is not criteria for deletion - simply to say, do you believe the article should be renamed, or do you believe it should be deleted? There are two completely different sets of criteria for the two. Also, just because it was published in Beijing, and that it says it's about common surnames in the whole country does not necessarily mean it excludes Taiwan. If this publication is PRC-government related at all, I'm pretty sure it will claim to include Taiwan. But this whole issue is a different discussion altogether. You've mentioned nothing that actually warrants the deletion of this article. It just seems like you don't like it, that's all. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Personally I think it was way to early for Japanes surnames to be transwikied, considering there are way over 200,000 Japanese surnames in existence. If this list was deleted, what you would have is a very incomplete list that has been transwikied with no access to the easiest of the wikies, and the information on a much less used wiki, to edit on to help fill in gaps and finish it.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamb_4927.html" title="User:Williamb">Williamb</a> 22:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand this comment at all. Could you please explain why the articles are encyclopedic?

<li><b>keep</b> -- <s>I don't see how Wiktionary is appropriate for this at all</s>; and, given the fact that the Chinese article contains some referenced info above and beyond most of the articles, perhaps everyone's time would be better spent tagging the other articles for improvement (not deletion), or, even working on the article content, instead of debating the same points over and over. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 14:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the creator of the List of Luo surnames, I can say that the comment "no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose" does not apply there. There is a brief description of Luo nomenclature/name structure, then most of the surnames listed have a "meaning" or explanatory note after them. The argument, therefore, does not always hold.... <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValerius_Tygart_94f2.html" title="User:Valerius Tygart">Valerius Tygart</a> 18:52, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The List of Luo surnames is one of the worst examples of unencyclopedic articles. I doesn't even lead anywhere else. I would suggest that you rewrite the article into a generic article about Luo surnames.

<dd>These articles appear to be in part "all the references to the band that were too trivial to put in the main article, but we wanted to put them somewhere so that people wouldn't keep adding them." I suspect some of these subjects could have a useful article on "the image of x in popular culture", expanding upon their branding, use in subcultures, differing perceptions worldwide perhaps, etc. On the whole, though, I would agree that most of these ...in popular culture articles could go. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Splitting off trivia sections from the main article prevents useless trivia from collecting in the main article. I had trouble even getting the Elvis article to load on my computer before I split off the trivia section. Now those who want to add information about what TV shows Elis has been mentioned on have a place to do so. As for it being an indiscriminate collection of information - it's true that it isn't the most organized article, but with some effort it can be brought up to the standard of some other similar articles (like the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_George_Washington_af2f.html" title="Cultural depictions of George Washington">George Washington</a> ones).

I think this could be a stand-alone article, but it would require adding a lot of context, performing a great deal of cleanup, and sourcing every claim made.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- The Who is a rock band. It <i>is</i> part of popular culture. So the title makes no sense. But besides that, it is not clear what the point of this article, and those like it, is. The only justifiable purpose is to show that the band has had a major influence on (other) popular culture. But their influence is better attested by benchmarks that are actually relevant to being a musical group, such as album/single sales, successful tours, and statements by later musicians saying that The Who was influential on them. These can all be put in the main article. Any other way of conveying the idea of influence will do nothing but be a collection of trivia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 06:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> To quote from my arguments given in the number of other 'in popular culture' articles: I would make the argument that any article with "in Popular Culture" in the title should be deleted. Such articles are going to necessarily be original research and you have the added (and significant) problem of defining what, precisely, constitutes 'popular culture.' Essentially, "in Popular Culture" equals "in American Culture." This is unencyclopedic and US-centric (or at least Western-centric). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I disagree with The Way that all "In popular culture" articles should be deleted, but THIS one definitely should, it's nothing but insignificant trivia. Furthermore, no article on this topic should exist either.. The Who are an element of popular culture, anything really worth having should become part of the main article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Strong delete</s></b> - Article appears to be using an <i>existing</i> word as a neologism for something else. According to <i>the Hutchinson Encyclopaedia</i>, Helicon Publishing LTD 2007, <a href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/dictionaries/difficultwords/data/d0002410.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/dictionaries/difficultwords/data/d0002410.html" rel="nofollow">biologism</a> is "biological theory; use of biological terms." This is a very general idea, and appears to have nothing to do with the content of the Wikipedia entry of that name. In addition, the sentence "Biologism will become the underlying principle of the future societies" is probably the worst violation of <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> I've yet seen. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 04:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'd recommend a merge, but the writing in "Biologism" is so unclear, that I don't think it can be salvaged. A google search of "biologism -wikipedia" yields 55600 hits, most having something to do with biological determinism, so clearly the word is a semi-established synonym. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

List of profanities (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_profanities_3231.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of profanities">AfD discussion</a>) was deleted for being a dictionary, too. There is <i>no</i> navigational purpose to this list, because it doesn't link to articles on the words. The articles that are bluelinked, such as <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance.html" title="Lance">lance</a> (a thing) and <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaylord.html" title="Gaylord">Gaylord</a> (a name disambiguation), have nothing to do with the words and are pretty much bluelinked by accident. Dictionary articles on the words will be found on the project that <i>is</i> a dictionary: Wiktionary.

In any case, my goal was not to keep this list as is, but to keep and see it improved with encyclopedic content (such as information on origins, commonality of use, geographic distribution of use, etc.). However, as I doubt anyone will, I have removed by suggestion to "keep". I do agree with you and the nominator that the list cannot remain as it is. I though it could be expanded, but upon further consideration, I seem to have overestimated its potential for expansion.

<p>The article is a chronological summary of media reports about the election campaign for the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_general_election%2C_2006.html" title="Victorian general election, 2006">Victorian general election, 2006</a>. Seperate articles deal with encyclopedic content about the candidates and the election itself. I would consider an article on the policies of the parties and candidates of the election to be encyclopedic, but this is just a collection of sourced opinions, media stunts and quotations. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 03:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that the topic per se is notable and the article is well sourced. I haven't found any official WP policy which refers to this type of article, but from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%22election+campaign%22&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%22election+campaign%22&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">search of "election campaign"</a> this is the first article of its type. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">This section</a> from 'what WP is not' is the closet I could come to a guideline. I refer to section 7 - plot summaries. The article in question is a massive plot summary, which doesn't actually discuss itself in broader terms. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 08:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate that, but as this is a new type of article it isn't dealt with anywhere in WP, so I decided to use an argument from analogy. Surely some of the ideas in section 7 are relevant to all plots whether fictional or non-fictional. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 01:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really don't think the analogy is appropriate, as the whole point of section 7 is that plot summaries complement "real-world context and sourced analysis".

<p>As a member of the evil godless liberal Muslim atheist Democrats of Wikipedia that swear there is no God and Muhammad is his prophet, I'm afraid I must nominate this article for deletion. I simply can't stand our evil schemes being revealed. Also, this is more appropriate for Wikinews anyway as this is an utterly minor non-incident. A local Imam prayed at a Democratic meeting; hardly any different than your average Christian minister with some perhaps odd views praying at a Republican meeting. This fails the 10 day test, and <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=Husham%20Al-Husainy&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=Husham%20Al-Husainy&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">seems to have already blown over</a>.</p>
<p>Though it doesn't technically impact on notability, I'd also point out that all the sources are from the tabloid wing of the conservatives rather than the intellectual side, which leads to POV/reliability concerns. Most of the G News articles seem to be copies of one <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Schlussel_3d40.html" title="Debbie Schlussel">Debbie Schlussel</a> editorial.</p>
<p>(By the way, feel free to discount my personal vote, but I hope that merely bringing this page to other's attention should be sufficient. For those curious as to how come a one-edit account knows Wikipedia policy, I'm friends with another Wikipedian and just haven't edited much myself...)

<p>There have been many AFDs regarding lists of "flops", such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_miscellaneous_commercial_failures_cbe5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of miscellaneous commercial failures">List of miscellaneous commercial failures</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_flops_in_entertainment_96cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of flops in entertainment">Lists of flops in entertainment</a> and others.

<li><b>Keep</b> <s>and possibly <i>speedy close</i></s>. I strongly disagree with the decision to list them together. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_disasters.html" title="List of military disasters">List of military disasters</a>, for instance, is sourced by two books which are specifically about "military blunders". The information contained in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_flops.html" title="List of political flops">List of political flops</a> is mostly true and verifiable (including the part about such incidents being classified as "political campaign[s] which fails disastrously in spite of high expectations"). I think {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} would be more appropriate for this case.

<li><b>Absolute Keep</b> - I think people are being incredibly sensitive with these. I liked commercial failures. I liked entertainment failures. True, the articles are (were&#160;:( ) amateurly written, for the most part - but the products within them were uniformly awful. I don't think it's POV to call a square a square. <s>The only article that had troubles was the Video Game Failures one, and that was the result of a rather petulant group of self-appointed dictators who refused to allow the inclusion of any game that wasn't in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seanbaby.html" title="Seanbaby">Seanbaby</a>'s Bottom 20.</s> (sorry, confused it with the Worst Videogames Ever article) It is (was&#160;:( ) articles like these that brought me to Wikipedia in the first place - the forgotten and failed, the dismal and pathetic, the OK Sodas and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn_On_950e.html" title="Turn On">Turn Ons</a> of the world. Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy, and niggling over objectivity in areas such as this is counter-productive to the utmost. --Action Jackson IV 10:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think these articles would be better debated separately. There is a big difference between a commercial failure (which is verifiable), and a political flop (which is a matter of interpretation). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 10:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree, list them separately. I think the grocery one should be deleted (unsourced, untrue for a few, poorly written, undefined), but not the military one (as per Black Falcon). <a href="../../../l/r/r/User%7ELrrr_IV_0800.html" title="User:Lrrr IV">Lrrr IV</a> 11:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As per above, as I would never attempt to add 4 entries in one deletion nomination in this lot of AFD list massacre I seen within a month, all you get will be a keep answer by the end of it. The political one should be retitled though and the military to be kept. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillirennen_c3f6.html" title="User:Willirennen">Willirennen</a> 12:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, list them seperately, these articles all have problems certainly, but each has it's own unique problem. Some might well be good candidates for deletion, but probably not all. I'd suggest an admin stop this AfD for a prodedural "no consensus" and send a note to the nom to relist these as individual AfDs. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:31, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all except the grocery list <a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhilding87_ba3c.html" title="User talk:Whilding87"><font color="#990000">Whilding87</font></a> 15:00, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Most of the articles seem extremely weak on sourcing, but I see no reason to believe they can't find sourcing for nearly everything in them. Political flops are hard to source without either citing an election result (in which case they're easy to source) or perhaps poll results, although if enough highly respected sources can be cited, that article too should be possible to source in its entirety. Adequate sourcing should eliminate nearly all POV concerns. It seems to me incredibly useful to know the history of flops in a particular field. That doesn't seem indiscriminate at all, and it sounds very encyclopedic to me. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:34, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment and brief essay</b> - I am a member of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cycling_e7bf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cycling">WikiProject Cycling</a>, and a personally non-neutral partisan of <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycling.html" title="Cycling">cycling</a>, but all WikiProjects must conform to Wikipedia's policies. Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, and not a general-purpose information appliance for any particular group of users. Perhaps the most basic feature of encyclopedic content is that it has been published in a reputable source already; see: <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTRIBUTE_be04.html" title="WP:ATTRIBUTE">WP:ATTRIBUTE</a>. Everything we write on Wikipedia has to be attributable to a reputable source. That's why, among the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycling.html" title="Bicycling">bicycling</a>-related articles, there seem to be so many articles about elite <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_racing.html" title="Bicycle racing">bicycle racing</a>, and fewer articles about the bicycling most bicyclists actually do: bicycle races are widely reported in <i>published sources</i>, whereas much of non-competitive bicycling gets less press. The key to writing an <i>encyclopedic</i> article about a cycling-related topic is to get the article's information from published sources, and cite them all properly. Doing that generally avoids these article deletion nominations.</dd>

Someone merely needs to research the cycling literature and find multiple published sources documenting the history of mountain biking on Mount Tamalpais. I can recall reading about the legendary "Repack" race years ago (mentioned in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Fisher_0910.html" title="Gary Fisher">Gary Fisher</a>, but also unsourced there, regrettably).

<li><b>Keep</b>, Mountain Biking on Mount Tamalpais does make some very strong <i>claims</i> to notability. Such as being the "birthplace" of mountainbiking and having had famous races there. I'm going to take the word of members of WikiCyling on this for now.... but it would help a lot if we have a few sources for these claims. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 20:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - mountain biking at this location appears to meet notability criteria and is certainly of interest to the cycling community. However, I agree with others who have noted the article does need a rewrite so that references/citations are provided and to make the style more encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> – if this article is kept, it will have to be knocked back to a short stub immediately. So far, I've heard some good arguments on the <i>potential</i> for an encyclopedic article on mountain biking on Mt. Tamalpais, however, I haven't seen anybody make a good case for keeping the most of the existing content. The "travel guide" style content flat out goes against the guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and belongs in Bicycling Wiki, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the development of Mountain Biking and its association with this area makes it notable for inclusion in Wikipedia. However, much of the existing content needs editing and perhaps some deletion, with proper referencing of sources, including its historical notability. I suggest the article is cut back to a stub. I was contacted to participate in this discussion as a contributor to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cycling_e7bf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cycling">Wikiproject Cycling</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirin_6dbf.html" title="User:Tirin">Takver</a> 12:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Takver, the are is very important for mountain biking history and I believe is notable enough to be included here. But I also think much of the content must be deleted or transwikied or something.

<p><b>weak keep</b> yes this article is autobiographical but remains factual and referenced, if being a candidate is non notable then the article should be deleted, however this article should be cross referenced with anoth AfD Tim Kalemkarian who has repeatedly stood for candidacy through self nomination and it would appear that the general discussion favours a keep. I, on the other hand, have been nominated through a candidacy process and local selection. Clarification is requiredas to level of notability that selected candidacy brings versus self nomination?Leonspence 17:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:As I've argued before, inclusion in the Biennal is an assertion of notability, but as usual that needs to be documented. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 14:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Which is why the article needs work. I think we should take it as good faith that the artist was at the Biennale and that this can be referenced, which would require someone to do the (most likely Polish language) research. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 14:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> in accordance with several precedents.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Some time ago, Wikipedians had an extensive discussion about the proper method for retaining information about defeated and minor party candidates in national and state/provincial elections. The compromise option we arrived at was to permit "list pages", which would provide short biographical entries for each candidate according to party affiliation. Not everyone favoured this option, but most participants agreed that it was an acceptable outcome.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia now has many such "list pages", which have generally attracted little controversy. A few of these pages have been nominated for deletion in the past, and in each case the result was <b>keep</b>.</dd>
<dd>This particular page is currently a stub, and was admittedly in rather rough shape when the nomination was made (the "2003" link was an error). In time, however, it has the potential to become a good repository of information. Pages such as this should not be deleted. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Author's intention is to list items that can be used to facilitate drug use, in order for a ban on such items, apparently in place in Philadelphia, to be respected. Author: "It is critical to establish a list of items that are commonly turned in paraphernalia so that retail stores can be in compliance with the act". However, the page currently seems indiscriminate, listing apples, lemons, potatoes, squash, the Holy Bible and the New Gideon Bible.

<p>This is an article on a song that has been posted on Mandy Moore's official MySpace page, but there are absolutely zero references supporting the assertion that it has been released as a single. When I redirected it to the album article, the original author, <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParys_d8c8.html" title="User:Parys">Parys</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParys_7abc.html" title="User talk:Parys">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parys_7012.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parys">contribs</a>), reverted me; when I asked him/her for sources, he/she didn't provide any and told me I was "wrong". Because nothing is referenced (there's a huge slab of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> concerning the meaning of the song and comparisons with Moore's previous material), there's nothing to merge into the album article. <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 15:37, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I assure you Sausage is a real game, I play it frequently, it is actaully very good fun and most certainly not "non-notable". I have just created a group on Facebook for people who play it, located at "<a href="http://hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2245237352" class="external free" title="http://hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2245237352" rel="nofollow">http://hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2245237352</a>" please have a look at the group, it should convince you of its reality. Thanks - Luke Valori, 18 February 2007

<li>A game can be real but non-notable. "It exists" does not automatically mean "it is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>". For it to be notable there must be at least two or more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (such as major newspapers and magazines) that have described the game in detail. There appear to be no such sources for this game. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong J.</a> <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">M.

<ul>
<li>Fair enough. I nonetheless object to the description of the game as "nonsense" or "cooked up by the writer". Delete it if you must, I just disagree with the use of Wikipedia solely for the purpose of describing things that have three or more major articles written about them - 86.128.189.226 18:05, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm chuffed that you think I invented the game but I really didn't, I believe it has been around for a while. I think the issue here is not whether or not the game is real (there's no way I'd go to all this troubule just for a laugh) but whether it's significant enough to merit a Wikipedia article. Perhaps it's not, but it is quite widespread, even if Google doesn't have much on it. Lukevalori 21:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. I currently study at Gordonstoun in Scotland. I can assure those of you who believe this game is 'non-notable', which perhaps it is, it is a real and a highly-amusing game. It should not be excluded from the Wikipedia pages. It is in fact a well known game among schoolchildren, illustrated by the fact that the craze has found it's way this far up North. As this game is evidently growing more popular among the younger generation, I advise you to keep it. It is not offensive, nor is it irrelevant; it is a page of reference for those who know what it is, just like all the other pages on Wikipedia are. Your unfounded accusation that the creator has 'cooked this game up' is quite frankly absurd and overt speculation. Oliverlock 20:34, 20th February 2007.</li>

<p>This is pure trivia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Characters die on lots of shows.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment from nominator</b> I should add that this list already includes many insignificant or completely off-screen "characters". If this list were to be comprehensive, it should include every soldier killed in any attack that President Josiah Bartlet orders as well as all of the tens of thousands of people who die in civil wars and genocides on the show. This is indiscriminate information. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 19:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is already a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_West_Wing_episodes_480e.html" title="List of The West Wing episodes">List of The West Wing episodes</a>, and it looks to me like a justifiable list. There seems to be a separate WP article for every episode of this show. If you scan through the present article you will see a ton of blue links, which shows that it's heavily connected to the other coverage of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_82a6.html" title="The West Wing">The West Wing</a>. Given that the notability of this show goes without saying, I believe this list is not excessive. In answer to <a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">User:Hnsampat</a>'s comment above, a sentence might be added to the article indicating it includes only deaths of named characters. That would be a usable criterion for the completeness of the list. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — The show is notable, the list is organized in an acceptable way, it does however require a lead-in, a good strong paragraph to establish the notability would be good. Perfectly encyclopaedic, and perfectly manageable. <span style="font-style: Tahoma; font-size: 84%;"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></span> 12:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, in particular this article is informative and aids in navigation. Also, there are numerous online references which discuss Leo's death, establishing notability. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 16:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Dissenting comment</b> - I must disagree here. Just because one of the deaths on this page is notable does not change the fact that the page as a whole is non-notable information. Most of the people here exist in one episode and many of them aren't even seen (e.g. the pilot who crashes into a mountain, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the guy on the boat that gets caught in the hurricane). The only deaths on this page that are "significant" in any way (i.e. having dramatic plot-altering consequences) are Leo, Mrs. Landingham, and Abdul Shareef. Other than that, it is simply a list that one looks at and thinks, "Oh, cool." In other words, it is trivia only. The fact that the show is notable doesn't make the page notable. Otherwise, a well-organized "List of characters on The West Wing with brown hair and blue eyes" would be considered encyclopedic, which it clearly is not. <i>The West Wing</i> is not a show about people dying and there simply are not enough notable character deaths to merit keeping this page. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 19:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete and Merge</b> as per nom. I'm afraid this is an obvious one folks.

The rest of the characters on this page (e.g. the aforementioed pilot and boatsman, as well as the homeless veteran who freezes to death wearing Toby's coat) are insignificant beyond the single episodes in which they appear and their deaths don't deserve mention even on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_on_The_West_Wing_177c.html" title="List of characters on The West Wing">List of characters on The West Wing</a> (since it's a page about major characters and significant recurring ones).

<li><b>Comment citing precedent</b> I just noticed this little archived AfD debate: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Deaths_in_Scream_a18b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Deaths in Scream">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Deaths_in_Scream</a>. It was decided that an article that lists all the people who die in the horror movie <i>Scream</i> ought to be deleted as "fancruft." Now, <i>Scream</i> is a movie about people dying. If a list of people dying in that movie was deemed nothing more than "fancruft", then surely a list of people dying on <i>The West Wing</i> has to go. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 03:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>-***½ Delete</b> - as an ex-wrestling fan, I find Keith's breakdown of wrestling shows are fun to read, but the nom is correct in there's no reliable sources about Keith himself.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as the author of four published books through what appears to be a reputable publisher, the Citadel imprint of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington_Books_ccbc.html" title="Kensington Books">Kensington Books</a> and a writer for a professional magazine, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighting_Spirit_magazine_68bc.html" title="Fighting Spirit magazine">Fighting Spirit magazine</a>.

<li>None of these are about the person; some of them are not even about the book, just evidence that someone referenced it. All of these only trivially mention Scott Keith. You would need to make an entire encyclopedia article about Scott Keith out of these sources, as any unsourced or poorly sourced information would need to be removed, which is not possible from the ones you have listed. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> On principle alone. Seriously. How backwards is Wikipedia? Why is it that there is 11 seperate articles just of LISTS of fictional characters from Dragon Ball Z for example, and literally hundreds of articles on all of these individual characters, and then someone like Scott Keith, a notable real-life published author, gets put up for deletion.

<li>The reason is there are an abundance of sources that list these fictional characters. Also, that "Scott Keith" is a real-life person is part of the problem; unsourced inaccuracies in an article about fictional characters have no effect on the life of a living person. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Examining the list, there does seem to be sufficient appropriate material,m and it is usefully collected here.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with the nomination that the term "commercial failure" is not well defined. This is illustrated very well by the first entry on the list, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A318_2aac.html" title="Airbus A318">Airbus A318</a>. Some would argue that the lower sales of this aircraft compared to the A319 and A320 constitutes a "failure", others might argue that this shortened version is a niche product which was a moderately successful aircraft for the airlines who wanted a smaller version. One could say that some of the entries are "failures" by most reasonable definitions, that is the ones which never got off the ground, the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_2707.html" title="Boeing 2707">Boeing 2707</a> for instance. But there is a big gray zone here. Where to draw the line between "commercial failure", "disappointing sales", "not as well as hoped", and "moderately successful niche product" is inherently subjective, leaving the conditions for inclusion on the list as a poor discriminator. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There's a decent concept at the heart of this list, but the concept can't be realized in this context.

<li><b>Delete</b> This list includes quite a number of items but there is not even one citation, no sources at all.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The following comments should not be taken as saying anything negative about the two editors just above, just respectful disagreement: I have to confess to being irritated by the attitude that no matter how potentially serious the subject of a Wikipedia article may be, we need to squelch it because the article as written has flaws. <i>Serious subjects belong in Wikipedia. Serious treatment of unserious subjects even belongs in Wikipedia if a serious purpose can be shown for studying it.</i> If these last two sentences can't be found in Wikipedia policy, then they need to be put there. (I'd even go further and say that subjects that are unserious and where the serious purpose for reading them is slim would still belong in Wikipedia if there's citable proof they are of obvious enduring interest to a large number of people, but that's irrelevant to this discussion.) Maybe the real reason we disagree about deleting this article is because I'm inclusionist and want to keep articles that can be improved and the above editors are deletionist and want to destroy articles that might be replaced later with something of higher quality, but I'm speculating about that. My answers to above objections:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><i>UNSOURCED</i>: You could fell a forest to come up with the printed pages of journalistic and historical sources for political flops, so the lack of sources is reason for a citation notice, not deletion.</li>
<li><i>INHERENTLY POV'</i>: If multiple, neutral journalistic sources or multiple historians say something is a flop, it's not POV. And that should be the standard when we don't have an election or other, similar fact to hang our hats on. The item about Howard Dean in the U.S. part of the list cites <i>The Economist</i> cover and Dean's third-place showing in Iowa. That's an utterly solid assertion of a flop. And cited.</li>
<li><i>PURELY ORIGINAL RESEARCH</i> Anyone who has ever read political news and magazine articles should know after a bit of reflection that this list could cite sources saying "-----'s campaign was a flop". There are countless articles out there that say just that, and it's the same with historical sources. It is harder to imagine that there are NO such sources out there for anything on that list than to imagine that there IS a source that the editor(s) just didn't go out and find.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional comment: The subject of this article is too broad, since you could do a political flops list for every democracy and quite a few governments that aren't democracies. In the U.S. you'd eventually have to split the list up. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:29, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and tag for cleanup/improvement. The term "flop" has been applied to political campaigns plenty of times. The state of the article is very poor, but everything there is easily sourceable. This is surely not OR (a few single items may be questionable, but they can just be removed). Also, POV? Huh? Against or for whom? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for Black Falcon's reasons. He's got an almost perfect definition, but I'd replace "soundly defeated" with at least "utterly defeated" or something else a bit stronger. The word "disaster" I think also carries an implication of drama -- something that startles. So maybe something like "dramatically and soundly defeated". Serious subjects, seriously considered deserve Wikipedia articles. Military blunders are worth studying, and examples of them are worth noting. With Black Falcon's clear definition, there shouldn't be a POV problem, at least not an inherent one. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:47, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't find any sites which specifically comment on this family. If Sweden's nobility system is anything like England's, there are many such families with minor claims to nobility, ie a hereditary title linked to a landed estate.

<li><b>Delete</b>, there are hundreds of low nobility families in Germany with similar members being some kind of official, artist or other.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The German Wikipedia already has more articles on the Moellendorffs/Möllendorf(f)s. There are articles on two of these Moellendorffs (which seems to be the more common spelling, at least during the 18th and 19th centuries) in the old <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie</i> from the 19th century. The newer <i>Neue Deutsche Biographie</i> seems to treat most of them in one big article on the whole family. Some other reference works, such as the <i>Deutsche Biographische Enzyklopädie</i> also have articles on the Moellendorffs. The ADB has been scanned and put online, but in order to improve the article any further, both the NDB and the DBE and other paper references need to be checked in a library. The index to the NDB is however available at the same website: <a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~ndb/ndbmaske.html" class="external free" title="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~ndb/ndbmaske.html" rel="nofollow">http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~ndb/ndbmaske.html</a>. The most famous member of the family is probably the philologist <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_von_Wilamowitz-Moellendorff_ae47.html" title="Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff">Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff</a>, who belongs to an adopted branch.

<p><b>Weak keep</b> If a player had played even just one match in the World Cup finals he would almost certainly be kept. There's no notability guidelines for referees but I'd suggest that being selected to ref in the world's biggest and most significant tournament qualifies him (and for information, somewhere in the region of half of the refs who are selected for each edition of the World Cup only get to ref one match) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 21:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I'd say he meets notability, only one referee (and his assistants) on the FIFA list from any individual association can go to the World Cup Finals. Therefore FIFA and his own FA have judged him to be the best suited. He's been selected by the FIFA Referee Committee as one of the 40-50 possible and gone through the assessment stages to be in the final 20-30 for the tournament, therefore he was judged as arguably one of the top 30 referees in the world in that year. For example: of all the football referees in the world only 23 out of a suggested 40 were chosen for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>.<a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,116346,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,116346,00.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a><a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1812502,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1812502,00.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, referees that have officiated a World Cup match (even if it is only one) should be considered notable. As said above, doing that means the ref arguably is one of the 30 best referees in the world at that time.

<p>I believe this article to be either a spoof or a fake. I can find no evidence of a film of this name being in production anywhere. The cast list looks suspiciously good, too good. The supposed poster that is in the article is suspect as well, a close examination of the ink bottle in the top corner will show that the writing is backwards because the image has been flipped. Would a professional film company allow a sloppy mistake like that out in to the open? The supplied link to yahoo is merely a message page. It's a total fake. <a href="../../../x/2/0/User%7EX201_1eb7.html" title="User:X201">X201</a> 21:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> IMDB has nothing on this.

The spelling in that post is unprofessional as well. The director, Stephen Daldry, is currently in pre-production on <i>The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i> so I'm not sure how he would have time to do another film and have it released in 2007.

<p>There are two major problems with this article. It is a clear conflict of interest (<a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>) as it was written by a <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudd_hamilton_56bc.html" title="User:Judd hamilton">User:Judd hamilton</a>. This, however, could of course be overcome. But as I looked for sources I began to have serious doubts as to whether this article could meet the notability guidelines for biographies (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). He does have an entry on the <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a>, but it doesn't help persuade me of his notability.

<li><b>Delete at present</b>: The figure in question is, indeed, an actor who did, indeed, do the things the article claims. However, the tone of the article is personal and laudatory, and it looks for all the world like autobiography. Essentially, saving it would mean a rewrite, and that's not what Cleanup does.

<dd>Just because the pageant is not televised in the United States, does not mean it does not exist or is not notable. It certainly is a real and influential pageant as illustrated by the amount of young women who compete for it every year and the work the titleholders do for their platforms.

<li>The card game itself is an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article; an advert for a site that runs an online version of it isn't. (Even less so when it currently only seems to be "available to a select set of Beta Testers" - from the pages that weren't broken or locked, I was unable to determine whether the site was gambling-orientated or not; the poker chips in the logo suggested it was.) At most this should just be a link at the end of a neutral article about the history and rules of Fifty-Six. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 10:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Am I correct in assuming from Google results that when you say "J9A10 is a group of a trick-taking games" you mean "a number of games that J9A10.com has chosen to host" rather than anything of wider significance? The term "J9A10" does not appear to be used outside of your site. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 19:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also you mentioned that the game is not open to public. Though the site says at this time it is open to Beta Testers only. But it is in fact open to the public, if you try registering it will let you open a new beta testing account and play the game. The game is free like Wikipedia and has no levels or usage restriction. Guess the reason there is a beta testing restriction is just to ensure there is no flood of user traffic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.250.232.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.250.232.151_07dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.250.232.151">contribs</a>) 23:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

The journal <i>Cahiers de l'Institut de Linguistique de Louvain</i> has been published since 1972 by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universit%C3%A9_Catholique_de_Louvain_e2c9.html" title="Université Catholique de Louvain">Université Catholique de Louvain</a>, a prestigious university in Belgium.

<dd><i><b>Excursus</b></i>: Most of the content in the first, unsigned, comment above seems confused, confusing and irrelevant to the issue of the actual journal. The above-mentioned title by Elena Bashir appears to be not a book, but a single article in volume 113 of a supplement series of the journal. To hopefully make things clearer: The journal is called <i>Cahiers de l'Institut de Linguistique de Louvain</i>. The supplement series is called <i>Bibliothèque des Cahiers de l’Institut de Linguistique de Louvain</i>. Volume 113 of this series is a conference volume called <i>Bourouchaskiana: actes du Colloque sur le bourouchaski organisé à l'occasion du XXXVIème Congrès international sur les Études asiatiques et nord-africaines (Montréal, 27 août - 2 septembre 2002)</i> ed. Étienne Tiffou, 2004. The journal has a second supplement series called <i>Série Pédagogique de l’Institut de Linguistique de Louvain</i>. I hope that helps. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 08:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This appears to be a legitimate scholarly journal, in publication since 1972. I looked it up in three online library catalogs of universities in the United States, and two of them subscribe to it, even though the journal is in French. Normally I would recommend "keep", but the text of this article appears to have been poorly translated from <a href="http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=journal&amp;journal_code=CILL" class="external text" title="http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=journal&amp;journal_code=CILL" rel="nofollow">the publisher's web page</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it can easily be rewritten in English once we determine we want to have the article. The only academic journal I can recall which was deleted at AfD in a while was one that could not be shown to be in any library at all, even in the online catalog of the institute that published it., &amp; even that had those who disagreed. You cannot expect the same GS or other coverage of articles in journals like this. The supplements of course should not be separate articles unless one should ever be really notable.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: How does one establish the "notability" of an academic journal in a way that satisfies Wikipedia's requirements? People would usually cite individual articles, rather than write about the journal as such (and if somebody would, it would probably be the editor in an anniversary volume). But it would seem to me that reputable institutions and personalities of academia should be regarded as noteworthy in and of themselves, as that is where the knowledge is produced that an encyclopaedia is supposed to distill and describe. Knowledge does not just occur naturally, like apples that can be picked off a tree; it is produced in a certain institutional, social and historical context, and that is how it has to be understood. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 07:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very very strong keep</b>. This journal is already in use on Wikipedia as a source; check <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Cahiers_de_l%27Institut_de_Linguistique_de_Louvain_cf71.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Cahiers de l'Institut de Linguistique de Louvain">Special:Whatlinkshere/Cahiers_de_l'Institut_de_Linguistique_de_Louvain</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Worldcat finds 40 libraries in their network that hold this journal, including Lib of Congress, NY Public Library and Harvard University. See <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2341256" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2341256" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. The fully-quoted name of the journal gets 20,600 Google hits. I think it's notable. Regarding journal notability, and the effort to create new articles on important journals, it's worth taking a look at John Vandenberg's project at <a href="../../../l/o/m/WP%7ELOMJQ_053f.html" title="WP:LOMJQ">WP:LOMJQ</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I personally thought that Project Monarch was notable enough as a crackpot conspiracy theory to merit inclusion, but <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Project_Monarch_b696.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Project Monarch">others felt differently</a>.

<li>I think Cathy O'Brien is a deluded nutbag with obviously ridiculous claims.

<li><b>Keep conditionally</b> - the users involved state the article is a work in progress. Seeing as the item in contention seems to display notability, I suggest we let the article go undeleted for a week or so to allow it to come up to standard. Besides, if the article gets deleted the article will need to be remade from the ground up, which is a pity because it needs to be part of the podcasting wikiproject (personal opinion). This podcast apparently beat the podcast "Nobody likes onions" on podcast alley, and if I recall Nobody likes Onions has an extensive article. It would be unfair to cut this article off from devlopment when it is already more notable than another article that has been firmly established.<sub><i><b>Optomal</b></i></sub>7 07:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)<small>— Optomal7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Optomal7_ef8f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Optomal7">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Is this even a legitimate AFD as none of the articles have been tagged? Ok well, I guess I can fix that. The only problem I actually see with these articles, except for "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_of_The_Dragon_Balls_a11a.html" title="Secret of The Dragon Balls">Secret of The Dragon Balls</a>" is that they do not conform to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> point about plot summaries without real-world context. Normally, I'm in favor of this being <b>merged</b> into a list, where such context can exists. But there aren't any policies or guidelines against episode articles so long as the real-world context and sourced analyst is provided. "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_of_The_Dragon_Balls_a11a.html" title="Secret of The Dragon Balls">Secret of The Dragon Balls</a>" is the only one I see that provides such context. However, let me also state that having per episode articles for such a long running series is not a good idea. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 16:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I thought this wasn't a real AFD since the articles weren't tagged... now they are. I have to say that throwing all of these into a list together is unwise and I'm going to have to suppose I have to say keep because the secret of the dragon balls episode and because of its real world context. For the other articles... merge? I dunno, absolutely not delete. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 18:27, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't think these story arc led series really need articles on each seperate episode as they don't really stand on their own as part of the series, let alone in a more general context, the series's storyline is better defined in it's main article or a more general plot summary spinoff article (and Dragonball already seems to have seperate articles for each "saga" already). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 00:42, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Since other TV shows have individual episode articles, why shouldn't Dragon Ball? <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 10:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Whether there are other TV series that have episode articles is <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">irrelevant</a>. My view is that this is better handled by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_episodes_8690.html" title="List of Dragon Ball episodes">List of Dragon Ball episodes</a> instead of individual articles. The "<i>Saga</i>" articles should be likewise merged because of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> issues. In fact, I see that the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Pilaf_Saga_56b1.html" title="Emperor Pilaf Saga">Emperor Pilaf Saga</a> is already ready to be merged so I'll probably do that in a short while. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 20:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact other shows have episode articles is completely relevant. If there are story arcs, then combine the articles into indiviudal story arc articles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:33, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Notable television series, episode is inherently notable.

<p>The article was prodded, but the prod was removed so I bring it here. Non-notable webcomic. Google brings forth a mere <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jazz+and+Jess%22&amp;hl=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jazz+and+Jess%22&amp;hl=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">14 unique hits</a> for "Jazz and Jess".

The official forum has 52 registered members which doesn't illustrate a great deal of popularity. The article was initially created by one of the webcomic writers but it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Jazz+and+Jess" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Jazz+and+Jess" rel="nofollow">deleted</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> We're sorry if this deletion inconveniences you, but the page should never have been created in the first place.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The author admits to using Wikipedia for advertising purposes, so it should be deleted quickly, perhaps even speedied as db-spam. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 10:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The author admitted to advertising it on OTHER websites, but using wiki for *reference*. This is a web comic that has reached users allover Britain - I'm from the North East of England and it is widely read at my place of work and my university, and among friends, for example KJS1982 10:16, 19 February 2007</li>
