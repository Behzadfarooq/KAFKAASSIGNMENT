<p>Seems to be an autobiography (uses "my" several times as an adjective). The main problem is the lack of sources, none are mentioned in the article, and I can't find any searching around. The article appears to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverhand_a04b.html" title="User:Silverhand"><span style="color:silver"><b>Silverhand</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESilverhand_ca5f.html" title="User talk:Silverhand">Talk</a></sup> 04:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "my" was a typo. I was transcribing from an interview with him. The facts are direct from Richard Bailey himself and his rep</p>

<p>Yes I interviewed his through his Australian Rep (linked on the page). That was why I wrote "my" a few times.Wjwallis 05:04, 14 March 2007 (UTC)Jason</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, although I'm convinceable. Heavy googling (including Google News Archive) does confirm that he's a photographer for (mostly Australian) Vogue and there are quite a few web galleries of his work and plenty of photo credits, but very little information actually about him, even though several Australian dailies are on GNA. At this point I just don't see enough sources for anything more than a basic stub. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>That's why I wrote about him. There is very little information available on Richard Bailey. However, I just found some information from his NYC rep: <a href="http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html" class="external free" title="http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html</a> This has a bio on him. Despite the lack of "google" information on him he is a VERY famous photographer. Any viewing of his work will prove this Wjwallis 17:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)wallisphoto (jason)</p>

<p>Why do you want to delete this? part of the beauty of Wikipedia is you CAN find information on subjects that don't pop up as soon as you enter their name in Google! If you look at Richard Bailey's work and still believe he is not notable or worthy of being in Wikipedia fine. But as a photographer with 30 years worth of contributions to Australian Vogue he IS important. Please feel free to clean up my entry or make it a stub if I am referencing things incorrectly...Wjwallis 02:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)wallisphoto</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The problem with this article isn't so much that he might not be notable in the grand scheme of things, its that we have absolutely no way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> his notability. I looked to verify a few of the facts, and the only thing I could reliably establish was that he indeed did shoot for for Australian Vogue, though for how long, and how successfully, I don't know. Wjwallis - I'm sure you are a upstanding and ethical interviewer, but unfortunately, we simply cannot take your word that the information in this article is accurate. We must use reliable third party sources to check the facts - and if the reliable sources don't exist, the article must be deleted. I searched around a bit, and couldn't find anything, but you can change my mind if reliable sources appear before the five days are up. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC) (<small>Edited to correct spelling - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</small>)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> nailed it on the head and said it better than I could. To take it one step further, lets use the comparison you made previously, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bailey_1f4a.html" title="David Bailey">David Bailey</a>. Looking at his article, I can tell you something about his life, he is a member of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> as well as his career from 1959 to present day. I can also tell you he's written or collaborated on three books and been interviewed in a fourth. He has pointers at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a> and has at least three published interviews. Comparatively speaking, Richard bailey is a man of mystery. There appears to be your interview, some reference to his work in Austrailian Vogue and online galleries of his art. Honestly, I think we'd all like to see an extremely well-written article for Mr. Bailey with a plethora of details on his life and career. The problem is, there isn't enough there even for a properly sourced stub. You mention other articles that are of equal stature. I won't deny that. As time moves on, all of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">1.5+ Million articles</a> will get touched in some way. Some will go away, others will be improved. Still more will be created. Right now, it's about Richard bailey. A suggestion I might make in your sourcing is to read the most excellent article by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> called <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">On Notability</a>. Be sure to read the entire article and don't skim it. Take it in it's entirety and read the links as well. Good luck and don't give up.

<p>Notablility?!! That's rich. Wikipedia has all sorts of trivial people with dubious notability (ie American Idol contestants etc.) who have done nothing. If you are a photographer and shoot for huge clients and shoot for Vogue for 30 years I think that makes you notable!</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am still not convinced. Adding a bunch of wiki links to notable people and things he has photographed does not help to assert his own notability, and the POV of the article has taken a turn for the worse (übercool agency??). For obviously reasons, his publicist is not a reliable source, neither are blogs. The picture gallery is pretty, and he takes nice pictures, but <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not a criteria for inclusion. At least the B&amp;W Magazine seems to confirm that he is a "top photographer", but WP:BIO demands multiple sources. If the Capture Magazine article listed in paragraph 2 is available - then that might push it over, though somebody would have to go through this article with a hatchet - get rid of the model names, the agency names, and the publicist links. Vote remains delete. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once again: if you shoot for <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue.html" title="Vogue">Vogue</a> (the top fashion magazine in the world) for 30 years that would make you notable!!!! Most of the top photographers of all time used Vogue as their showcase: <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Ritts_214b.html" title="Herb Ritts">Herb Ritts</a>, Steven Meisel, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Von_Unwerth_f8da.html" title="Ellen Von Unwerth">Ellen Von Unwerth</a>, Anne Lebovitz, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Weber_3cb0.html" title="Bruce Weber">Bruce Weber</a>... etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on some lame reality show apparently you are notable so why not a professional photographer who works for <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue.html" title="Vogue">Vogue</a>?</p>
<p>If you judge his pictures are "pretty" and "nice" that is subjective and irrelevant. The fact is he is one of the top photographers in the world and his agency (top photographers have representatives) is relevant because that is where his work is displayed!!!</p>

<dd>This issue here is the common misconception that notability and importance are related on Wikipedia. When editor say non notable they mean that there are not sufficient sources from which to write an article. Since many reality TV stars are interviewed in magazines it is often possible to write a good biographical article about them. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.
