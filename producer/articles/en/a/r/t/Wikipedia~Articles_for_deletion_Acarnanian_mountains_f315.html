	    <p><b>Introduction</b> The Acarnanian mountains are loacted in western Greece directly south of the Amvrakikos Gulf and to the north of the Bay of Astakos. The mountains are generally low in elevation in contrast to the other mountains of Greece, such as the Pindus or the mountains of the Peloponnese. The mountains begin at sea level and top out at 1589 meters with the highest peak being Psili Korfi. The range is roughly 25 miles at long and is 10 miles wide at its thickest point. Although the area is relatively primitive with no feature mountain resorts or clubs in the area, there is still a plethora of activities to do in the mountains such as hiking, rock climbing, backcountry skiing, camping, hunting, rock diving, etc. For more information visit www.summitpost.org for more information on outdoor events.</p>
<p><b>The peaks</b> Psili Korfi is the highest point in the range and stands at 1589 meters above sea level. This is a long mountain that has a steep and rugged southwest face. On its western face can be found the monasteri of romvou which was built in the 11th century AD. Moreover, Romvou was used as a hideout by the Greek resistance against the Nazis during World War. The second highest mountain is Bumistos which stands at 1573 meters. Bumistos gets its name from the wicked thunderstorms that pound the mountain during the winter months. The third highest and most famous of all the mountains is Perganti which stands at 1428 meters. On the summit of this mountain is the Perganti radio towers and facility. The facility recieves numerous visitors during the summer and the winter. As a matter of fact, the mountain is so loved by the surrounding inhabitants that one dairy producer has actually named his yogurt product by the name of "perganti"! On the western edge of the mountains can be found Serekas which is 1171 meters tall. Although low in elevation, this is a rugged mountain that has limestone walls that are in places over 1000 feet high. In the early 90's a German climber actually fell to his death while attempting to climb Serekas so caution must be used on this formidable peak.</p>
<p><b>Climate</b> In the summer the area can get extremely hot with temperatures rising to the 90's and 100's F. However, a cold storm from the north can come out of nowhere and the temperatures can drop into the 40's even in mid august so warm clothes should be brought at all times. In the winter, rain and thunderstorms are very common with the mountains receiving 50 inches of rain a year! Moreover, from December to March snow falls on the higher elevations above 1200 meters. Snowskiing in possible on the highest peaks when conditions permit. It is adviseable to avoid climbing in the mountains during a storm because the lighting in the area has killed numerous people throughout the years so use extreme caution.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Wildlife and Fauna</b> The akarnania mountains have a very diverse widelife. There are eagles, owls, vultures, and many other rare bird species in the area. Also, there are foxes, wild boars and even wild horses in the archondohori. Grazing is popular in the mountains with an overabundance of cattle, sheep, pigs, and mountain goats. One should avoid nearing the livestock as mean and protective dogs are always on alert for trespassers. With regards to fauna, Oak trees dominate the lower elevations and coniferous firs can be found in the upper elevations.</p>
<p><b>Mountain villages</b> The most famous of the towns that surround the Akarnanian mountains is Monastiraki that has a population of 1800 inhabitants. Monastiraki has a famous festival every year from August 18-20. Famous singers from all over the country congregate their and the town parties hard for those three days with tens of thousands of visitors from all over the province. In the center of the town one can find the famous meatshops that have roasted lamb and the spiced entrials as a appetizer.</p>
