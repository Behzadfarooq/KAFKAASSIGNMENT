<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge and Redirect</b> with listing of other anti-elements (is there one)?

<dd>Not all hits are relevant, that's why I didn't give an exact number. But I estimate that <i>at least</i> 3&#160;900 of the Google hits (4&#160;000 if you count the hits with the name spelled as two separate words) are refering to the candy from the Nidar chocolate factory.

<dd>In the first couple of pages I saw more hits for a motorcycle club with that name than I did for the candy. Some others appeared to be usernames. That is why I added chocolate to the search.

<dd>I see. But I doubt that anyone who didn't know about the candy would invent a name like <b>Bamsemums</b> independently. I checked those motorcycle references. One guy liked this one bike so much he called it "the tough guys' bamsemums", another compared the weight of a motorcycle part to the weight of a bag of bamsemums candy. So in fact they, too, (indirectly) talk about the Nidar product. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerdlanco_1c73.html" title="User:Verdlanco">Verdlanco</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVerdlanco_2f1e.html" title="User talk:Verdlanco">(talk)</a> 16:02, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is a vanity page posted by user JimJast to promote his own pet non-standard cosmology that no one else in the field even remotely accepts. JimJast is an astronomy student who wants to develop his idea, but wikipedia is not the place for it. 67.172.158.8 18:22, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Dilate</b>, err...<b>delete</b>. Not because it's a non-standard cosmology, though.

<li>It should be noted that the bbc tech/sci news department do a lot of these fluff pieces, many of them about interesting or fun but (in my opinion) non-notable subjects.

<li>And or course that always comes down to the individual's opinion of what notability, uh, denotes. And I don't intend to say that mine is correct or yours is incorrect.

<p>It isn't really unexpected or peculiar for pronounciations of foreign place names to change when they are adopted in other languages - in fact, it's practially the norm. The nation is <b>full</b> of cities/towns with French, Spanish and German names that are pronounced "wrong" ... as for American Indian names, they're butchered all over the place. The same thing happens in reverse, with English words adopted in foreign-language countries. So I think much of the basis of this article is short-sighted. But maybe that's just me. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 18:40, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, not short-sighted, but perhaps inadequately described. I don't disagree with your main point, but it is the case that when referring to Ohio cities, the names are often inadvertently mispronounced because of it. Yeah, it happens all the time and it is a natural result of adopting words from other languages, but it seems to me that it's worth noting what the actual differences are. <a href="../../../a/c/s/User%7EAcsenray_d459.html" title="User:Acsenray">Acsenray</a> 19:15, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I have long felt that Ohio is particularly prone to this sort of oddity, but in reality it's probably not any worse than any other state. More appropriate, perhaps, would be to have similar lists for all states (and, hey, other countries) or at least not to imply in this article that Ohio is unique in this regard. -[[User:Aranel|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>")]] 23:40, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was voted for deletion once before, and the decision was made to keep it. As a historian, I spent great effort in attempting to clarify the innuendo and to flush out this entry. Nothing exists. The only pertinent information is this: Weiss and Epstein worked together on the Beatles American tours. That doesn't even need to be merged into the Beatles article; a simple edit will do, since it's a one-liner under the "history" section. Everything else in the Weiss entry are "weaselisms." Weiss may well be remembered by industry insiders; but does that constitute POV or fact? Check all the websites; his name isn't mentioned in either the Turtles or Tom Jones.</p>
<p>That it is well-written (thank you very much) does not preclude that this is NOT weaselism and therefore, does not belong in Wikipedia. I don't think authors often ask that their article entry be deleted. After a great deal of time and serious effort, I am reluctant, but adamant: there is nothing informative here. Nor is it likely that anyone can dig up anything substantive.</p>

<ul>
<li>The way to do this is with a Move. Although this could be done while the VfD is in process, there are so many ways this could cause confusion that it's better to wait and see whether it survives. For now, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenWilson_3b1d.html" title="User:BenWilson">BenWilson</a> should place a note on Talk:LexiconRPG saying that if it survives VfD he intends to move it to LexiconGame and explain why. The sole editor (except for the VfD nominator) has requested deletion of LexiconGame. It is essentially duplicate content from LexiconRPG so deleting it loses nothing important. It would have to be deleted to permit LexiconRPG to be moved later. For these reasons, I have deleted it now. If anyone wants it restored, just let me know. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:19, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
