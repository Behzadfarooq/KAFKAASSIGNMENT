<li>How did this band become less notable now than a year ago? I thought it was once notable, always notable. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 11:02, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have looked at the article, he seems to have made some top twenty list, and he has released an album. There must be some reason the last VfD ended with a keep. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 11:57, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Two questions:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Does White Dawg exist?</dd>
<dd>2. Did he have a top 20 hip hop hit, "Restless"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As I see it, if the answer to both questions is yes, then it should be kept; otherwise probably not. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:11, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>To clarify, I now believe that the answer to both is yes and therefore I vote <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:18, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Delete: I voted delete before, and I do now. There is probably hoaxing involved, plus a possibility of misapplication of titles, etc. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:07, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and I DO invoke <b><a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a></b>. White Dawg DOES exist. He DOES make records. This is notable. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> 13:43, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. On a lighter note, somewhere in BJAODN is an article on mental retardation. A picture of this rapper is included, along with the caption 'Even mentally retarded people can live relatively successful lives', or something like that. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 15:08, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. How could you say White Dawg is not a real rapper? See his official website: www.whitedawgonline.com ... dig up old Billboard charts and see that his single "Restless" was a top 20 hit... do a search on a peer-to-peer network and you'll see many of his songs listed. In the earlier "votes for deletion," it was noted that there's been newsgroup discussion about him for the last six years. Votes for deletion based on him "not being real" are based on ignorance. What "hoax" is involved??? Someone should make more clear charges if they're going to use them to justify deleting an article. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrowardPlaya_b00a.html" title="User:BrowardPlaya">BrowardPlaya</a> 17:04, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blu_Cantrell_d784.html" title="Blu Cantrell">Blu Cantrell</a> listed on VfD and she only had 1 top 20 hit in the US. 172.128.157.85 18:50, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But she made #2 on the US <i>overall</i> charts and #1 on the UK <i>overall</i> charts. Top 20 on the <i>hip-hop</i> chart is not nearly as notable. This is right at the edge of notability for me, so <b>no vote</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:09, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Had one top 20 hit on the rap charts in 1999, has released an album and has an Allmusic page. This makes him notable within genre for mine. <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE4781ED947A57520EFB71670E1FA5CDE2DFE62D9BA5007656392940454880C71ED59E695C8AEF870AB7BAFFF2BE85905D7CFE453F9CC0640&amp;uid=MIW010505251545&amp;sql=11:5p861v71zzha~T1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE4781ED947A57520EFB71670E1FA5CDE2DFE62D9BA5007656392940454880C71ED59E695C8AEF870AB7BAFFF2BE85905D7CFE453F9CC0640&amp;uid=MIW010505251545&amp;sql=11:5p861v71zzha~T1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia already includes many other articles linked to this rapper which are fairly well-written and come up high on Google searches. White Dawg isn't enormously popular, but is better known than many other individuals who have articles on Wikipedia. Personally, I was aware of White Dawg's music years ago. Btw, this already went through vfd and the consensus was to keep. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMaxwell_e603.html" title="User:JMaxwell">JMaxwell</a> 20:46, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I remember this chap having a pretty poor-quality 'featured article' candidate-ship-hood a while back. I say delete, because he's not notable enough as a straightforward pop star, and not funny enough as a clever joke or amusing novelty, as with <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_Willis_4120.html" title="Wesley Willis">Wesley Willis</a> or the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldie_Lookin%27_Chain_ec88.html" title="Goldie Lookin' Chain">Goldie Lookin' Chain</a> - who would have merited an article even before their recent commercial success, in my opinion, and are far superior to White Dawg, both lyrically and rhythmically, and also philosophically. And <i>you knows it</i>. Note that although I lapse into humour at the end of this VFD vote, I really do genuinely vote <b>delete</b>, am I clear? Yes.-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 21:03, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP!!!!!!!</b> White Dawg is a total thug and is crunked out. Yall peoplez trying to kick him off are lame HATERZ. Why you gotta hate on a thug just because hes succesful and be pimpin the bitches and showin off his BLING? And to the punk that pointed out that the radio station that nominated White Dawg is owned by him so its fake, LIES, THAT IS A LIE DAWGG, PROVE THAT SHIZ. PROVE IT, I WANT EVIDENCE. This entire nomination against White Dawg is a farce. Check it out yo:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>1: What changed from the first VfD to this that would merit deletion?</li>
<li>2: If White Dawg is deleted I suppose its fine then for me to speedy delete most artists that <i>only</i> have a TOP TWENTY hit?</li>
<li>3: What is the reason for this VfD? Anyone? Hoax? What Hoax? Please establish how he is not notable following the WP: MUSIC guidelines.</li>
<li>4: There is obviously animosity against White Dawg, I added a White Dawg award to the pages of the users who voted KEEP and thus voted to defend Crunk. They were all removed. I dont see any Barnstars being removed. Can anyone EXPLAIN THIS?? <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">User: Meelar</a> is to blame for this.</li>
<li>5: Look at the reasons people are voting delete, such as what gang signs are being thrown, this is not a valid reason to vote!</li>
<li>6: The anti-White Dawg hate is prevalent in BJAODN where one of you haters compared to White Dawg to a mentally retarded person. HATERS.</li>
<li>7: People voted to delete this while the nomination was still a personal attack rap and no reason was given. You're telling me people can judge whether to delete this solely based on a PERSONAL ATTACK?</li>
<li>8: To the guy who keeps saying this is a hoax or parody. HOW COULD IT BE A HOAX OR PARODY OR SATIRE? EXPLAIN PLEASE. WHITE DAWG IS A THUG LIFE GANGSTA, THIS IS FOR REALS AIGHT, HE AINT PARODYING NOOO ONNNEEE.</li>
<li>9: THere is evidence of stacking here. Notice the votes from the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th voters are all from feminists. It is established in the <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thug_Ride_d821.html" title="Thug Ride">Thug Ride</a> page that feminists have attacked White Dawg before just because he plays/pimps dem bitches and hoes like it aint no thang. So what if he fucks a girl, records it and tells her "NOW GET THE FUCK OUT BITCH!!!"? That aint no thang. Yet feminists have stacked this shiz and voted against him to take th #1 Mack Daddy down cuz they cant handle not having him for themselves. WORD.</li>
<li>10: Once again, the nomination of real thugs to get the WHITE DAWG AWARD FOR DEFENSE OF CRUNKTITUDE is being held down by the feminist anti-rap haterz cabal.</li>
<li>11: Vandals have clearly messed with this page ON PURPOSE to defame White Dawg, such as adding false links, until White Dawg cleared them the link that said GANGSTA RAP led to RETARD and the one that said LIL JON led to LIL RICHARD. This could have been fixed by anyone but was not because they wish to see this article fail.</li>

<p>KEEP - White Dawg is crunk and represents the FLA. He is a beautiful man and a humanitarian. "I want to lick the pussy" is one of the classic amalgamations of lyricism, artistry, and scholarhsip of our time. White Dawg forever! - Jack Bauer</p>

<ul>
<li>Your probably right, however I'm talking about stealing the jpg of the cover from a site instead of scanning the cover yourself. If I may contrive a stupid scenario: What if I photograph the cover of a magazine and put it on a website. Can somebody else then steal that image from my website under magazine cover fair use? What if I dropped some cookie crumbs on the magazine and they ended up in the photo? Those crumbs are <i>my</i> art!&#160;&#160;—<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeknic_08a9.html" title="User:Teknic"><span style="color:green">Teknic</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeknic_5e83.html" title="User talk:Teknic">T</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Teknic_013e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Teknic">M</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Teknic_ebe3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Teknic">C</a></sup> 19:21, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, on the other hand, when the magazine site's already got a direct Photoshop dump of the cover, how could your scan *ever* be as good? Even if you had a mint copy and knew how to set up your scanner software correctly, the official rip is still faster and better. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 06:33, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly my point. Their image file would be far better than anybody else could do which is why they should have sole rights to it (the jpg). &#160;&#160;—<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeknic_08a9.html" title="User:Teknic"><span style="color:green">Teknic</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeknic_5e83.html" title="User talk:Teknic">T</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Teknic_013e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Teknic">M</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Teknic_ebe3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Teknic">C</a></sup> 23:17, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
