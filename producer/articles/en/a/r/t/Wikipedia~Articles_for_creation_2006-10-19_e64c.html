<p>She is a spanish teacher of Spanish Literature at the University of Barcelona. She is known for her investigations on the author of "El Lazarillo" and its meaning. In her investigations she used the first editions of "El lazarillo"; it has been very important for her the discovery of one ancient edition in a village in Extremadura. Her statements can be summarized as following: 1.- The author of "El lazarillo" was Alfonso de Vald√©s. 2.- The expression "breaking shoes" means having sexual intercourse. 3.- The main aim of "El lazarillo" is to warn other people about the problems with confession because priests may break confession secret. 4.- The second aim of "El lazarillo" is to criticize the Catholic Church (it should be noted that Alfonso de Vald√©s followed Erasmisms). 5.- There is one page missing between the introduction and the first chapter in the four ancient and original books that we have; this sentence change the interpretation of this book and it was removed to make sure that censors did not ban the book (although they finally did).</p>

<p>Jaheeva</p>
<p>Jaheeva is an unemployed african amerian man who lives in New York City. He is the inspiration behind the Jaheevaist religion, created by Rudy Barret of Forest, virginia. The Jaheevaist religion isn't one of which most people are aware but it is noteable enough for several key factors. Jaheevaists believe in much of the same things as mainstream catholics but with one exception they believe in Jaheeva as christ's present day incarnation, yet they do not view it as an end times apocalyptic event.</p>

<p>A peasent revolt against the Yuen Dynasty in Northern China starting in 1351. It had its origins in peasent unrest caused by crop failures and floods of the 1330's but was a direct response to the assignment of 150,000 workers to rechannel the Yellow River and reopen the Grand Canal. The rebellion was based around a religious sect that regarded their leader as an incarnation of the bodhisattva Maitreya. The Red Turbans maruaded the surrounding area, even reaching as far as Korea where their attacks further weakend the Korean Koryo dynasty. The revolt was eventually stopped by the Yuan Dynasty, however, other rebellions eventually brought down the Yuan Dynasty and founded the Ming Dynasty in 1368.</p>

<p>Zarhan Fastfire was the lovemate and later lifemate of Rahnee the She-Wolf, second chief of the Wolfriders. Zarhan was a firstcomer and found himself drawn to the unpredictable wolfrider in spite of the many hardships that she put him through. Zarhan was able to conjure magic fire for use by his people and they say that it is one of these "pockets of magic" that went bad and later helped to spawn the creature Madcoil that decimated half of the Wolfrider tribe in the time of Bearclaw. Zarhan was ridiculed by the other firstcomers for trying to "tame" Rahnee, but his love for her would not let him forsake her, even though she often flew into fits of rage, lashing out at whomever was near. Even though Rahnee was so volitile, she did love Zarhan genuinly and counted on him to bring her back from what the Wolfriders call "the now", least she lose herself to the urges of the wolf-blood. Zarhan outlived his lifemate by many moons and it is not known exactly what happened to him once Rahnee died.</p>

<p>English rock/acid jazz group which began life in 1991 as a studio project for Acid Jazz Records, Mother Earth has a sound that is somewhere between the Small Faces and Santana but with a jazz/funk sensibility. Consisting of the core group of Matt Deighton (Guitar and vocals), Neil Corcoran (bass), Bryn Barklam (Hammond organ) and Chris White (drums), they have also included in their lineup Shauna Greene (vocals), Bunny, Xan (vocals), Jose Hadaway (drums), Kym Marsh (vocals), D.C Lee (vocals) and Meryl Kenton Forbes (vocals).</p>
<p>Their contemporaries in the UK scene are The Brand New Heavies, Corduroy, Skunkhour, Galliano, Incognito, James Taylor Quartet and Jamiroquai. They are arguably the best British band of the 1990‚Äôs to have never ‚Äúmade it‚Äù, however they built great support by their powerful live shows and impressive studio albums but were never able to translate this into massive record sales. After having parted ways in the late ‚Äò90‚Äôs Mother Earth reformed for some one-off gigs in 2001 and 2004 and in 2005 were rumored to be working on a new album.</p>

<b>Park head FC</b> Mitcham &amp; district league team</p>
<p>Park head FC were founded a while back. They are named Park Head as most of the players derive from an Irish background and share a love of The Glasgow Celtic Football Club, apart from Skipper Damien Adams who is a big Rangers fan. (He is also the tallest player in the team at 7'2) They have had some big players play for them, including Damien Adams who played for Sutton United, Aiden Hogan who played Trinity University Dublin, Colin Sexton who was at Millwall and Niall Dillon, who played in goal for the round towers, in a different sport.</p>
<p>Timmy "The bollocks" O'Donovan joined the ranks of the mighty hoops, and is their current penalty taker.</p>
<p>Paul "Ello mate" Allan is their all time top scorer, and has resisted offers from clubs in higher divisions on many occasions, mainly because he would be unable to embezzle money from any other team.</p>
<p>Their mascot is "Tugboat Tully", who always Shush shushes the team to victory, in his traditional tugboat outfit and with his usual care-free attitude. "Don't worry about it!"</p>
<p>Other notable players include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Joe Coffey</li>
<li>Gappy Malone</li>
<li>Rocky Falzon</li>
<li>Bernard "Banooly" Coyle</li>
<li>Pat "They're gonna taste great" O'Donovan</li>
<li>Garry "Gazza" McGovern</li>

<p>ModelUK.com was established in summer 2005 by Ali Kosari and former beauty queen Lucie Hide who runs the company to this day.</p>
<p>It is the first company of it's kind - possibly the largest pageant organisation in England, with the sole intention of creating a higher profile and a larger Miss England contest, leading to Miss World.</p>
<p>34 regional heats were held by the company for the 2006 Miss England contest - the most ever run by one company - making for the biggest Miss England final to date.</p>
<p>Miss Oxford, Eleanor Glynn, was discovered by ModelUK.com in October 2005 and went on to win the Miss England 2006 crown, taking her to Miss World.</p>
<p>ModelUK.com has created a turn around in the Miss England contest, bringing it into the 21st century.</p>

<p>The WOGS ie the Witnesses Of God's Salvation is a Christian hip hop ministry comprising of Patrick Patons Ocira (mostly known as PatO Plus) and Emmanuel J. Paul (mostly know as Emma Ends). The WOGS is an acronym for, "Take Him Everywhere, Witnesses Of God¬¥s Salvation", and according to the music group this name is derived from Acts 1:8. Started in 1999, the duos main purpose is to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The prominent face of the WOGS has been Christian Rap music by Emmanuel J. Paul (Emma Ends) and Patrick P. Ocira ( PatO Plus). Currently the group is based in Kampala, Uganda although they had several concerts in the East African region mainly in Kenya. The groups main focus is to change the non-biblical philosophies of hip hop with biblical ones and promote identity in Christ. As proclaimed musical evagelists of the Gospel, their current album "Kingdom Reality" stands to prove their point.</p>

<p><b>== Lun Bawang ==</b></p>
<p><br />
The Lun Bawang Community who were formerly identified as Murut (which means ‚Äòdregs‚Äô or ‚Äòrotten‚Äô‚Äì a derogatory terms championed by the Rajah Brooke, whose government wanted this community to be wiped off from the face of Borneo Island : "Let them die ‚Ä¶. Furthermore they are like an old shoe that has no value any more ‚Ä¶.the country would be better off if the Muruts were allowed to die out". (Jungle Fire, Drunk Before Dawn, A New Dawn Over Sarawak)) made up of one of the ethnic natives that occupied the Borneo Island for centuries. According to Tom Harrison (1959) and S. Runciman (1960), the Lun Bawang Community is one of the earlier settlers in the mountainous regions of central Borneo.</p>
<p>Today, a majority of the community still lives in Kalimantan Indonesia; 25,000 in Kalimantan, 2,000 in Sabah (prefers to be called as Lundayeh), more than 300 in Brunei (Crain 1978) and about 15,000 in the State of Sarawak (Sarawak Statistic Dept. 1980).In the State of Sarawak, they mostly live in the Limbang Division, especially in the District of Lawas.</p>
<p>The Brooke Regime (Government) considered the Lun Bawang Community as the worst and dangerous ethnic; the worst drunken people of Borneo, the dirtiest long house (Sarawak Gazette 1936), though the customs and traditional practices are not very much different compared to other ethnic groups in Sarawak, and that it is well accepted that the first Sultan of Brunei is a Lun Bawang from the family tree of Upai Semaring. It was because of the indifference attitude of Brooke Government ( Diseases were let to spread out) and coupled with lifestyle that was purely influenced by animism and taboos, that the population had greatly diminished from around 20,000 to 5,000 in the year 1907 and to 3,000 people in the year of 1937 (Reports of District Officers during that periods ‚Äì Sarawak Gazette; Drunk Be fore Dawn). The status of the Lun Bawang became worsen that the then District Officer reported that the Lun Bawang Community "is facing extinction".</p>
<p>At the time when the condition had become critical, God in His sovereign mercy performed a miracle, in that Christian Missionaries were allowed (previously forbidden by the Government in 1920s) to fully enter the Trusan valley sometimes in the 1930s to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. The community as a whole repented from their ancestral beliefs and became Christians. It was the missionaries from the Borneo Evangelical Mission from Australia that was responsible in bringing about the great changes to the Lun Bawang Community which ultimately catapult the formation of the Sidang Injil Borneo (Evangelical Church of Borneo) after the Second World War.</p>
<p>The changes brought about by the Christian teachings had greatly surprised the Raja Charles Vyner Brooke during his visit to Lawas in the year 1940 and commended the two missionaries that paid a courtesy call to him, saying :</p>
<p>"I am amazed at the change in the Murut tribe (Lun Bawang). I believe you have done more good in a few years (3 years) than the Government has done in forty"</p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the living condition of the Lun Bawang gradually improved and lifestyle became more systematic. All their ancestral beliefs, the grip to animism and taboos which they had practiced for centuries were removed completely so much so that some customs and cultures that could still be practiced were also wiped off. The changes also include various aspects like health, education and socio-economy. These changes have indirectly helped towards the increase of its populations.</p>

<p>Euro Fusion is a respected website that has been running since 2004. It covers all types of entertainment but its main focus is on gaming. It started as HayesMates, a small site made by a person called Chris, who made it a place for him and his friends to talk but in 2005 it was re-branded as HM-Fusion. It was from then that it became the site it is today with its own forum, pod cast and even its own clothing label. In June 2006 it turned into Euro Fusion, with evrything it had before but with a new design and instead of having just UK coverage it now has news from the whole EU. It has dedicated forum members and they sometimes meet up at events.</p>

<p>Aaron Ernest Sims is an American educator who was born October 29, 1968. He currently lives in Bolivar, Missouri, with his "wife" (many believe this to be his sister or perhaps, a blow-up doll) and is certified to teach both English and history subjects. Before becoming involved in the education realm, Sims was a local radio personality whose lively banter was beloved by all in the listening area of Southwest Missouri. Presently, he teaches high school courses at Hermitage High School in Hermitage, Misssouri, including Enlgish I, II, III, and IV. A tragic event that continues to haunt him to this day is a tragic hog-mauling incident that occured to him when he was a young man. However, he does not let this handicap keep him down.</p>

<p>Pablo Morgan Llwyd 20:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>- - - - - Peter Marselis Van Winkle (1814-1882) was born in New York City. He later moved with his family to Illinois, where his father died when Peter was still young. Left with little formal education and limited prospects, Peter, like many of his generation, went west in search of opportunity. He found it in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he built sturdy wagons to carry the '49ers to the California gold fields. He also designed a plow able to break the heavy prairie sod of western Benton and Washington Counties. Peter's first wife Ellenora Wilcoxen died at a young age. In 1840 he married Temperance "Tempy" Miller and the couple eventually had twelve children, nine of whom lived to adulthood. - - Peter used his profits from the wagon and plow business to go into lumbering in 1850. At first he had a simple oxen-powered sawmill about one mile east of the Van Winkle ferry (about two miles east of today's Horseshoe Bend Recreation area). In 1858 he moved to a hollow along Little Clifty Creek near War Eagle and built a steam-powered mill. Over the decades his business grew into an empire that stretched over thousands of acres and brought him and his family wealth and prestige. Peter once said, "Only a fool wishes for what he wants. A wise man works for it." - - Peter lived in a time when Americans believed that the resources of this continent were virtually boundless. Like his fellow lumberman, he did not worry about conserving the forests. In the pre-Civil War South most people also believed that there was nothing wrong with using the labor of enslaved African-Americans. Peter shared that belief and built his lumber business in part on slave labor. In the Ozarks slaves worked not on huge plantations but on farms, in households, and in industries. In 1850 just over 5% of Benton County's population was African-American; all but one were slaves. - - At the outbreak of the Civil War, Peter "owned" over a dozen slaves. Because he considered these human beings to be amongst his most valuable property, he took them to Texas in 1862 when the family fled the fighting in Northwest Arkansas. After the war some of his former slaves, now free men and women, returned with him to Arkansas. Some of the men helped Peter rebuild his home and business even though he could not afford to pay them at first. Presumably they would not have done so had Peter been a harsh master. But these men probably also realized that working for an ambitious man could offer them a chance to get ahead in life. - - Upon his return in 1866, Peter found his home and mill destroyed and $4,000 in buried gold missing. So he started over again, taking advantage of steam power at a time when his neighbors relied on water power to run their saw and grist mills. Peter built three small mills and a large, state-of-the-art lumber mill just north of his home in Van Winkle Hollow. The level of his industrial sophistication belied the notion of the backwards hillbilly. - - The mill's large 150-horsepower engine and three enormous boilers were purchased in St. Louis and shipped down the Mississippi River by barge to the Arkansas River. From there they were shipped to Van Buren (Crawford County) and hauled by oxen over the Boston Mountains. "Roads had to be chopped, bridges improvised, camps maintained and food provided for men and oxen." The huge flywheel was cast in sections and shipped by rail to Rolla, Missouri, which was, as Jay B. Iden noted in a 1924 article in the Fort Smith Times Record, - - . . . the nearest railroad point at that time. Twelve mules were required to haul it down over the mountain roads and there were many tip-overs and bog-downs before it was finally delivered. . . . It was in sections with a hub as large as a locomotive drive wheel. The sections fitted into the hub and were keyed in. When that was accomplished Peter Van Winkle mixed salt, vinegar, and iron turnings and tamped them into the fittings. That started rust and corrosion that fastened all the parts together so firmly they could not be separated. . . . The great fly wheel was so well balanced and had such great force in its momentum that after [the engineer] shut off the steam the force of the revolving fly wheel would keep the machinery in motion long enough to saw one more log. - - All this horsepower meant that Peter could run a number of pieces of equipment at one time, including a circular saw, a gang lathe, two planers, two rip saws, one shingle machine, and two molding saws. With its sixty-foot high smokestack, the mill housed equipment not only to saw logs but to make shingles, moldings, balusters, windows, doors, and cabinets. Customers could even buy kit homes, complete with house plans and all the necessary lumber. One such home belonged to Peter's son Robert E. Lee Van Winkle, who was twice elected mayor of Oklahoma City around the turn of the 20th century. - - Peter supplied lumber to rebuild not only Northwest Arkansas but parts of neighboring states as well. The props for the lead mines of southwest Missouri came from his mills as well as the lumber to build the Peel House in Bentonville and many of the homes and businesses in Victorian Eureka Springs. After Peter's daughter Mary married John Bell "Jack" Steele, a former turner or lathe operator at the mill, it's likely that Van Winkle lumber was used in the building of Captain Jack's general store in Springdale, now preserved on the grounds of the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History. - - Unfortunately Peter's old home, built with "the most perfect boards," was torn down in 1969. The bricks and lumber were sold to Harvey Jones of Jones Truck Lines and used in the construction of the school house and other buildings at Har-Ber Village, a "village of yesteryear," located in Grove, Oklahoma. But Peter's daughter Mary's home, which was patterned after her old homeplace in Van Winkle Hollow, still stands today at 303 Arkansas Street in Rogers. Undoubtedly the lumber for this stately two-story, wood-frame home came from her father's mill. - - Around 1874 Peter began sending wagon-loads of lumber to Fayetteville to be used in the construction of Old Main, the University of Arkansas' first permanent building. The builders used local materials because the nearest river port was 60 miles away and the nearest railroad was 150 miles away; Peter's mill was about 30 miles to the north. - - During Old Main's 1989-91 renovation, some of Peter's wonderful wood found its way into dumpsters, only to be rescued by carpenters and woodworkers who appreciated its tight grain, thickness, and history. The piece depicted here was removed during the construction of an elevator shaft by the former son-in-law of the donor, Curtis Fisher. It was examined by a University dendrochronologist (from the Greek dendron=tree and chronos=time) who identified the species as a short leaf pine with a pith (center) date of 1724 and a cutting date of 1874, making the original tree about 132 years old at the time of its felling. Pins were placed in the block to mark the years; single pin: decade, double pins: 50-year mark; and triple pins: the year 1800. (The 1820 pin is missing.) - - Peter was the first great entrepreneur in Northwest Arkansas history. He built roads to transport his lumber, started a ferry service across the White River, and in 1880 ran his own private telephone line from Fayetteville to the hollow. According to the 1880 U.S. Industrial Census, Peter's mill produced 1,300,000 board feet of lumber a year, worth about $134,000. Fifteen people, including a few children, worked at the mill between eight and ten hours a day for about six months each year. Daily wages ran between 75 cents and $2.00. - - Peter and his successor, son-in-law J.A.C. Blackburn, continued to run the lumber business with little concern for conservation. When Peter died Blackburn was able to buy out the interests of the other heirs and keep the business together. By 1889 he employed 50 men and owned 17,000 acres of land. No wonder that he was known as "the Lumber King of Northwest Arkansas." Within just a few decades the Van Winkle lands were stripped of marketable timber. - - By the early 1900s land that once had been a source of wealth had become a burden. After several failed attempts Blackburn was finally able to sell his thousands of acres of depleted timberland. In 1928 Roscoe Hobbs of the Hobbs Western Tie and Timber Company began purchasing this land, which had begun to renew itself. By the time he died in 1965 Hobbs owned over 14,000 acres, and his will requested that if at all possible, the land should not be sold. - - But one 11,644-acre tract was sold to the State of Arkansas in 1979 and the future Hobbs State Park-Conservation Area was born. Thanks to research efforts by Peter's descendants and the Arkansas Archeological Survey, when the park is fully developed the legacy of Peter Van Winkle, his family, and his workers will be preserved and shared at the mill- and home-site trail (opening to the public in 2005) and in an interpretive center. But visitors to the site won't see Peter's legendary flywheel. As Jay B. Iden noted in 1924, "A few years ago a group of workmen went into the woods about twelve miles southwest of Rogers and with charges of dynamite blew a 24-foot fly wheel into fragments. The fragments were carted away and sold for junk during that period just past [WW I] when old iron was worth a lot of money." - - - CREDITS - - "Story of the Old VanWinkle Mill," Jay B.

<p>Parsi 13 gang was formed as just Parsi under the leadership of Haj in Shiraz, Iran, 1984 as a political party against the Islamic Revolution of Iran. At first, there was an estimated 40 members. Three were executed, while 12 sent to jail (including Haj). The majority fled to Turkey and Germany, while some went the united states, Los Angelas. They noticed that Persians were frequently harrased by black gangs. One day they all gathered up and reformed the gang, but as Parsi 13 to show alliance with the Mexican gang Surenos. Today the gang has approx. 200 members, mostly in Los Angelas, Orange County, San Diego, or San Jose. They cause little trouble usually getting into street racing and the selling of Marijuana</p>

<p>The Holy Empire of Avio-Searth began when Dean was crowned Duke in April of 1988. Duke Dean sought secession from the crown and independent soverignty. After years of research and exploration, in 2004 a small uncharted isle was discovered in international waters that was unclaimed by any government. He has taken the Style and Title of: His Imperial &amp; Royal Highness, Dean, by the grace of God, Prince of the Empire of Avio-Searth, regent of the Empire and of His other realms and territories, defender of the Christian faith, Grand Duke of The United Duchies of Avion and Searth Duke Dean sought independent soverignty, and it was granted on June 9, 1988 with the condition made that the Dean could retain the title of Sovereign Duke, but no land would be granted as it was still under the rule and authority of the Kingdom. His title became Duke of Avion (Duke of the Air, i.e. without land).</p>
<p>Since that time Duke Dean sought land that could be claimed as an independent soverignty. During the interim, Duke Dean founded the First Christian Church of Avion (later just known as the Church of Avion) as a foundation for his humanitarian outreaches. He continues to be heavily involved in humanitarian projects and Christian charities.</p>
<p>After years of research and exploration, in 2004 a small area of land was discovered in international waters. It is hundereds of miles from the territorial boundaries of any nation, and was unclaimed by any government.</p>
<p>The duke secured rights to this land and claimed it as the Duchy of Avion. Shortly thereafter the expedition discovered another land mass in the South Pacific and Duke Dean claimed it as the Principality of Searth, and combined the two into the Holy Empire of Avio-Searth.</p>
<p>He called it The Holy Empire of Avio-Searth because he believed that it was a directive from God, and an Holy Appointment to build Him an Empire.</p>
<p>Dean has submitted himself and his authority to God Almighty as Emperor and to Jesus Christ as King and Lord of all. He has taken the Style and Title of: His Imperial Highness, Dean, by the grace of God, Prince of the Empire of Avio-Searth, regent of the Empire and of His other realms and territories and defender of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Prince Dean and the Royal Family are considered to be "In Exile" as the land is not inhabitable at this time, and there are no plans to develop it anytime in the near future as the Prince feels that the money and time involved can be better used to benefit mankind.</p>
<p>Prince Dean has decreed that although the land exists, and was rightfully and legally claimed by right of discovery, and unclaimed by any other soverignty or government; in the interest of national security its location will remain secret to prevent any other claimants from trying to usurp the empire.</p>
<p>Avio-Searth is now awarding titles of nobility to exceptional people, you may also apply to become a member of an Order of Chivalry.</p>
