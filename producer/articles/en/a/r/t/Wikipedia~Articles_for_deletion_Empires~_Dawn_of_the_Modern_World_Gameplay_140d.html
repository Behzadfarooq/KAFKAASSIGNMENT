<li>ummmm, that is exactly what an instruction manual does, explains how something works. This is a guide on how to play the game and on how various facets of the game work. That makes this a game guide in violation of official policy. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 02:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>An instruction manual explains <i>how to do</i> something, that's what "instruction" means. An encylopedia's duty is exactly to explain how various facets of the game work. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you ever read an instruction manual for a computer game? They usually include both information on how to play the game as well as information on what various things do so that the player knows how best to use them. Anyway, why don't I just quote <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at Wikihow or our sister project Wikibooks." I have often been at odds with you on AfD, but this is the first time I have seen you blatantly disregard an official policy. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Game manuals obviously have to explain how the game works, in the same way an encylopedia does. We've already established that this isn't a "how-to". <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: this is Wikipedia, not GameFaqs. I doubt Wikibooks would accept this either, so transwikifying is not an option. In addition to being a game guide, it's also largely incomprehensible: what on earth is "Citzens <i>[sic]]</i> build buildings, with the exception of England and the United Kingdom" supposed to mean, and why is it such an important fact that it's in the lead section? Bizarre. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know about it not being able to transfer to wikibooks. I think that that if you are completly unmovable on keeping this, other solutions can be found. You're saying that wikibooks won't accept this? All it takes is a little love and a little editing to make it up to snuff for transfering (I've already done a spell check and rewrote the into). If you are not willing to accept that solution we could tranfer to it to <a href="http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Main_Page|" class="external text" title="http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Main_Page|" rel="nofollow">strategy wiki</a>. Your basis for no one else not accepting this is justified, but I think fixing it is fizable (and already underway). Of course I'd like to keep it, but I'm willing to negoiate.

<li><b>Keep</b> Um...I'm the person that wrote this article, as well as much of <a href="../../../d/a/w/Empires%7E_Dawn_of_the_Modern_World_2703.html" title="Empires: Dawn of the Modern World">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a>, and I wasn't aware that I was breaking policy with this. I thought it added understanding to the game article if someone wants to look further into the game or how it's played. I know it looks like I suck at writing, but I haven't had time to edit this and Empires: Dawn of the Modern World simultaneously. I did most of this myself, but I could see about minimizing it or wikifying it if you guys don't like it. If you look at the main article I was able to summarize the gameplay with the knowledge in mind that if someone wanted to look up more into the gameplay they could so. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_candidates_d0d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article candidates">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a> is up for GA nomination right now, and I'm just worried it will be failed because the gameplay article was suddenly wiped from the face of the Earth, which would make the Gameplay section look rather pathetic. I'm also rather sad that Indrian decided to go after this one article. I thought I was doing a good thing by making this only one article. I noticed that articles like Runescape have 16 articles that could be considered exactly the same thing as I'm writing, so would it be better for me to split this into a few more articles and you guys can decide which sections should be up for deletion? I'm really up for any solution other than deleting, and I'm hoping that can be done.--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 21:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with a lot of video game articles like this one (as well as articles about TV series and books) is that they seem to cater to people who are familiar with the topic...<i>extremely</i> familiar with the topic. Maybe if articles like this one could be written more for people who have never played the game (or never played video games <i>at all</i>, *gasp*) they would fit in with the other articles a bit more easily. As it stands, I can't really make a decision about this article because it doesn't relate much of anything to real life<sup>TM</sup>. If the article is kept or userfied, a severe amount of <b>wikification</b> and <b>general cleanup in tone and spelling</b> is needed. But it may have a shot. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 01:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I cannot understand why someone would want to delete this long and informative article. Some people don't understand this game and think games of this sort have no importance. This viewpoint is not correct in my opinion: many people think this is important. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi

<li>A game isn't important, noteworthy, relevant or has encyclopedic value just because someone claims it has in the middle of a pile of baseless accusations and personal attacks. I suggest that if you try to defend the article you keep your arguments objective and on topic. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 11:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>A very sharp and ironic comment. Can you help me identify what in my comment constituted an "attack" rather than a harmless statement of my opinion? I would like that. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>In your vote, you stated that the people voting delete do not understand the game or its importance. However, the reason given for deletion is that the article violates policy by being a game guide and no one here has advocated that the article about the game itself be deleted. Therefore, your comment is a straw man because it attacks an issue that you made up rather than one in controversy, and it is an attack because you call people ignorant rather than attacking the policy arguement. Anything still unclear? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It may have been a straw man (that depends on whether you think there was some "real issue" that I was ducking in my post), but was no attack. What I wrote: "Some people don't understand this game and think games of this sort have no importance." What you say I wrote: <i>people voting delete</i> do not understand the game or its importance. Those are two different statements. If I wrote, "people voting delete" have no idea about the importnace of the game, that might be a personal attack. But I was making a more general point that the article deals with a subject about which some (most?) people know or care very little but yet that should not preclude it from being on wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>
