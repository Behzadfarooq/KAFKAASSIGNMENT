<p>This is Halifax. I have taken back my previous assertion. We do not wish to advertise, but understand that Wikipedia is place to come for answers. If one hears talk of Sanjan on the street, this is a wonderful place to come for answers. More defense is on its way. Give us a chance, we are not looking for money, or even followers.</p>

<li>Sanjan, though it has not yet been recognized by congress as an official religion, is in fact, a real religion, as has been outlined by one S.W.M. according to his spiritual vision.

<li>Yes. Yes it is quite a religion. What I see in the sanjan followers is no different then what i see in christian and jewish followers.

<li><b>Comment:</b> There's a big difference between Sanjan and Judeo-Christianity. It's a case of sheer numbers. Over 1/6th of the world's population is a believe in the Judeo-Christian faiths.

<li>I would kindly like to point out in response to Xcali's comment that Judaism and Christianity began as small faiths as well. Sanjan is one of the fastest growing belief systems in America.

<li>Where exactly do counter-arguments suggest that deletion of the article will destroy the religion? Sanjan will remain strong and growing whether or not the article exists. The question is whether or not you want to undermine and show a complete lack of respect for the spiritual beliefs of others by deleting the article. The issue is freedom of religion, plain and simple. <small><i>unsigned edit by 69.231.58.181 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.231.58.181.html" title="User talk:69.231.58.181">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.231.58.181_5272.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.231.58.181">contribs</a>)</i></small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: True, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all started small and grew <u>over thousands of years</u> into major forces in world events. <s>You should probably check back with Wikipedia in 3900 years, 2010 years, and 1490 years (respectively) and resubmit your article.</s> {struck with apologies for the snide tone.} At this point, it is still non-encyclopedic, POV and advertorial. Also, as to the "freedom of religion", Wikipedia is NOT a US government institution, it is an international collective enterprise; it has specific rules which detail what kinds of material are appropriate. The reason that your articles are on this page is so the worldwide Wiki community can collectively determine if they meet those guidelines. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a> 21:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I find the comment about "check[ing] back with Wikipedia in 3900 years, 2010 years, and 1490 years" to be offensive and an insult to my intelligence, considering that, as far as I know, no human could possibly live this long. Perhaps you should save your jokes and sarcasm for amateur night at your local comedy club, or maybe even to impress some ladies at the pub. Otherwise, your apparently witty comments have no place in this serious discussion. In addition to this, I fail to see how the articles are non-encyclopedic, POV or advertorial. However, the articles are <i>informational</i>, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Wiki has any policy prohibiting information. <small><i>unsigned edit by 69.231.58.181 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.231.58.181.html" title="User talk:69.231.58.181">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.231.58.181_5272.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.231.58.181">contribs</a>)</i></small></p>

<li>I would also suggest that if you took offense to those comments, you need to develop a thicker skin.

<p>Alright, so far we know that Wikipedia is not a) a soapbox and b) a crystal ball. I might also point out that it is not c) a state of mind or d) a toaster.

<li><b>Comment</b> In a way, it's up to each user of the Wikipedia to define it for themself. There are guidelines, but in the end, they are just guidelines, not rules.

<li>I respect your opinions, and appreciate your support, user, but the purpose here is not to perpetuate arguments. If the Wikipedia team choose to be unresponsive to (or even prejudiced toward) our burgeoning faith, they have every right. Wikipedia is not a democracy, it's true, and if the tides of the modern age swell against us, then we must continue to look to the skies with or without the knowledge of the online community. --Bndr McFarlane 21:55, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clarification:</b> Wikipedia is neither for or against any religion. It is non-denominational. However, Wikipedia strives only to include information that can be verified by <b>independent sources</b>. Since I can't find any, and its adherents here have provided none, I have no choice but to support the removal of the articles in question. It has nothing to do with my personal feelings on the religion, which are in fact non-existent. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 22:25, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My name is Tomas, and Sanjan has saved my life. I tried Christianity, Judaism, even Zen buddhism, but it wasn't until a monk at the Zen Center of Los Angeles referred me to the religion of Sanjan that i found something that really spoke to me. <i><small>unsigned comment by 68.66.102.239 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.66.102.239_59a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.66.102.239">contribs</a>)</small></i></li>

<li>Okay, let's back up a bit. Most Wikipedians (including Jimbo in his <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance</a> post) feel there are two essential elements for any encyclopedic article: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Is it <b>possible</b> to create a Sanjan article that passes both tests? IMHO, you cannot write one that passes either. The religion is "secret" and "exclusive", so verification is only possible by referring to Sacred Texts (a tautology), or by deferring to adherents (which violates objectivity). Since only adherents will be able to effectively edit Wikipedia articles, POV is inescapable. Until such time as Sanjan becomes a discernable, well-known influence in society or a topic of wide public discourse, I do not think encyclopedic articles can be created. PS: The list of things Wikipedia is not is found <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">here</a>. Also, I am not anti-Sanjan. I have as much respect for your faith as any other; I just have no faith in the encyclopedic value of your article. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a> 22:49, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>in response, the post "i have heard of sanjan and i know people that follow. unsigned edit by 207.200.116.6 (talk • contribs)" from this anonymous user, who is obviously not an "adherent", gives an objective verification of Sanjan's relevence. --24.126.43.134 22:53, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - A Google search for "Sanjan religion" (no quotes) returns 827 sites. As far as I can tell, they seem to refer to a kingdom of Sanjan, which is a part of the Zoroastrian religion. That said, I believe that your religion exists, and I believe that you follow it closely, and I believe that to you, it is your religion. I also believe that those who are mocking you are wrong in doing so. However, it cannot be argued that your religion, due to secrecy, cannot be verified in regards to any information that we put down. Its notability to the general world is not significant (again, I quote the Google search). I (and I hope we) are not anti-Sanjan, merely anti-unnotable articles. When your religion has grown and is more notable for an encyclopedia, I have no doubt that an article will be allowed. -- <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabhan_df88.html" title="User:Cabhan">Cabhan</a> 17:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
