I was originally going to vote keep, but when I saw the nominator's reasons and ran my own Google search, I was not strongly swayed enough to vote delete, but did not wish to vote keep either.

<li><b>Delete</b> Because all the admins of and frequent editors of encyclopedia dramatica come to wikipedia under tons of names each and alter the article to promote the website. If it's kept, the article should be reduced to a much shorter article, like "encyclopedia dramatica contains non-serious articles, which on very rare occasion are funny." April Furs Day should be left in though. I wonder if 4chan will do it this year like last. A more significant reason for is moving is that the domain is encyclopedia not encyclopaedia, and there is no "ae" key on keyboards, so it needs to be renamed at least. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 05:51, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

I think you'll notice that 499,000 is more than 18400, and that 8,201 is a higher rank than 32,000. So in terms of just pure stats, Uncyclopedia is literally about 4 times more notable than ED. Also you have to take into consideration all the extremely notable newspapers Uncyclopedia has been featured in. The source? You may have heard of it, it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncyclopedia#Notability" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncyclopedia#Notability" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.

Uncyclopedia has been featured in The New York Times, the Boston Herald, and the London Guardian among others. Believe me, I've had four of my own articles from Uncyclopedia cited in some of these newspapers. The best ED can come up with is a linkfilter quote from a year-and-a-half ago.

<li>Before you (and the ED crew) go spreading even more misinformation about me, I'll thank you to remember one thing. I went on my 'own personal fight' because <a href="http://nathanr.com/misc/lj-drama-archive.jpg" class="external text" title="http://nathanr.com/misc/lj-drama-archive.jpg" rel="nofollow">misinformation was being used</a> about me in the LJ Drama article (and kept getting reverted back, and absolutely no attempt was made to verify the info with me which made it a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). Think about that next time you make accusations about what I supposedly did that aren't true. I remind you of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. (Do not damage the reputation of other Wikipedians should be a policy as well).

<li>I merely clicked the link on your webpage and noticed that you have a nice message directed to visitors from Encyclopedia Dramatica on your main page. It wasn't a personal attack, I was merely stating you have a grudge against Encyclopedia Dramatica -- it isn't a secret either, because you mention it on the main page of your site. I wasn't saying you were wrong or right; I don't know the backstory and I obviously wouldn't have any facts to back it up. Just stating that you do dislike them a lot, which I think that is true. Linking people to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> when they are only stating obvious facts is also a bit of an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a>, isn't it? (Also, I don't think they care about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or any of our other policies, considering their wiki isn't Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Notability is questionable (this is a recreate of a page twice deleted, kept the third time). This is a rather small website and rather limited in scope and activity. This article appears to be being used as a sandbox, a soapbox or an advertisement for a website; info the owners of that site don't want included has been repeatedly deleted via various means including sockpuppetry and DMCA misuse. Unless this can be dramatically cleaned up and merged somewhere else (such as a list of wikis on similar/related topics), this smacks more of "I want to advertise my website on the Wikipædia" than of actual useful encyclopædic content. I question whether we need an entire article about this one individual wiki. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlb_f511.html" title="User:Carlb">carlb</a> 17:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b>. It has enough notability to at least deserve a mention.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I admit that I do not care for this website, but that's not why I think this article should be deleted. <b>Wikipedia is not a web directory</b> and <b>Wikipedia articles are not advertisements</b>. The article does not read in an encyclopediac style and with the subject matter, it doesn't seem like it could. The website itself centers on non-notability, so any description thereof would be non-notable. The history of the website isn't notable, the content isn't, and thus an article wouldn't be (and isn't). The site <i>is</i> notable, IMO, but not more than dicdef. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 19:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Not a merge, per se. Perhaps a <i>mention</i> in a relevant article (of which I can't think of any), but there isn't much notability to it besides its definition.

Basically <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> tricked people who posted furry art to post in this one area (instead of on their anonymous area) on April 1st and a few days later as an <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_fools.html" title="April fools">April fools</a> day joke, their admins banned everyone who posted there.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nn per nominator. Also as <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">user:Keitei</a> point out above, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a lot of things</a>. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 03:44, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I'd like to make a comment about this stuff in general</b>. I should say that there are millions, maybe even TEN millions, of sites out there, and just because a site has an Alexa rank of 50000, or even 200000, doesn't automatically make it non-notable. Many of the sites with &lt;10000 Alexa ranks are mostly sites for corporations such as ESPN.com, adultswim.com, and things that have notability outside the web. I know what the Wikipedia guidline is (and, for the record, it is NOT policy), and I must say it's pretty flawed. Something can be very popular and referenced and still have low Alexa ranks. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starmen.net.html" title="Starmen.net">Starmen.net</a> and SMBHQ, for example, have Alexa ranks of 200,000 approximately, and they're still some of the most popular sites on the web. Both sites have been referenced in MAJOR PUBLICATIONS, yet all people care about around here are numbers and statistics. And people say things like "delete: non-notable" without providing any evidence. Usually those who say it is notable provide evidence to back it up. A site does not have to fall under certain statistics to be notable.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as to notability, it's not in the article, and probably should be, but ED has gotten press coverage. It's been noted by the Washington Post that hacker groups attacking <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> have used ED to claim responsibility. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 05:34, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above reasons. notable, covered in various 'real media'. Cleanup the article if necessary, however a badly written article is hardly a reason for deletion. Also this site has a much more favorable alexa traffic ranking than <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowikis.html" title="Yellowikis">yellowikis</a>, a spam haven project using the same mediawiki software, and that article seems to have been kept (voted without logging in before, fixing this now) --timecop 07:57, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable. Also, this is a bad faith nomination. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> 07:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I've had my difficulty with keeping this article NPOV a while ago.. Things are better.. Encyclopedia Dramatica is definitly (in my opinion) notable. I have no doubt in my mind about this. --<a href="../../../d/e/p/User%7EDepakote_443b.html" title="User:Depakote">Depakote</a> 08:02, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Seems to be pretty quiet of late, and lacking in notability, maybe cut <i>way</i> back to a stub, similiar in length to the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowikis.html" title="Yellowikis">Yellowikis</a> article mentioned above.--<a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvisThePrince_8a5e.html" title="User:ElvisThePrince">ElvisThePrince</a> 09:54, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
