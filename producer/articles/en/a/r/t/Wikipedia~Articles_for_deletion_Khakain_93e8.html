<li><b>Keep</b> - 'A page should not be cast away as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia, and therefore, lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it should be noted that an article is not a "vanity" page simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is to salient material and not overtly promotional.' <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhakain_d59b.html" title="User:Khakain">Khakain</a> 22:38, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DELETE</b> - I am the person who they (The members of that forum) are naming on that entry. Khakain is the name of my novel, Khakain the Coming of the Chosen One, I wrote it in 1994 and posted a few chapters on my literary site "Unlimited Fantasy". These members registered the domain name out of spite for me because I shut down their community from my Zelda video game site because they would harass other users on the community, myself, and such. I was hosting the image they think is "Max Fichtl" on my private server and it was hacked without my permission and paraded around thier own forum as some trophy. They have subsequently over the past few years on several occasions attempted to discover my personal identity. At one point in time they posted my phone number on their forum and made prank calls and harrassed my family as late as 3 AM at night. Recently after contacting the teenager, *deleted by said teenager*, who registered the domain and firmly asking for the entire removal of the users attempting to steal my identity, he transferred ownership that day of the domain to an Australian, Andrew Maher, to what he thinks would wash his hands of the issue. This entire entry on Wikipedia is designed to be inflamitory and harrass me. I have attempted at editing the entry 3 times already to remove personal information and harrassment, and replace the entry with the accuracy of what Khakain actually is however each time it was reverted to what it was before by members of their community who likely share the "Khakain" user account, "Castle Guard" (John M.) as well is a member of their forum classified as the "Historian." I have collected an orgy of evidence on the individuals at that forum, including the location of their colleges, and their current residencies, however this is only some of them, many have managed to remain anonymous, however they've left a digital trail online which would likely be easy to follow. Many of them pride themselves in spamming the message boards I currently am co-administrator for with Hentai Pornography and spamming bot programs. I DO NOT WANT my personal information displayed in a public location online, to have my or anyone else in my family's name slandered in that way, this is a form of online cyberstalking as defined by the FBI's computer Crimes Division, and falls under their jurisdiction because it is occuring as a conspiracy between multiple individuals from several states including countries like Canada and Australia. And if the issue is not resolved in due time, I will be pursuing whatever legal recourses are available to me up to and including litigation. I hope that the users of Wikipedia see the perspective I'm coming from and remove the entry and ban users associated with creating this filth. I want to be left alone and I want to be anonymous on the internet and go about my work in peace!

<li><b>Comment</b> And posting the full names of those you don't like here ISN'T some form of Cyber-Stalking? How'd you get their colleges, home addresses and what not? Hm? <a href="../../../2/0/8/User%7E208.62.7.133.html" title="User:208.62.7.133">208.62.7.133</a> 18:03, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> It's not hard to find that out when people spam your forums and you trace their IP address and call the school's campus IT department. (That was of course before I and my co-Admin banned those people and they returned on proxy servers) As well, names and addresses are included through the registrar of the domain name. I've already consulted an attorney breifly about the issue. And to clarify, I'm not going to sue Wikimedia, however entries like this could be used as evidence should I decide to pursue a case against specific individuals, if the burden of proof is not strong enough for a criminal case, my lawyer said there was plenty enough for a winnable civil one.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Campus IT departments do not hand over the personal information of their college students, it's an internal affair they would deal with (not to mention it would be illegal under current regulations, as you do not represent law enforcement). Not only this, but your vendetta against this community is irrelevent to the subject at hand. Your writings cannot be proven to have been before the registration of this community and this "evidence" of yours is meaningless. 24.194.18.242 20:33, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> All this boils down to is that I want to be left alone, I don't want my name or names or photographs of myself, my family or friends posted and paraded on a public forum like Wikipedia for mockery and harrassment. It is a breach of my personal privacy. If the material is removed and the people from that forum leave me alone, I wouldn't be inclined to prosecute them, it's not something I set out to do, but I will take whatever measures necessary to protect the integrity of my identity, the quality of my work, and the security of my family.

<li><b>Reply</b> This is Tim/Insubordinum. Take his damn picture and name off the page, and put up a disambiguation so he can have a page for his novel. This is just going to go backwards and forwards otherwise.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Regarding vanity pages: 'The most significant problem with vanity pages is that they often discuss subjects that are not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors. Additionally, they are often "experimental" pages to which the author never returns. The quality of a Wikipedia article is often presumed to be proportional to the number of edits, so if an article is doomed to be a one-edit page, it should be deleted.'<br />
<br />
As per the already-being-established edit history and the extent of the page's content, it is more than evident that the article serves the purpose of a collaborative effort to chronicle the history of the community, its members, and what products it has wrought (the growing subsite "Tim Hates People" being a prime example, among others -- but that's for the article, not for this page), both for new members and veterans alike.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, regarding Wikipedia's article interests: ' As Wikipedia is, or at least aspires to be, an encyclopædia, it should contain only material that some definable group of people might want to know.'<br />
<br />
The article already has more than enough information to be classified as a relevent information base, and obviously contains material of interest to the members of the community. In no way is it a promotional page; rather, its content more than speaks for its informational nature.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Also regarding "vanity", this community has only resided at its .com address for a little over 1/5 of its life. This was long after ties were cut with its former administrator. For this to be a vanity page, it would have to refer to itself with shameless advertising (which it does not). This is a chronicle of the community's history and portrays it accurately, showing the positives and negatives, with an unbiased point of view. --66.82.9.77 00:11, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Speaking as a member of a community that has interacted with this one, it is nice to see the article up. I found it very informative, and it helped me write a historical overview of the war for my own webpage.--66.53.71.99 01:40, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Not advertisement for the forum, this article actually documents many things that have been passed down by word-of-mouth until now. It's good to finally be able to refer people to a website with all the info they want to know. The article does not promote the forum, but only describes it. --Fletcher00 03:28, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> But none of those other "non-notable" communities went out and got a Wikipedia entry, did they? Seriously, I don't see how this is any of your business if we want an entry. You're simply ego tripping and I have no idea why you feel it's necessary. We created an entry to document the name and its origins, and the community is fairly large (the Empire for example, roughly 3/4 of the board's population, is underground, which you cannot see unless you've been approved). So I guess in summary, why the hell do you care so much, and do you seriously believe that you can get this deleted since it clearly does not qualify for deletion? Get a life and leave us alone. 24.194.18.242 05:12, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uh... notability <i>does</i> concern us and it <i>is</i> our business if we want to delete this. We aren't ego tripping. If half the board is underground, well: tough luck really.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is far from a vanity article. It's a niche article (and granted, that niche may be smaller than some), detailing a part of the history of something fairly well known to a portion of the online gaming community. It by and far represents something more than the small message board community you'd see when visiting Khakain.com. This particular message board community may not be known well outside of a relatively small corner of the internet, but that does not make it less than noteworthy. Contrary to what you may believe, wikipedia is used by more than bored freshman english students patrolling articles for an egotrip. Who are you to be judge and jury of what something appeals to? Wikipedia's great reputation is that it's "a growing documentation of nearly everything." Do your best not to destroy that.170.215.192.239</li>

<li>We get lots of people coming in here and trying to create articles about their pet web forums. It's nothing personal about you or your forum -- most web forums are not notable enough for encyclopedia articles. And the onrush of anonymous editors make people very edgy because vandalism is a major part of the forum participants who want to try to get us somehow to figure that if they attack the encyclopedia and its participants enough, somehow that will make us see the light and decide that, yes, by golly, that forum populated by vandals and personal attackers must be, somehow notable after all. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 07:11, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Ignoring the points that have been made and riding on your claim to "experience" doesn't prove much either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps we were mistaken with regards to the experienced editors. However, I think I speak on the behalf of the entire community when I say that, according to the posted, [and perhaps mistakenly taken to be] official deletion policies, it seems well within the spirit of the encyclopedia's goals. It's not that we believe we have a <i>better</i> idea of what this is, but rather that, based on the material available (some of which is quoted in the first two "keep" votes, and we would like refuted), this was a valid article providing "material that some definable group of people might want to know." In our eyes, all the reasons given to delete this article are either in direct opposition to what we thought was the policy, or can be amended with recommendations and support, which is more than available. I've already voted, but we're as stated, we're quite new to the Wiki thing. In fact, we're probably wasting your time already, but some of us want closure on the matter; we've received very little constructive criticism, and yet are told that we could have this article if certain things are done. Could someone please refute these interpretations of the various Wiki-related information pertaining to this debate? Forgive my summary rather than direct quoting:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From the vanity page definition, regarding fame, we interpreted: <i>"Don't delete just because it's not famous."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And many of the delete reasons seem to say, either explicitly or implicitly: "It's not famous enough, therefore you're either advertising or this is too worthless to exist."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From the deletion policy regarding anonymous votes: <i>"Don't discount anonymous votes because it violates the premise of good faith in submissions and discourages potential contributions."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The prevailing opinion of many delete voters seems to be this: "You should've known better and registered an account, sockpuppet."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We looked up the definition of sockpuppets, and this is the general idea we got from the Wiki definition; interpreting sockpuppets seems to be a case of good vs. ill faith, but does NOT seem to apply to separate entities taking one side on a matter: <i>"Sockpuppets refer to users running multiple accounts, and while not against the rules, are generally frowned upon."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, this is the prevailing opinion we seem to be getting: "Even though you're obviously a full community posting and we've admitted this, this looks suspicious and these are all sockpuppets because it's their first edit. Disregard them."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Explanations appreciated; those of us who started/suggested this project bear no ill will here; this just seems a bit hypocritical. 128.61.69.109 20:30, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, and those arguing for keeping this article must show that this subject is important enough for an encyclopedia. Not important enough to some niche group or to the people on that forum, but for a general reference work. What makes this different from and more important than any of the countless other forums on the internet? Is it frequented by anyone famous or important? Does it have specialized knowledge of a particular subject? Has it gotten significant media coverage? Objective evidence is what is required here, not a particular interpretation of our own rules. (This is what back in my D&amp;D days we called "rules lawyering".) The best thing you can do to make a case for this article is to provide such evidence. Voting en masse will not do it, as the tallying administrator will most likely toss out your votes as they are allowed to do by policy. This policy is to prevent new users from rushing in from a blog or message board with a particular agenda who don't necessarily have Wikipedia's best interests in mind from overwheliming established Wikipeida users. Given that this policy is designed to prevent precisely what is happening here, you won't be able to argue out of this either. I'm sorry if you think this is unfair, but Wikipedia is not a democracy. Even in a democracy, you can't just show up from outside the society and vote the next day. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:08, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment #2</b> Re. 128.61.69.109's questions (composed simultaneously with the post above): Thank you for the sincere and well-formulated questions. I'll try to provide some answers here. First of all, it would help to realize that Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, and strives to provide a wide range of articles that are both accurate, and that might be interesting and useful to the <i>general public</i>. It is not a general knowledge base. This means that the subject of an article has to have a certain level of notability. An example: while I could write a compelling and factually accurate article about my local greengrocer, it is doubtful that anyone outside my neighborhood would be interested in his story. Therefore, the greengrocer might warrant an article in the local newspaper but not in Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A similar choice has to be made about articles pertaining to websites. There are millions out there, and not every one of them is notable enough to have its own article on Wikipedia. To gauge the notability of a site, "hard" criteria can be used, such as the number of Google hits and the Alexa rank (which aren't too impressive for your site, I'm sorry to say). Another, and maybe even more important, criterion is: would anyone <i>not directly associated with the website in question</i> write an article about it? In that case, someone obviously <i>took note</i>, which by definition is a mark of notability. On the other hand, if the article is written by people who are (in this case) members of the forum the article is about, the subject better be something unquestionably notable, or the tag "vanity" is sure to be used. That's why the line you paraphrased reads in full: "Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" <i>so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.</i>" Salient means: "of notable significance". So we're back at the requiremant of notability.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, suggestions about "improving" the article should be read as: let the article establish why your site is of importance to the general public (i.e. people <i>other than</i> its own members). What are its <i>unique</i> qualities? Why should someone take a look at your site? What contribution have its members made to the Zelda community at large? Is it mentioned on other sites, in reviews, in articles? Establish notability.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the sockpuppet comments: do realize that episodes like this, where someone writes an article about his on forum, the article gets listed here, and suddenly lots of anon users flood the place with "keep" votes, is almost a weekly occurance. It's like waving a big red flag and it will certainly lead to irritation. Imagine a crowd of people you've never met barging into your house, who start to question your choice of furniture and music. Would you receive them with open arms? Of course not. It's just not a polite way to make a first impression.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, it might be useful to know that the VfD page is usually filled with very terse and short comments, that might seem blunt and unfriendly to a new member; however, this is just a way to keep this page working efficently. There are dozens of VfD votes each day, and keeping it concise (unlike my rambling here, sorry guys) is just one way of doing that. See: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a>. The thing to remember: <i>it's about the article, not about you</i>. Nevertheless, the VfD page is not the most cheerful place to have one's first encounter with Wikipedia. I'd invite you to start at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_4140.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome">Wikipedia:Welcome</a> and take it from there.</dd>

<li>Um, and what arguments are those? That you have a right to post whatever you want to an encyclopedia? That's not an argument, that's an assertion which those of us who have been here a while have heard before, and have rejected. Your website is not notable. If there is something that makes it more notable than the 2 million other websites which get more hits, you'll need to make that argument in the article itself, by explaining to us WHY your site is notable.

<li>"Wikipedia is not a democracy... Delete, not notable... A gram is better than a damn..." <i>unsigned comment from 172.201.48.204</i>

<li>How about a rule that forces people to improve the article to address the concerns raised or find evidence to support keeping the article?

<li>And you're still doing it. We're not impressed that you rejected them years ago, especially not if this is the amount of thought you put into your decisions. Show us the original discussion where they got rejected and maybe your comment will start to mean something. For the same reason, we don't care about the seniority you attribute to yourself because you've been doing this for however long. I don't care how "jaded" you want to act, these are still copouts. As for improving the article, it'll probably happen if we have some kind of sign that it's worth the effort, i.e. that the work we put into it won't get deleted regardless. <i>unsigned comment from 172.201.48.204</i>
<ul>
<li>Nobody cares about impressing you. Beat this dead horse all you want, but winning this argument won't save this article.
