<p><s>A completely random, unreferenced, and made-up list of things that <i>might be</i> hidden in a secret government warehouse. Not <i>are alleged to be</i>, but <i>might be</i>; in its current construction, this list ought to list anything related to any conspiracy theory ever, as well as a number of completely random artifacts from history and legend. (Who has alleged that Amaterastu's sword is hidden in a Japanese government facility? Anyone, ever?) The fictional contents of this hypothetical warehouse are similarly random and unsupported (except for the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_of_the_Covenant_ce22.html" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>, which is the only thing that links here other than <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of conspiracy theories">list of conspiracy theories</a>). The only remotely salvagable parts of this list are redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of conspiracy theories">list of conspiracy theories</a>, and even then, any specific link between the cover-ups referenced here and a monolithic secret government warehouse are spurious at best. <b>Original research.

<li>A lot of this content is bunkum. In the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a></i> television series the Stargate was housed in a facility located beneath <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne_Mountain_e819.html" title="Cheyenne Mountain">Cheyenne Mountain</a>, for example, not in a government warehouse. On the other hand, this is a concept that is used in works of fiction, and we can certainly have an article on a common fictional plot device, <i>as a plot device</i>. Watching <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark_c5d6.html" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i> is enough to verify the existence of such a plot device. ☺ What we cannot verify is all the stuff about what governments <i>in reality</i> have such warehouses, what the rules of the secret society of caretakers are, and where they may be. All of that stuff is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">too secret for Wikipedia</a>. Moreover, the references that this article cites are entirely bogus. (From <a href="http://www.io.com/~jlockett/RPG/HEGGA/Stuff/warehouse.html" class="external text" title="http://www.io.com/~jlockett/RPG/HEGGA/Stuff/warehouse.html" rel="nofollow">an earlier version of that same "Government Warehouse List"</a>: "Recently, I decided to try to use this warehouse in a role-playing game, for fun. I've been trying to figure out things that should be in some of the boxes.".) At best, this article needs an industrial strength dose of <b>Cleanup</b>. Every single item needs to demonstrate exactly what work of fiction uses the government warehouse plot device in relation to it, or be mercilessly edited out. And the utter conjecture at the top needs to go, too. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:24, 2005 May 26 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Clever description of a very common concept in fiction.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a concept that exists in a lot of literature, media, etc. Therefore it's notable. Perhaps retitle (by adding something in parentheses) so as to make sure the concept discussed in this article doesn't get confused with actual warehouses and storage facilities known to be owned and maintained by governments. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 07:13, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> This is not original research <i>per se</i>, but a copy of a long-running and ever-expanding fannish list, which appears to have been skillfully edited to remove some of the more idiocentric items. It is <b>fiction</b>, and probably belongs in <b>BJAODN</b>, with a clear label that it is fiction. It is, as peope have pointed out, inconsistent with other fictive universes and the original is internally inconsistent. It may be a <i>copyvio</i> -- I don't know. It wants <b>delete</b>-ing, but it wants an audit trail left behind it (sorry for lame phraseology -- I'm not a Wiki-talk expert) and a block on recreation -- does this equate to a redirect to the BJAODN entry&#160;? --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:21, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
