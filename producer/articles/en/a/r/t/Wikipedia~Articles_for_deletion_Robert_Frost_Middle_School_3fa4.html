<li><b>Delete</b>. Middle schools are very seldom notable, and this is not apparently an exception. A quick Googling finds Robert Frost Middle Schools in Los Angeles CA, Deer Park NY, Louisville KY, Markham IL, New Carrollton MD, Rockville MD, and elsewhere—and none appear to be very exciting.

<li>On "notability" - if this really is what the community means by non-notable, then should we revisit the Ram-bot issue again? Clearly thousands of tinpot little American towns are non-notable to the same extent as this school, but it seems absurd to me to want to delete the information. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 22:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will not go into a notability arguement at this time, but that does not address the other two issues I have raised. Keeping is fine if that is what you want, but callnig this a paragon of school articles is a bit extreme. Just because it is more than two lines and therefore superior to 99% of the school articles we have does not make it a shining example, which implies that a longer POV section and some unmaintainable statistics constitute an outstanding article on a school. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:32, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Based upon the trends I have been following on VfD, one could concretely assert that Wikipedia is only a "real" encyclopaedia when it is a matter of convenience to be one. The entire matter of "notability" is one hundred percent subjective. As it has been so vibrantly illustrated right here in this discussion, many contributors to Wikipedia strongly DO believe schools to be inherently noteworthy and "encyclopedic". To answer your original question, which was incorrectly punctuated, yes, schools in the "middle of nowhere" <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0773490507" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0773490507" rel="nofollow">are included in print-encyclopaedias</a> without any mention of Slashdot. Does this really surprise you? Either we can agree to disagree and move on, or continue to repeat ourselves in this exercise of futility. Which do you choose?

However, anonymous and new users should be aware that we've had significant problems with sockpuppets in the past, so simple statements of opinion are likely to be ignored. Hard facts which add to the discussion, on the other hand, would be much more useful. Has this school had any notable alumni, for example?

<li><b>Response</b>: I don't know why people would create sockpuppets, but I agree, don't bite them. As for notable alumni, I am compiling a list currently. This Saturday, there may also be media coverage if Robert Frost Middle School wins the regional science bowl (there was media coverage when the local high school won their science bowl last weekend.)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: Frost did win the Virginia/Maryland Regional Science Bowl and there will be an article in the Rockville Gazette newspaper. Coverage of a science bowl does not seem to fall under the category of "local descriptions of athletic events." The article will appear this Wednesday and, if they put the article online (which they do not do with all their articles), I will post a link. Besides, the vote is 35 keep to 25 delete. Even subtracting some keeps (because of the sockpuppets), it seems like keep won by a landslide. Although there aren't any notable alumni I have found as of now, there might be years from now considering there seem to be exceptionally gifted students (that won the science bowl for two states.) By the way, what's "vote stacking"?

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li>I added a table, an aerial, and lots more information. There's even a newspaper article being printed tomorrow and a press release being wired next week! What more do you want? I think you should keep it and allow "organic growth." I also agree with someone else (I forget where I saw this) where we should just make a templete and put it on all schools to regulate them.

<li><a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Pcpcpc</a> says "a model school article". What xe really means is "a boilerplate school article". Most of this article is just an exercise in raw statistics within a framework that could apply to any school ("Headmaster X, enrollment Y, maths club, band, sports teams, motto ..." — data that are just extra columns in the tables at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_County_Public_Schools_secondary_schools_6527.html" title="Montgomery County Public Schools secondary schools">Montgomery County Public Schools secondary schools</a> in fact), and gives one <i>no context whatever</i>. Moreover: When I pushed for improvement to establish notability early on in this article's history, what I <i>wasn't</i> pushing for was this exercise in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a>. The school is "fifth in the county" in one respect, and "one of the only schools in the county" in another. What does it mean to be "one of the only schools"? And what are the standard deviations that accompany the various means (without which many of the raw statisics are pretty useless)? The prodding has just resulted in padding, I'm afraid. What makes this school stand out from the crowd of 37 middle schools <i>in Montgomery County alone</i> <a href="http://www.mcps.k12.md.us./schoolodex/quicklistms.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mcps.k12.md.us./schoolodex/quicklistms.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, let alone from the crowd of the hundreds of thousands of such schools in the world? Nothing, apparently. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> has pointed out some of the other issues that I would have mentioned, such as the copyright violations in the included images and the lack of any sort of <i>analysis</i> that would warrant an article rather than a line in a table. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:41, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It is one of the sucesses of mathematics that large quanties of information can be summarised in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>. The use of this in this article is well thought out and certainly encylopedic. A researcher looking at this page would be very happy with what he saw and horrified that all but "one line in a table" were to be deleted for the reasoning afformentioned.</li>

<dd>What makes this school <i>stand out from the crowd</i> is evident on the page. A school does not need Nobel Prize Winners in its alumi to unique, this article is evidence that in-depth research into a school will uncover unique information. The above article simplifies articles' validity down to a one-dimensional scale, which is very tempting to do when considering VfD, of <i>notablility of facts contained in article</i>. On this scale, almost all schools will be deleted as they'd fall into the middle ground. However in reality the total is greater than the sum of the parts and a collaboration of these facts and figures in a coherent article builds up a real and encyclopedic picture of what the school is like.</dd>
<dd>As a summation, if you picked up one of the 1157 pupils in this school and placed them in one of the other 37 middle schools in Montgomery County do you think they'd consider the differences non-notable?--<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 00:29, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
