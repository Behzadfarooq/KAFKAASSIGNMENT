<li><b>Keep</b> this project has made large headway in the marketplace.

<dd><b>Keep</b> Naturally ZX2C4 wants to keep it up, so that is just to be expected. Let us look at the facts of the matter: ZIM is a real product with many, many users. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">User:THE KING</a> is right.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Again, I assert that ZIM is a legitimate enterprise product. The company receives many calls and e-mails per day regarding licencing of the software to major firms. It does not have much Internet presence due to the nature of the product; it is designed for private use in companies, and the public server is only for demos and testing. The article is written as no such advertisement. If the language is written in a non-wiki way, then it needs to be flagged for <i>cleanup</i>, not for deletion. I assure you ZIM is legitimate. All above claims of illegitimacy are based in mere speculation and are completely unfounded.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No assuring us is not the way this works - you need non-notable sources to indicate this is worth an article. As for not reading like an advert - surely you jest? <i>Looking past all of these features which <b>eloquently enhance</b> ease-of-use, the most <b>remarkable</b> feature of ZIM is it's advanced file transfer technology. <b>Where other messengers fail</b> to work with firewalls, are slow because of uncompressed data, or do not integrate with the users' computers well, <b>ZIM excels</b>.</i> --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 20:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's see 1 is a link to sourceforge - anyone can jump a few hoops and get on there - entirely non-notable. The second and third are just sourcefog logs - so what? The third is someone basically saying "hey dude - try this piece of software, me and two mates are trying it!" - big wow.

<li><b>Keep</b> ZIM is a real product that is vastly used in the business world. Its web presence is low and this is unfortuanate, but this does not change the fact that it is wide spread. As for sourceforge: look at how long this product has been on sourceforge. One cannot just jump a few hoops to get on sourceforge. One must undergo a large review process. Sorceforge logs are of news releases that sourceforge <i>published</i>. The third one, yes I'll agree, is just a couple of script kiddies using the software, but after all, the internet presense of ZIM is for script kiddies; the wide spread usage of this in the business world is done over the telephone and with real material.
