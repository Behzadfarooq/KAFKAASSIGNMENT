<li><b>Delete</b> as POV and factually incorrect. The Spaniards were conquerors too; they were not the original inhabitants. Ask the Celts, the Carthaginians, the Romans, the Visigoths, and the Moors, who were all there before the modern Spanish.

<p><i>Charlene: Modern Spaniards are the product of the mixing of all these people you have just mentioned. Your comment is akin to saying that the modern British people are not really British because the Celts, Angles and Saxons were there before them.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is racist nonsense. It purports to claim that the Spanish inhabitants of Gibraltar were 'Original' and 'Gibraltarian' neither is true; This myth supports the irredentist Spanish claim. The history of Gibraltar is one of successive occupations, the Spanish one being in the middle. The Spanish inhabitants had a choice of remaining or leaving, and freely chose to escape future conflict. The term 'Gibraltarian' did not exist at the time so cannot be applied to them. Today it has a precise legal meaning. The article remains unnecessary this is covered extensivly in the Gibraltrar and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Roque_2222.html" title="San Roque">San Roque</a> pages where it has been subject to extensive editing to achieve a more honest consensus. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 18:01, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Please explain what is racist about this article. I dont understand that allegation which you use quite often. It is true that the history of <b>Spain</b> is one of successive occupations. It was occupied by the Carthaginians, Romans, the Visigoths, the Vandals, the Moors, the French and the Brits... That has little to do with the fact that the people who were born in Gibraltar are Gibraltarian.</i>--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 14:11, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but modify. I have already changed the name which I admit was POV. The Gibraltarian identity and heritage of these Spaniards is a reality and is not covered at all in other Gibraltar related articles, so the allegation that the material is duplicated is false. This article makes no controversial statement. It simply mentions the existence of a collective of people in history and at present. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 01:48, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your assertion that the article is now NPOV is false, as demonstrated by this quote: "The Spanish Gibraltarians or original inhabitants of Gibraltar, as opposed to the present inhabitants of Gibraltar, were those who left (voluntarily or forcibly) the town of Gibraltar during the British conquest of this town from Spain. 4000 Gibraltarians left the town in 1704 - the vast majority of Gibraltar's population at that time." Also, it is customary to state that you are the original author of the article in these discussions. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Burgas00&#160;:</b> It would be nice if your contributions to this topic were in one place rather than splattered all over everyone elses. That the article is racist nonsense seems evident to everyone else.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>history</i> of this is all adequately covered in the main article on <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, which already makes perfectly clear both the number of Spanish inhabitants who decided not to remain under British occupation and the circumstances of the war which led to Gibraltar being ceded in perpetuity to Britain. What that leaves for this article is merely a group of present-day Spaniards who claim descent from those four thousand, and have formed a little club for themselves. Unless they have had significant media exposure -- and the references provided so far make no such claim -- they do not belong in Wikipedia, per policy and long-standing precedent. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The debate is closed. Your article is to be deleted. You added this "subsection" to the AfD entry for your article, and you are trying to represent this as a vote, which it is not. AfD is a discussion about the article, not a vote, whether the article should be retained, and if so what need to be done. You have renamed the article but it is still a POV fork and doesn't contain any noteworthy information that isn't already in the Gibraltar article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 03:58, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
