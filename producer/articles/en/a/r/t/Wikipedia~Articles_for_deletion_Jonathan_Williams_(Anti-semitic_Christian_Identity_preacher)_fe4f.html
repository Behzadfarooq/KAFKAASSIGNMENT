<li><b>This article is accurate</b>, as it is written by a concerned resident of the state of Georgia. Myself. I am only trying to make people aware of these wolves in sheep's clothing!</li>
</ul>
<p>The info is derived for the most part from their own website! www.twelvearyannations.com Every time I have ever tried to share knowledge on this site concerning haters in the world, it is deleted. I follow all of the guidelines. I don't understand? All of what is being said can be proven by all resources available.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The reason it keeps getting deleted is that there is nothing in the article that asserts that he is notable. <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ-Christian_a914.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ-Christian">Church of Jesus Christ-Christian</a> is just barely notable enough for an article since it seems they are an extreme minority group with very little large-scale influence. But the individual pastors aren't notable enough for their own articles. And the fact that you admittedly wrote the article with an objective ("to make ppl aware of these wolves in sheep's clothing) means it is POV. Your anti-racist objectives are wonderful, and I hope you continue that fight, because God knows we need it, but this is not the forum for this particular battle. You might considering mentioning consider mentioning him in the church article. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d">Esprit15d</a> 21:44, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please keep your personal vendettas to your blog. Encyclopedias are meant to hold objective, impartial and worthy information. It isn't the job of any encyclopedia to serve as a vehicle to shamefull vendettas and persecutions. And let me inform you that if you keep creating articles like this one, then wikipedia's users will keep on deleting them. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 20:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hiya&#160;:) Don't take this too badly - it's not you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exposing fascists is a great thing to do and I thoughroughly approve, but since this is meant to be an encyclopedia, written in a neutral style, it's better to simply describe the subject of the article rather than write your own opinions - and I've made this mistake before in the past so it's nothing worry about.</p>
<p>In addition, he simply isn't well, important enough to the public, to write an article about, or at least I can't see any evidence of it, even if the article is accurate (which it probably is). Should this change in the future (G-d forbid) then we can rewrite the article.&#160;:) <a href="../../../x/y/a/User%7EXYaAsehShalomX_ac1b.html" title="User:XYaAsehShalomX">XYaAsehShalomX</a> 20:18, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment to Author</b>, what XYaAsehShalomX has said is right on the money. This is an encyclopedia and it is not the correct place to <i>"make people aware of these wolves in sheep's clothing"</i> even if your intentions are good. I suggest maybe you get a blog, or some free webspace to post your material and any arguments against Mr. Williams. Hopefully XYaAsehShalomX is right and Williams will continue to be such an unimportant fringe element that he will never qualify for an article. I applaud the sentiment behind what you are doing, but this just isn't the right place for it. I hope you understand.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no difference in what I have posted, and the other stuff posted about White supremacists! This Williams individual is local for me, and he makes the news nationally all of the time. I understand, but then again I don't. It seems to me EVERY article is biased in some sort of fashion, and mine just tells precisely what is widely known around the southeast. The public deserves to be able to read about figures of all backgrounds for research, including these unwanted ones. Clean it up if you wish, but I don't see how deletion is absolutely necessary. But I am sure it will get deleted anyway...
<ul>
<li>Can you cite an example of what you are stating? Perhaps a link to national news article about Williams?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:46, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> For wikipedia, the most important fact for people is notablity. If he is a national figure with national (even world) impact, that needs to be put in the article to survive. Like you refer to his radio show. What show? Is it big? This would be an example of notability.--<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d">Esprit15d</a> 22:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>two repeated articles from a newspaper, an article from an obscure hate group site and an article from a news site which publishes anyone's articles .

<li>Can someone provide documentation of his radio show's existence? Then we at least could consider whether to keep him based on notability as a radio host, rather than arguing whether enough media mentions are found to make the anonymous poster's controversy notable. Currently the only source (before addition of the above links during an edit conflict, so I haven't checked them) is the website of one hategroup, which doesn't really do anything to substantiate claims of notoriety for this individual.

<li><b>Retitle</b> and <b>clean up</b>. The fact that this guy is "Communications Director" of Aryan Nations (or at least he was in 2004) makes him just notable enough for inclusion, IMO.
