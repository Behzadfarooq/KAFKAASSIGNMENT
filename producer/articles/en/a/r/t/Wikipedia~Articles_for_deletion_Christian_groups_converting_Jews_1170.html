<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 "deletes", 6 "keeps" (2 very new users discounted), 2 commenters who did not express a clear opinion and one "merge". The merge recommendation was generally rejected as an inappropriate target. No alternate target was suggested.</p>
<p>Right around the start of the dicussion, the content and title were changed significantly. However, votes against the article continued after the revisions and none of the early "delete" voters returned to change their votes leading me to conclude that they were unconvinced by the changes.</p>
<p>Looking carefully at the current content, I see an orphaned article which appears to me to be expressing opinions about topics already well covered (and better sourced) in other articles. The content is internally inconsistent. Since the VfD discussion, the article has been neglected. I am going to add my own opinion to the decision and call this (barely) a "delete" decision but without prejudice against the re-creation of the article in a more coherent format. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:54, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am unable to decide how to vote at this time. This article as it is when it was listed on vfd seems to be entirely changed from its state yesterday. Even the title is different. What happened.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The title before the move was alternative claims of Jew, Judaism and Israelite.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While the article as it stands at the time of this writing is poorly written iin places, and questionably sourced, this article should be fixed, not scrapped. The tension between Judaism and Chrisinaity is an important peice of knowledge, and the attempted and actual conversion of "Jews" to Christians is large part of that. We definatly shouldn't back away just because it is contraversial. I think we should edit, rather than scrap it. --<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 21:23, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>- if its POV clean it up! An article on Christian groups that seek to convert Jews to Christianity is a legitimate subject for an NPOV article, unless they are specifically covered elsewhere. This article maybe POV (although I personally can't see where as it stands) - but there is nothing inherently POV about the subject. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(t)</a> 23:12, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Qualified Keep</b> - The article requires a better title, first of all. Many Christians and Christian groups "convert" Jews and other nonChristians regularly around the world. The groups listed in the article are special because they purposefully convert Jews in particular (or are composed of ethnic Jews who have converted to Christianity) as their primary function. Secondly, the article's text takes what seems to be offense at the idea of Christians converting others, which many Christians feel is an essential component of their faith. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 23:25, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. In serious need of cleanup. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:43, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Weak keep: I have a number of problems with this article. Its writing is anemic, as noted, but the title is illogical. Is this how the material will be sought? Is this an apt description of the contents? The article is fairly NPOV, but it's also fairly inaccurate. It glosses over the fact that most Jewish religious groups are not messianic. It's simply not a majority position to look for a messiah, these days. Also, while the groups listed as proselytizers of Jews are proselytizers of Jews, there is a real nightmare of potential POV addition (and that happens with a wiki), as well as defamation. I'm not at all comfortable with the article, but it's not a deletion policy violation, so far as I can see. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:00, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd like an explanation too. I can only assume that this subject has some history I wasn't aware of. In my opinion there's no question: the various fundy "Jews for Jesus" groups do exist and do attempt to recruit Jewish people.
