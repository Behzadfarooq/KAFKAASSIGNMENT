<p>What is the point of this page? Thai immigrants in US are relatively SMALL number compared to other nationals. If you want to talk about In-Chan, then creat a page about them. There is no Thai official record about Mr. He Thien whom the author claimed to be the first student to immigrate from Thailand. The number of Thai immigrants to US that the author provided does not have any reference. If you want to put this page on, you have to do more in-depth with reliable FACTS, not something you guess. And again, what is the point of talking about Thai immigrants in US which are relatively VERY SMALL number compared to other nationals. Dhanakorn 00:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>its literary art deleting this would be a crime, the poster is an extreme good writer why cant you see that. just because it doesnt pamper everyone doesnt mean its not true indeed he put hs own views but then again it gave the article a lively touch it was thereby given character which isnt a bad thing and if someone would write it the guy that wrote it would be the best candidate. you have to accept that the dude has talent. so i am <b>against the deletiton</b> of this article. -zerebubuth- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zerebubuth (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zerebubuth_32a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zerebubuth">contribs</a>) 19:37, 2005 Jun 22 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>Non-notability does not imply unverifiability. One can verify an article that states that 1679+22=1701, for example. Unverifiability makes questions of notability moot, of course. Since this Jim Luckman is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> (I cannot find anything, either, and this biographical article cites no sources, of course.), the question of his notability does not arise. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:40, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe that for a biography, non-notability does cause anything more than a stub to be unverifiable without original research. I agree that this implication is not true for all potential articles and I will be more careful in my wording in future VfD nominations. I prefer putting both reasons in the nomination because I want the reasoning to hold true even if someone was able to verify the unimportant information. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 20:05, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> with Smark (professional wrestling). "Internet Wrestling Community" is indeed a phrase often used in wrestling to refer to a distinct fan group. Although I suppose not literally every "smark" is internet-aware, it's really hard to imagine there are many who are not, given that the 'Net is both where you would get the news and where you would discuss it, these days. Practically speaking, it's hard to imagine any significant difference between the content of the two entries. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 19:52, 28 June 2005</li>

We have articles that are huge, and when they get huge, we split them up.

<li><b>Delete</b> I listened to Dr. Kelly speak yesterday here in Shanghai on the Ren Min Bi exchange rate. His comments on the exchange rate between Marsmarks and Euros and Ren Min Bi's were too speculative though for a real scientist. Anyone with even a bachelor's degree in astrology would know more about interstellar economics than this Kelly guy. His credit repair book is very good though. It's been translated in Chinese and (illegal but cheap) copies can be purchased from any newspaper vendor if you ask for it. <small>(unsigned vote by Shanghaiman)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I was at the speech together with Shanghaiman (whose real name is Richard Haworth) where Dr. Kelly shared also with us his fear of deletion. But Shanghai man is a Leninist extremist, curiously in synch with the ZOG fascists on this site. Why should anyone who offers a new and different opinion be deleted immediately? No matter how famous? According to the ambassador from Zimbabwe (oh, he doesn't exist either?) who introduced Dr. Kelly, he has been twice nominated for the Nobel Prize in Credit Repair. Is his earnest and courageous defense of the working man the reason? Is the democratic party in America -etacar and her sock puppets Haworth/sundry unsigned commentors- so threatened by looming exposure as nothing more than just another tool of the MAN? HayworthEtacarScimitar brings up a good point though. Support for Dr. Kelly is global because Dr. Kelly is global and the working man is global and space is global. In contrast, the deleter (save for ingratiating Shanghai man hoping to get an American visa to study astronomology at Baker) has all his IPs in just one corner of one measly 5% of the world population. Go ahead, I challenge you, delete the good Dr. But you can't delete his dream. The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die. <small>(unsigned comment by 218.1.141.14, user's only edit)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is not a hoax and I find that notion offensive. Granted the man is obscure but he's an authority in his field! Just because he's not among the conventional list of experts hints that he's above the fold! I'm not looking up the same guy that Joe Schmo looks up. Besides, I have met the man.

Kelly from Flint (you have his picture you can find his address, go look him up, read his publications in the Flint Times). Anyway, I am arguing with a paid killer posse.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a bit torn on this issue but after the arguements I think I must vote to keep. We may disagree with his paleo leftist, neo fascist views but that doesnät mean he doesn't exist. As a Christian I personally disagree with Dr. Kelly's views on the existance of space and dinosaurs but just because I personally disagree with him doesn't mean he should be deleted. Another point I don't understand is why it matters if people vote from Lithuania or America. We Swedes view Lithuanians as a race of gypsies and Americans as fat slaves of israel yet we still can not deny their votes. Dr. Kelly is wrong but people must know about him. In the mean time I will pray that he realizes that space is an invention of satanists. (unsigned comment by 62.65.118.114 2005 June 28, 08:00 [Sweden])

<li>It is hard for the voters to give proof because many of these voters have met Dr. Kelly as he travels and lectures. I guess they could post pictures of him giving speeches, but I doubt that would sway you either. I guess since Dr. Kelly isn't covered in the mainstream, Jewish owned news media you don't consider him to be real. This is hogwash. Dr. Kelly is real and your attempts to delete him are hurting people. You see, Dr. Kelly is a hero to many people, especially small children. He may be an almost mythical character, like the Queen of England, but that doesn't mean that the children do not have a right to know of him. Think of the children. -Mistress Miller (unsigned vote/comment by 24.56.237.85)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bill Kelly is most certainly a working man, a proponent of space travel, and a partier. What other arguments are needed? One may disagree with him, as I most certainly do, but the extreme anger displayed against the Space Party on this page only further demonstrates the controversial nature of the Space Party and the brewing anti-semitism against Dr. Kelly, his Space Party, and judaism. We shouldn't discriminate against others, and not suppress Dr. Kelly and the Space Party, no matter how much we disagree with it. Tolerance is a virtue.

<li><b>Keep</b> Over the past three years I have gotten a chance to know Dr Kelly very well. I first met Dr. Kelly on a trip to Washington DC. as we attended a political conference in DC, we unfortunatly tuned into the news of the Columbia disaster. While this tragedy pushed many people away from space exploration, this made Dr Kelly work even harder to achieve his goal. As a graduate of a Big Ten university, and a student starting grad school in the fall, I realize that Dr. Kelly is a valueable resource to the Flint community, and an asset to any life he touches.

<li>Ectar, how can you say this man isn't notable? You have people posting from a dozen countries and several US states that have heard him speak and care about what he has to say. Is it up to you to say who is notable, or is it up to those who find him notable? Think about the children here, the little children care. - Mistress Miller</li>

<li>The author me <a href="../../../p/j/j/User%7EPJJP_dd81.html" title="User:PJJP">PJJP</a> who is definitely not anonymous and created a PJJP some time ago has had over 400 works published in such well-known and established pubs as The Paris Review (5 works), Boulevard, New Letters (24 works), etc. I am the creator and president of one of the most respected language sites in the world (yourDictionary.com) which has links to thousands of Academic institutions worldwide (check our board of Advisors for a who's who of the world's linguists); while the C is one of the most respected analytical media tools globally. The BBC interviewed me twice in the last six months, CNN over two dozen times, PBS twice in the last ninety days. The vanity pubs you cite (iUniverse) are merely me collecting my previously published works. BTW, Mythomania, was published in '76 and is out of print, hence the mirrors. Check Bowkers for definitive lists of books in print from the past (I have some dozen between '73 and '87 that are now out of print.) My bio appears in scores of pubs of which the Contemp Authors is one of the most accurate because the author can correct it (but it usually runs 2 years behind reality.) As for the number of words in the English Language: this is applauded by serious linguists who are tired of the games that are played over words; the number of which can never be cited for the reasons you cite.

<dd>Re the "previously published works", I can't find them in a few major library catalogs (Boston Public, Library of Congress, Harvard...) I checked. And on bookfinder.com, all the listings of your books are from the vanity presses, none from the original non-vanity publishers. Interesting.<br />
About yourdictionary.com, you say of it that you are "<i>the</i> creator" (my emphasis); according to the <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v3=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search_Arg=payack&amp;Search_Code=NAME_&amp;PID=4622&amp;CNT=25&amp;HC=1" class="external text" title="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v3=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search_Arg=payack&amp;Search_Code=NAME_&amp;PID=4622&amp;CNT=25&amp;HC=1" rel="nofollow">Library of Congress record</a>, it was created by Robert Beard; is that incorrect?<br />
About Contemp Authors, the point is that you quote what it says about your work as though it was an outside resource; but in fact you wrote that quote yourself, which seems a bit like what you're doing here on Wikipedia, adding links to yourself in various places.<br />

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the article's talk page, if it exists; or after the end of this archived section. The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 10 "deletes", 7 "keeps" and one too ambiguous to call.

<p>However, even with my own opinion, this fails to rise to the level of concensus necessary for deletion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. You don't realise do you?

Seeing how he's the one that's going to pioneer some radical programs, I think notability IS established.

<li>Calm down, natalina. I understand that you care about this subject, otherwise you wouldn't have created this article. But accusing users of systemic bias and intolerance won't get you far. The issue is not whether the Anglo-Chinese School is notable (I believe it is). The issue is also not whether dr. Ong Teck Chin has played an important role in the history of the school (I'm sure he has). The issue is whether that makes him notable enough to be on Wikipedia. A major problem with this article is that it simply states <i>that</i> Dr. Ong Teck Chin is the principal of the ACS. No mention is made of all the valuable information you have posted here. Also keep in mind that three weeks have gone by since the creation of this article. In that period of time, there have been no serious edits to this article, only some minor copyediting and some stub-tagging. That's it. That of course doesn't make Dr. Ong Teck Chin non-notable, but it doesn't plead in his advantage either. This article doesn't give a shred of proof of notability. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 11:59, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (PS.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know exactly how far a principal has to go to become notable but it seems to me that the article establishes that he is more notable than an average principal. Playing into my judgement, to some degree, is that the author has over 500 edits in the last week and seems to have a very good grasp of what Wikipedia is about. For me to sit here in Chicago and say that a principal is <i>not</i> notable is very difficult. Here, the former head of the Chicago Public Schools was so notable that he ran a very viable campaign for governor in the last Democratic primary. Wikipedia is not paper and I think we have a new bytes to spare for Dr. Chin. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:05, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've discovered Wikipedia fairly recently and, coming from Singapore myself, I was surprised and interested to discover this article about Dr. Ong Teck Chin at its consideration for deletion. I agree with what's been said above about being the principal of a well-known school not being sufficient criteria for an entry in an encylopaedia, unless the circumstances are exceptional. I think this article as it currently exists is very biased and reflects the propaganda at this school (and supportive elements in the press) would like people to believe rather than the reality. ACS (Independent) was not the first school in Singapore to introduce a 4-year integrated programme. It was the first local school to take a firm decision to use the International Baccalaureate, but others are considering this too. Deciding to use the IB is not as "pioneering" as this article makes out. It's a major international exam curriculum which has been used at schools around the world for decades, including at a number of the international schools in Singapore. Fundraising is something all schools in Singapore do, and that independent schools particularly try to push. The school's achievements in these areas are not that remarkable. If this article is kept, people associated with all the other leading schools in Singapore (and probably many other schools around the world) will be encouraged to also put trumped-up articles about their principals in this encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingopo_d907.html" title="User:Singopo">Singopo</a> 6 July 2005</li>

<li>Checking with <a href="http://www.ibo.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ibo.org" rel="nofollow">IBO</a> shows that this is the first Singapore-system school to be authorised to use the IB Diploma Programme.

<li>I know it's the first local-system school in Singapore to adopt the IB (I already noted that above). But that in itself is not a "pioneering" move. A number of other schools in Singapore are also considering doing so. This article currently implies that Dr. Ong is responsible for doing something revolutionary, and in my opinion that is "trumping-up" his significance. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingopo_d907.html" title="User:Singopo">Singopo</a> 6 July 2005
<ul>
<li>It's the first such school to be authorised in Singapore. Not pioneering enough? To clarify, it is the first local-system school in Singapore (known internationally for its education system) to actually offer its students a different terminal qualification from the GCE-Cambridge system (as opposed to 'considering' doing so). Considering that every single one of the other 179 Singapore secondary schools and junior colleges offers GCE terminal qualifications, this is revolutionary enough, surely.<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrythain_bb83.html" title="User:Brythain">Brythain</a> 7 July 2005
<ul>
<li>The school was not the first to start a 4-year integrated programme, just the first to choose to have the students sit IB instead of A-Level exams at the end of it. I DO think that's significant enough to note on the page about the school on Wikipedia. But I DON'T think it's enough to mean that its principal merits an individual page in an international encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingopo_d907.html" title="User:Singopo">Singopo</a> 7 July 2005 14:55 (UTC)</li>

<li>"probably advertising"&#160;? how do you know without researching the truth? There is no advertising in this at all, and I make no money witrh this. Please don't spread half-truths or liews without knowing what is going on, thanks. I was asked to write an article for each game by administrator Silke two. I onloy started doing this AFTER it was suggested to me by an administor. If you now want to delete them I suggest, you sit together and agree on your policies. That I document only my own games, has simple reasons like shear workload associated with it etc. I have asked other Zillions game to document their game in Wiki accordingly. Since these are many, I am not willing to document their games. I have doiscussed all that in length with admin Silke2 already, and we agreed on the important subjects.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Regarding maths: yes, some definitions have been invented by me about 20 years ago, since in the area of tilings there was no word for the property of neat and nowhere-neat tilings then.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just going to interrupt here, to point out <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_function_%28topology%29.html" title="Continuous function (topology)">continuous</a> tiling</i>, and its opposite, <i>dis-continuous tiling</i>. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 15:39, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But this and other definitions have meanwhile (over the last 2 decades) become used more and more amongst people who research in these and similar tilings, see Journal of Recreational mathematics. Special areas of maths have their special language; this makes it much easier to communicate.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, (with the exception maybe on the article of 'slices'), I think the documentation of everything else is well justified.</dd>
<dd>The area of tilings and puzzles has undergone quite a lot of blossoming the last two decades (maybe widely unknown to the ordinary public or even to mathematicians who do not read journals like <a href="../../../j/r/m/JRM_90b7.html" title="JRM">JRM</a>).</dd>

<p>By the way, Zillions games are without violence, blood splatter, horror,etc, but thinking, intelligence games without time pressure and stress. They represent a much more healthy way to enjoy games that the point-and-shoot arcade games etc. Yes, they deserve more publication because they can help people increase their mind power and teach cids better skill than shooting well.

<dd>Almost 100% of the edits he has made to puzzle related articles which are not explicitely about the games, are to add links to his zillions website, and introduce terms and ideas he himself (above) admits he made up (i.e. original research), into a field of mathematics that, apart from him and a small group of his (non-professional) friends, does not use them.</dd>
<dd>Apart from this, his edits are to add things such as "Karl Scherer [i.e. him] solved this maths problem on date X, with the following theorem", which is both original research, and definitely non-neutral, as well as vanity.</dd>

<dd>Most of the reasons given for deletion here are based on the assumption that these articles are ads for non-notable games.

<dd>The other non-zillions-games articles are attempts by Karl Scherer to promote his own personal categorisation and terminology. These things are not notable usage, mathematicians and others do not use his terms. Also, many of them are simply an attempt to justify adding all zillions games as links - by splitting the games up into very small categorisations, creating an article for each category, and then adding external links to the games in each article. It is a massive abuse of Wikipedia. This is why I am including them in the deletion and urge an <b>Extremely strong delete</b> (n.b.

<dd>Sorry, you seem to be contradicting yourself. Here, it sounds like you're saying "delete everything listed"; below, you exclude pre-existing articles like <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tiling.html" title="Tiling">tiling</a>. So it seems vital to clarify the intent, and to ask what care has been taken to separate edits from new article creations. In any case, do we have prior history with <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">Karl Scherer</a> that suggests intentional bad behavior? He claims he was <i>asked</i> to create articles by an administrator (presumably <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a>, misspelled); is that disputed, or was it misunderstood, or what? Yes, we need a massive deletion of all the separate games articles, perhaps accompanied by a merging of the content into a single article. Yes, we need to educate the author about what's expected in Wikipedia. What I see is a somewhat misguided attempt to contribute, not a deliberate attempt to spam or to distort mathematics and games terminology — unless I hear facts to the contrary. But this proposed vote is not clearly enough limited in scope. It strikes me as excessive on the part of <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>, more of an angry rant than a reasoned response. In fact, with a little guidance Karl might happily do most of the cleanup work himself, sparing the need for this debate and vote. Otherwise, <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> seems to have it about right.

<dd>Check his talk page, you'll see our discussion, and his completely reasonable and polite responses. And -Ril-'s not-quite-so-reasonable comments. He had his games linked from one of the pages, I informed him that editors don't tolerate external links of that sort, and that they would only make sense if there was an article about them directly. I also pointed out that some people don't like to have what they deem is 'minor' information in wikipedea, and noted that he should try to put them in one big article. I doubt his intent was to advertise, only to inform people about the things he knew the most about and was most enthusiastic about. I find this whole process sad to see, it should have been handled in another way first, considering the user's positive attitude. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> 14:33, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What is really sad in reading his <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarlscherer3_33d3.html" title="User talk:Karlscherer3">talk page</a> is that he seems to have begun creating all the Zillions pages because he believes that's what you recommended! Yet, despite that, <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> launches an assault. Karl claims to have a doctorate in mathematics, which is <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> evidence that he may be a bit strange (said tongue in cheek), but <i>not</i> that he is unwilling or unable to place nicely with others. Yes, I believe adding numerous links on WP pages to one's own work shows a certain lack of professional and social awareness; it is inappropriate, disturbing, and creates a bad impression.

<dd>If you check the contributions he made <b>before</b> that, you will note that almost 100% of articles he created are either

<dd>exactly as if the entire set of articles is designed to create enough articles to spread the games accross, so that all of them can be listed without there being a huge list of external links in any one article. <i><b>This is an appalling abuse of Wikipedia</b></i>.

<dd>(b) are articles describing friends of his, which is also original research, not NPOV, and non-notable</dd>

<dd>On top of that, many of his edits to <i>pre-existing</i> articles are to insert claims that he (i.e. Karl Scherer) has solved such-and-such a maths problem. Which is (a) not verified, (b) not NPOV, (c) original research (as it is him doing the insertion), and (d) a massive vanity edit
<dl>
<dd>This users edits over the past 2.5 years constitute nothing but these, and consequently I can see him only as a massive problem.

<dd>The indents were getting a bit deep for me, so I'm responding to <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> at the same level as my previous comment. We agree on two key points. (1) Yes, his edits look a bit egocentric. (2) The Zillions proliferation is over-the-top. We also agree that <i>if</i> he is deliberately google-bombing that is abusive and to be condemned. We <i>disagree</i> that such is the case. We also disagree, apparently, about the best means to resolve these difficulties. Read his own words on his talk page; they do not support your position that his behavior is a manifestation of evil intent. Nor can I agree that "a newbie in their first edit would know". By all means, we seem to be reaching a massive concensus that the behavior and its artifacts need correcting, so some action is called for. However, <i>at this point</i> we do not have concensus that we need an overreaching deletion to accomplish this, nor do we have consensus that the person (not the behavior) is to be attacked. Can we please first try educating the guy? After all, what kinds of social skills can we expect of someone living in a country with more sheep than humans (tongue firmly in cheek)? Also, I understand (and sympathize) that you are upset because the boor spilled red wine on your beautiful white Wikipedia carpet; but please turn down the flames, at least reserving boldface for votes. The mess can be cleaned up, and we might as well be <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civil</a> in doing it.

Yes, fine, you think this deserves a vfd. That's not his point. His point is, if I may offer a blunt translation - or rather, lets just say that this is my point - considering <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">Karlscherer3</a>'s reasonable responses, an alternate solution may have been to talk to him first, and that even if you do decide to vfd some of his articles, there's no need to be a righteous bastard about it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> 01:21, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Curious, how perceptions differ. The white wine suggestion made me smile. I took it as a tacit acknowledgement of my diagnosis, and a hopeful sign of a more productive tone. At the end of the day, style and personality aside, we all want a better Wikipedia. Red wine <i>is</i> a metaphor, and (at the risk of speaking for <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>) white wine might be taken as an alternative to ripping out the carpet. Is either of you two (<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> or <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>) experienced Wikipedians willing to guide <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">Karl</a> through the nuances of what is and is not an appropriate contribution? Shall we first give him a chance to clean up his own mess, perhaps also assisted by a targeted delete of <i>only</i> the Zillions sprawl, leaving him to back out the vanity edits? (And I use "vanity" in the Wikipedia sense, with no interpretation of user intent.)

<dd>It doesn't seem curious to me&#160;:) My expectations of <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>'s good will being not as high as yours may account for the difference. In regards to the metaphor, I fear it's lost on me - I have no idea which action correlates with ripping out the carpet, and there seems to be no mention of "having the spiller himself clean out the carpet" (and it wouldn't seem to be red wine, because these 'stains' are really quite easy to get out). I don't know how well your suggestion would work <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarlscherer3_33d3.html#Please_note" title="User talk:Karlscherer3">at this point</a>, but asking him to clean it is worth a try, though I doubt it'll do much: he seems to have been discouraged to the point of leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Karlscherer3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Karlscherer3" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, thanks to <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>'s absolutely innapropriate behaviour (I'm not talking about the vfd).

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are 199 articles in the Book stub cat, many of them more obscure than this one; so why is this one being singled out? If the author article is worthy of retention, then it is a fairly natural progression to wikify his book titles. These red links then cry out for articles. It would be silly for these to be redirects back to the author page. That's how Wikipedia grows, or at least one of the ways. Not liking what a book says is not really a good reason for listing its article here; in fact it is a very bad reason. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html" title="User talk:Filiocht">Blarneyman</a> 11:46, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reason I'm voting delete is that the author of this article has created a bunch of POV stubs, including only publishers' blurbs, chapter lists, sometimes quotes from the authors, and pictures of the book covers. They're free advertising for the publishers and hopelessly POV data dumps: violations of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. They could be made to conform to NPOV, but it would be a lot of work for someone. It therefore makes sense to redirect the title to the author's page until an editor actually wants to write a neutral article about the book. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:53, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>How is a contents list of a book in breach of our POV policy? Granted the chapter titles reflect the POV of the book, but that is an entirely different matter.

<dl>
<dd>It's the lack of any balancing material that's the problem. If it were a neutral article that just happened to list the TOC at the end, it would be okay, but when the TOC's the only thing, and the chapter titles are things like "A Muslim by any other name blows up just the same" (this is from one of the Ann Coulter titles), there's a serious POV issue. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:12, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The fact that an article is POV is not a valid reason to list here. If it is impossible for it ever to become NPOV, that would be different.

And this is probably the first "prime Vfd candidate" that's changed so quickly after my nomination, so I didn't exactly have any track record to go by to "give it a chance". But I'll be happy with whatever the Vfd brings.

<li>Look at the town's article? Many (most?) of them don't even mention the existence of a school. Why? Maybe because it is not relevant for the towns article as it is just another school. Yet the main point is we have to stop at some level, as the only way to have the whole picture on education (or anything, for that matter), is to have an article on every thing and every one involved. Every building, every teacher, every student, every household, etc.. They are all important, they are all related.

<li>At present a dicdef yes. But I think there is some possibility for expansion (methods of waterproofing for instance).

<ul>
<li>Comment: I'd be willing to bet that a lot of waterproofing patents have been issued. The USPTO grants many patents, many of which should be invalidated because of prior art, basic scientific error, technical infeasibility, or simply not being legitimate subject for patents (e.g. basic software interaction methods). Nonetheless, such a search would support the implied point that waterproofing is an area widely considered significant and worthy of attention. Meaningful things beyond a dicdef can be written and verified. <b>Keep and expand</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:49, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b>. This is a perfectly good article about an encyclopedic website. It's difficult to take a second nomination seriously when it's barely a week after the first was closed. If there were an "endless revert war", this suggests that the article should be protected, not destroyed. As it happens, there doesn't seem to be significantly more revert warring than on comparable articles. However, the nominator, <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmileyrepublic_1cbc.html" title="User:Smileyrepublic">User:Smileyrepublic</a>, seems to have been engaged in a pointless edit war in the past day or two.

<p>Strong Keep. Singulair was first marketed as a preventative asthma medication, and after some time doctors began prescribing it for generic allergy prevention, and is now being marketed as such. Also, some patients have found it to reduce the severity of eczema. Genetic research has also begun to find evidence that all three of these conditions are linked, and oftentimes inherited together. If necessary the article could be changed to the title of montelukast sodium, which is the actual chemical name of Singulair.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> it is certainly the case that the items listed are <b>generally regarded</b> by the enitre UK population, including those who are right-wing, that these publications are right wing. As to whether that is or is not a good thing is where the population differs. N.b. the BNP publications would normally be regarded as <b>far-right</b>, although this is still right-wing. I suspect that the BNP would claim they are not so different to being <i>centre-right</i>.

<p><strike>There is no way this person is real (and even if she were it should still go I think)</strike>. OK admittedly she is real, but should it be on Wikipedia?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Google is inherently biased, and there's no shortage of porn actresses (I won't use the word artist- sorry, but artistic merit is something people rarely look for in this particular subject), so I find it hard to believe thet they're inherently notable if they have google hits. Of course they have google hits! Anybody, what's the number one use of the internet? 4-letter word, sounds like corn.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability not established. The fact that porn actresses pop up a lot on internet searches is a function of the internet and how it has become a perfect distribution method for the pornography industry. Just because Wikipedia is internet-based does not mean we should base our standards of notability on Google counts when it comes to porn stars. The most minor porn actress probably has more hits than most Nobel prize winners. Based on my brief review of the various porn categories and lists on Wikipedia such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_porn_stars.html" title="List of porn stars">List of porn stars</a>, we already have hundreds of porn actors and actresses with articles (and I assume that not every porn actor or actress has been categorized or linked on the lists). While there are some that are truly notable, such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Carey_0db0.html" title="Mary Carey">Mary Carey</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Lovelace_f18d.html" title="Linda Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>, I would venture to say most are not. In most cases we know nothing about them other than their stage names. Almost all of the "girls" claim to be 18 or 19, but like Dorian Gray, they seem to stay the same age. Any supposed "facts" that are published are likely nothing more than marketing, and certainly not verifiable. Although Ms. "Shagwell" does exhibit the ability to accept large objects into an orifice generally used for discharges, I fail to see how that distinguishes her from many other nameless "stars" in her profession. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 15:56, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the last two comments were directed at my comments (since I am one of the relatively few to have voted to delete), I thought I made it clear that I am not opposed to having porn stars <i>if</i> they are notable. What I do think is that the concept of what is notable is being grossly distorted by the fact that the porn industry uses the internet for delivery and that the focus on Google hits is a very myopic way to determine the notability of these people. In my opinion, this person does not meet the notability standards of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It seems to me by applying the Google test, anyone who is willing to make a couple of hardcore films under an assumed name is automatically notable under the definitions others are applying. Independent judgment seems completely lacking here, since I see no arguments in favor other than citations to a test which I believe is not an accurate gauge of notability in this case. I have no personal problems with the porn industry existing or even being represented fairly within Wikipedia. I fail to see where that shows any personal bias. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 20:30, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Her <i>claims</i> of being born in such-and-such a place are verifiable. If she is notable, this is all we need be concerned about. Many notable -- but odd -- people give false details in their biographies. The untruth of these is interesting, and might be discussed in any article, but should not prevent otherwise notable articles from passing. No one is certain about the age of <a href="../../../m/a/e/Mae_West_e0e3.html" title="Mae West">Mae West</a> (because she lied about it quite often), the birthplace of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> (because little attention was paid to the birth at the time), or any biographical details of mytho-legendary historical figures galore. What is important is that enough people knew of these notable figures, and accepted details regarding them.

<ul>
<li>I see no verifiability. Please point to the place where she herself (rather than some pornography copywriter just making blurb up to go with the pictures) has actually claimed a nationality and place of birth. In any case, that has no bearing upon the points that I made. Even having pseudonym(s), date of birth, job (that tens of thousands of other people have), claimed nationality, and claimed place of birth doesn't meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria, by an enormous margin. Articles about everyone who ever received a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_card.html" title="Green card">green card</a> would be justified on those grounds.

<li>Whether or not we can verify the claims of where she was born, her age and any other facts is not really the issue. We can verify the age, height and place of birth of any number of people ranging from singers and shop assistants to teachers and students. However this is not sufficient to earn them a place on Wikipedia. What must be established is whether this woman is a <i>notable</i> porn actress. After all, while I have nothing at all against porn actresses appearing on Wikipedia, it is certainly not the case that every single one deserves an article. This is when the google results come into it. Whilst a non-notable teacher would have very few search engine results (perhaps one or two from the school website or that of a local newspaper), a non-notable porn actress may have a very large number of results. This is because they conduct their entire business via the internet whereas for most jobs the internet is fairly irrelevent to their working life. As such we can expect that <i>any</i> porn actress will get a great many search engine results as this is their form of advertising (although note that most of these results are actually automated lists of keywords to inflate page ranks). What <b>we</b> have to establish is whether Ms Shagwell is an especially notable porn actress or whether she is just one of thousands of actresses who have not yet earnt a place on Wikipedia. Google results will not tell us this because any porn actress, notable or not, will get huge numbers of these - their entire source of income depends on it. <a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimt_5387.html" title="User:Wimt">Will</a> =&gt; <a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimt_36f5.html" title="User talk:Wimt">talk</a> 21:06, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of votes, however much you may think that this helps the process. Again, the votes are not the ends in themselves (Wikipedia is not a democracy). Both the context and the order of the comments are essential to understanding the intents of contributors, both at the discussion closure and during the discussion. Refactoring actually makes the job of making the decision at the closure of discussion much harder, not easier.

</ul>
<p><b>BULLSHIT</b> This radio show is created by an independent entity, me (l0de). The gnaa calls in to the show, this is the extent of their participation. All equipment, music, etc is provided by me. Most insults to delete voters are from me, because these people need to unclamp their teeth from their pillows and get on with life. This wikipedia entry was created by a fan of the show, and is a fitting homage to the spirit of the l0de radio hour. Grave repercussions await its deletion. I am personally issuing a challenge to any one voting for delete, I will duel you, to the death, in international waters. If you so strongly wish to have this deleted, you must back up your words with your life, else they shall be considered inconsquential, and those urging its deletion forevermore relegated to the ranks of shunned cowardice.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The cries of "trolling" and "sockpuppetry" perhaps eminate more from the fact that the show is loosely-affiliated with the GNAA rather than any particular judgement upon its merits. Despite what the vote count could perhaps be, it is possible to dismiss whatever the powers that be disagree with by simply dismissing the individuals making the statements. The l0de radio hour is a fairly cutting-edge program that stands out within the realm of internet media as both extremely funny, shocking, and suprisingly topical. Despite the potential obscurity of the show, it has exiested as an internet entity for several years and will continue to thrive for quite some time

<li><i>Delete'</i>. What the GNAA does or does not have to do with the show is irrelevant, though the sockpuppet votes are not exactly supporting the arguments. In fact, the vote above was made by a GNAA member who was honestly arguing the point (I know this because we were talking on IRC as he made it, and I think you can trust me when I say I wasn't trolled...) However, this show is indeed very obscure. I don't see how this can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable|</a>; if the only source of information on the material is the station itself, or its listeners, we should not be reporting on it. <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not for advertising</a>, <i>even</i> if articles are written neutrally. When the station does something that makes it notable in the world (and I mean as in newspaper/major website notable, not "I really think this is revolutionary" notable) we can report on it, because then we'll have some sources with which to back up the claims. Wikipedia doesn't report on the truth, but on all (notable) views of the truth.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> There are a lot of irellevant radio shows on the internets. This is not one of them. While many internet radio shows are dedicated to how sexually appealing an anime character's breasts are or even worse the fact that anonymous sexual intercourse just seems more arousing with a mascot costume on, this show is about relevant and recent news events and presenting them in a way that the aspberger's afflicted community can relate to. A vote for deletion on this item is a vote to marginalize anyone with aspberger's. These are intelligent people with a voice that must be heard.</li>
