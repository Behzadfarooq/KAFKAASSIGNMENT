<p><b>Art history</b> is the study of objects of art in their historical and stylistic contexts.</p>
<p>This discipline is distinguished from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_criticism.html" title="Art criticism">art criticism</a>, which is concerned with placing a relative artistic "value" on individual works with respect to others of generally comparable style, or giving sanction to an entire style or movement; and <i>art theory,</i> which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art and is related more to <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetics.html" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> and determination of the essence of beauty and artistic appeal.</p>
<p>Art history is technically not these things. Art history answers the questions, "How did the artist come to create his or her work?" "Who were his or her patrons? His or her teachers? His or her disciples?" "What historical forces shaped the artist's <a href="../../../o/e/u/Oeuvre.html" title="Oeuvre">oeuvre</a>, and how did he or she and his or her creation in turn affect the course of events, artistic, political and social?"</p>
<p><i>Art history</i> (also called <i>history of art</i>) is a term which encompasses several different methods of studying the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_arts.html" title="Visual arts">visual arts</a>; in its most common usage it refers to the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">academic</a> study of works of art and architecture. The definition is, however, wide-ranging, and some aspects of the discipline overlap with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_criticism.html" title="Art criticism">art criticism</a> and art theory, as noted above, and as is demonstrated by <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Gombrich_72e1.html" title="Ernst Gombrich">Ernst Gombrich</a>'s observation that "the field of art history [is] much like <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Caesar</a>'s <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>, divided into three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: the connoisseurs, the critics and the academic art historians".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Works of criticism or of theory have frequently been the pivots around which the understanding of art history has turned.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition</span></h2>
<p>Art history is a relatively new academic enterprise. Whereas the analysis of historical trends in, for example, politics, literature, and the sciences, benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, a true art history relies on faithful reproductions of artworks as a springboard of discussion and study. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II made this possible. Nevertheless the appreciation and study of the visual arts has intrigued man for millennia. The definition of art history reflects the dichotomy within art; i.e., art as history and in anthropological context; and art as a study in forms.</p>
<p>The study of visual art can be approached through the following broad categories:</p>
<p><b>Contextualism</b> is the approach whereby a work of art is examined in the <i>context</i> of its time; in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and consideration of religious iconography and temporal symbolism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.</p>
<p>In contrast, <b>formalism,</b> as the term suggests, approaches the artwork through an analysis of its form; that is, the creator's use of line, shape, color, texture, and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a two-dimensional picture plane (or the three dimensions of sculptural or architectural space) to create his or her art. A formal analysis can further describe art as <i>representational</i> or <i>non-representational</i>; which answers the question, is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is <i>realistic</i>. If the art is less imitation and more symbolism, or in an important way strives to capture nature's essence, rather than imitate it directly, the art is <i>abstract</i>. Impressionism is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. Of course, realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. If the work is <i>not</i> representational of nature, but an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or his or her search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is <i>non-representational</i> or a work of <i>expressionism.</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>'s <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_History_%28Pliny%29_720f.html" title="Natural History (Pliny)">Natural History</a></i> concerning the development of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_art_e94f.html" title="Ancient Greek art">Greek sculpture and painting</a>. From them it is possible to trace the ideas of <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenokrates_of_Sicyon_5af1.html" title="Xenokrates of Sicyon">Xenokrates of Sicyon</a>, a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian. As a result, Pliny's work, while mainly an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> of the sciences, were disproportionately influential with respect to art from the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> onwards, particularly the passages about the techniques used by the painter <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apelles.html" title="Apelles">Apelles</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: The beginnings of modern art history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The beginnings of modern art history</span></h3>
<p>While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_Ghiberti_4d83.html" title="Lorenzo Ghiberti">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> for the best early example), it was <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giorgio_Vasari_a473.html" title="Giorgio Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a>, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of "Lives of the Painters," who ushered in the era of the story of art as <i>history</i>, with emphasis on art's progression and development, a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, and Vasari's account is enlightening. Vasari's ideas about art held sway until the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, when criticism was leveled at his peculiar style of history as the personal. Scholars such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann_64a9.html" title="Johann Joachim Winckelmann">Johann Joachim Winckelmann</a> (1717-1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and argued that the real emphasis in the study of art belonged on the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_criticism.html" title="Art criticism">art criticism</a>. Winckelmann was famous for his critique of the artistic excesses of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rococo.html" title="Rococo">Rococo</a> forms, and subsequently instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassicism.html" title="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a>, in a return to elemental Renaissance thinking. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Burckhardt_48d5.html" title="Jacob Burckhardt">Jacob Burckhardt</a> (1818 - 1843), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. Incidentally, from Winckelmann until the early 20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: The critical tradition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The critical tradition</span></h3>
<p>Winckelmann's work marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture. Winckelmann was read avidly by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_ea9e.html" title="Johann Wolfgang Goethe">Goethe</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Schiller_7210.html" title="Friedrich Schiller">Schiller</a>, both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laocoon.html" title="Laocoon">Laocoon</a> occasioned a response by <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing_9e89.html" title="Gotthold Ephraim Lessing">Lessing</a>. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_Judgment_b766.html" title="Critique of Judgment">Critique of Judgment</a></i> in 1790, and was furthered by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Hegel_e1c4.html" title="Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel">Hegel</a>'s <i>Lectures on Aesthetics</i>. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Schnaase_de16.html" title="Karl Schnaase">Karl Schnaase</a>'s work. Schnaase's <i>Niederländische Briefe</i> established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his <i>Geschichte der bildenden Künste</i>, one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, faciliated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Theodor_Kugler_8c23.html" title="Franz Theodor Kugler">Franz Theodor Kugler</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: Wölfflin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wölfflin</span></h3>
<p>Most acknowledge <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_W%C3%B6lfflin_fd9e.html" title="Heinrich Wölfflin">Heinrich Wölfflin</a> (1864-1945), who studied under Buckhardt in Basel, as the father of modern art history. Wölfflin certainly made the first formal analysis of the field. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, turning on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly the work of Willhelm Wundt, one of the founders of scientific psychology. A principal, if strained, scientific conception was that of the artistic ideal of corporeal correspondence; i.e. that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facade.html" title="Facade">façades</a> looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. Hence by comparing individual paintings to each other, one were able to make distinctions of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic.html" title="Artistic">style</a>. His book <i><a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">Baroque</a></i> developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giorgio_Vasari_a473.html" title="Giorgio Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a>, Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationhood.html" title="Nationhood">nationhood</a>. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "<a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a>" and an inherently "<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_culture.html" title="German culture">German</a>" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_3199.html" title="Albrecht Dürer">Albrecht Dürer</a>.</p>
<p>He used a comparison - contrast type of analysis, and believed that both Renaissance and Baroque architecture "spoke" the same language - that of classical Greek and Rome - though with different dialects.</p>
<p>Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including Jakob Rosenberg and Frida Schottmuller.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Vienna_6835.html" title="University of Vienna">University of Vienna</a>. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Riegl_a4a7.html" title="Alois Riegl">Alois Riegl</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Wickhoff_19cb.html" title="Franz Wickhoff">Franz Wickhoff</a>, both students of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moritz_Thausing_da66.html" title="Moritz Thausing">Moritz Thausing</a>, and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_antiquity.html" title="Late antiquity">late antiquity</a>, which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.</p>
<p>The next generation of professors at Vienna included <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k_3bdc.html" title="Max Dvořák">Max Dvořák</a>, Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Strzygowski_652c.html" title="Josef Strzygowski">Josef Strzygowski</a>. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Gombrich_72e1.html" title="Ernst Gombrich">Ernst Gombrich</a>, received their degrees at Vienna at this time.</p>
<p>However, the term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") is usually reserved for the following generation of Viennese scholars, including <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Sedlmayr_91cd.html" title="Hans Sedlmayr">Hans Sedlmayr</a>, Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of <i>Kunstwollen</i>, and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconography.html" title="Iconography">iconography</a>, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestratined and irresponsible <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formalism.html" title="Formalism">formalism</a>, and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The opposite tendency, focusing more, although not exclusively, on iconography, was developed by a loose group of scholars who gathered in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Panofsky_e8d8.html" title="Erwin Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/y/Aby_Warburg_e7e3.html" title="Aby Warburg">Aby Warburg</a>, and Fritz Saxl. Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the middle ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in post-classical art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Hamburg_3344.html" title="University of Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a>, where Panofsky taught.</p>
<p>Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warburg_Institute_2a1d.html" title="Warburg Institute">Warburg Institute</a>. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Advanced_Study_d005.html" title="Institute for Advanced Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s (the so-called "emigré scholars"), which also included <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Kitzinger_c7d5.html" title="Ernst Kitzinger">Ernst Kitzinger</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Krautheimer_db6d.html" title="Richard Krautheimer">Richard Krautheimer</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Brendel_5518.html" title="Otto Brendel">Otto Brendel</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Wittkower_9856.html" title="Rudolf Wittkower">Rudolf Wittkower</a>. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for at least a generation.</p>

<p>Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> wrote a book on the artist <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, in which Freud used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psyche.html" title="Psyche">psyche</a> and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>. The use of posthumous material to perform <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoanalysis.html" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> is controversial; furthermore, the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different.</p>
<p>After Freud, several other scholars have applied psychoanalytic theory to art. One of the most well know of which is Laurie Schnieder Adams, who wrote a popular textbook Art Across Time.</p>

<p>Since Heinrich Wolfflin's time, art history has embraced <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_history.html" title="Social history">social history</a> by using critical approaches. The goal of these approaches is to show how art interacts with power structures in society. The first critical approach that art historians used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural (<a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>).</p>

<p>Even Marxism has figured in the interpretation of art. <a href="../../../m/e/y/Meyer_Schapiro_aaad.html" title="Meyer Schapiro">Meyer Schapiro</a> was the first art historian to take Marxism seriously. While he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and early <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, at which time he saw evidence of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> emerging and <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a> declining.</p>
<p>Arnold Hauser wrote the first marxist survey of Western Art, titled "The Social History of Art." In this book he attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. His book was very controversial when it was published during the 1950s because it makes gross generalizations about entire eras. However, it remains in print as a classic art historical text.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._J._Clark_%28historian%29_9bbc.html" title="T. J. Clark (historian)">T.J. Clark</a> was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon vulgar Marxism per se. He wrote Marxist art histories of several <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionist.html" title="Impressionist">impressionist</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realism_%28visual_arts%29.html" title="Realism (visual arts)">realist</a> artists, including Gustav <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courbet.html" title="Courbet">Courbet</a> and Eduard <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manet.html" title="Manet">Manet</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: Divisions by period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Divisions by period</span></h2>
<p>The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions. Such divisions typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prehistoric</li>
<li>Ancient</li>
<li>Medieval</li>
<li>Renaissance</li>
<li>Baroque</li>
<li>19th Century</li>
<li>20th Century/Contemporary</li>
<li>Africa</li>
<li>Pre-Columbian or Ancient Americas</li>
<li>Asia</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of sub-fields are included under each specialization. For example, the Ancient Near East, Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of Ancient art. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus Korean art, for example).</p>
<p>Non-Western art is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying Ancient Rome or the Italian Renaissance, scholars specializing in Africa, the Ancient Americas and Asia are a growing minority.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Edit section: Methodologies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Methodologies</span></h2>
<p>Art historians employ a number of methods in their research into the qualities, nature and history of objects.</p>
<p>A <i>formal</i> analysis is one which focuses on the form of the object in question. Elements of form include line, shape, color, composition, rhythm, etc. At its simplest, such an analysis is simply exegesis, but it relies heavily on the art historian's ability to think critically and visually.</p>
<p>A <i>stylistic</i> analysis is one which focuses on the particular combination of formal elements into a coherent style. Often, a stylistic analysis makes reference to movements or trends in art as a means of drawing out the impact and import of a particular object.</p>
<p>An <i>iconographical</i> analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these motifs. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and/or aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.</p>
<p>Finally, many art historians use <i>theory</i> to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. A somewhat vague term, theoretical approaches to art can range quite broadly, from psychological analysis to aesthetics to Marxist critique and more.</p>
