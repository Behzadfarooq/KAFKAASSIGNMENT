<li><strike><b>Neutral</b>.</strike> I'm much more tempted to vote Keep on malls that are upscale (read: have a "swanky kind of store" like Saks or Neiman-Marcus, which are fairly rare), and are major commerce centers in their cities, like <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenox_Square_f5b8.html" title="Lenox Square">Lenox Square</a> in Atlanta, or the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Plaza_and_Bay_Street_db6c.html" title="International Plaza and Bay Street">International Plaza and Bay Street</a> in Tampa (an article I wrote, actually). If this is the main mall in Asheville, I'll probably vote keep, but it needs a lot more than this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 09:45, May 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see that the article has an "Other meanings" section, but since "white powder" as an alternative explosive/propellant to "black powder" is not the phrase's meaning most often seen in the press in recent years, I vote to <b>disambiguate</b>. Cocaine, anthrax, and unknown-suspected-contraband are all at least as common uses of "white powder" as this one. This article should be kept, but I don't think this meaning should redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_candy.html" title="Rocket candy">rocket candy</a>. Maybe <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_candy.html" title="Rocket candy">rocket candy</a> should redirect to White powder (propellant) or whatever title this article gets after disambiguation. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:49, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Article seems to document a movement forming which could develop at least a fringe significance. For now, it appears to be a neologism (WP documents the existence of neologisms as a concept, but WP doesn't keep articles on each one), not quite original research (unless it's more vanity than it appears), but not yet established as notable per Google searches. Probably Lumano should <b>userfy</b> it for now, and if the term reaches common notoriety, then this fairly good article can be restored to main article space. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:00, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just because something fails deletion criteria, doesn't mean it should automatically be kept.

<li>This boils down to how one interprets the policy, and whether one should adhere to the <i>letter</i> or the <i>spirit</i> thereof. One can make a valid point for 'non-notability' being a valid reason for deletion, based on policy and precedent. One can <i>also</i> make a valid point for the opposite.

Yeah, he got a mention in the Post and USA Today, but the entire contents of the Post article was "• OMAHA -- Brandenn E. Bremmer, a musical prodigy who completed high school at age 10, apparently killed himself at 14, authorities said. Brandenn, who had studied piano improvisation at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, Colo., was found dead Tuesday at his home with a gunshot wound to the head, sheriff's officials said." Is everything ever mentioned in one of the nations top 10 newspapers automatically encyclopedic? The Post printed the weather in San Diego today as well, should there be an article on that? They must print millions of sentences a year, and 2 have been devoted to this kid. If you look at that link supplied by verdana above you'll see several other Post articles primarily of regional interest are printed along with this one. Are all such things going to be wikipedia articles? Wouldn't it have been great if wikipedia 500,000th article turned out to be "• FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Three teenagers kidnapped a 15-year-old and ordered his father to drop off a $50 ransom at a Taco Bell, authorities said.

<dd>"Widely reported" is a bit of a stretch. I think a two sentence blurb in a few papers is hardly "wide". Every minor thing mentioned somehow in the news on a single day is encyclopedic material? Pick up any paper on any day and you'll see hundreds of things given this kind of coverage. Are they covered in encyclopedias? Are they recorded for posterity? Shall I write an article on that dog that was reunited with it's family after 2 years that I saw on the news several times yesterday? Or what about that day about 2 years ago when CNN gave substantial live coverage about a small airplane that was making an emergency landing without a front landing gear? I remember it, so it must be notable, I guess. And your comment "This made the news... do you not watch the news or read newspapers?" strikes me as a bit condescending. This was not the Space Shuttle expolding, this was 2 sentences buried in the Washington Post that I'm sure 99.99999% of the world's population took no note of.

<dd>It wasn't condescending, it was in response to someone who seemed to be under the impression this was some kind of family-written vanity page, even though it had already been pointed out that this did genuinely make the news (and not just the local papers, but internationally). By the way, The New York Times gave it 22 paragraphs (some of only one sentence, of course), and Google News counts at least 231 newspapers internationally that ran the wire story or wrote their own <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brandenn+Bremmer&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brandenn+Bremmer&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in the UK, India, etc. This is not a vanity page, nor a memorial, nor a music-related article to be judged on musician notability criteria, nor a topic of purely local interest, nor a "man bites dog" trivia filler story. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 07:57, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I was serious in my comment, but I must have missed the part in my argument where I said what you're implying I said. My argument is that just because something doesn't meet the <i>explicitly-listed</i> deletion criteria, doesn't mean it should be automatically kept - remember that someone in the know can write a full-length article on things which shouldn't be here (note that the list on <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> is not exhaustive). It should be noted that this article <i>does</i> meet deletion criteria, specifically "No potential to become encyclopedic" and "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a>" (read it again - it very blatantly is one, compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandenn_Bremmer&amp;oldid=11282617" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandenn_Bremmer&amp;oldid=11282617" rel="nofollow">this</a> to the example given). It's also worth noting that your argument re: the music guidelines is also flawed. "I mean, that <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono.html" title="Bono">Bono</a> guy is a nobody, he's never in the news - the fact that he's the lead singer of the <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">biggest rock band in the world</a> should be neither here nor there." One of the major points made in the article is that he was a musical prodigy, thus it should be also judged under the music notability guidelines. You're also flawed in your idea of how many news companies "ran" this story. Just because it appears on their Web site, doesn't mean it was printed in the paper. In fact, most of those on Google News probably didn't give the story column inches in their dead-tree editions, or actual coverage on TV. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 16:29, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">vanity page</a> is a page about a topic or person known to only a small group of people in a local area, usually written for the purpose of boosting the fame or recognition of that person or topic, and usually written by someone directly involved with or acquainted with the topic or person.
<dl>
<dd>Right, which is exactly what I think this article is - attempting to boost recognition for someone hasn't otherwise garnered it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A topic that made the news internationally is, virtually by definition, not a vanity topic.
<dl>
<dd>404 <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">Logic</a> not found.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Your original post mischaracterized this as something that "[made] the local newspaper", and although you have repeatedly been informed otherwise and provided references, you now treat us to your unfounded speculation about how this story "probably" wasn't actually printed anywhere... I can personally attest that it did appear both in print and on television news in a non-local area.
<dl>
<dd>So it was a slow news day. Ultimately, newspapers have a given number of pages to fill, and TV has the same problem - if there's not enough <i>real</i> news to fill the paper, then they have to turn to things like this. See it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>One of the things people use encyclopediasfor is to look up background information about news stories they recall, and since <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> this meets a minimum threshold for being encyclopedic. And once again, the music guidelines you cite are completely and absolutely irrelevant... by your criteria <small>Warning! <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a> alert!</small> <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> should be deleted because he wasn't a notable artist.
<dl>
<dd>No, Hitler should be kept as a notable world leader, since that's the one thing he's best known for. According to both the article, and the Google results for his name, the one thing this guy was most associated with <i>before his death</i> was as a musical prodigy. As such, judging under the music guidelines is the Right Thing. Again, you seem to be caught up in this notion that everything that makes the news belongs in Wikipedia. Excuse me for noticing that the guy that egged <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> (and that made the news big time) doesn't have an article, and neither does whoever it was that harassed <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> outside that hopsital 4 years ago (we had to put up with that for a whole week). Now, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Keeler_7ff3.html" title="Christine Keeler">Christine Keeler</a> has an article. She made the news, but her incident was a national scandal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I readily agree that if someone had added this kid's bio one day before his suicide, it would have been deleted as a vanity page of a non-notable musician. But the international news story of his death, which received considerably more coverage than you were aware of or willing to admit, became a sufficiently minimally notable internationally news story (deservedly or not) that a background article on this news story meets the minimum threshold for being encyclopedic in a non-paper encyclopedia without size limitations.
<dl>
<dd>How about you shut up with the pointless conjecture and actually come up with a <b>convincing</b> argument for keeping this? The fact that it's made the news <b>does not</b> change the fact that the whole of this story is "There's this kid, really good at music, studying at college at 14, and he kills himself." That is not the makings of someone who deserves an encyclopaedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I personally don't really care all that much about this kid or his sad life and death, but I dislike seeing mischaracterizations of this topic and misapplication of irrelevant criteria.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Sort of an interesting dilemma. People who commit suicide are not inherently notable, but child geniuses who commit suicide so that their organs might go to save others probably are... and indeed, the news reports suggest that his organs went to several needy people. But I have to wonder if the story is all there - maybe his death was triggered not by altruism, but merely by the enormous pressures to which prodigies are subjected; maybe his mother's belief that his suicide was prompted by such a selfless motive is her own projection onto him of her values. Either way, very sad, but the prodigy-suicide combined with the <i>possibility</i> of a notably unusual motive tips the balance for me. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="#FF5500">gab</font></sup></a> 11:39, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)

<li>I get the feeling that the whole organ donation thing is purely anecdotal. Worse still, given the publication dates of some of the newspaper articles, some might have been running with it based on the fact that "Oh, he's in Wikipedia, he must be important".

<p>I have resuscitated this VfD because an article on the same subject has been provided afresh. (On 3 May, originally telling us that <i>there was a side of him that hit the highest spectrums of natural intelligence.</i>) As you'll see, although the VfD process at first may appear to have resulted in a decision to delete, what actually happened was that after some rather lively debate the article was found to be a copyvio, listed as a copyvio, not revised, and deleted as a copyvio. There was no decision about the WP-worthiness of Brandenn Bremmer.</p>
<p>Bremmer still strikes me as a more than averagely interesting teen who had a more than averagely interesting suicide. Good fodder for the "human interest" sections of "news" sources on a slow day, but very minor and ephemeral news. He was no Mozart and his suicide was, sadly, not particularly remarkable. This doesn't strike me as encyclopedic stuff, and my "delete" proposal of 19 March still stands. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:38, 2005 May 5 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't feel that is an appropriate argument for keeping.

<li>I hope you're not going to waste everybody's time by writing a new article here so we can have a third VfD on it. All the above delete votes were based on inherent notability issues, not article quality. I'd hate to see this turn into one of those cases where someone tries to "improve" an article on a nobody by turning it into their entire life story, no detail ignored, as if mentioning someone's hobbies, family, and other mundane details is somehow going to make a subject encyclopedic.

<p>At 00:44, 2005 May 7, <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> deleted the entire content of the VfD project page, in conjunction with his or her creation of a new page about Brandenn Bremmer. Putting aside the question of the legitimacy of deleting a VfD page, I see much of the discussion above as <i>not</i> specific to this or that previous article about Bremmer, but rather about the noteworthiness of Bremmer. This made the resuscitation of the content of this page particularly important, but I'd have resuscitated it anyway, as VfD pages are "preserved as an [sic] historic record" -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:10, 2005 May 7 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any concerns about deleting an article with no explaination? I have never seen the original article. There seemed to some kind of voting taking place about an article that didn't exist - very odd. I think it may be very confusing to leave the debris of an aborted discussion about an article that has already been deleted here, especially when <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">User:Hoary</a> has tagged a new article of the same title as VfD.

<ul>
<li>You have already raised this point, and I have already answered it, in the talk page. Interested readers can see that. Please do not remove the VfD notice from the article a second time; removing a VfD notice (however misguided you happen to think it may be) constitutes vandalism. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:45, 2005 May 7 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I gave a cogent reason for the removal, so it is improper to label it "vandalism". Your VfD was entered on May 7, yet it points to a May 5 discussion about an article that was deleted. You need to create a new VfD entry dated May 7. My removal of the VfD notice was entirely proper. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 04:53, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And articles that are deleted stay deleted unless there's a compelling reason otherwise. The consensus is respected - if we held a new VfD every time someone recreated a deleted page, we'd gridlock Wikipedia in 10 seconds flat. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:15, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>If articles were deleted based on their subject and not due to transitory problems, then there would be no need to recreate deleted pages. But the vfd process is horribly broken, and thus recreations are sometimes necessary. If you want to stop recreations, then stop the deletion of articles based on transitory problems. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 13:17, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, it's notable, and I don't feel there's any reason to believe this is self-promotion. I would guess it's one of, if not <i>the</i> most, popular extensions for Firefox.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> as noted by Android. Firefox extensions are more notable than any other plug-ins I can think of, and Adblock is both the most popular and most discussed-in-the-media of these extensions. But I think the amount of encyclopedic information available makes it more fit for a description in <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html#Customizability" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla_Firefox#Customizability</a> than for a separate article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:25, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. Actually Adblock is already mentioned in many places. We certainly can't create an article for every Firefox extension. That would be crazy!

It appears that many of the objections to the entry are based on a distaste for the articles' presumed author rather than a legitimate objection to its presence in the wiki.

<p>The page has been created by the Webmaster of the only site that mentions "wholism", and therefore looks like vanity or original research; as a result it has no potential to become encyclopædic. The creator has stated on the Talk page his lack of interest in Wikipedia and unwillingness to learn how to improve the article, so there's unlikely to be any help from him. The supposed religion is merely <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">Pantheism</a>. Two editors have tried to make the article a redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holism.html" title="Holism">holism</a>, but it has been recreated; a redirect to Pantheism might be the best solution. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:22, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that Goethean is the vandal. He keeps reverting all my contributions, which are quite specific and descriptive, such as <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whole.html" title="Whole">Whole</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/o/Wholon.html" title="Wholon">Wholon</a> etc to his favourite <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holism.html" title="Holism">holism</a>. What is the 'Whole' if it is not God? If he wants to revert the word whole ( without the capital c) to holism then let him. But I don't see that the word whole is specific to holism anyway.

<p>Non notable concept of M.G. Miller for space drive which would contradict the laws of physics and without the slightest hint, how it can be build.

<dd>Oh come now, comparing this short-run sex comic to <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>? I'll concede, though, that "Slut Girl" + Isutoshi does top 1000 hits... but I have faith that the vfd process will work correctly, one way or the other. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD</font><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">Abram</font><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">son</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">thi</font><font color="red"><b>m</b></font><font color="DarkGreen">k</font></sup></a> 17:26, 2005 May 5 (UTC)

<li>It's a Beatles article, my first instinct would be to call such a thing notable. It even has an external link.

<li>the external link is to the page of the person trying to sell the item Vincent Ruello and his alleged manager. His claim to have an item worth millions (article "almost priceless piece") is not supported at <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/hobart/stories/s602028.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/hobart/stories/s602028.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

In other articles of the group, Allan Kissick does not seem to have ever managed the Easybeats (googleing he only exists on 2 'pedia mirrors), I can find no record of the Hope Album (google ("Hope Album" Ruello) no hits). I have removed references from the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easybeats.html" title="Easybeats">Easybeats</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> articles, which were effectively vandalism. The only google hits on "Last Memento of The Beatles" are the site selling it and wikipedia mirrors. ("Drops of light" has more important meanings) '"Drops of light" ruello' gets 1 hit (you can listen to their music) 'pentultima ruello' a massive 4 hits. Given the author's unreliability on all these facts, I would not want to rely on the article being a genuine Beatles association item, without a reliable source, but even if it were, there's <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=50&amp;item=6529104641&amp;rd=1" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=50&amp;item=6529104641&amp;rd=1" rel="nofollow">thousands</a> out there (I have books that belonged to J.R.R.Tolkien, but they're not worthy of articles, and wouldn't be even if they were extensively autographed). <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a> 23:00, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rich Farmbrough you are a jeolous vindictive person doing things against the spirit and policy of Wikipedia. The last memento of the beatles is exactly what it says. This must be allowed to stay. the history of Drops of light and Allan Kisick is also true and relevant. Michael Heatley who is the manager today at EMI London is the agent for Apple still and current. If anyone dares remove any of my historical articles due to jeolousy or other motives you will be reported and the articles will simply go back up.

<p>Richard, this is a beautiful late rare memento with exquisite pedigree. Phil Jenkinson who made the cartoon wobble on the BBC launch for the album working with Rowan was the pioneer of pop/rock clips. there are not thousands of these out there, I own the original and have only released a couple of dozen. This is the only history made available of this piece. Im honored to be here at wikipedia and to meet you all.Vince.</p>

<li>As the "creator" of this article, and I use the term sparingly, I really don't object to this article being deleted. Incredibly, this initially formed the bulk of the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fluoridation.html" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> article, and unfortunetely I haven't had the time, or the assistance to begin sifting through it, and searching for coherent/useful information. If anyone wants to step in and rescue something, that might be a good thing, but I believe that most of it is junk anyway. It just seemed unfair to come in and delete what was such a large portion of content, that had seemingly developed over time, without giving the editors at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fluoridation.html" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> a chance to save some of it. Given that it has been a few weeks now, I think it's reasonable to delete it now, but we should give a couple of days for the editors at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fluoridation.html" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> to oppose this, as the article does link to this page, and that is where the content originated from and was developed. I'll post something to the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fluoridation.html" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> discussion page, and if there's no response in a couple of days, I'd say its quite fair to remove the page. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendanfox_bfcb.html" title="User:Brendanfox">Brendanfox</a> 11:18, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I will first say that I believe the original <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fluoridation.html" title="Water fluoridation">Water fluoridation</a> article is very much inadequate seeing that it is definitely not neutral and no where near the overwhelming concensus of international scientific research (notice there are 4 links to "pro-fluoridation" sites and 19 links to "anti-fluoridation" sites). Nonetheless, what I think someone was trying to do was to make the Water fluoridation quotes article be a place to relieve some of the clutter from the original article. I do not think it worked, and it is definitely a mess. Instead, as I believe it has been suggested earlier, if the authors want to write an extensive article on the objections to water fluoridation (using "facts" and opinions disputed by most of the scientific world), I think they should do it in another article entitled something like Water Fluoridation (controversy) and have the majority of the original article expressing facts (such as where water fluoridation is used/banned) and conclusions accepted by the scientific community. A bit of this controversy might be fine in the original article to represent the beliefs of some people, but I do not think it would do much good to just move/keep this amount of quotes in the original article. <a href="../../../d/o/z/User%7EDozenist_62e6.html" title="User:Dozenist">dozenist</a> 04:14, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is trivially short and seems unexpandable. It contains only such trivia as "Snæbjörn is not a common name in Iceland.", a dicdef, and the amount of people bearing the name.</p>
<p>This was the subject of an <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sn%C3%A6bj%C3%B6rn_old_c556.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Snæbjörn/old">earlier VfD</a> which yielded no consensus since several people suggested <i>transwiki</i> or <i>merge</i>. The article has now been put in Wiktionary, and no suitable place exists to merge it to.
