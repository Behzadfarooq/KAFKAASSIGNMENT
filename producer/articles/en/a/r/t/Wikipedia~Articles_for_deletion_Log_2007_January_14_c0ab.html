<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, quite possibly able to condense and merge into a parent article or character page. I don't see a reason to have it on wikipedia but as it goes with articles on games exceptions could be made, just so long as WP guidelines aren't completely ignored. It is often quite hard to find appropriate third party sources, in those cases one or two articles could survive if they have been well prepared. But without sources, references, formatting, templates, and links it’s just a worthless paragraph.-- <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 00:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it is clear I was hasty nominating this page for deletion but I think I should make my issues with this page clear. In my mind there is a huge distinction between fictional discography and real discography. Spinal Taps real world discography has a place on Wikipedia, there fictional discography (In this level of detail) is pure cruft and does not. The problem is the article's title is not all that clear, since Tap has both fictional and real discographies it might be best to have a renamed article along the lines of "Real world Spinal Tap discography" or some such. The fist line is all that really prompted me to nominate, I read it and thought, "Wow this is really not what Wikipedia is." I apologize for not thinking it all the way through. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Not "unsourced"</i> because others voting to 'delete' point out that most sections have their own article (which needs to be sourced). The article at hand is to be compared with 'List of...' and other overview articles. The separate topics are clearly related but the relationship cannot neatly be expressed in each main article (each would then require 'see also' links to all others, whereas now a single 'see also' link suffices). Neither can it be merged because none of the more specific articles has a wide enough scope for all others. Any unsourced section not referring to its main article, simply requires being tagged as such, allowing to improve it or after a while remove only that section. If as has been pointed out, the <i>name</i> of the article could be considered improper (technically not fetishism, or not a coined term, term as OR), the <i>title</i> of the article needs to be improved. Though some 'delete' voters have made ostentatively clear not to fully appreciate the topic ("Every fetish does not deserve an article", "As silly as it sounds, well you get the idea... AAA", "DAFT"), that is no excuse to apply WP standards more lightheartedly or eagerly. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_15.html" title="Jan 15">15 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 10:14&#160;(UTC)</span>

<dd>I think you miss the issue with this article. The question is whether those articles can all be linked together by <i>semen fetishism</i>, which is not an editorial decision. It requires a reliable source to be found which states that there is a notable fetish called "semen fetishism" and/or that the acts described in it are forms of <i>semen fetishism</i>. One cannot just presume that those who engage in these acts are semen fetishists (which would be a judgment by editors), there must be a source for such a claim. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 10:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>For the same reasons given at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Renai_game" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Renai_game" rel="nofollow">Ren'ai games AFD</a>. The term "anime game" is a neologism not used by any reliable sources. The only definition "anime game" can consistantly apply to is "a video game based off an anime". We don't have articles for "Movie games" or "TV show games", there's really no reason we need one for "Anime games". The term is also not used in Japanese at all. There has been much debate over what is the overbranching genre for <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sims</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">visual novels</a>, and due to there being no consensus, this is a move to do away with even trying to connect them. There are too many exceptions to be able to group them together.

<dd>And about the POV: who decides who is important to have an article here? You? I repeat: if I make an article about me, I am allowed to include myself in the list? If yes, I hope you understand about what my list is.</dd>
<dd>If you think someone is not notable enough to be a "Personality", it can be removed (presumbly you give some reason). If there is any list you could delete, it's your list: your list can be constructed if you only put a tag "Iasi" to the article of the person born in Iasi. Simple enough, so if you want I can do it for you.</dd>

<dd>Subjective?? I can give you examples of national or international recognition for every entry. How is this subjective? About your argument that my list is just a fork where I removed the entries I didn't liked: I specifically told that the list for personality would have people who had big contributions to Romania or Iasi. What is the contribution of Nicolae Vogoride? Just because he was a Moldavian governor he deserves to be in the list with personalities? For that matter who is Samuel Leibowitz? Hes entry is 3 lines and he was an attorney in USA. I am very sure that it is not subjective for me to not consider him a personality. I stand by my argument that you have a list with people that are born in Iasi, mine is with people who contributed to the advancement of Romania. For me this is complettely different from what you want. I told you, your list could be generated if you put a tag born-in-Iasi to the articles. cristi 09:50, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I know what is the problem. You don't know what subjective is.Let me help you with this one: modified or affected by personal views, experience, or background (from Merriam-Webster). Let me point to you an other word: Objective: expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. If I say some one is not important doesn't mean that I am subjective. In fact the fallacy applies to your argument: there is no objective difference between people and "personalities". Maybe you should check the link yourself.</dd>
<dd>So, I don't see where I'm subjective if I only state what the majority of people are saying (I feel I must explain to you that "majority of people" means, in my context, what is considered to be intelligent people. Not you or me, but people who managed to demonstrate that they are capable to judge a person *objectively*. Again, check the definitions.).</dd>
<dd>One more thing, because I feel you need it: personality - distinction or excellence of personal and social traits; also&#160;: a person having such quality b&#160;: a person of importance, prominence, renown, or notoriety. Hope it helps you understand what the words you use mean.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, in English calling someone a "personality" carries the connotation that they are a little peculiar, strange, not quite normal. It's often used as a euphemism for "really weird person".

<dd>I agree it's poorly written, but it's a copy of the other list with the persons that are not notable removed. The reason for deletion was POV. About the birthdates, they can be removed easily if it's a problem. The other points apply to the other list as well (the red links). I did this list because I didn't wanted to be polluted by small time, insignificant people. A list where only the persons with great value for the city will be inserted. What is so hard to understand? I want to know if the reason for deletion has changed or it's still because of my POV, like in the first line on this page. It seems Charlene didn't even read the first line of the discussion, but she still want's the page deleted. If "personality" is such a bad word (but from the english definition it has the same meaning as in romanian), it can be changed with something else. I want to know the reason why it has to be deleted: it is still POV, or the quality (I can work on that), or both. I have some definition for the words used in this discussion in my other post, so maybe you should read those before posting (this is for Charlene). For the last time: my list is supposed to have great minds and people with a great impact on the lifes of the citizens. Dhan, maybe you should respond to Charlene also, because we had some discussion about some of the red links I removed. cristi 08:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, and this is <i>the last time</i> I'm replying on this topic (given that the issue is as clear-cut to me as clear-cut gets): the red links that you see there are to future articles (part of which I'm planning to create in the future). Since I do not particularly enjoy creating illegible and ridiculous stubs such as the ones you created for various people (such as <a href="../../../g/h/e/Gheorghe_Br%C4%83escu_684b.html" title="Gheorghe Brăescu">Gheorghe Brăescu</a>), I take my time in creating <i>actual articles</i> (Bujor is on my list, and I have already mentioned him in three articles or so). Also, since I do not want to go and do the same research over and over again (or reverting once I do create those articles) I would appreciate it if the list is not purged due to who some guy has hard about and who he has not.</dd>
<dd>A while back, I bumped into a question about Bujor and <i>any</i> details of his life, as posed to Wiki reference desk. It had been answered by an editor, who indicated that Bujor was [at the time] only mentioned as red link in the <a href="../../../p/s/d/PSDR_d526.html" title="PSDR">PSDR</a> article (which I had created). See <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_archive_Humanities_2006_September_18_a20f.html#Mihai_Gheorghiu_Bujor" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk archive/Humanities/2006 September 18">Wikipedia:Reference desk archive/Humanities/2006 September 18#Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor</a>. Following the same theory as Croisti Falcas, one would remove red links willy-nilly in that article as well, leaving us with <i>no</i> context or data on a relevant person.</dd>
<dd>As it is, I am <i>one of two or three persons</i> contributing information on the entire interwar period in Romania, as well as on related subjects. At a quick glance, Bujor is mentioned, with details, in 4 major sources I have tapped into. I cannot be expected to continuously furnish information on topics, and I certainly <i>will</i> not do it because some user, who is not even polite to me, and who has contributed nothing of any value to the project, is pretending I cannot prove they are relevant. I also cannot help but point out that the said user has no idea of how wikipedia works, and, for some reason, imagines that collecting particular data on particular persons is an easy job.</dd>
<dd>As I have mentioned already, virtually all those people are on the list are mentioned in the standard issue (and not at all exhaustive) Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary of 1978. It is utter bullshit to claim that there is some other, hidden, criterion of notability that has somehow elluded me, and that it is "objective" just because Cristi Falcas can type certain words in ALL CAPITALS.</dd>
<dd>You, Cristi Falcas, on the other hand, have no access to sources, and little knowledge of your own country's history (it is frankly embarrassing that a residence of Iaşi found out who Nicolae Vogoride was yesterday, and that this Iaşi resident has produced theories about the depth of <i>my</i> culture).</dd>
<dd>Bottom line: deleting those entries is hurting the informative value of the project, and only answers to the whim of a person who has not even understood what this project is about. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First, I just responded to Charlene about the removal of red links, no reason the call me names for this one. I have removed the link to people from Iasi because I started to see what you want. I still have other points unsolved, but I will take them on the List of people from Iaşi discussion page. Have a good day. cristi 15:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The statement by the article's creator and sole author (just above, which said: "After reading of the policy, I do not find that it is need of being deleted") is a conclusory statement without any evidence in support. I do not see a reason to withdraw the nomination or change my opinion on this issue at present. I do recognize that it can be an ever-bending issue in a forum such as Wikipedia. For instance, not long ago the accepted position was that only colleges should merit inclusion as articles in WP, and fairly quickly many more of the AfD debates have moved to high schools, and even to elementary schools. Similarly with blogs maybe; but I've been under the impression that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">WP:notability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a> and other relevant guidelines have still been intended to mean we shouldn't use WP to introduce and attempt to disseminate a blog, but should instead constrain ourselves to describing such an endeavor only after it achieves widespread attention of its own accord. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 03:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey, No problem at all, I certainly understand and agree by Wikipedia policy that it really did not belong. Here in the Missouri, U.S. it was late, I just hope that my tone did not come off as too cranky. It was just not a priority for me at the moment to really try to defend the page being on Wiki. Perhaps in the future as I gain experience with the encyclopedia, a policy and project could be designed for academic oriented sites (if not through the encyclopedia, through another site). You arguments were well defined, certainly no need for apology. Do take care, Kenneth.</dd>

<p>This article covers a single advertisement placed by the UK Conservative Party in 2004. There is no real assertion of that add campaign's notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> The sources are there, and three of the four are reliable gaming sites. However, nobody seems to have too many details on the game yet.

That he was given finance to create a short film is great but if the film then doesn't do much it's not of any importance, yes it showed in a couple of film festivals where hundreds of other films may have been shown, unless the film is nominated for an award or receives acclaim then it isn't worth being noted.

<p><b>*Comment</b> Well, it looks like were going down in flames here. I don't think that losing this artile will shake the pillars of WP, but neither would keeping it. I think that Adam is in the grey area of notability. Oh well; oh hell! However I think there are some confusing precedents being asserted here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Capitalistroadster says that we don't have relaible sources. But we have many citations in the bibliography. Is that because our sources are online?</dd>
<dd>(2) EdJohnston says <i>"we should be holding out for some outside press comment"</i>, what is the outside press? Is that referring to printed material?</dd>
<dd>(3) People keep saying he lacks <i>"importance"</i>, while WP Bio specifically says that "notable" is not as high of a standard as "important" or "famous".</dd>
<dd>(4) I think that people are equating the short length of the movies with a lack of impact. Because the genre is less noticed, doesn't mean it isn't noticed.</dd>
<dd>(5) People have said that the references are about his work rather than him. I think this is fallacy; when the body of work is notable so is the creator. Inherently the producers are in the background compared to the directors and actors, but their contributions are none the less notable.</dd>
<dd>(6) The author has provided some background information about Adam's TV work, but some critics above have focused on the non-notable contribution to the more famous genre, rather than look to the notable contribution to the less famous genre. It's a lack of being able to see the trees in the forrest through the clutter of underbrush -- a writting style of building to the climax, rather than putting the <b>NOTABILITY</b> in bold in the first paragraph.

<li>Kevin, I opened and viewed every single link listed under "Bibliography" and "Notes". Most of those links only cite his name, some don't even mention that and then you've got a couple that list his very, <i>very</i> minor professional TV credits. As I said, the links pad out the reference list and give the appearance of notability when in reality this guy simply isn't a notable Australian and he isn't a notable film maker. He's making not-notable shorts, some as part of courses, to send in as entries into film festivals and to community TV. He's just not notable and his films are just not notable. <b>Sarah</b> 02:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sarah, I didn't write this article. I found it at AfD in pretty poor shape and have worked to remove a lot of "puff" and focus on the only notable aspect, which is as a film producer.

<li>Yes, there are links to sites which mention him as included in the festivals etc.; it's not how he is mentioned that is important, but where he is mentioned that supports the verifiability of the text. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, it's an absolute stretch to call him an "award-winning Australian Film Producer" on the basis of the Raw Nerve Initiative. The Raw Nerve Initative is a partly government backed minor funding program, not an awards program. It gives a very small amount cash and very limited services to make a short film.

<li>This is certainly better than a category. Even so, "villain" is a tricky word. "Supervillain" is fairly objective because it has specific criteria, generally the characters are specifically labeled as such, but "villain" in general involves a lot of opinion and interpretation. I question the need for this list, though. Most villains in comics and graphic novels are supervillains. As for the minority who aren't, how have they been defined? Does the list cite outside sources that identify the characters as villains like the strict criteria we follow at the anti-hero list? For now, I'll say <b>delete</b> (and a pretty <b>strong delete</b> at that) for the use of a vague term that invokes POV. Should the list gain more objective criteria with external references like the anti-hero list <i>and</i> define itself in a way that reduces redundancy to the supervillain lists, I could easily change my "vote." <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 04:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there's too much worry about what is subjective in these debates. (You just mentioned opinion and interpretation, someone in a related AfD voted "delete all subjective lists".) If it were genuinely the case that subjective or normative things are inherently POV and shouldn't be on wikipedia, we would have to delete pretty-much everything on the humanities, leaving just an encyclopedia that covered math and science. But that would be to ask the wrong question. The real question is about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Someone is a "villain" (or whatever other subjective term you're worried about) if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> say that he is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 09:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, classifying someone as an anti-hero is also subjective, but that list survived an AfD because it is carefully sourced and policed by a number of editors to reject any additions that don't have external sources labeling the characters as anti-heroes. This villains list, however, does nothing of the sort. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 19:02, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Disputed prod; my prod reason was "notability not asserted". Appears to be a minor community radio station. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> removed the prod with "may be just as notable than the others on this list--just needs some editing". There have been an enormous number of radio station stubs added over the last two months; are these stations notable merely by their existence? I doubt it; hence this AfD.</p>
<p>Let me add <a href="../../../w/e/a/WEAF_%28AM%29_45d5.html" title="WEAF (AM)">WEAF (AM)</a> to this AfD; simply because I prodded both at once. After prodding these two I noticed how many had been added, so I stopped at that point. It'd be great to get some consensus here. I'll stay <b>neutral</b> for this. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 05:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There ought to be a policy which says "all radio stations are notable". The only relevant policy-like document that I could find is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28TV_and_radio_stations%29_767d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (TV and radio stations)">Wikipedia:Notability (TV and radio stations)</a> which is labelled as inactive. I would argue that most radio stations which have ever existed are notable in the context of the culture, news and politics of the cities and countries in which they operate or operated, and that establishing notability in individual cases is difficult without detailed knowledge of the station's operations. A band or musician may have gotten its first big break by getting airplay on a particular radio station (which would help establish notability for that station), but how easy is it to verify this 25 years later? This is another example of the gap between notability and <b>demonstrable</b> notability. I would prefer to keep these articles, even if they are just stubs, and avoid deletion votes for radio stations which will be a lot like the deletion votes for high school articles, which satisfy noone and exhaust everyone. That way, when a radio station becomes famous for breaking a news story or being the first to broadcast a particular song, Wikipedia will have a good stub on which to build. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 06:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So every one is notable? Even campus radio stations, for example? <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 22:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(Reply to Eastmain) I don't think notability should be either speculative or inherent. Even if it turns out that, say, some band really did get its first play at WEGO, that would not automatically imply that WEGO is notable. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability on Wikipedia</a> is a totally practical concept: are there enough external sources that we can use to write a verifiable article? In this case the answer seems to be no for both WEGO and WEAF (which is no surprise -- most small radio stations wouldn't pass WP:N). Of course, if the articles are deleted now and appropriate sources surface later as you suggest might happen, nothing prevents anyone from recreating the articles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional delete</b>, there absolutely ought <i>not</i> to be a policy which says all radio stations are notable. Nothing, IMO, could be farther from the truth.

In any case, however, in the absence of tspecific policies and guidelines, more general ones must apply, This does not assert any notability nor does it provide independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, so it <i>must go</i>!

<li><b>neutral</b> I asked for the AfD to get just this sort of discussion. We judge the subject as being notable, not the article, and I can tell what stations suit my interests, but not whether or not they are notable, so I was hoping for some guidelines. If there aren't any they all must stay is at least as stubs. A poorly written article which for some reason doesnt have the detail of the 100s of parallel articles needs the detail in, not the article out, and just needs to be marked for expansion.</li>

<dd>On the other hand, looking at a number of radio station articles, most of them don't have much to say. They all have the same sources, which are reliable if not very informative. Some belonging to major chains have more (they CBS ones, for example, have the CBS box at the bottom.) The only one in this geographic area with real content has been protected over a debate on the reliability of a web site. In almost all cases the sources are 1/ the website 2/lists that include all radio stations. Neither of them counts. I don't want to do it myself as a project like the removal of transmission towers, but any argument for removing these 2 applies to 95% of them.</dd>
<dd>As I said, I'm neutral. In or out. I dont think it is essential content, since the outside lists are available &amp; they all have websites.

<dd>You omitted the subsequent text <b>Lower power radio stations limited to a small neighborhood, such as Part 15 operations in the United States or stations with a VF# callsign in Canada, are not inherently notable</b>.

<dd>Part 15 stations are not listed in the FCC database, because they're not licensed operations. Since WEGO does have <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WEGO" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WEGO" rel="nofollow">a page</a> in that database, by definition, it has to be a licensed station.

<dd>You misread it. Are these lower power stations? Some I saw seemed to be. The rest of the text is an example, not an exhaustive list. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't misread anything. I was personally involved in the process of determining how best to <i>write</i> that particular precedent statement, so I know <i>exactly</i> what it means. What it means is that if a station operates under a legally-issued FCC license, then it gets an article. The exclusion applies to <i>unlicensed</i> operations. It does <i>not</i> permit any kind of cutoff that splits FCC-licensed stations into licensed-and-notable vs. licensed-and-not-notable piles on the basis of some arbitrary minimum transmitter power. If it's FCC-licensed, then it's in, period. That <i>is</i> the established AFD precedent, and that <i>is</i> what the precedent statement expresses. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be taking this the wrong way; perhaps I could have worded better. My apologies. It doesn't say what you claim though; if it did it would read "As an exception, Part 15 operations in the United States or stations with a VF# callsign in Canada, are not inherently notable."</dd>
<dd>Regardless, prior consensus is not set in stone and can change; this has happened several times already. What little consensus exists in this discussion does not match what it apparently was before. As another example, today you de-prodded the campus station <a href="../../../w/p/p/WPPJ_5b87.html" title="WPPJ">WPPJ</a>; however I really fail to see how that station has any genuine claim to notability. In other words, I think the precedent as you see it is too broad. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 11:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If a radio station is duly licensed by the appropriate media regulation authority, then it's notable enough for Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Established precedent is <b>neither final nor non-negotiable</b>! It does (generally) reflect a growing concensus, but <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">concensus can change</a>!

<dd>You're misquoting me. Allow me to rephrase myself: until such time as somebody articulates a new policy <i>specifically about radio stations</i>, the precedent <i>on radio stations</i> is the final word <i>on the matter of a radio station</i>. It's <i>not</i> sufficient to cite <i>general</i> policies about which people can and do genuinely <i>disagree</i> on whether radio stations meet them or not — the precedent as it stands reflects a lot of debates in which those policies <i>were</i> already taken into account, and the determination was that radio stations <i>do</i> meet them if they're duly licensed by the appropriate regulatory authority and originate at least a part of their own programming schedule. It's not as though you're introducing some radical new litmus test that nobody ever thought of before; in fact, you're citing the exact same policies that were brought to bear in <i>setting</i> the precedent in the <i>first</i> place. So if you don't like the precedent as it stands, then try to build consensus around a new policy statement that specifically addresses <i>radio stations</i> in <i>particular</i>, because as things stand right now, it's not as though you're citing anything that hasn't already been taken into account. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Reply to Bearcat) The debate between you and Akihabara about what WP:AFDP actually means in regard to radio stations is fascinating but irrelevant. It's irrelevant because WP:AFDP is a description of what has happened in past AFD's, not a prescription for what should happen in future AFD's. Outcomes of prior AFD's have nothing to do with whether <i>these</i> 2 articles should be kept. In fact it says in bold at the very top of WP:AFDP that "This page is not policy." By contrast, WP:RS, WP:N, and WP:CORP are derived from WP:V and WP:NOT, core policies. I would say those trump WP:AFDP. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"The precedent <i>on radio stations</i> is the final word <i>on the matter of a radio station</i>." -- I beg to differ, it's not even the final word on <i>the specific radio stations that were nominated</i> -- they can be AFD'd again -- and it's certainly not the final word on all radio stations ("This page is not policy").</dd>
<dd>"The determination [at prior AFD's] was that radio stations <i>do</i> meet [the general policies] if they're duly licensed by the appropriate regulatory authority and originate at least a part of their own programming schedule" -- You are citing AFD <i>outcomes</i> as if they can determine general policy. They cannot. Please, if you are convinced by the actual <i>arguments</i> that were made at prior AFD's that all such radio stations are notable, then cite those arguments.

<li><b>comment</b>If N and V are properly applied, they will give consistent decisions. If similar cases coming up now are being decided differently, then the standards are not being properly applied. The AFDD page states what is intended as an honest summary of past consistent decisions. As WP evolves, it may be desirable to change some of these. Some matters, like the wording of the N standard itself, are changed in a legislative sort of way by amending the standard; if thought desirable, a standard or guideline on radio stations could be developed. At present, it's essentially a judge-made standard, made by continuing AfD discussions such as this one here. I understand the meaning of precedent in WP to mean that we should continue prior practice in individual cases, until we intend to change it. As in the RW, one of the factors to consider is how such change will affect the cases treated in the previous decisions. Since WP has the peculiar rule that articles kept may be brought up repeatedly, those interested in consistence may want to re-discuss early articles.</li>

<dd>I'd support and take part in creating a brief guideline for radio stations; no need to make it too long or wordy IMO.

<li><b>Background</b>. As the original author of the IS group entry, I would like to provide some background information on how and why this entry was made. I am new to Wikipedia editing, and the IS group entry was my first contribution. I was inspired to add this entry by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry and modeled my entry after that one. At that point in time, I was blissfully unaware of Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Since that time, I have learned a lot, but still have much to learn. Seeing the short Reality Club entry inspired me because, as a scientist, and scientific administrator, I am very interested in the history of science, particularly the informal aspects of science (such as what happens behind the scenes -- see, for example, the excellent book <i>Tuxedo Park</i>). As an administrator (former Division Director at NSF and former chair of OSTP committees and present chair of an NAS board) who has done federal service, I have grown much more aware of how science policy can be shaped in ways that are not always apparent and not always reported in standard venues. I am also aware of the importance of ethnography, ethnomethodology, and oral history in documenting events, including events related to the history of science. Because of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry, I had thought at the time that Wikipedia was interested in such articles, as long as they were notable and verifiable in some way. Thus, the IS group entry was started on Nov. 22, 2006. On Nov. 23, 2006, a Wikipedia editor named weregerbil raised concerns about notability and verifiability. I took these concerns very seriously and did what I thought was appropriate at the time to establish both the notability and verifiability of the entry, spending a lot of time and adding what I thought was appropriate information. I indicated that I was both the author of the entry and a co-founder of the group, but I do not recall at the time weregerbil raising any COI concerns. Please also note that, contrary to what some have said above, as author of the article I have NOT admitted that there are no reliable or verifiable sources, I have only stated that "...I am unaware of any verifiable PUBLISHED sources ..." Instead, I based both the notability and the verifiability on the reputation of the members of the group and on the notability (and verifiability) of the research that has been influenced by this group. The reliability and verifiability and notability of these individuals is easy for any independent individual to establish if they know how to do a literature search or use a library. I certainly think that I have gone to considerably greater lengths than what has been done for entries such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> (by the way, I commend having "The Reality Club" entry on Wikipedia, and feel that it should remain). More recently, on Jan. 11, 2007, the Wikipedia COI policy was been pointed out to me by ragesoss. I wish someone had done so earlier and apologize for not familiarizing myself with it on my own. However, I still think that the IS group entry has value, is notable, can be verified (though perhaps not in printed sources), is not original research, and should remain on Wikipedia. I strongly feel that it makes a valuable (though very small) contribution to the history of informal science. Progress in science is not always made only by publication, but often by the social links that foster collaboration and influence theoretical directions. In addition, often the best way to hear about an event is through oral history, as long as this oral history can be verified in some way (which is often by corroboration of known individuals). A more nuanced approach to verifiability is needed than apparently presently exists in Wikipedia. To not ponder this issue and, hopefully, improve policy related to it means that Wikipedia may become overly reliant on certain kinds of publication and runs the risk of being driven by the desires of the dominant media which increasingly are being controlled by fewer interests. Because of the COI policy, I will refrain from editing the IS group entry in the future. However, I am hoping that those who really care about informal aspects of the history of science, oral history, and ethnography will make a better case than I can for why hearing from the horse's mouth of those who have participated in events can sometimes constitute a valid form of verifiability and can both help Wikipedia become a stronger, and more accurate, encyclopedia and can also make for a richer and more exciting history of science. Thanks for bearing with this flame and thanks to the Wikipedia editors, weregerbil and ragesoss, who have urged me to consider these matters more carefully. Ddp224 00:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>For what it is worth, I used the term "verifiable" here in the Wikipedia sense (per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>), which is by definition a published source. Wikipedia is not the place for unpublished work (which is by Wikipedia's definition, as opposed to common usage, original research). But there are other possible venues. If seeking out a more formal publication venue, like a journal in your field(s), would be too onerous, try <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikinfo.org" rel="nofollow">wikinfo</a>, a wiki encyclopedia with different editorial policies.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 03:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>ragesoss -- Thanks for the clarification. I am just trying to explore and understand better some of the Wikipedia concepts and guidelines. As should be crystal clear at this point, this particular entry is not critical to either Wikipedia, the history of science, or the survival of the larger world. However, there are larger principles here that are, at least to me, fascinating, and potentially of some importance, including how they relate to how behind-the-scenes information can be gotten into the public record in some "reliable" (not, apparently, in the Wikipedia sense) way, and the possibilities they raise for nurturing innovative approaches for documenting the informal history of science. Your mention, above, of "verifiable sources" led me to WP:V and WP:RS, and resulted in my being even more unclear about a few things. Is official information, such as press releases, news, information, etc., published on academic and commercial websites, such as Yale and Microsoft, considered to meet the test in certain circumstances for what Wikipedia considers to be reliable sources? Is such website information considered to have appeared in what Wikipedia would view as an appropriate "published source"? One reason that I ask is that there has been, for some time, an IS group description on the Haskins site (<a href="http://www.haskins.yale.edu/ISgroup.html" class="external free" title="http://www.haskins.yale.edu/ISgroup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haskins.yale.edu/ISgroup.html</a>). This is a corporate, not personal, website that has a full-time, paid website manager, and that also requires that material that appears on the site have editorial oversight and be vetted and approved by a website editorial committee, and finally approved by the President of our Laboratories and, thus, gets multiple views and scrutiny before it appears. Of course, there still may be COI issues with such a source. (Please also note that Haskins is not formally affiliated with the IS group (listing it as an informal affiliation) and takes no responsibility for its actions or the actions of its members.) On WP:RS a number of issues seem related to sourcing and verifiability on this type of informal article. Putting verifiability aside for the moment, the material in this entry seems to be non-controversial and is more just a historical listing of when certain things took place, why they happened, their possible importance, and who was involved. Controversial conclusions are not being reached and, if they are, should be removed if they cannot be verified. Finally, the issue of "Self-published sources" did seem relevant. In WK:RS it says, in that section, "When a well-known, professional researcher writing within his or her field of expertise, or a well-know professional journalist, has produced self-published material, they may be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications." Again, I don't want to push this too far, but many of the IS participants (it is not a formal group, and does not have membership), including me, meet these tests and have numerous publications in respected, credible, third-party publications, including professional journals, books, etc., to establish their credibility and reputation. Should such factors be taken into account when establishing verifiability and reliability? Apparently, Wikipedia thinks that they should, at least to a certain extent or in certain situations. Clearly, such approaches for establishing verifiability and reliability are not the preferred approach, but often this may be all that is possible. This situation does not seem to be the same kind case as an earlier example that you mentioned to me, in which a bunch of high-school kids create a fake entry as a lark. Most of those involved with IS are credible, known researchers, academics, physicians, etc., and their credibility can be verified. By the way, your comments are worth a lot to me. I am learning a great deal from this process and appreciate the time that you are willing to spend on this. Ddp224 21:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the article was restricted to information found on that website, then a case could be made that the article did not violate <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. However, I believe the section on self-published work by professionals is intended to only apply in limited circumstance; in this case, I think the intended interpretation would be that, because you and/or the author of the website are not experts <i>on informal science</i>, it would not apply here. The bigger underlying issue is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. Wikipedia's notability requirements are, in my view, flawed in some ways (and rather byzantine). But the self-publishing exception to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> would absolutely not apply when the self-published source would be necessary just to establish the notability of the IS group. If there was an independent source establishing the notability of the IS group, then the group's website would probably be accepted as a valid source for filling out the article. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 23:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not entirely clear which websites are being referred to in your most recent message, above. There are 2 websites in question. The Haskins site is a professional, corporate website, that gets its content from academics of known reputation and from paid science writers, who are familiar with both formal and informal science. The IS group website (<a href="http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/is/" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/is/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/is/</a>), which is not affiliated with Haskins, is a self-published site, maintained by Simon Levy. The responsibility for this site is his. Simon is an academic of established reputation (<a href="http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/</a>) who also has experience in formal and informal science. Starting in 1992, Simon was the editor of Exponent (<a href="http://www.extropy.org/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.extropy.org/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.extropy.org/history.htm</a>) and other Extropy Institute newsletters, which published material related to formal and informal science. Simon has also been a presenter at meetings that include both the formal and less formal aspects of science (e.g. <a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/tv/2004/presenters.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.transhumanism.org/tv/2004/presenters.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.transhumanism.org/tv/2004/presenters.shtml</a>). Regarding your comment, above that " ... you and/or the author of the website are not experts on informal science," I, reluctantly, would point out the following about myself. As noted above (and as can be found by all on my website and on other websites), I was formerly the Division Director for Behavioral, and Cognitive Sciences at the National Science Foundation. In that role, I had responsibility for 10 fields: Archaeology, Cultural Anthropology, Physical Anthropology, Geography and Regional Science, Environmental Social and Behavioral Sciences, Child Development, Cognitive Neuroscience, Experimental Psychology, Social Psychology, and Linguistics. Part of my responsibilities included reading, reviewing, and signing off on each and every award or decline made on each grant proposal from all academic universities in the US in each of those areas (this, by the way, was a lot of work, which is why I no longer am doing it). I was also the first chair of the most recent NSF priority area, Human and Social Dynamics, and served on the Science and Technology Centers operating committee, responsible for giving out among the largest of awards at the NSF. In these areas, I would often deal with issues related to informal science, and with issues related to informal science education. I would also work with those in the NSF Informal Science Education programs. I deal with such matters on the National Academies Board that I chair, and have dealt with such issues on the OSTP Committees that I have chaired or worked on in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. Finally, I have also lectured in this area. One example is a recent presentation at Dartmouth College ("Turning Fears into Public Policy: Grey Goo and Government." Invited talk, SEAC (Society for Ethics Across the Curriculum) 8th Annual International Conference, 2006, Ethics Institute, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, Nov. 16-18, 2006.). Other examples can be found on my CV on the Haskins website and would, I assume, be considered to be both verifiable and reliable. Much of my recent career has been related to the intersection between science and public policy and falls clearly in the domain of what is considered to be expertise in informal science. Others who have been affiliated with the IS group have expertise in informal science. For example, one of the participants, a physician, academic, and scientist, is currently a Slate columnist and NPR pundit, where he writes about speaks about health, medicine, and the informal aspects of science related to these matters. But, enough on this. I would like to close this overly long missive by raising my concern that there seems to be a small degree of "bait and switch" (or perhaps just dealing with a moving target) in the criticism of this particular Wikipedia entry. I start by apologizing again for the COI matters, which were not clear to me until recently. In Nov. 2006, the main concerns of weregerbil were with notability -- thus, considerable time was spent attempting to establish this notability. More recently, the concerns moved over mostly to reliable sources and verifiability, which have been discussed at length, above. In your most recent comment, you seem to indicate, again, that the crucial underlying issue is notability. As noted in previous discussions, and assuming for sake of argument that reliability and verifiability and COI are not the major problems, one aspect of my viewpoint on this is that notability, in this case, relates to the fact that this informal group has brought leading (at least in their fields) scientists (and other individuals) together and, to at least a small degree, helped to shape their research and scientific efforts in important ways, both by exposing them to the materials being read and discussed and often by no more than the simple act of intellectual interchange cemented by social contact, a little good beer, some crap to eat, and a fun movie to watch. If that ain't informal science, I don't know what is. In addition reliable information appears on at least 2 websites (one commercial, the other self-published, but by a known, verifiable, reliable source) to establish the existence of this group and provide a short description of its activities. Sorry, as usual, for going on so long and hoping that this has been of some interest and use to you. Ddp224 23:09, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm sorry if my explanation seemed like a bait and switch. The issues of verifiability, reliable sources, and notability are closely intertwined. In a nutshell, the issue is that there are no sources about the IS group independent of the group; the Haskins website in nominally independent, but obviously the informal connection is significant. The convention on Wikipedia is to exclude such material based on the Notability guideline, at least until an independent published source exists. The establishment of notability is dependent on verifiability through reliable sources, but establishing notability has the additional burden that the sources must be independent. COI is (or at least supposed to be) treated more as a user behavior issue than a content issue; the decision of whether to keep or delete content is, in theory, independent of COI issues regarding who created the article.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 23:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean to imply that your particular response was a bait and switch. Rather, I was attempting to express my frustration with the overall process, which continues to seem like a moving target to me. I have asked specific questions when interacting with Wikipedia editors (such as my attempt to find out whether or not information on websites can be considered, in certain cases, to be "published sources" and, if so, what those cases would be), but have not always received specific answers (or, perhaps, I have not understood the answers). For example, I am still confused about your answer to one of my earlier questions about one of your statements (The statement of yours that I was inquiring about was: "If the article was restricted to information found on that website, then a case could be made that the article did not violate <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>".). In this statement, are you referring to (a) the Haskins website, or (b) the IS group webpage? Since the IS group entry was made in Nov. 2006, I have been trying to deal honestly and carefully with criticisms and/or concerns when they have been raised. I am aware the many of the issues are intertwined. I am also aware that newcomers such as myself can find these complexities to be inhibiting. However, I have tried to persist and attempt to untwine some of the intertwined strands. I have tried to carefully deal with each issue as it has been raised, by either providing sourced information in the entry (and other entries I have worked on in the past), or by providing detailed background on discussion pages, or by requesting clarification from Wikipedia editors. However, in the responses that I have received, a slightly different concern seems always to be raised by Wikipedia editors. These have seemed not to be always because topics are intertwined, but sometimes because the editors are looking for other reasons to dismiss the entry. On another matter, Haskins Laboratories is absolutely independent of the IS group. Although there is a historical connection, Haskins has NO connection with the IS group, not even an informal one. The Haskins website is a source independent of the IS group (certainly more independent than <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry, which inspired the IS group entry, is of the Edge.org sourcing). Reference to the IS group on the Haskins website is treated as we would treat professional organizations or other entities that are of interest to our employees or website visitors, or whose activities seem relevant. For example, consider some of the professional societies that I belong to or other Haskins people belong to, such as AAAS, IEEE, the American Psychological Association, AVISA (Audiovisual Speech Association), the Linguistic Society of America, ISEP (the International Society of Ecological Psychology), etc. I assume that many Haskins people are members of these societies, are possibly officers of some of these, or other, societies, may have played a role in founding some of these societies, etc. The same would be true throughout academia. The Haskins site may link to such entities, and Haskins may even be supportive, in a general way, of their activities. However, organizations such as Haskins (and other such academic organizations, such as colleges, universities, etc.), are usually considered to be independent of these professional organizations, even if faculty members are members (or even officers) of the professional organizations. The individual faculty member, of course, would not be considered to be independent of the organization. Referencing and/or discussing such organizations on a website does not violate the independence of these organizations. These kinds of connections are standard and do not seem to be significant. The Haskins connection to the IS group is, in some ways, significantly weaker than some of these connections. There are no membership connections, no financial connections, and there is even a disclaimer on the Haskins website ("The IS group is not formally affiliated with Haskins Laboratories. Haskins Laboratories takes no responsibility or credit for the activities of the IS group, but encourages activities that foster multidisciplinarity and rigorous exploration of the frontiers science, particularly when done with a spirit of fun and enjoyment.") Information about the IS group appears on the Haskins website because Haskins is supportive of multidisciplinarity and because the early history of the IS group involved Haskins connections and, finally, because when people inquire about the IS group because of individual employee connections to the group, past or present, it was felt that it was important to point people elsewhere because the IS group is not formally affiliated with Haskins and so that people interested in the IS group would not bug people at Haskins, because Haskins IS INDEPENDENT OF THE IS GROUP. In a similar way, we refer to Haskins Laboratories at Pace University. Many years ago there used to be a connection between the two organizations and even though they have similar names, there is no longer a connection between these two organizations -- they are completely independent, both formally and informally, even though there once was a strong connection between the two. I have continued to persist with the discussion of the IS group Wikipedia entry because I feel that the information provided in the entry is valuable, providing a small, but significant, contribution to the history of informal science. Although aspects of the entry are not ideal as they interact with important Wikipedia policies, such as COI, notability, verifiability, etc., I feel that these concerns are outweighed by the fact that the sources that back up the verification of this entry, coupled with the notability of these sources and the entry, the independent published source, and the significance of such difficult to find information, would encourage retaining this entry. I have looked at the entry again and found it to be non-controversial, fairly benign, but potentially useful to those interested in exploring connections between scientists and the evolution of scientific ideas. However, I would appreciate hearing back from anyone who has read the entry to find out if they feel that there is any particular information that they think should be removed (aside from removing the whole thing). I would also like to hear from a Wikipedia editor about how this entry differs from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry, which I also feel should be retained. Hearing about the differences between these two entries might help me to better understand the subtleties of Wikipedia policy that I appear to continue to be missing. I certainly understand the importance of having information in Wikipedia this is verifiable. Although not ideal, I continue to feel that this entry is verifiable and that its notability has been established. Ddp224 03:07, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My intent was not to use the existence of one article to defend another, but instead to beg and plead that a Wikipedia editor (or someone else) help me understand the differences between the two entries, if any, by using them as a basis of comparison. If there are differences, that is okay, it would just help me understand Wikipedia policy if these differences were explained. If there are no differences, that is also okay. I personally do not feel that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry should be removed. To me it is verifiable, notable, and adds important information to Wikipedia that is useful for understanding the history of informal science. The entry seems to be non-controversial and reasons for removing it seem to be technical quibbling and an over-attention to formality that, in this case, does not seem to be beneficial to the quality of Wikipedia or anything else.

<dd>I was inspired not by the quality of the entry, which is poor, but by the fact that the entry was there at all. Again, influenced by things like reading the book <i>Tuxedo Park</i>, I have come, over time, and after government and federal service, to realize that much goes on behind the scenes and in informal groups. Science policy, including at hidden levels, can often have strong influences on what becomes the science enterprise. Much of this is hidden from the public and hidden from the history of science. I believe that it is time for this to end. It is particularly difficult to get at this information without hearing directly from the participants. Waiting for books or magazine articles to be written can often result in critical information being lost. Often, the best thing to do is find the critical players and see how you can get the information out of them. Thus, I was pleased to see this tiny entry because I am delighted to begin to hear about things that I would not normally hear about. Having started several groups, I am particularly interested in informal groups, particularly when they go on to have some influence. I was particularly pleased that Wikipedia provided a vehicle for publishing such information. Of course, this was before I started to find out about the rules and restrictions of Wikipedia. It is true, of course, that the particular entry is fairly weak. Hopefully, someone who knows about the topic and the history of the club will strengthen the entry, but, unfortunately, from Wikipedia perspective this will probably be a conflict of interest. Common sense would seem to dictate that there has to be a better way to provide options for allowing such information to get in, as long as some sort of verifiability path can be established, but, of course, we have been through all of this before. Thanks again. Ddp224 06:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although the article is interesting, by the letter of the rules I don't see how it can be kept without reliable sources (WP:RS). Since Wikipedia tries to echo whatever reliable information is generally documented out in the world, when a topic comes to us that is not generally documented, our normal instinct is to keep it out. It may well be that this topic deserves more coverage than it has received, but it's not up to us to be the first vehicle for such coverage. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 21:11, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, you bring up a lot; I'll do the best I can, and try to get a few other editors to weigh in.</p>
<ul>
<li>On moving targets: You've experienced something that is, to some extent, endemic in the lived experience of Wikipedia. Wikipedians generally learn the system more by participation than by following the codified rules, and in a lot of ways deletion is a stochastic process. There are philosophical disagreements (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Conflicting_Wikipedia_philosophies" class="extiw" title="m:Conflicting_Wikipedia_philosophies">m:Conflicting Wikipedia philosophies</a>) about what is and is not acceptable content, and different editors develop different ideas about what it is important to keep out or allow in. Sometimes motivations for trying to get something deleted are orthogonal to reasons stated and policies invoked.</li>
<li>On my statement ("If the article was restricted to information found on that website, then a case could be made that the article did not violate <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>"): Some of the information in IS group (e.g., about half of the "Activities" section) is found on neither website; to the extent that you (in your capacity as as an editor) are the source for the information rather than the websites, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> because editors cannot be reliable sources. I used the singular "website" because the <a href="http://cs.wlu.edu/~levy/is/" class="external text" title="http://cs.wlu.edu/~levy/is/" rel="nofollow">IS group website</a> itself has no relevant information. If the article was limited to material published on the websites, then it might pass WP:RS. However, the notability problem remains since demonstration of notability has to invoke "multiple, non-trivial published works" independent of the article's subject. (As an aside, I think the "multiple" aspect is excessive, but that's the way things currently work.)
<ul>
<li>Not to be too much of a pain on this point, but the above illustrates what I mean by moving target. After several months of working on Wikipedia, this is the first time that "multiple" or "non-trivial" has been brought up. I am, of course, familiar with these criteria and I don't deny either their existence of importance, but just wish to express my extreme frustration that there always appears to be something new that is used by editors to make their case. If these concepts were so important (and they are), I would have hoped that they would have been mentioned earlier. This would be of great help to newcomers like myself. Please note that even after all of this time, I am still not clear on what is allowable, as opposed to preferred, and how much flexibility there is related to verifiability, notability, autobiography, COI, multiple sources, etc., particularly as it related to the non-controversial nature of entries and their ability to be corroborated in other ways. I remain unsure if Wikipedia editors are being overly formal in their interpretations in this case, and if there isn't more for flexibility with entries of this sort. I have been a Wikipedia contributor for only a brief time, but have been a reader/user of Wikipedia for much longer. My sense, on entries that I have some expertise with, is that the reality is less formal than this instance, without the quality being reduced. Of course, there is variability in entries and the rules help to ensure quality. Hopefully these rules will not have the unintended consequence of reducing quality. I think that there are other checks and balances, such as common sense and expertise, that might profitably enter into the equation. These appear to be taken into account by Wikipedia, in certain instances, but it is not clear how far they extend. Ddp224 14:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>On the independence of the IS group and Haskins Laboratories: Given that the IS group was founded by members of Haskins Laboratories, and you (one of the founders) are the primary contributor to both articles, it seems obvious that while formally independent (after all, the IS group isn't even formally connected to its participants), they are not independent enough to avoid the appearance of a close connection. The Haskins page about the IS group is unsigned, but I assumed (perhaps rashly) that it was written by a participant in the group. (While COI with respect to editing activity is not relevant to content decisions, COI or the appearance of it regarding an article's sources is relevant.) In a nutshell, it looks like no one not associated with the IS group has published anything about it even on the internet. Maybe my impression was wrong; if the Haskins info is truly independent of the IS group, then the article would probably not be something I would spontaneously choose to delete. (However, lacking <i>multiple</i> independent sources, it would still failed to meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.)</li>
</ul>

<li>I agree that there is a close connection between the IS group and its founders, including me. Haskins Laboratories does not have "members" nor does it have any kind of connection to the IS group. It is a world-renowned research laboratory that has been around since 1935 and has helped to shape the history of science in various fields and continues to make discoveries at the cutting edge. It has employees, volunteers, and friends and is, in general, a pretty informal place. The original founders of the IS group have had affiliations with Haskins in the past and some continue to have such affiliations, but some of the individuals have also had affiliations with Yale and the University of Connecticut and, again, I contend that there is no close connection between Yale University or the University of Connecticut and the IS group. The process of adding content to the Haskins website varies. Source material is usually provided to professional science writers (contractors independent of Haskins), who then synthesize this material into a final product. This material is then subject to review by a website editorial committee, further edited by a webmanager (who is not me or anyone associated with IS), and approved by an administrator (who is not me or anyone else associated with IS). Websource content would, of course, usually be dependent on interviews and/or conversations with primary sources. Much material is from oral histories obtained before participants either left or died. Other material is from interviews with professional journalists. Other material is from newspaper articles and press releases. Haskins is not associated with the IS group and has published minimal information about it, but it has acknowledged on its website the historical connection to the IS group formation and has also published a strong disclaimer about any existing connections between the two entities. Conflicts of interest, which I am very familiar with from federal policy and regulation, and also from a corporate standpoint, etc., is usually mitigated by a number of events, including the passage of time. Thus, judges who have a COI with former colleagues from, let's say, their former law firm, usually recuse themselves for a period of about 2 years, depending upon the nature of the relationship. After this, the COI usually no longer exists. There is, of course, variability in this, depending upon the circumstances. Thanks again for your input on these matters.

<li>Our requirements here are not formal, but substantive. We require three things, which overlap: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">non-originality</a>; we have, as a consensus-based organization, developed many ways to say these same things. In principle, any article must consist of sourced statements, phrased in a neutral manner, derived from sources which any reader can confirm, independent of the author's personal knowledge. (Do we fully meet these standards everywhere? most places? No, of course not.)
<ul>
<li>(a) I would consider a requirement such as multiple-sources to be both substantive and formal, if there are no exceptions (or clearly defined limited exceptions) to the requirement. Requirements imply, to me at least, formalities. If possible, please define "formal" and "substantive" and clarify the differences for me. (b) Part of what I am trying to understand relates to your last point ("Do we fully meet these standards ..."). I, of course, would also haved liked to have met the standards, but have also been trying to understand the degree of flexibility that is allowed (in principle or practice) and how it rates to the mundaneness of the entry. I am not interested in this out of desire to exploit the system in any way, but because of what I see as a potential benefit for getting more informal than usual information into Wikipedia, as long as it can be verified in some sensible way. Thanks! Ddp224 14:31, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>For these reasons and others, we strongly recommend that editors, like yourself, <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">eschew autobiography</a>. (I know one editor who has an article about himself, which unquestionably meets our requirements. His only edit to it added his birthday.) This article is a larger autobiography, and has the same problems. I hope you will come back, and make contributions about things <b>less</b> important to you. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 06:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the feedback, it is greatly appreciated. Putting autobiography aside for just a moment, I continue to believe that portions of the IS group entry consist of appropriately sourced statements, are phrased in a neutral manner, and are derived from sources which any reader can confirm. Some of the information that appears in this entry was added not because I originally thought that it should be there, but because after starting the entry and hearing from a Wikipedia editor (weregerbil) about notability, I attempted to provide what I thought (at that time) was appropriate information to establish both notability and sourcing. Since being informed of COI and autobiographical concerns (that I was previously unaware of), I have refrained from modifying the entry in any way, because it would appear to me to be inappropriate to do so. Thus, material in the entry that does not meet these tests has not been removed. Other material seems to meet some of the Wikipedia criteria to varying degrees. But, as has been noted, there are issues of multiple sourcing, etc., that weaken this entry. As a newcomer, I have been very intentionally trying to learn about the rules and flexibility of Wikipedia, not to push the limits, but to explore how informal material is handled. This article was not intended as autobiography, but a simple attempt to report verifiable, historical events that I thought were of some interest and importance to those who use Wikipedia as an importance refrence. Perhaps I misled myself by starting the IS group entry after looking at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reality_Club_1c3e.html" title="The Reality Club">The Reality Club</a> entry and believing that the latter was a standard, appropriate Wikipedia entry, but that I could do a better job than was done in that case. My experience with Wikipedia has not been bitter, but it has sometimes been very frustrating and time consuming. At times I found the editors insulting (see interactions with weregerbil), inappropriately inaccurate (such as ragesoss comment about the lack of expertise on my part and the part of others with informal science), off the point, and, to my mind, not very competent regarding clearly and simply explaining the Wikipedia policies to newcomers. I realize that this is a volunteer effort on the part of the editors, and appreciate their effort. Nevertheless, I don't feel that direct questions that I asked were answered clearly, nor were Wikipedia policies explained in a timely fashion. For those reasons, coupled with my density on some of these issues and my desire to more fully understand Wikipedia's flexibility on informal issues, this process has stretched out. I certainly would consider adding appropriate information to Wikipedia, but doubt that I would bother spending times on things that aren't important to me. Thanks again.

<dd>Wow. Discussion becomes the basis for the recommendation of deletion. Apparently, I continue to misunderstand both the practices of Wikipedia and the soul of its community. I had thought that this section was for conversation and debate regarding proposed delection of an article, and perhaps also for providing assistance and guidance for newcomers like me regarding appropriate Wikipedia practices, and did not realize that brevity, which is clearly not my strong suit, was desired. Sorry. By the way, the full quote is: "Brevity is the soul of wit," from Hamlet. In addition to brevity, a little more wit would be nice. Ddp224 14:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As for verifiability, Thompson Gale's Contemporary Authors series--which should be neutral, and available in most major academic libraries--has an article on him, which is available standalone from Amazon for six bucks. I'm getting a strong feeling that people are confusing dislike of the person with notability. I don't know much about the guy, but even if his works were insipid cultic trash, getting this many people from around the world to write about his work, plus the biography in Contemporary Authors, makes him notable.

<dd>The way this hypothesis is presented on Eric Weisstein's World of Physics is as follows:
<dl>
<dd><i>Several authors have published theories claiming that the speed-of-light barrier imposed by relativity is illusionary. While these "theories" continue to be rejected by the physics community as ill-informed speculation, their proponents continue to promulgate them in rather obscure journals. An example of this kind is the Smarandache hypothesis, which states that there is no such thing as a speed limit in the universe (Smarandache 1998).</i><a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Superluminal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Superluminal.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<dd>Maybe they are "a bit biased" too. If you look up the reference<a href="http://www.gallup.unm.edu/~smarandache/NoSpLim.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gallup.unm.edu/~smarandache/NoSpLim.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, it is really totally unscientific <i>even in comparison with your run-off-the-mill piece of pseudo-scientific junk</i>. It reads like the typical junk faster-than-light speculation posted by a freshman on a bulletin board. I don't know whether Smarandache was picked randomly, or as a particularly egregious example of ignorant speculation. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:03, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I found 336 such pages. The guy is just incredibly prolific. Most of it (established by sampling) either makes no sense, or is completely elementary and utterly trivial. A Lambiamoid Number is a prime number plus one. Lambiam's Theorem: 3 is the only odd Lambiamoid Number. Lambiam's Hypothesis: There is an infinite source of energy. Lambiam's Paradox: 0×0 = 0, therefore 0 = 0/0 = undefined. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that several people writing articles in the walled-garden Smarandache universe are the Master himself writing under a pseudonym. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:26, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe I'm being too subtle. I think "Comparison of operatingsystemX and operatingsystemY" articles are a mistake. I don't think they are encyclopedic. I think they are a magnet for POV edits from people who really don't care about our policies. Unless someone is going to make a lifetime commitment to keeping this article under control, I don't see how this article can be kept in a NPOV manner, even if it is tidied up enough to reach an NPOV state in the first place. Note that this article has been here for two and half years now, and never reached a healthy state.

<dd>As far as I'm concerned it's been 2 weeks or so (busy too as kids back to school) since I started on this article. For others maybe 1 day or for yourself it looks like 2 or so years. Linux has new kernel releases every few months, KDE and GNOME have had many updates and even Microsoft have finally got out their latest though in the interim have issued service packs and other stuff. Microsoft, Linux and Wikipedia are all moving targets. They never will stable&#160;!. What happened last week is a distant memory and certainly what happened 2 and 1/2 years ago is completely irrelevant to today. POV edits to me are more interesting than vandalism. Look at an article like <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis_ball.html" title="Tennis ball">Tennis ball</a>. I don't care less for Tennis but every few weeks I revert vandalism. So does antivandalbot and others. I have no idea why it attracts crap. Is it a reason to cull the article&#160;? No. Has it ever been "stable"&#160;? No if the past month is anything to go by. Your noble quest to AfD'ing articles that doesn't stabilize within some timeframe you have in mind is to me quixotic given the fluid nature of Wikipedia and that I do not see a policy that says this is what has to happen. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 02:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I think the question here, given that we have numerous other "comparison" articles on Wikipedia, is whether or not the ultra-controversial nature of the article itself will directly prevent it from being maintained in a policy-compliant form for any length of time. If, as AlistairMcMillan suggests, the article is (and will remain) a constant source of POV-based edit wars by either "camp" then the article very well may need to be deleted. If, however, it is possible to clean up the article into a policy-compliant form and keep it that way then it should be cleaned up and remain on Wikipedia. At least, that's my interpretation of this AfD.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I've only just started to look at this article in the past few weeks and I feel that there is sufficient material around to fill out the "citation needed" tags with trustworthy cites. Part of the problem is that there is quite a lot of disinformation, from both camps. Fact is that the article has <b>46 references</b> and <b>10 citation needed</b> tags now in an article <b>44 kbytes</b> long so doesn't feel that bad from looking at other articles. The article will understandably be complex as OS's are probably some of the most complex software projects that humans have created. It does seem odd that this quite extensive (i.e. encyclopaedic) article that is slowly settling on a NPOV (remembering that Wikipedia has no version 1.0) is tagged for AfD whilst at the same time the editor requesting the delete is busy editing the very slim article on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_Windows_and_Mac_OS_X_fcf4.html" title="Comparison of Windows and Mac OS X">Comparison_of_Windows_and_Mac_OS_X</a> e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_Windows_and_Mac_OS_X&amp;diff=100607585&amp;oldid=100124335" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_Windows_and_Mac_OS_X&amp;diff=100607585&amp;oldid=100124335" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> in a positive way. The AfD states "This simply is not a suitable subject for an encyclopaedia." and yet they agree with the idea of comparing any two OS's by editing another similar class of article. This indicates a bias; why not simply edit this article to fit their idea of what the article should look like&#160;? I call this AfD nonsense on that basis in that it is a subject for an encyclopaedia as Windows and Linux is extensively compared in the tech community and the deleting editor actually edits in a positive way the same class of article and that the article has "refs" outnumbering "cites needed" by 4:1 showing a need to expand on the cites and not delete the lot. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 07:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The article has been around since last July (2006) and a review of the long and contentious history does not indicate any tendency for the article to resolve itself "into a policy-compliant form". The article shouldn't be a comparison, it should be about the controversy and the stances of the various participants in the controversy. That can be factual and can be based on appropriate sources. If the proponents of this article want to write that one, then let us delete this one, and they can create a new "Windows vs. Linux Controversy" article from scratch. How long is it appropriate to allow them to fight before quashing it? --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 08:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deleting it because it atracts POV bias is like not going to the market to buy food because it rains. The point is whether you are hungry and need the food, not whether it will be confortable to buy.

<dd>This article is inherently an opinion piece. Many of you seem to feel the best route is to restrict the whole thing to 'facts'. I would counter that there are few, if any absolutes in such a comparison, and that only way ever approach NPOV is to back up everything you say with reasoning and support. The conclusion alone isn't enough; there must be context and references. In short, the 'why' must be present, and in a rote recital of 'facts', it is not. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Indech_fa0c.html" title="User:Dave Indech">Dave Indech</a> 02:03, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must commend you on managing to hit virtually all of the points covered in "arguments not to use at AFD" in one short paragraph - we have WP:OWN, WP:ILIKEIT, "what about article X" and an admission that it's an op-ed piece! (WP:NOT, WP:NPOV!)

<dd>I don't appreciate your sarcasm. Be civil or please don't talk.</dd>
<dd>The most important word in my first line was 'good'. The fact that I wrote the content is irrelevant. My contributions are legitimately worth keeping because they add to the encyclopedia, and that's the reason I would rather the article remain.</dd>
<dd>'Like it' was not in my post.</dd>
<dd>The comment about the George Bush article remains valid. The sole reason for a delete cannot be because an article attracts POV. A bad article with POV is better than no article. Eventually, it will improve.</dd>
<dd>Finally, NPOV is an entirely relative concept. A comparison, by nature, depends on the relative values of the person making it. It can approach neutrality, but never achieve it. Moreover, the value judgements that color NPOV add to the worth of the article.</dd>
<dd>While this comparison will never be a shining paragon of the Wiki way, I feel it should nonetheless remain.</dd>

<dd>PS- There seems to be a bit of an identity crisis over what Wiki is and is not. One article says, "articles must be encyclopaedic". Another says, "Wikipedia is not Britannica; we're not limited to that". I'm firmly in the latter camp. It's articles like the one we're debating that keep me coming back.</dd>

<li>"Global presence"? Where? Because they have a web site (on which they don't even call themselves global either)?</li>
<li>Ron Jon: There is no comparison. Ron Jon is a widely known tourist destination, and recognized by just about every Floridian (due to Ron Jon seemingly buying more billboard space than any other advertiser), and the billboards are about the first thing tourists see when crossing the border. Killer Dana isn't a tourist destination, it's a surf shop known mostly to surfers; it certainly doesn't have the name recognition throughout the state that Ron Jon has. I don't see this as a valid comparison.</li>
<li>Furthermore, you don't need a separate article to make a distinction between a geographic location and a surf shop; that can be done in one article. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 04:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Further clarification</b> It doesn't work to use opnions as to which retail has a stronger presence or respect among tourists- this is not provable information and is geographically biased information. Ron Jon's isn't even well known (nor taken seriously) in Southern California- arguably the mecca of surfing in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. As someone educated in surfing history, I confirm that Killer Dana is a well known retailer (of over a decade) that is an intregral part of the Southern California surf industry, epecially in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Point_6aba.html" title="Dana Point">Dana Point</a>. The <i>Global</i> referrence was merely explaining the distribution of it's product worldwide. But you are correct, it is not a "global" corp. in the sense that it has headquarters on other continents. Killer Dana is also a manufacturer of apparel, especially <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardshorts.html" title="Boardshorts">Boardshorts</a>- also the largest single retailer of this same item. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eng500_4b92.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eng500">contribs</a>) 20:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>Ron Jon isn't taken seriously by surfers in Florida either, which just strengthens my point that it's invalid to compare a surf shop with a tourist destination.

<li><b>Keep</b> Should not be merged or redirected. It may not be a great page right now, but adding and finding information does not happen overnight. Lego Minifigure/Minifigs is a Lego element. Lego Pirates is one theme of many different Lego theme pages listed on Wikipedia. Example: Lego Train, Lego Star Wars, Lego Exo-Force, Lego Bionicle, Lego Mindstorms, Lego Space, Lego Castle and so on. The reason Lego Pirates page was created, was the same reason why the other Lego themes pages were created. There was a big debate/discussion about (should or should not) breaking up each theme. There was a agreement that each theme should have their own page. Because the set list, data, images, information of each theme was getting bigger and the page was getting to long. This applys to other companies, brands or hobbies mention and listed on Wikipedia. If this page is merge or redirect, we will have the problem over again. There are about 24 members on the WikiProject Lego or WP:LEGO. Who might be able to help. <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGoTLG_e469.html" title="User:GoTLG">GoLTG</a> 00:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Pirate LEGO" should under no circumstances be merged or redirected to "minifigure" as Pirates is an entire LEGO theme which encompasses much more than just minifigures. I think <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGoTLG_e469.html" title="User:GoTLG">GoLTG</a> is absolutely right, there is plenty more information to be added to this page. If anyone wants to discuss the development of this page on a dedicated to Pirate LEGO then by all means create a thread at <a href="http://pirates.eurobricks.com" class="external text" title="http://pirates.eurobricks.com" rel="nofollow">Eurobricks Pirate LEGO Forum</a> as there are many knowledgeable Pirate LEGO fanatics who frequent that forum on a daily basis. I have added some information regarding the Ladybird Book series and 1993 LEGO Expo "Pirates Ahoy". I have also added other titles of topics relating to Pirate LEGO which can be expanded on. At present I don't have time to do it all myself so I urge others to contribute until I find the time. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_phes_9f7e.html" title="User:Mr phes">Mr Phes</a> 08:13, 16 January 2007 (AESDT)</li>

<p>A prior <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kimberly_Franklin_071e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kimberly Franklin">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kimberly Franklin</a> was overturned at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_8_ccc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 8">deletion review</a> based on the undiscussed tidbit that the video named after her is a compilation, so not covered under <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>, so we're back here now for more discussion. This is a procedural nomination, I have <b>no opinion</b> (other than the question: Does porn fall under "media and music" or "fiction and the arts"?). ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Although this article technically fails <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>, the real reason to delete it is because it is crap. Poorly written, unreferenced, uninformative, overtly perverse, irredeemable crap. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 21:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>comment</b>: With all due respect Anetode, none of those reasons are valid deletion reasons. Poor writing can be cleaned up, references can be added, information can be found, wikipedia is uncensored, and the article can always be fixed up. I do take issue with the overly liberal criterion in WP:PORNBIO however, it seems pornstars are subject to a much lower standard of notability than any other field of entertainer or public figure, specifically the "any video named after them" bit includes a lot of trivial artists. If she passes pornbio, we have no choice but to keep, though. Perhaps we ought to look at trying to tighten up pornbio to control some of the pornocruft. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 03:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's true that all of these concerns can be addressed by completely rewriting the article, I've done that to several underappreciated stubs before<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hoang_Thi_Loan&amp;diff=93950999&amp;oldid=93939894" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hoang_Thi_Loan&amp;diff=93950999&amp;oldid=93939894" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. However I do not think that it is worth it in this case. Sometimes the best action to take w/r/t a crappy article is to flush it down the toilet. Not always, and certainly not because of subject matter in general, but I think that there is nothing wrong with subjecting articles to harsh criticism if they have little, if any, redeeming qualities. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 21:44, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

After research and tedious debate, she does not. To everyone who says the standard needs to be changed if you don't like it, we have tons of discussion going on in the talk page of PORNBIO.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nowhere in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> does it say that having "any video named after them" is a criterion. The criterion is quite specific that it be an original film, not a compilation. Franklin has a compilation with her name in the title, not an original film.

<p>Request <b>deletion</b> as not notable. Kelly D. Williams is an artist who produces skateboard related art. The only references are in External links to his own web site and a blog interview emailed from <i>Kreativ Network</i> <a href="http://www.kreativnetwork.com/enter.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kreativnetwork.com/enter.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> a non-notable association of artists. A search of the commercial EBSCO news and magazine database did not turn up any hits for Kelly D. Williams. A NEXIS search for Kelly D. Williams in art news did not turn up any articles. Nor did I find any reliable sources in a brief Google search, mostly his advertising and takes from this Wikipedia article. This article has been up since April 2006 and notability has not been provided. As the “Official website for Kelly D. Williams” is quite commercial, as well as is the <i>Kreativ Network</i> site, it is not entirely clear where this should be judged for notability as a business or as an artist. As a business it fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. As an artist: There are no book or magazine biographies or even news stories about Kelly D. Williams. Some magazines are listed in the Wikipedia article under "Exhibition &amp; Media Summary", but, for example, <i>Transworld Business Magazine</i> was listed (until removed by an IP editor last week) and a search of their issues 2003 to date did not produce any articles. Similarly a search of the archives of Staf Magazine <a href="http://www.stafmagazine.com/staf30/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stafmagazine.com/staf30/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> (a Spanish language zine) did not reveal any interview with Kelly D. Williams, or any Williams, caveat the archive may not have contained the whole of 2006. Kelly D. Williams may have works in some galleries, but so far as I have been able to determine, he has won no awards and had had no one-man-shows. He has no works in museums. He is not notable as an artist. Maybe in twenty years he will be, but it is not there now. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 08:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I took a look at the 2006 media mentions listed in his CV.

The interview introduces him as an "up and coming artist". Bejnar's already done most of the legwork, so I just ran the other names of media sources through <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> - only Lemonade came with 2 very passing mention hits. <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> search on Williams only brought up a few one line mentions in gallery schedule listings. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep – assistance with edit</b> When this article was first created it seemed to have some improvable or at least opinionated information, so I have made few attempts to remove such content and/or add additional resources as they were found. I’ve done this because I’m aware of the credibility of <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_D._Williams_ea84.html" title="Kelly D. Williams">Kelly D. Williams</a> as an actual artist, both as a gallery artist as well as a commercial graphic designer (not a business). As mentioned, there is, in fact, an article/interview with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a> in Staf Magazine – I know this because I have seen the actual issue as well as seen this artist’s artwork on listings for group and solo exhibitions in various art-related periodicals. Reasons for deletion are also highly opinionated, so I propose to remove opinionated content and keep. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> 18:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Further, the person must have made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. They can't just be a credible artist. Contributing to the "enduring historical record" usually means that an artist has works in museums (more than one); however, it can also be met where an artist has started an artistic movement.

<dd><b>RE: Keep – assistance with edit</b> Please refer to the same <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">notability</a> article defining requirements for credibility of a person, which reads <i><b>“This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.”</b></i></dd>

<dd>From the research that ALL people have posted on this discussion, this article (or artist as a person) has satisfied several (or ALL) of these tests.</dd>

<dd>Also note the length of time that this article has existed, the diverse contributions to it, and also consider other articles on Wiki for similar artists in this similar genre of art. Many of them have not been sufficiently written according to the points discussed in this Afd, and therefore serve as referential precedence as preserved articles of significance that should not be deleted. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> 05:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Surely a redirect or a merge is basically the same as a delete in this case since the information is already on the artist's page? You might say that the content has been merged but the source page has not been redirected. Seems reasonable to me to use AfD to discuss it, especially as it's already been prodded.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich257_a349.html" title="User:Rich257">Rich257</a> 08:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, in most cases a redirect should be performed to save the edit history. And AfD is not reasonable at all if: (i) you have not previously attempted the redirect; (ii) you have not entered into prior discussion on the article talk page.

<li>I recognize that you've done most of the work on the Baby Cham discography article (and the Baby Cham article itself). The real problem with a separate discography article in my opinion is that since Baby Cham has only produced two albums, it does not warrant a separate discography page. And seeing as the information is the same, it would be much easier to have it in one source (it would be much easier to keep it up to date. Currently, the discography in the Baby Cham article has more information than the separate article, which really makes it useless.

<li>So you allow that it's ridiculous, but still want to keep. What's AfD for if not to rid wikipedia of articles which are <i>ridiculous</i>? Yes, it's ridiculous, <i>but keep</i> is tantamount to saying, "Wikipedia should be ridiculous."</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This was not meant as an attack, and sorry if you felt that way, Yukichigai, I was just thinking out loud and contemplating the worth of the presence of this article. What bothers me also is the choice of external links, as they point to specific pizza farm'y places and border on advertisement.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "The perceived worth of the subject matter" is a nice way of saying "the editor's personal opinion on subject X," i.e. what they think of the concept of a pizza farm outside of its presence on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The premise of this AfD "There is no such thing as a "pizza farm;" this concept has no notability" is clearly not true - the external links show that the term <i>pizza farm</i> is indeed used, and that the concept is recognised.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

My daughter has visited out local Pizza Farm and she quite enjoyed the educational benefits of the field trip.

<p>The page was speedily deleted once and promptly recreated. The creator of the article has said (on the discussion page) that multiple, non-trivial references to this FL tanning salon exist, but that they are under no obligation to cite any of them to establish notability. This seems to be a pretty cut and dried case of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. There is absolutely no reason to think that this tanning salon varies from any of the hundreds of tanning salons in the United States, despite the link to their myspace page. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 10:18, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I created the page. I have no influence on said company. All the information I wrote on the article were what I remembered from a newspaper article about the store from a girl I knew in high school. This page has no instances of self-promotion. There is no advertisement, price list, nor specific list of items and services sold. The reason to think that this tanning salon varies from any of the hundreds of tanning salons in the United States is that I got all the information used to write it from a published periodical, which did not publish the tanning salon article as an advertisement and was not the owners and operators of the store "tooting their own own." It was written by a staff member. This qualifies under the rules of notability. <a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMghabmw_2c34.html" title="User:Mghabmw">Mghabmw</a> 10:38, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This also seems to be a personal attack. Just because on might not personally not care about Sunglow Tanning Spa, in this case, most people, it does not make it non-noteworthy. Apparently, a Florida periodical tended to care as do I for writing an entry on someone I met 10 years ago in NJ.<a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMghabmw_2c34.html" title="User:Mghabmw">Mghabmw</a> 10:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accept some of your points but if we followed what you said to your logical conclusion "list of colour of booties that Link wore" would be fine because notability would be expressed by the parent article of "the legend of Zelda" would be there and we'd have the primary source of the game to draw upon. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 11:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, because if that information were included in the article it would be removed as "tangential" or "irrelevant" information. Notability of list information is established by its notability if it were included in the main article, irrespective of the effect it would have on article flow/size/etc. in that hypothetical.

<p>"<i>Ω ID is Ω Universitas in ID Mode. When in ID Mode the craft changes color from blue to red and projects out bright teal wings of energy similar to KOS-MOS' Third Armament.

It is accessible only near the end of the game after Citrine is defeated aboard the Durandal. She drops a key to the Weapons Development Area of the CAT Facility on Fifth Jerusalem, where the fight between KOS-MOS and Ω Res Novae was held.

Let it stay until the plans are set in motion, so that we don't lose the edit history. As I point out on my userpage, don't rush to AfD articles if someone is planning on revamping the article(s) in question (as I stated on the CVG talkpage a day before the AfD was started). I'm not going to pull an all-nighter to work on these articles just because one is on AfD, either; I'll work on them, all right, but it'll have to be when I have the time to do it.

<dd>That's the problem; AfD is being done more and more incorrectly as of late. AfD should always be a last resort, not a wakeup call; I find it best to let users know that these kinds of articles are unacceptable on an encyclopedia, and then give them ample time to consider a plan and make a major turnaround (like the Final Fantasy pages). Unfortunately, I have been unable to realize my full plans for the Xenosaga pages because of other pressing matters (finsihing what I began at the Final Fantasy wikiproject, copyediting, reviving the star wars project and continuing star wars cleanup, working on an FA, and so on). Either way, the AfD has been launched, and all that is moot because editors are now going to be forced.</dd>

This article describes plot elements from the series' storyline, for the most part. Therefore, it's not a gameguide, it's a violation of the "plot summary" clause in WP:NOT. Sourcing is not an issue, because the game provides both plot databases and even real-life influences! The article can easily be sourced with cites from the database (the game database is actually out of universe for the most part, making it reliable), and so on....IF the article were to stay in list form, which is pathetic because we don't need an inch by inch summary of every little element of Xenosaga. So, while the article has potential to remain in its current state with some cites and rewriting, that is not the idea.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The idea is to take all these organizations, terms, and locations, and merge it into one article describing the plot, another describing the technological aspects and their influences (japanese mecha, names deriving from myth, etc), and maybe a character list. However, with Xenosaga (which features more than 30 hours of cutscenes on the whole - that's more than 12 movies right there), such a heaping amount of information requires time to sort through what is important, what's not important, influences, and what is significant enough to note; not to mention finding the correct cites to avoid original interpretation, and keeping everything contained and succinct. This takes time, which a 5-day AfD doesn't provide.</dd>

<dd>However, just deleting this article is not a wise move, because some of this information may be kept (or at least the ideas), and edit histories are very important to me. Which is why I suggested keep and add numerous cleanup tags to designate that this article needs significant overhaul, compression, and merge into a more complete out of universe page - not simply delete and scare people off. Let editors realize what they're doing is wrong, and let them help fix it so that I'm not tackling yet another project alone. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 16:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The Real Number Domain is the plane of existence consisting of physical being and flesh (Material realm - All that we hear, see, smell, touch and taste) while the Imaginary Number Domain consists of consciousness, (Spiritual realm - emotions and heart etc). As the Ark is from the Imaginary Domain, it does not exist physically. Abel's Ark is the form of Abel's consciousness while Abel is the form of U-Do's physical being. They are referred to as "U-Do's eyes" because U-Do exists outside of the universe (in what's referred to as the "Higher Domain").

<li><b>Keep</b>. Where an artists releases their albums is irrelevant. While having the support of a major label with its attendant PR and distribution apparatuses may make it more likely that a band will have the articles necessary to qualify for Wikipedia notability, many bands still manage to achieve notability without this support. Such as this band, which has more than enough 3rd party press to qualify for notability. But I see that the article is lacking in references. I'll try to integrate some references when I get the time. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 06:01, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

And, Alf photoman, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_Freedom_Center_4b1d.html" title="David Horowitz Freedom Center">David Horowitz Freedom Center</a> was redlinked because it was misspelled, not because it was not notable. This article is a stub and has an anti-Horowitz POV currently, but keep it for others to work on. Incidentally, it doesn't need renaming, since Horowitz renamed it from Network to Networks some time back (it seems both names work as urls). And I notice that adds ANOTHER 1,563k to the Alexa. And here's another left near counterpart with a Wiki entry, <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaTransparency_869b.html" title="MediaTransparency">MediaTransparency</a>, more used than the other two, but still with only about a quarter of DTN's combined Alexa.

All the accusations of guilt-by-association count. ("Web-specific content is notable if...The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.") And, no it's not all FrontPageMag reprints.

<li><b>Reply</b> Not a pain, at all. I followed Jersey Devil's link and didn't read closely enough. I stand corrected, and am happy to have my misunderstanding corrected. Nonetheless, if JD is right that DTN's traffic is sufficient, adding DTNs' has to make the case stronger.</li>
<li>I actually don't have a VERY strong feeling that DTN needs to be a separate article. Probably it does. Only Will Bebeck seems to realize that deleting the article just means folding the material into the Horowitz article, which is long enough already. What I do have a strong feeling about is this poll, which seems animated by an animus against the content of the site rather than it's notability. I don't know exactly how much <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is required to justify an article on Wikipedia but it's obvious that there are a LOT of articles on Wikipedia on subjects with a lot less <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has mostly to do with how you cite the site, right? And accusing it of <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> says more about where you are than Horowitz. So WHY are we discussing deleting this article? If someone searches for info on DTN do we really want them to wade through the Horowitz article? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 00:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the clarification. Both Photoman and Guy had mentioned the Horowitz article, so I assumed you were on the same page.

Organizationally FrontPageMag and DTN are on the same level - see the "Ongoing Programs" list at [<a href="http://www.horowitzfreedomcenter.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.horowitzfreedomcenter.org/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>]. It might be justified to reconsider the decision not to delete <a href="../../../f/r/o/FrontPageMag.com_723d.html" title="FrontPageMag.com">FrontPageMag.com</a>, and fold it too into <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_Freedom_Center_4b1d.html" title="David Horowitz Freedom Center">David Horowitz Freedom Center</a>. And <a href="../../../s/t/u/Students_for_Academic_Freedom_8915.html" title="Students for Academic Freedom">Students for Academic Freedom</a> too, while you're at it. With redirects, of course. But this is because of the paucity of material in Wikipedia, not because of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. If someone were to write up a description of that java ap on DTN (it would be really cool to have something like that as a view of the links between Wikipedia articles!) or otherwise describe DTN at length it would unbalance the DHFC article and should be spun off. But I, e.g., am not yet enough of a Wikipedian to know how to do that step, so that I am not convinced it isn't better to leave the framework of nodes, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> but stubs, in place.... But that's not the discussion that started here. The proposal to delete and initial comments were couched in terms dismissive of the CONTENT of the site ("vast left-wing conspiracy", "fringe", "tin-foil hats", etc.) that invited the conclusion that the proposal was partisan. I know, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>... but it's not non-rebuttable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 15:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't think the afd or some of the votes were made in bad faith, however it does appear that some are allowing their bias to cloud their judgement somewhat. DTN is the exact ideological opposite of <a href="../../../s/o/u/SourceWatch_0526.html" title="SourceWatch">SourceWatch</a> <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaMatters_c33e.html" title="MediaMatters">MediaMatters</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaTransparency_869b.html" title="MediaTransparency">MediaTransparency</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/NameBase_383d.html" title="NameBase">NameBase</a> -all sites which operate on the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vast_Right-Wing_Conspiracy_f756.html" title="Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy">Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy</a> thesis. It also doesn't appear that they're supported by any <i>better</i> cites than this article is. So it looks like there are plenty of tin foil hats to go around. However, I think all of these articles are useful. In fact, I think they should be kept so that when they're used as sources for articles, (which is a far bigger problem IMHO due to their advocacy POVs) we at least have the ability to wikilink them for full disclosure. One other thing, regarding Will's observation that it's an archive of FP articles. I don't think that's entirely correct. DTN is a distinct project of the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_Freedom_Center_4b1d.html" title="David Horowitz Freedom Center">David Horowitz Freedom Center</a> and appears to have a lot of additional content, however it isn't mentioned in that article at the moment and it should be. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 23:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmm... didn't you just "wikilink" to <a href="../../../n/a/m/NameBase_383d.html" title="NameBase">NameBase</a> even though it doesn't have its own article? Anyway... Horowitz claims about DTN that "[t]he sources for the facts entered and the interpretations based on them have been made as transparent as possible" <a href="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=7030" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=7030" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>-- I'm not clear if he's referring to more than just the hyperlinks embedded in the text -- and if true one mostly shouldn't use DTN as a source. I've done a little work on sections of the Horowitz article written by individuals with an anti-H POV and one of the things I found most obnoxious was contributors who cited MediaMatters or somesuch for what Horowitz said when the original text is readily available. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 14:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>(Yeah Brant is a whole other issue) Just to clarify, I don't think <i>any</i> of them are good sources, but in real-world WP you will find editors who <i>insist</i> -more of pragmatic argument than an idealistic one. In any case, I think they should all be kept according the the philosophy behind <a href="../../../t/i/g/WP%7ETIGERS_f7f0.html" title="WP:TIGERS">WP:TIGERS</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 00:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Who Brant?... My own view is that even non-reliable sources can be useful as long as they don't agree. They do a lot of the spadework and the disagreements are instructive. But that's beside the point, here. The AfD poll shouldn't be about whether DTN is reliable, but about whether DTN is so un-notable that merging it away and possibly splitting it off later is worth the investment in time. It's not as if there's a shortage of Wikipedia articles that could be worked on instead. Guy, at least, offered a metric for his claim of non-notability, though I can't decode it, but Yukichigai picked up on his animus against the site's content instead. Alf photoman gave a reason for considering the subject non-notable (that I debunked),Hut 8.5 offered his opinion that the content should be buried in the Horowitz aricle (already pushing 30k)...and we end up with 70.51.231.96's "not influential or that notable" opinion. My understanding is that this is a debate, not a vote. If there's opposition you need to come armed with more than unsupported opinion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 01:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or possibly merge into a section on the Frontpagemag article. This should be removed due to lack of notability.

<li>"Discover the Network" was the initial name of DTN, before Horowitz renamed it. To repeat, "Discover the Network"AND"David Horowitz" returns 27,800, not 700. Most "discover the network"(only) hits do not refer ro DTN, but Google apparently rates it the most notable meaning of the phrase because 9 of the first ten links are to references to DTN. Thanks for at least attempting a metric, tho. I don't think DTN is all that notable, but I don't think it's all that non-notable either, and it satisfies the technical definition of notable ("subject of multiple, non-trivial published works").

<p>This project has been dead for over a year and the project home page has been shut down. Notability was somewhat arguable before, but at this point it appears that Kat will likely be a historical footnote in the development of Strigi.

<dd>Just to clarify, I'd argue that it's border-line on notability and I'd say the same with Strigi. i.e. the nomination wasn't because it's dead, but because I think it's below the threshold for notability and being dead isn't going to become more notable. Strigi will likely at some point be notable, but it would be a bit odd for me to suggest the creation of another article that also wouldn't meet the notability requirements to merge Kat into. &#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott.wheeler_fe46.html" title="User:Scott.wheeler">Scott.wheeler</a> 21:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This officer heads a police force with only 63 officers. If he is entitled to have his own article, then inspectors/lieutenants in larger forces or army lieutenants should logically also be entitled to have one, since they can easily command the same number of people. The article is written like a eulogy and appears to have been written by the subject, who actually created three identical articles to cover all permutations of his name. All in all, this appears to be a <a href="../../../r/%C3%A9/s/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.html" title="Résumé">CV</a> for a probably worthy but not very notable small town police chief, of whom there are thousands in the United States and Canada.

RESPONSE FROM Barry King (I hope I am following the appropriate protocol here) <b>NECROTHESP:</b> You articulate a rationale for consideration in that there are only 63 officers reporting to Barry King. However a career of 46 years, and through that career there was a unique variety of service on Federal, Provincial, Regional, Medium city and Small City police services, including very senior positions (and responsibility for planning and implementing Peel Regional Police),Canada's 6th largest police service, with over 2,500 as a Superintendent (3rd highest rank at that time). Subsequent was Chief of a mid sized city police service of 165 (Sault Ste Marie) until retirement, then to Brockville on contract due to a shortage of candidates in the mid 1990"s for Chiefs in Ontario due to staffing retirement cycles. This was not intended as a CV or eulogy, nor an anal depth recital, rather a chronological history in what was believed to be in conformance with the intent of postings on Wikipedia. If there is a legitimate reason that something should be revised or deleted please advise but I don't belive that warrants deletion of the entire posting.Barry KingBarry king 15:15, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAutobiography_1f61.html" title="WP:Autobiography">WP:Autobiography</a> for the reasons why you should not write articles about yourself. As an example of eulogising from the article: "Chief Barry V. King, O.O.M. has had a distinguished career with an extraordinary legacy. In recognition of outstanding service to the various communities he has served, he has received the following medals and honours" and "A Family that Serves &amp; Protects". These are not really neutral. Please also note that while Sault Ste Marie may have 165 officers, it is a small police service in comparison to many others (e.g. only one territorial police force in England has fewer than 1,000 officers). Do you really think it's feasible or desirable to write articles on every senior police officer in the world? Bearing in mind that most of them will have similar CVs. For chiefs of forces with several hundred officers and deputy/assistant chiefs of forces with several thousand, I would say fair enough, but I'm afraid that neither Sault Ste Marie nor Brockville qualifies as such. As for more junior officers, they are not really notable unless they have done something particularly notable (not just their jobs). For example, I have written a series of articles about the senior officers of the London <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Police_13e1.html" title="Metropolitan Police">Metropolitan Police</a>, one of the biggest and most influential urban police forces in the world, with over 30,000 officers. However, I would only consider the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners to be automatically notable. More junior officers (many of whom head units considerably larger than the entire Sault Ste Marie and Brockville services put together) would have had to have done something fairly important to qualify for notability. This is my personal opinion of course, which is why I have listed it here for discussion. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> for the general guidelines. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 16:34, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Response from Barry King: I should clarify that I did not write the page, it was written by a third party as a compilation of a chronology of my career for a citizen of the year nomination and later for the OOM medal submission. It was suggested that as I was retiring, it should be posted, not because of my being Chief of Brockville, but for achieving 46 years policing career, 20 years as a Chief of Police, the leadership involvements I have participated in, which are all documentsd and verifiable, such as achieving the first WHO (World Health Organization) Collaborating Centre on Community Safety, Designation of Brockville as a Safe Community, which I have Co-Chaired for 10 years, 14 years Leadership as Chair of the Canadian Chiefs of Police Association Drug Abuse Committee where I led presentations to parliamentary committees on legislative changes towards decriminalization of cannabis and use of marihuana for medical purposes, legitimacy of needle exchange programs, my GiC appointment by the Government of Canada, Prime Minister's Federal Cabinet to three, 3year terms as Chair of the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (Canada's National Addictions Agency), much of which was extraneous to my job and consumed a great deal of personal time and travel away from work and home. Also speaking nationally and internationally on Drug Policy, atending as part of the Canadian Delegation to the UN on Drug Control Policy in Vienna,conferences in Perth Australia, Venice, Italy and others. Also international Emergency Management and Integrated Incident Command presentations, subsequent to the 1979 Mississauga Train derailment and my role as command post coordinator for the (at that time, prior to New Orleans evacuation) the largest peacetime evacuation in North America of 225,000 citizens and three hospitals for one week due to explosions, fire and chlorine contamination of the souther half of the city. I personally, do not desire nor need to be eulogized and welcome comments if this violates any rules, Your comment on UK policing, however, whereas Chiefs/Commissioners of most police services have 1,000 or more with some as high as 30,000 doesn't apply to the same degree in Canada as I am certain you are aware we have not completed the amalgamation process you have in Europe. We are now in the process, and in Ontario we have reduced from 238 police services to 60 and Quebec is doing the same. We do not suscribe in Canada as a Chiefs Association, that only the few Chiefs of the 15-20 or so major (large sized) Police services can make contributions or are noteworthy. We have 383 Canadian Police Services at this point in time and our Past president of the Canadian Chiefs of Police Association heads a Police Service of 225. I have been on the Chief's Association Executive for 6 years. What may fit in older, larger countries with sizeable, amalgamated police services and where the Commissioners are sometimes Knighted by the Queen, does not necessarialy fit with Canada. I can now better appreciate the criteria you have identified and your concern about adjectives that appear self serving. I will have these areas revised where they appear to do that. The remaining chronological statements are fact based and verifiable. Thank You.Barry KingBarry king 17:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that Canadian police forces are smaller is not relevant. Wikipedia covers the whole world and Canada is not a special case. The fact remains that by definition the chief of a larger force is usually more notable than the chief of a smaller force, just as an army general is usually more notable than a colonel. If there are 383 police services in Canada, then it would be ridiculous to have an article for every police chief or former police chief, just as every mayor or fire chief is not notable enough for Wikipedia. Before the second half of the 20th century Britain had many borough police forces, but I would not expect to have an article for each chief constable, only for those of the major cities with police strengths in the hundreds or thousands, who had national influence and prominence. This is also the case in Canada and the United States, where town police forces still exist. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would agree with you - articles should be deleted in accordance with our policies. If other biographies exist which should not, they should be deleted in accordance with our policies, rather than used as justification for keeping equally non-notable other articles. However, you've failed to point out how Nina Hossain is not sufficiently notable to merit an article here. As you suggest, we do have a consistent set of rules to apply to such articles: it's <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and I see no reason why Nina Hossain is not sufficiently notable per these guidelines. How can "fame" never be "enough to justify the existence" of an article? Isn't that, in essence, what notability is? It sounds to me that you want this article deleted out of jealousy for the deletion of an article you authored.

<dd>As to the point you raised about 'fame' equating notability, I don't think fame alone results in notability (at least not in the domain of wikipedia), and it's also highly questionable just how much fame can be attributed to Hossain. In fact, some would argue that whatever fame the subject has is down to sex appeal, and I would be inclined to agree with that. As a journalist if she achieved something significant in her field then fair enough, she deserves to be included. <b>Sir David Frost</b> is a journalist worthy of notability because he has achieved much in his field and is highly recognisable both in the United Kingdom and outside it. And not only that, but if Hossain did something outside of newsreading that increases her fame, then that too might merit her an article. <b>Natasha Kaplinsky</b>, for example, is notable not only as a newsreader but also as a popular celebrity thanks to her appearance on prime time television programs in the UK. But as it stands, being an ITV newsreader alone is not enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, and I don't see how knowing about her snowboarding and iPod passions are relevant for inclusion either.</dd>

<dd>Basically, as somebody who regularly features on a mainstream television channel she is notable. You seem to be a little confused about the function of AfD. It is not to judge whether what has been written is notable, but whether the subject <i>written about</i> is notable. Nina Hossain is certainly notable enough to have an article <i>written about</i> her, although all that is currently in the article may not be encyclopaedic. Note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that one of the criteria for inclusion is: "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by: (e.g.) Name recognition". Since she appears regularly on national news on a major TV channel in a populous country she blatantly meets this criterion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This biographical article is about and written by John Joseph Kennedy, who has no relation to the famous political Kennedys. He's just a guy who creates write-in campaigns for himself and is not considered a serious contender by anyone. He's non-notable; if you search for him out there, all of the articles are either 1) written by him, 2) press releases by him, or 3) clones of this Wikipedia article. This is simply a vanity article. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 15:20, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment from John Joseph Kennedy.</b> It was brought to my attention today that my biography and history that were recently expanded by me and my campaign on Wikipedia is in question and subject to speculation, authenticity and ridicule by some of the individuals below. First and foremost, it is my copyrighted property, and approved fully by me. Wikipedia posted my name and brief bio in 2004 after the election - without my knowledge - however, I was pleased to have this recognition for standing up for America as a voice of Truth and Hope. I am again officially running for President in 2008, not as a write-in, but on the Democratic ticket, and have every right to have my biography and family biography posted and stated <i>accurately.</i> I stand behind every word that is written. I may be a "fringe" candidate as some have suggested because I am not well-known yet, however, I am a candidate none the less. My bio on Wikipedia clearly states that I am <i>not</i> associated with President John F. Kennedy's branch of the family, nor do I care to be. If you read my biography in it's entirety, it clearly states that I am from the Kennedy's of Charleston, South Carolina family, and we have a history far beyond the Boston Kennedy's, here in America, and in other parts of the world. So I ask each of you these questions: What are YOU notable for? What are YOU doing for America? What are YOU doing to make the world a better place? I ask these questions not with malice, but with sincerity. Although I fully support free speech, I do not condone, nor will I tolerate, slanderous or libelous remarks made about me or my family, and have passed this review page on to my legal advisors. Sincerely, John J. Kennedy <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jjk2007 (<a href="../../../j/j/k/User_talk%7EJjk2007_77ef.html" title="User talk:Jjk2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjk2007_b9ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjk2007">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Uioh and 69.122.3.19 share editing trends, typing styles and use similar language. It could be possible that they are the same person. Also, whether or not there is potentially a lot more information to come, if it is more information about the roles of the items in the story, then that will not improve the articles.

<dd><b>Comment</b>:We care that there are sock puppets, because it gives the illusion that there are many more supporters of the idea that the user with the sock puppets is proposing. Despite the fact that this is not a vote, the idea that there are numerous supporters of an idea can often sway peoples opinions on the matter, which is not what we are trying to do.

<li><b>Comment</b> considering that <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spamhaus.html" title="Spamhaus">Spamhaus</a> is currently being sued in part for mentioning someone on their ROKSO list, I'm not sure that they alone qualify as a reliable source.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I urge people to look through the list and note the number of times that being sued has been mentioned. I can think of a couple of other cases where people have sued because they were accused of being spammers that aren't mentioned in this article. Spammers, in general, do not think as much about the costs they place on others as they do the profits that they can make and simply looking at the top of the page shows that they could make millions if they successfully sue wikipedia. People who don't think of themselves as spammers often are deeply offended by such accusations. <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>, let alone wikipedia's laywer, but I suspect that council would urge the speedy deletion of these claims until they are well documented, rather than keeping with the hope that someone will do something now that hasn't happened in the last 3 years. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 18:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rename</b> to "List of <i>alleged</i> e-mail spammers." Much of the sting of possible libel is removed if we refer to these people as alleged spammers, rather than spammers. I would rename the article myself and create a redirect from the current name, but I don't know how - maybe it's an administrative privilege. Anyone who can do that should please also rename ESKAR to "Eskar." Given the number of blue-linked people in the list, deletion seems like a mistake. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory or a database dump site. Not every building that is listed deserves an article.

My family home in London is a Grade II (the lowest grade) listed building. There is nothing special about our (extensively modernized/remodelled) home (my father went and researched this in order to value the property, which dates from the 18th century) except some "period" architectural features on the house's front and top (the house is not recognizable as a "old" house and there is no special history attached). ~94% of England's listed buildings are Grade II. The higher grades - Grade II* (4% of buildings) and Grade I (2% of buildings) - are conferred on buildings with some kind of enhanced or exceptional interest and are eligible for grants towards preservation (Grade II are not eligible). Grade I buildings are likely to be worthy of articles. Grade II* buildings - <i>maybe</i>. Anyway, applying these average England percentages, 94% of the buildings on the Liverpool list - which has just been dumped from a database - will be quite unremarkable in encyclopedic terms.

<dd>No, it's an argument for deletion; the criteria for inclusion on the list is simply too wide, it is unmaintainable.

Can someone elaborate as to how this does not violate this policy? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I am currently neutral in this debate, I am having trouble understanding how this list meets the definition of a directory, which, according to the OED, is a list of people and businesses in a certain area with their addresses or a list of people in a particular trade, profession or occupation. This is a list of places of interest, which is a list, not a directory. And <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">lists are perfectly acceptable on Wikipedia</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It may not list the owner's of each building, but if you look at the article you'll see it lists the addresses of all of them. Virtually none of the <i>thousands</i> of addresses listed are linked to articles and never will be as they appear to be addresses of houses and other small buildings. They are accompanied, apparently, by the date of their creation. There entire list consists solely of addresses and the date they were built; no context is provided, not notability is established. There probably is copywrite issues because someone most likely ripped this list wholesale from somewhere else. Sure, lists can be fine on Wikipedia but they should provide context, notability and should be easily maintainable; lists that have well over two thousand entries consisting primarily of items that will never have their own articles are almost, if ever, acceptable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, it is not a directory, and therefore does not meet the criteria on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" class="extiw" title="w:NOT">W:NOT</a>! Of course it lists their addresses, since buildings tend to be known by their addresses! That doesn't make it a directory.

<dd>It is a directory, at least as far as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> is concerned. A list of addresses or names or a combination thereof constitutes a directory. Furthermore, you haven't addressed the fact that 99% of these buildings are non-notable and will never have articles, that the article itself provides no context, that the information is unencyclopedic and can be found elsewhere more appropriately and that it likely is a copyright violation. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Really? Where in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> does it say that this is a directory? It doesn't appear to meet the criteria for any of the three categories listed there. It is not a list of "loosely associated topics" since it focuses on a single narrowly defined topic. It is not a genealogical entry or a phonebook entry. It is not a directory (as already established according to the pre-eminent dictionary of the English language), TV/radio guide or resource for conducting business. Unless there is a hidden category which I am unable to see, it is not therefore a directory in Wikipedia terms. Furthermore, maybe you should read both my previous posts where I said I was not trying to address anything other than your incorrect citing of a policy and note that I have not said "keep" anywhere. My concern is simply that people are getting rather too fond of citing policies and guidelines which they claim back up their arguments but which in fact do not. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 20:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>QISDL stands for "Quality Independent Self Directed Learner".

Martin Senior Public School</a> in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. The google search for this term returns 3 hits: the wikipedia article, a personnal home page of a former student of the program and the page of the school. Hence, there does not appear to be any third-party coverage whatsoever and the page is just internal lingo and of no encyclopedic interest. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have researched this subject myself, some, and never found a reliable source discussing the existence <s>(or even hypothetical existence)</s> of cheese made from human breast milk. The article itself cites three sources, only one of which is about cheese (the others are about milk), and that one source (<a href="http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt" class="external free" title="http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt" rel="nofollow">http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt</a>) is far from being a reliable source. In external links, there is a blog post on the topic as well: again, very much not a reliable source. Also, much of this article as it now stands is original research, extrapolating what the nutritional value of human cheese would be, based on the nutritional value of human milk. <b>Delete</b> —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Correction.

The columnist makes a few calls, including one to a cheesemaker who says "The department of health might have something to say about that." But is it possible? "You could probably do it, I don't see why not--provided you could get your hands on the milk."

<li><b>Keep</b>. The newspaper column is, I think, a fairly famous one which gets reprinted from time to time and has appeared in newspapers across Canada and the United States, since Dan Savage's column is syndicated to several other alternative newspapers. In the same way that Wikipedia has articles debunking urban legends, here we have an article which says "it's possible but probably wouldn't be a very good idea". The points in the article seem adequately referenced (and the fact that some don't mention cheese is fine - the references are illustrating points about human milk), except for the suggestion about it being appropriate for vegan diets. However, I think the article has adequate sources. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The 16,200 google hits for "human cheese" suggest that people are interested in the concept. Even the nominating editor admits to having done research on this. People are interested! (So, human cheese is notable.) The article is sourced; the Savage Love article (and I can't find the older version on The Stranger website, but I think I remember Dan Savage getting lots of responses to that column) and the external link blog (with pictures!) are a very good start. The milk content sources are useful, relevant, helpful sources that make the case for you-can't-make-human-milk in this article very well. The sources have bit and pieces that, when put together as they are in the article right now, make that case better than any of the sources taken alone. This is a characteristic of a good article, not a characteristic of original research! Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a how-to-manual, so the fact that you probably CAN'T make human cheese is not a problem! It is also not a problem that the FDA would not approve of human cheese; wikipedia isn't a list of food approved by the FDA. If people are interested in the concept of "human cheese," having a wikipedia article that tells them that they can't buy it, and probably can't make it, either, is actually really useful. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 09:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not meeting "original research" and "verifiablity" are two different reasons to delete an article. It's not "original research" because of the Dan Savage article and the blog. Neither of these are particularly "good," reputable sources, but they do strongly show that this concept is extant. However, there are "good" reputable sources for what's in human milk, which makes this article verifiable. As I said above, it's noteable for the sheer number of goole hits (although some of them must be about the sex thing, I don't think most of them are).<a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 03:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's not crystal ball in any shape to have an article on a ship on order, any more so for a building under construction (two of them, actually, Carnival confirms they've got two of the same size and plans building for 2009 and 2010 service dates respectively). Money has been paid, contracts are signed, there are plans - it's real. If it were never going to get more detail, then merging it in to the parent article would make sense, but we know that more info will be released on the ship as it moves through the construction process and towards service. Any article on a confirmably real notable item, and two ships <i>among the world's 10 largest cruise ships</i> are notable, is worth having. The article will grow over time to have good content (as much as the other cruise ship articles), and should be kept for now. Deleting it now, just to recreate it as the ship nears its launch date, is silly and a waste of time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't doubt the notability of the ship(s) even whilst under construction - I just don't see the sense in a separate article with minimal information, and which people are unlikely to specifically search for. A few sentences in the Carnival article would seem much more useful to the public reading that article. The process of merging the article now, only to merge it back out again in a years time is hardly a lengthy process - and certainly not a "silly waste of time" if it improves the quality and usefulness of our content in the meantime. I do fully agree with <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> below that the ship(s) will merit their own article once named and launched. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 08:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. At this stage it is worth noting that Carnival is building the ships in their article. However, it would be preferable that we have an article once the ships are named as people looking for the information at this stage would be more likely to look at the Carnival article that enter the term Un-named Carnival Ship expecting an article.

<li><b>Delete and no Redirect</b>. May not be <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystal balling</a> as much as other articles but it violates WP:NOTE. A press release does not notability make. Who would look Wikipedia up for a unnamed ship of Carnival Cruise Lines?? The news of the press release is better suited to the main <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnival_Cruise_Lines_b389.html" title="Carnival Cruise Lines">Carnival Cruise Lines</a> article. I prodded it because I am new to deletion processes and wanted an admin or somebody more experienced to look it up and judge it for themselves, but after finding out my prod was removed, I'm glad somebody Afd'd it. And be glad I didn't prod the other ships, they look like blatant advertisements. Only those ships involved in the Hurricane Katrina relief effort are suited for Wikipedia. Even the main Carnival Cruise Lines article doesn't have third-party references making it look like an advertisement as well, except for the Hurricane Katrina section. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 13:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We should be <i>glad</i> you didn't prod the other ships?! I find it hard to think that all those prods would have come to anything if you had of done - some of the largest cruise ships in the world are most definitely notable as is Carnival Cruise Lines. The fact that many of the articles may be short and lacking adequate references is a reason to improve them, not delete them. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 22:20, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You are free to create Bowl of beans if this is your personal preferred method of serving the food. <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_of_beans.html" title="Cup of beans">Cup of beans</a>, however, documents a distinct method of food preparation.

<dd><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> I have provided two references of the use of the phrase cup of beans, one from a BBC website (which anyone would consider a reliable source) and the other shown in a video clip from a very popular television program. This is more than many other articles which cite only a single reference or none at all. I have also provided a link, in this discussion, to a Google search showing 300+ websites where various people have used the phrase to describe the dish detailed in <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_of_beans.html" title="Cup of beans">Cup of beans</a>.</dd>

<dd>The BBC reference is a trivial reference, and doesn't count. I don't consider that every phrase used in a TV programme should be given its own article, unless the gag itself is notable. We don't need articles covering every last line in every comedy show.</dd>
<dd>As for the recipe argument, articles such as <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_and_chips.html" title="Fish and chips">Fish and chips</a> do give examples of ways in which a dish can be served, but this article consists of very little else, and can therefore be considered a recipe. (Besides, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_and_chips.html" title="Fish and chips">Fish and chips</a> is obviously well-known, whereas <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_of_beans.html" title="Cup of beans">Cup of beans</a> isn't.)</dd>
<dd>The fact that lots of people on the web use this isn't a good argument - they are using it to describe a cup filled with beans. If all the article said was "<b>Cup of beans</b> is used to describe a <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup.html" title="Cup">cup</a> filled with <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beans.html" title="Beans">beans</a>", then the article meets the speedy deletion criteria. <b><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut_8.5_802a.html" title="User:Hut 8.5">Hut</a> <a href="../../../h/u/t/User_talk%7EHut_8.5_521d.html" title="User talk:Hut 8.5">8.5</a></font></b> 17:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Furthermore, you did not argue that <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_of_beans.html" title="Cup of beans">Cup of beans</a> should be deleted because it is a 'traditional' dish. Nowhere in the article is this stated and the status of any dish as being traditional or not would not be a criterion for deletion from Wikipedia anyway.

<dd>I know it has been disputed that inclusion in the british television show satifies <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">wikipedias notability guidelines</a>, but I think that it does. It may not be a concept familiar but does not mean it is valid. Perhaps a cleanup or some other tag may have been appropriate. The articles current writing does not read like a recipie to me. If i wanted to have a "cup of beans" for dinner, if there are any specifics to it this articles does not provide them. It explains where it is used in television hence it asserts notability. And, i feel it may be on the line of notability, and in the case i would rather err on the side of caution and let this article be here. In the future, when somebody watching that television show wonders what a cup of beans might be, this article could provide a little more insight into it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 17:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wait wait wait. The usage on the television show hardly confers notability. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it wasn't a catchphrase was it? Did someone order and eat a cup o' beans every episode?

But if you are watching a rerun of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_King_of_Queens_48d5.html" title="The King of Queens">The King of Queens</a> and somebody orders "a plate of spaghetti", you can't then go on wikipedia, create an article called A Plate of Spaghetti, explain how to "make" it, and cite the TV reference as a source. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

At best, due to whatever little notability the association with Alan Partridge bestows on it, this should be a redirect, like Bender's catchphrase <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bite_my_shiny_metal_ass.html" title="Bite my shiny metal ass">Bite my shiny metal ass</a>. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>delete</b> Only three of the article the page lists were peer-reviewed. This is below the average, so he does not qualify as a scientist. As a clinician, giving intrviews and speaking at meetings does not make him notable, All medical specialists do that, as a form of advertising. If a medical proceedure is only mentioed in a couple of local sources, then it isnt notable as a clinical advance.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first paragraph of the article is self-advertising puffery. The second is a list of his education. He says he is an Assistant prof. at a Phila med School. Oddly, he does not list their web site as a source--but checking their catalog I find him listed as a Clinical Assistant Professor, which is not the same and probably not just carelessness.</dd>
<dd>We need a special N standard for clinicians, because he isnt the first to try to get listed in WP. When they actually have done significant research, or won academic awards, then they deserve to get in as academics. He hasn't and doesn't. And as a clinician, an notable clinician would have quite a lot more to show. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As far as I can tell, his most prominent publications in refereed journals have been co-authored by many many other people. Several things strange about this: 1) Why not list the co-authors and give them credit? 2) None of his co-authors have wikpedia pages. I can't see why he should have one, while the others do not. E.G.: Francis Hutchins, R Berkowitz, George Popky, James B Spies, Jay M Cooper John C Lipman, Benjie B Mills, James F Benenati, and the list goes on and on. I wish he would put up the co-authors names and properly credit them for the articles he lists. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollerbackgril_d612.html" title="User:Hollerbackgril">Hollerbackgril</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHollerbackgril_37fb.html" title="User talk:Hollerbackgril">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hollerbackgril_b385.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hollerbackgril">contribs</a>) 09:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I don't know enough about WP's criteria for notability of clinicians. However, when I go to www.pubmed.org and search for "robert worthington-kirsch" I see a list of 20 search results that look quite legit. I could be persuaded to give a definite vote for or against deletion if someone can look at these 20 results and tell me what their quality reveals. For a start, if this article is to be kept, I would expect to see all the cited references in the article to be properly spelled out, with all their authors, and with their PMIDs supplied, because that allows access to their abstracts. Currently the article doesn't have that. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>D/K/K</b>. The first Newbank is a wiki in the UK which offers course help for secondary school students. I can't find external references to it, so I suppose it will have to be deleted. The second Newbank is not a regular commercial bank but an emergency-only organization that will be activated if another very large bank (one which clears US government securities) fails. The press release is from a U.S. government agency rather than from Newbank itself. I would keep this article as a stub. The third Newbank should become a separate article, probably renamed <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbank%2C_Glasgow_11ca.html" title="Newbank, Glasgow">Newbank, Glasgow</a>. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 22:05, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This really should be three separate articles. The first (schoolwork wiki) is manifestly not notable. The second (dormant bank) would seem appropriate for a merge and disambiguation redirect to <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Bank_b425.html" title="Federal Reserve Bank">Federal Reserve Bank</a>. The third looks like the original subject of the article and should be kept with the other bits stripped off. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 22:15, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disambig</b>: #1 being non-sourced probably needs to go. #2 &amp; #3 should have their own articles. Given that there are c. 20,000 ghits for 'newbank', it's probable that there will be more entries for a disambig page. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH"><font color="green">SkierRMH</font></a>,<font color="purple">07:33, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Because the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_System_b397.html" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a> article is so large and since Newbank can't really be mentioned within the first two paragraphs of <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_System_b397.html" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a>, I don't think a merger-redirect is the best solution. Rather, I would keep the Newbank (bank) article as a stub, until the bank is actually activated, in which case the article could be expanded. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 16:19, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><font color="green">Comment: Per nom, the issue is of notability. Two independent views state a firm delete on the basis of non-notability, and two propose a (weak?) keep on the basis of some degree of notability (the fifth view is from the article creator, whose sole contribution judging by contribution log has solely been to write articles on QuoteWerks and its company Aspire, in the two months of editing history to date. This tends to uphold the suggestions of promotion and COI per nom.) The question then is, whether any contributor to the AFD has provided reasonable evidence of notability. A couple of awards from a trade group <a href="http://www.userschoiceawards.com/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.userschoiceawards.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> are not likely to be notable as the <i>sole</i> basis for this criteria, nor is being a Microsoft partner, having a wide sales net, or being congratulated for being a good integration to some other package especially notable. If there is (as Dogbert01 states) truly a significant size userbase or it truly is notable in any significant way, there would have been serious independent and credible sources able to be cited to support this, and upon citing, others would have accepted them. But none (beyond google which is often as much about marketing as actual importance) were presented to support this view in the AFD by any contributors. Although the 'vote' on the surface was fairly equal, <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">AFD is not a vote</a>, but a process to solicit policy-related points. Looking at the <i>policy-related points</i> related to promotional articles and notability, and the <i>evidence</i> for these put forward in the discussion, the nom seems to be well founded; no significant evidence suggesting otherwise was put forward. If the software in future becomes notable outside its own small circle and its mutually-supporting trade affiliates and relationships, then that would be different. But if that happens there will need to be clear evidence that others can see and agree, to support it.</font></dd>

<dd>Like I mentioned above, "possible". The speedy tags suggested systematic tagging of this record label's bands' articles without even reading them, and then these Afd nominations came equally as fast and as direct copy-paste work: <i>Non notable band, attempted CSDA7 and was rejected</i>. Even <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oren_Ambarchi_b6e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oren Ambarchi">a person was nominated for deletion</a> as "Non-notable band". <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 22:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Systematic without reading? Most of these don't have much TO read! This is the second time today I've been accused of being a bot. I normally don't take offense to things, but this "possible bad faith nom" is not appropriate, especially given the prior discussion that I've had with the user. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 22:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You said that this deletion-tagging for articles related to this record label originated from an IRC conversation. You did not mention why this record label, which administrator proposed such a move and why, et cetera. Tagging any of these band articles for speedy deletion is not appropriate, because releasing albums on that label <i>is</i> already an assertion of notability. I assume good faith on your part, but there are no diffs to IRC queries and I'm not willing to assume <i>blind</i> faith. Considering these circumstances, adding a note about possible bad faith involved was a proper action. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 23:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then what is the proper action for nominating a article for CSD and having it removed? Either prod or AFD right? The IRC isn't relevant to why I'm here (other than a basic starting motivation). I'm here because I choose to CSD these articles and then AFD them after the CSD was rejected. I take full actions for my choices and as such, the IRC is now a moot point. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 23:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In addition, <i>speedy keep</i> is not appropriate since it does not meet the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">speedy keep guideline</a> for the following reasons: 1) I want the pages deleted, I have not withdrawn my nomination, 2) This is not vandalism or disruption. 3) I am not banned. 4) The article it not currently linked from the main page.

<dd>Yes, Afd is appropriate, but "Non notable band" does not say much, especially if it is copy-pasted to over dozen nominations by a script. For example, this band meets #4 of WP:MUSIC, so why is it "non notable"? <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lair+Of+The+Minotaur" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lair+Of+The+Minotaur" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> It does not matter whether you take the responsibility for your tagging/nominating, the fact is someone asked you to <i>target</i> this record label and did so outside Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 01:46, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My original comment stands. Bringing up bad faith is still not so great, even if you preface it with the word "possible." AfDs are FULL of editors accusing one another of bad faith - let's not add to the fray!-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 00:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If an administrator asks a user on IRC to go through a notable record label's bands and tag some of them for speedy deletion, I can see only two reasons for that; the admin does not understand CSD, which is unlikely, or he is not acting in good faith. The circumstances are dubious. 18/29 of Southern Lord Records' bands were tagged, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Obsessed&amp;diff=100708323&amp;oldid=100374426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Obsessed&amp;diff=100708323&amp;oldid=100374426" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electric_Wizard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100709220" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electric_Wizard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100709220" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I'm not a fan of bad faith either, but this is enough to justify suspicions. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 01:46, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A 'guarantee' that in future there will be notability does not therefore make him notable now. There is only one substansive argument for keep advanced by contributors to the debate, namely that he won a national championship (Canada) in one martial art, twice, then moved to a new martial art. No further grounds are suggested in the article. The consensus,although weak, seems to consider this inadequate grounds for notability, and that seems a reasonable and policy-respectful view.</font></dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't know a lot about martial arts competitions, but from the article it doesn't sound like he's competing "at the highest level" in his sport.

<p>Hi there Zetawoof, from the standpoint of someone outside of martial arts competitions it would be difficult to know who Ryan Caligiuri is; however, in the Canadian Shotokan/Kyokushin scene he is a very prominent figure. He was ranked the number kumite practioner at the age of 17 in the City and Province 3 times and was the number 1 ranked kumite practioner in Canada 2 years in a row, in Shotokan. He just recently retired from shotokan to begin Kyokushin, he has told me that he is gearing up for tournaments very soon within the next few months and I guarantee you will find more google resources for him.</p>
<p>I have to say though, that while you google him, I did the same thing. Googling him doesn't do justice, which is why I request that this page stand and I work on it to support Ryan in his endeavours in the world of Kyokushin, kickboxing and martial arts in general.</p>
<p>Please get back to me as I will further defend the initial stages of this article to proceed on to a more in depth piece...Thanks Zetawoof.</p>

<p><s>This is an organisation that supposedly conducts football matches between the "national" teams of fictional or non-sovereign countries.

<li>Err, the whole point of the board is to organise teams <b>not</b> connected to FIFA.

<li>The article states&#160;: "The NF-Board seeks to work with FIFA to be a temporary organisation for football teams before they acquire membership in FIFA." Until such links are made, I am assuming these games are not sanctioned by any officially organising body. I also note that only one of the member federations (N Cyprus) appears to have a Wikipedia article, and that most of the "National Team" articles have also been under AfD. Still a very clear delete in my eyes. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 17:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, I misunderstood "with links to FIFA" as being a member confederation of FIFA in some kind of way. Still, I don't see the point. Why is it necessary for a governing body to be associated with FIFA to be notable in your eyes? What is an "officially organising body"? The NF-board is an official organising body for teams not affiliated with FIFA. And I am not sure how it is relevant that only one of the member federations has an article either. Not one of the regional governing bodies of the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Football_Association_c6f6.html" title="Swedish Football Association">Swedish Football Association</a> has an article, but that does not tell us anything whatsoever about the notability of that association. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 22:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The board and the cup has also had slightly more trivial coverage, but still coverage, by larger papers and media in <a href="http://sr.se/cgi-bin/isidorpub/PrinterFriendlyArticle.asp?artikel=1026561&amp;ProgramID=2327" class="external text" title="http://sr.se/cgi-bin/isidorpub/PrinterFriendlyArticle.asp?artikel=1026561&amp;ProgramID=2327" rel="nofollow">Sweden</a> and <a href="http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2004/08/26/406549.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2004/08/26/406549.html" rel="nofollow">Norway</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> The reference section show independent, non-trivial coverage. The article asserts notability to a small extent, although it could do better in this regard.

<dd>The first reference in the reference section is to a 1990 paper, "Z++, an Object-Oriented Extension to Z", by one Kevin Lano. It's about a <i>different</i> Z++ to the one in the article. The second reference is also to do with that other Z++. The third is about yet another Z++, again not the Z++ in the article. And the fourth is to something written by Kevin Lano, which would strongly suggest it has nothing to do with Zorabi's Z++. The Byte review is of a book by Kevin Lano and Howard Haughton, so, again, it's probably to do with that other Z++, not the Z++ of the article. So, it would seem that <i>all</i> of those references are to do with <i>other</i> Z++s, <i>not</i> the Z++ of the article. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_G_Best_ceea.html" title="User:Simon G Best">Simon G Best</a> 20:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, that certainly makes sense - thanks for figuring it all out. I'm now of the opinion that it should, like you said, be reverted to the version about the Lano's Z++, without prejudice against a creation of a new article on this one if it becomes similarly notable. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon</a> 20:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Author's Response. Mr. Simon G. Best had a disagreement on a point about C++ exception handling, in Google C++ news group. It is a coincidence that I came to this page and saw the deletion notice. I think it is inappropriate for someone to attempt to create pain for someone for a difference of viewpoint in an entirely different context. Perhaps someone with authority should speak with Mr. Best. Zorabi 03:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> The first three cited are not peer-reviewed articles. Byte, however, is a respected professional magazine, now unfortunately defunct. There is thus evidence that the language exists, and that articles have been written about it. How significant ist is I cannot really say. Question--I tried to do a Google search. Quite apart for the 99% of other uses of the term, I can not tell if all the others refer to the same language--my results are on the article's talk page. (I was the one who asked it be deprodded &amp; sent here for AfD to get some more information.)<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s> Keep but Revert</b> I'm the one who nominated this article, <s>and here's why.</s> but I've now found that the article was originally about one of the other Z++ languages. I'm now in favour of reverting back to how it was before the stuff about Zorabi's Z++ was introduced. See below for more on this. Anyway, here were my reasons for nominating this article for deletion:-
<ul>
<li>I first came to the Z++ article because: I wanted to get some idea of the notability of Z++; and I wanted to learn a little bit more about it <i>without</i> worrying about possible bias from Z++'s creator, Zorabi. But what I found, when I read the introduction, was that it seemed to have been written by Zorabi himself. I could tell it just from the style, having read some of the stuff on his <a href="http://www.zhmicro.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.zhmicro.com/" rel="nofollow">ZH Micro website</a>. It really came across as a case of the author promoting his own language. A quick scroll through the article reinforced my impression that Zorabi was the primary author, as did a quick look through the article history. I was left feeling quite unable to rely on the article for an impartial view of Z++.</li>
<li>A bit of Googling revealed about 222,000 hits for "Z++", but many (even most) of them were for occurrances of "z++" in code (without having anything to do with Z++ the language). (Googling for "x++" gives about 1,510,000 hits; "y++" 1,300,000 hits; "n++" 1,960,000 hits; "i++" 15,800,000 hits, "j++" 4,630,000 hits, and "k++" 3,840,000 hits.) As mentioned on the article's talk page (where some other Google results are given), some of the hits are to do with a 1990 paper by one Kevin Lano on <i>another</i> Z++, based on a language called Z. I also note that some of the references at the bottom of the article seem to be to do with that other Z++, rather than Zorabi's Z++. Although it was only some quick Googling, it didn't look like Zorabi's Z++ was particularly notable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, I'm yet to see anything to show that Zorabi's Z++ is notable, and I don't feel able to rely on the article as an impartial, neutral point-of-view article on his Z++ language.</dd>
<dd>Now, the article history shows that, on the 17th January 2006, <a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbowen_d87e.html" title="User:Jpbowen">User:Jpbowen</a> edited the article and added a brief mention of Zorabi's Z++. However, the article was still about the Z++ that Lano wrote his 1990 paper on (<i>not</i> Zorabi's Z++). Then, on the 6th February 2006, an anonymous editor added "A brief intoduction" about Zorabi's Z++, as if that was what the Z++ the article was about. That same day, Zorabi made some edits, and went on to make many more edits, treating the article as being about his own Z++. The anonymous user who made the first edit on the 6th of February did so from 24.23.86.75, and subsequently made some more edits on later dates. That <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.23.86.75_b2c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.23.86.75">anonymous editor's contributions</a> have all been to the Z++ article. From the style of that anonymous editor's contributions, it's clear to me that that anonymous editor is almost certainly Zorabi himself. In other words: Zorabi seems to have 'hijacked' an article about <i>another</i> Z++ in order to promote his own Z++.</dd>
<dd>I am therefore now in favour of reverting the article back to how it was before Zorabi 'hijacked' it. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_G_Best_ceea.html" title="User:Simon G Best">Simon G Best</a> 18:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. Non-notable programming language given the appearance of notability by bad sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article is labeled as biased and not being notable because it was written by the creator of the language. So, who would be a better candidate to take on the presentation of a complex invention that automates distributed computing and mobile agents, among many other things? It will take a few months for a well-educated engineer to appreciate the automations of Z++ and how they reduce the pain of software development. And suddenly you could tell that it is of no value in a few minutes (if not seconds). In order to have an unbiased opinion, should you not know enough about the language so you can indicate some inconsistency, or anything. The reason the presented code looks bad to you is because you are not familiar with its linguistic constructs, and therefore not with their semantics. No one can take a look at something this complex and evaluate it on the fly, unless there is a bias. Finally, I wonder what bothers you from allowing others see for themselves. This is scientific work, not a product. If you think the article needs improvement to reflect that view, perhaps you can help by pointing to certain parts of it, and what you think should be done.

<dd>When it comes to the issue of notability, it's a matter of whether or not it's notable in a relevant sense for inclusion in an encyclopedia. If, as you seem to suggest, you're the only one in a position to write an encyclopedia article about it, it would seem that your Z++ is not actually (sufficiently) notable in a relevant sense for inclusion here. Also, Wikipedia isn't for the publication of original research (but there might be another Wikimedia project that <i>is</i> suitable for your Z++ stuff). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_G_Best_ceea.html" title="User:Simon G Best">Simon G Best</a> 20:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete and recreate the old version</b>. The general rule for notability of programming languages should be that they are actively used by someone else than the creator.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the arguments given in the companion AfD. This list is rather orphaned without its male counter part and there isn't really any good reason to divide this up by gender anyway.

<p><b>Nom</b> - non-notable campus recreation center. An editor claims it hosted an important college team, but that says nothing about the facility itself. If that's its only claim for notability, then relevent details can go in the team and/or school article. The same editor removed the prod, so I'm sending it here for broader consideration. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 21:39, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Hosted the Tigers for close to 40 years, while they competed in the Southern Conference (when it was a major conference) and the ACC. The fact it is now a rec center doesn't mean at one time it wasn't notable. Many other articles on defunct college basketball arenas also exist. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatken4_840d.html" title="User:Patken4">Patken4</a> 21:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Using the logic in the first part of your statement, it would make sense to write articles about the bus they rode in, too. It's just a dumb building that the team played in. So what? The logic in the second part of your argument fails <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 21:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Articles on major sports venues are notable. Articles on buses teams rode on are not. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatken4_840d.html" title="User:Patken4">Patken4</a> 22:01, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - If that's the case, then why isn't this stated in the notability guidelines? The building itself needs to be notable, and it isn't. We don't allow articles on people solely based upon their relationship to someone famous - they need to be notable in and of themselves. This applies to buildings every bit as much. Not every location where George Washington slept is article worthy. Those that are have some other claim to notability - like inclusion in the National Registery of Historic Places, architectural awards, or perhaps they've been the subject of some scholarly work. This facility can make no such claim. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 22:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> I haven't found any notability guideline on architechure or buildings in general. The generally accepted criteria for sports venues, particularly for college venues that host Division I programs from the so-called "Major Conferences", is that they should be included. For example, California's <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haas_Pavilion_51bb.html" title="Haas Pavilion">Haas Pavilion</a> was kept in 2005 based at least partially on the fact it hosted a major college basketball team. This venue, while it doesn't currently host any varsity level teams at Clemson, did at one point and had Wikipedia been around when it was currently hosting the basketball team, would have had an article on it. More about the history of the building should be included, however. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatken4_840d.html" title="User:Patken4">Patken4</a> 23:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Definately not local with the "awards" she has won.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Only 700 google hits for "Carolyn Egan", many of which are for other people with the same name. However, one actual commentary from CBC mentions an award this Carolyn Egan got (no date on the award though). Interestingly, this source talks mostly about how good it is for "behind the scenes" type people to get awards; is it a signal of notability to have a article about you talking about how sad it is that no-one knows who you are? I need to know more before I have an opinion on this, but this article <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick000525.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick000525.html" rel="nofollow">[85]</a> might be helpful. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 07:44, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the second page and farther in the google result pages, there also appear to be a lot of left (listen to what this person is doing!) and right (careful, we've got an activist around) press releases and biased stories about Carolyn Egan's campaign against Steven Harper. I don't know enough about canadian politics to know what's a good source and what isn't, but I'm starting to suspect that there might, indeed, be multiple non-biased sources about Carolyn Egan. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 07:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Please, check out an article before assuming it to be needless: <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Socialists_%28Canada%29_0c1c.html" title="International Socialists (Canada)">International Socialists (Canada)</a> is a most decent quality article that mentions the publication in the <i>intro</i> section. An annual publication is not less notable than a daily newspaper, else we could not keep articles on any one-time events either. Such publications normally have in-depth articles or handle one or a few topics very thoroughly. The number of members of trozkist organizations is typically minute in western countries, but a publication like this is just as typically read by the theoreticians (think-tanks) of the larger left-wing parties, and thus indirectly but sometimes considerably influences public debate. The article at hand is required so as to avoid the forementioned article to needlessly grow, as Wikipedia does not work with subarticles. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_15.html" title="Jan 15">15 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 09:14&#160;(UTC)</span>

<li>Merge it with <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Socialists_%28Canada%29_0c1c.html" title="International Socialists (Canada)">International Socialists (Canada)</a> then. There isn't enough here to merit an article on its own and I see no evidence that the annual has any of the influence you speculate about on theoriticians, thinktanks, or larger left-wing parties.

<p>There is no information on her beyond her name and place and date of birth. The long filmography looks impressive, but in fact it's not clear that she was any more than an extra in most of them (there's another long list at IMDb, but checking the details for individual entries often reveals no mention of her). I think that she's a very small-time actresss, and that either she or someone connected to her (perhaps a fan) has been at work here and at IMDb to try to raise her profile. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, my looking at IMDB showed that she indeed was credited in most if not all of the filmography. I did not see any major roles, though. She looks like a small-time actress who gets regular work, but always with small parts. Most of the roles seem to have character names attached, rather than descriptions; they're clearly more than extras or bit parts. I'm not sure how we treat an equivalent actress in English-language works - someone with frequent appearances but never major roles. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 23:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, my fault — I just looked at a random scatter of entries, and I must somehow have hit those which didn't mention her at all. Still, I think that it's clear that she's not a significant actress, though I might not have opened the AfD if I'd known that she's at last had bit parts (which are often named, unlike extras). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> We can ignore the long filmography list because she is not referred to or linked to by any meaningful page anywhere else in Wikipedia.

There is the writeup on cnet.com, but (1) that is the only writeup offered and (2) it's online, thus not as strong as a writeup in a paper source (because publishing an online article is easier).

<li>Hi: Well, you realize that there is no way of knowing if you are "the nominator" or not. No way to know if you are our late lamented friend User:Crzrussian or someone making silly comments and not having the guts to sign their name. Either way, this was no way for User:Crzrussian to take leave of Wikipedia by taking a pot shot at a <a href="../../../y/u/_/YU_5d2e.html" title="YU">YU</a> (if you don't know what that means look it up) rabbi, and from my past experience Crzrussian has tended to nominate for deletion rabbis from the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism_5da7.html" title="Modern Orthodox Judaism">Modern Orthodox Judaism</a> spectrum claiming "he" had never heard of them, and this may be just another case. Finally, assuming good faith is a two-way street and whoever wrote this article is also deserving of that courtesy and should be asked to give more information and not have the article rushed for deletion as Crzrussian heads for the door and does a disappearing act on us. But the final quote ""sectarian mumbo-jumbo"" makes me think it's not Crzrussian because he knows full well that "sectarian" differences in Judaism, especially the main ones between <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi Judaism</a>; <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a>; <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism_5da7.html" title="Modern Orthodox Judaism">Modern Orthodox Judaism</a>; <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>; <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a> etc are all critically important. If anyone thinks that this refers to "sectarian mumbo-jumbo" they are very obvioulsy lacking any serious knowledge of present-day <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and only make <i>themselves</i> look dumb by leaving such pathetic comments. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 23:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Speedy was declined on grounds that the article does not seem to be blatant spam. I would tend to agree with that statement and there's a distinct possibility that the addition was made in good faith. However, the website (a dating/social networking site for lesbians) seems to come up well short of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Google comes up with tons of hits but that is a bit misleading since these seem to be almost entirely advertisement links. Unless we can obtain reliable third-party coverage of the website, this article should go. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. It may not be spam (though it seems quite spam-like to me) but is definitely a website that does not assert its notability.
