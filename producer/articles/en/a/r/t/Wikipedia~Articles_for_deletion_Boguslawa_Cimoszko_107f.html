<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. I have had to discount comments from a number of new accounts, including comments which include the same formatting anomalies, which heavily suggests sockpuppetry. Even if the comments from these users are taken into account, there is a strong lack of relevant arguments. Factoring all of this in, the remaining relevant arguments from existing users seems to clearly indicate a consensus to delete. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 14:28, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>In addition to my comment above, I would like to add my post from the"Talk" page for everyone to read my reasons why I believe this article should be <b>kept</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the notability criteria are met here still ( <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> ), referring to the 1st 2 points (as they are the only ones that apply here I believe).</p>
<p>"Keeping in mind that all articles on Wikipedia must meet our policy on verifiability using reliable sources, notability on Wikipedia for people is based on the following criteria. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.:" - Obviously her not being a "mainstream" celebrity, such as a pop star, footballer, noble prize winning scientist etc, makes it more difficult for her to fit the criteria... "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1" - EBRD publication referring to her as a Senior Banker at EBRD<a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar/ar91de.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar/ar91de.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>- German language version &amp; <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - English language version.

<li><b>Delete</b> all the article really makes clear is that she is a senior manager for large companies. That doesn't make her notable. What's the evidence that she played a major part in the Polish restructuring in the 90's as a <b>senior banker</b>? What's that even mean? Are there real verifiable accomplishments?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <s><b>DON'T Delete</b></s> This article shows that not only the politicians are responsible for changes in Poland since it broke away from the communist block. This is one of very few articles which mentions a Pole working on behalf of a multinational organisation (EBRD) who had a direct impact on bettering the situation in Eastern Europe, and directly facilitating a coutry's entry into the EU without being a politician. If the current form of the article is found unacceptable, I suggest rewriting it rather than deliting it. <b>Euzebia Zuk</b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Euzebia Zuk (<a href="../../../e/u/z/User_talk%7EEuzebia_Zuk_c4ab.html" title="User talk:Euzebia Zuk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Euzebia_Zuk_82ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Euzebia Zuk">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</dl>
<p>--&gt; <b>answer</b>&#160;:) here is an article in Polish and English about CMS (Cimoszko's firm) in the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Poland bulletin: <a href="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/download/bulletins/2004_03_bulletin.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/download/bulletins/2004_03_bulletin.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Also here is the English language version of the EBRD publication used as a reference in the disputed article: <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. I suppose these can prove notability, and are in English rather than German, so possibly understandable to a wider audience. I also found a mention of Cimoszko's previous firm on a Polish-language magazine website biznesspolska.pl: <a href="http://www.biznespolska.pl/?p=2&amp;companyid=14290&amp;search" class="external text" title="http://www.biznespolska.pl/?p=2&amp;companyid=14290&amp;search" rel="nofollow">[pageno</a>=69#baza_firm]--Abu-Bakr69 21:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Really? The Swiss chamber article is a description of the firm and the polish article is nothing more than a directory listing. So we have established at a business exists. Too bad that was never in question. The EBRD annual report says nothing about anything the subject has done. It says that she is a senior banker. That was never in question. The question is whether unbiased sources exist that say that the subject has done X or accomplished Y. Nothing has been presented. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 22:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--&gt; I believe so, also if you look at the firms listed in the Swiss Chamber, you soon realise that they are quite prominent indeed: <a href="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/act/pokaz.php?co=memb&amp;jak=k&amp;act=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/act/pokaz.php?co=memb&amp;jak=k&amp;act=all" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. e.g CMS Proalfa is preceeded on the list by Cigno Consulting, and itself preceeds Credit Suisse. The article about CMS listed in the Swiss Chamber has to be objective, as it isn't in the Swiss Chamber's interest to boast about some firm which is not even worth boasting about. Furthermore, I believe also Zoominfo (which states her involvement in e.g. Eastern European reconstruction, or talks about her setting up the East European operations of UBS) is objective/ unbiased as it is neither Cimoszko's (ex-)employer, or her own website, but an independent database of information about bankers and financiers. --Abu-Bakr69 16:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
