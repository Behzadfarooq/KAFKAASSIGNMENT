<p>Wikipedia editors are not supposed to make the news. This term is a very non-notable neologism, and the contents of the article only a matter of speculation among Wikipedia users about an ongoing demonstration in Minsk following the March 19 <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_presidential_election%2C_2006.html" title="Belarusian presidential election, 2006">Belarusian presidential election</a>. As far as I can tell, the term traces its way back to an article by <i>Independent</i> reporter Andrew Osborn. <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article350098.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article350098.ece" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The speculation of a single reporter, and perhaps a handful of other commentators, however, does not make an encyclopedia topic.

<li><b>Keeep</b> I am sorry to comment that this time normally very knwoledgeable <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">user:172</a> is mistaken. The term is in use in Russian language since October 2005. It is not a "single reporter". I added russian language names. Unfortunately I have no time to do proper research and write a decent text. However please let me note that the very fact that Belarus President <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukashenko.html" title="Lukashenko">Lukashenko</a> himself used the term (BEFORE the elections and recent demonstrations) makes it notable. See my comments in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelarusian_presidential_election%2C_2006_43be.html#Colour_Revolution" title="Talk:Belarusian presidential election, 2006">Talk:Belarusian presidential election, 2006#Colour Revolution</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Right now I added a reference to the original event that gave rise to the term (and Rusian/belarusian terms, for google search). I am sorry I didn't do it earlier.

<li><b>Delete</b> Belarus election riots gets many thousands of ghits, this gets about 500. It looks very much as if either the term has not yet made it into the English language media, or it's a localised neologism. No dispute that the riots took place, but we have not yet seen much in the way of credible evidence that this is what they are generally called. Articles which are "useful to counter speculation" almost invariably violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (a soapbox).

<li>You are not reading carefully. The term is not confined to "these events", if you mean the post-election rallies. In fact, this part of the article must be severely trimmed (done). Also you are forgetting that English language does not rule the whole world. this term is notable locally in Belarus; even Belarus President uses it in his speeches bashing the opposition. Wikipedia is not only for American <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">porn stars</a>, you know. As for English language media, they prefer the term "denim revolution", which is related with this idiotic fixation on "color revolutions" and loses all associations with the word <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeans.html" title="Jeans">jeans</a> in Russian/Belarusian culture. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:46, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mikka's points are well taken. I can't read Polish, so I have not been able to follow coverage of the protest in Poland. Still, this is the English language Wikipedia. It concerns me that English-language media outlets are still not using the term. <a href="http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?p=%22Jeans+revolution%22&amp;c=" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?p=%22Jeans+revolution%22&amp;c=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I still think the contents should be merged with <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_presidential_election%2C_2006.html" title="Belarusian presidential election, 2006">Belarusian presidential election, 2006</a> rather than be contained in the self-standing entry on a neologism. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 05:21, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>English Wikipedia does not mean English-centric Wikipedia. If something outside the sphere of the english-speaking world is notable, it should always be included. (It can be verified by people who know the language in which it's usually written about.)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Dont merge, dont delete!

<li>Wikipedia is not a forum for human rights groups and other advocacy groups, even if the cause is a good one. No matter how much some Wikipedia users want to promote a "Jeans Revolution," the term is still a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. A good standard for determining whether a term is a neologism or a real movement recognized by the zeitgeist of the English-speaking world is checking to see whether or not the <i>New York Times</i> has mentioned the term. So far, the <i>Times</i>, along with just about all other major media outlets in the English-speaking world, has not used the term. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=%22jeans%20revolution%22&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=%22jeans%20revolution%22&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Let's please resist the temptation to make the news. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:26, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Haha! Read <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>. The English-speaking world is not the benchmark for what should be included in a Wikipedia!&#160;:-) I think we agree on most points, but please, dont pretend that people citing HR groups are POV pushers for that agenda. Notable HR groups as Amnesty International or HRW are also simply sources for notability of such a term, just like you cite the Times. For arguments sake, if the term is widely used in German, Polish, Belarusian and Russian media, but not in English media, would it be notable enough? My answer would be hell yes.

<ul>
<li>When it comes to naming, the English-speaking world is indeed the benchmark for naming of articles on the <i>English</i> Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> lays out a set of guidelines under which "article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature." Thus, I would still prefer to redirect the article to a page like 2006 Belarusian post-election protest while the term "Jeans Revolution" is establishing itself in the English-language media. Regarding your point on human rights groups, I think that overall news agencies striving for objectivity are better guides for naming than activist groups, although material from human rights groups certainly ought to be cited. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 13:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your mixing up two questions. Question one is whether this subject should have its own article. My answer would be yes. Question two is what this article should be called. Jeans revolution seems uncommon as of yet in English media (though not elsewhere). We could rename it to say, Jeans Campaign (as used in <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/62999.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/62999.htm" rel="nofollow">this Commission hearing</a>). Still, the term may be much more neutral, but is used even less in both English and non-English sources, so I'm not sure if its a good idea. Still, just because the name may not be notable, does not mean the topic is not notable.

<li>Keep. As per Mikka and JJay the subject is very notable. If you search for "джинсовая революция" (best not in google but in a Russian language search engine, e.g. yandex.ru) you'll also find a lot. As pointed out by Boud there are a lot of articles in Polish, also. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a></sub> 08:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Another comment</b> As Mikka points out, since the Belarusian, Russian and Polish press all using the term to a certain extent, I am downgrading my opposition to this article. Nevertheless, I still hope that this AfD nomination serves to provide a caution to Wikipedia editors that the subject is a neologism, and clearly not at this stage a topic that, say, a historian can classify as a real "revolution." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:50, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As any historian will tell you, the naming of events is central to the interpretation of the events being named. And naming is often very political. Americans, for example, are very familiar with the dispute over the naming of the American Civil War (aka the "War of Northern Agression" or the "War Between the States"). Regarding the topic of this article, while no one can deny that there is currently a demonstration in Minsk against the outcome of the election, the idea of a "Jeans Revolution" may be a mere slogan, and not a real "revolution." Currently there are only around 700 demonstrators in Minsk. The protest has been dwindling since Sunday. <i>Since then, each evening has seen a progressively smaller gathering -- 5,000 on Monday, 3,000 to 4,000 on Tuesday. The hardcore group spending the whole night outside however rose from 300 to 1,000 on Tuesday.</i> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060323/ts_afp/belarusvote_060323111428" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060323/ts_afp/belarusvote_060323111428" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> So Lukashenko might be able to ride this protest out. (Personally, I hope not. But I'd bet on that.) At any rate, there is certainly room for disagreement on the question of whether or not the events taking place in Belarus are a "revolution." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 13:33, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm tempering my opposition to the article. Nevertheless, there are still some real concerns here. Reporting a current event is not the problem per se. Naming and framing the scene of a current event are huge issues in interpretation, which are of concern to an encyclopedia striving to be written from a "neutral point of view." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 17:16, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>172, you and me are on the same wave here. Let me repeat that it was me who nominated the previous version of this article for deletion, because it was really preposterious in 2005: it was not at all sure that this neologism would survive. Please pay attention: the term is not about a single "current event": the word "revolution" is kind of misleading here. Initially this guy with denim shirt in the air suggested the term <b>"jeans resistance"</b>, which would have been more correct. But the "peer pressure" (to say it politely) replaced it by "revolution", which is definitely way above the heads of belarussian opposition. Still, after the recent events the term generated enough buzz to warrant an article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:23, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand your point. You've helped to clarify the issue. By keeping the subject of the article focused on the term, as opposed to the "current event," you've gotten the subject out of problem territory.

<li>I'm unfamiliar with that "clause." I guess someone could argue that it is a corollary of "ignore all rules" and "Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy," which are established policies. At any rate, I'll let other editors hash out that debate. Nightstallion is correct that the nomination doesn't have "a snowball's chance." Nevertheless, in this case, the discussion stemming from the AfD discussion here is helpful and relevant. While I've started to agree with Mikka's point that the term has "generated enough buzz to warrant an article," the boundaries of the subject in an article on a neologism are often very murky. For now the AfD has been serving to help us clarify them. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 19:39, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

In local poetry, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornflower.html" title="Cornflower">Cornflower</a> is the national symbol of that country alluded to by the protesters, not denims. Please be cautious on relying on political commentators alone, for obvious reasons. Finally, there is no revolution unless the regime is actually toppled, which has not occured. (whether you are expecting it or not) I agree 100% that Wikipedia does not make the news, it only writes verifiably the notable events that reporters write about.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Students in the US have been participating in this jeans revolution as a show of solidarity with Belarusian students. Someone in Washington organized the making of a giant denim flag to send to Minsk, and students at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, painted squares of denim which were added to this flag. Today (25 March) we have asked the entire student body to wear jeans and join us in carrying a large white-red-white flag around the city. We have also participated in the candle memorials on the 16th of the month--please see <a href="http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html" class="external free" title="http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html</a> and scroll down.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, this is what the revolution in Belarus is being called (though it was Cornflower before the elections). With the mounting protests in belarus taking place now, I have no doubt that this revolution attempt will go on for a little while.
