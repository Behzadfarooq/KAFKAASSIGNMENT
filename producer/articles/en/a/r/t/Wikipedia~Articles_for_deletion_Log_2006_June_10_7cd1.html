<p>This page is completely original research and self-reference.

<li><b>The alexa rank of metawiki is not 600</b>. Alexa considers *.wikimedia.org to be the same site, so for example all traffic to *commons* is included in that number. Also, upload.wikimedia.org is included, so it's an excersise for the reader to determine why wikimedia.org doesn't have a rank as high as wikipedia itself. Metawiki is actually very low traffic. I'd highly doubt that it would cross the 100,000th point on Alexa by itself. The varrious funraisers logos and such which are pulled from wikimedia.org sites by the wikipedias are what causes a lot of this number. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ameta.wikimedia.org&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ameta.wikimedia.org&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">quick google search</a> shows that meta is almost entirely unlinked outside of Wikimedia sites. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the entity is notable then it shouldn't be difficult to find notable (not some random Wikipedian/Wikimedian's blog) non-Wikipedia sources to verify everything that's discussed in the article. But I really don't think that Meta-Wiki is an encyclopedically notable site. It's notable to Wikipedia, but not so much to the general public (which is what the Wikipedia namespace is for). And since as far as we know it hasn't been reported on in any notable source, anything that anyone writes there is gonna be ORIGINAL RESEARCH from their experience with Wikipedia/Wikimedia. On the other hand, if a newspaper was to interview a Wikipedian and report on it, then we could turn around and write about it and cite them. That's at least supposedly the standard for the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, but for some reason those rules are being ignored for all the peripheral Wikimedia-related articles. And it violates NPOV for Wikipedia to hold its own projects to a different standard than those of others. So for all those reasons, it's pretty clear it should be deleted from Wikipedia (and moved to a Wikipedia namespace project page if need be). <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment RE: Alexa and IAR</b>: Its supposed Alexa ranking was cited, but that raking was misleading, as Alexa gives the same exact rank to a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdomain.html" title="Subdomain">subdomain</a> as it gives to the main domain. So meta.wikimedia.org <a href="http://alexa.com/search?q=meta.wikimedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/search?q=meta.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> gets the same exact rank as wikimedia.org <a href="http://alexa.com/search?q=wikimedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/search?q=wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also, User:Zoz cited some other Wiki-Media project website articles, but if some of those are just original research and self-reference, then I think they should be deleted too. I think there's a very strong case for keeping the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, as Wikipedia is a major website which has recieved extensive media coverage and can thus be written citing those sources. The same goes for any other Wikimedia website where notable sources have written about it which can be cited. Someone said that it should be kept on the basis of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">"Ignore All Rules,"</a> but I don't see how violating self-reference, original research, and NPOV - to include an article about a site which hasn't been shown to be encyclopedic - benefits Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 18:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I will not stand by idley while it's being cut down but it's own rules. It's extremly important because it is the project, and the project, last time I checked: is relevant. I am keeping the overal aestics of the site up by ignoring the rules, since the rules would kill Wikipedia, and creating one massive downfall.

<dd>wm.org probably doesn't link to meta because it's solely for project coordination, not education, and so most people won't need it, and the ones who might want to go there know how.

Googlebombing does not increase a site's Alexa ranking, as Alexa rankings are based on the amount of visitors to that site (which they measure using their toolbar).

<dd>You still haven't shown how Meta-Wiki meets <i>any</i> of the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Has the site "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself"???

And is Meta-Wiki "distributed via a site which is both well known <b>and independent of the creators</b>" (Wikipedia is well known, but certainly not Independent of Wikimedia). And finally, WP:WEB notes that "Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article."

But that's assuming Meta is under Wikipedia in the hierarchy. However as the name suggests, Meta is contains <i>meta-content</i> so it's rather the parent of Wikipedia than it's child.

(If a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdomain.html" title="Subdomain">subdomain</a> is notable then the whole <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_name.html" title="Domain name">domain</a> is; if the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> is notable then <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">it's inventor</a> is etc.) --<a href="../../../z/o/z/User%7EZoz_d0ff.html" title="User:Zoz">Zoz</a> <i><a href="../../../z/o/z/User_talk%7EZoz_2d49.html" title="User talk:Zoz">(t)</a></i> 20:45, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The analogy fails. If Wikipedia is the building, Meta-Wiki is at best the scaffolding, not the architect. Theory of relativity is to Albert Einstein as Wikipedia is to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, not to Meta-Wiki. "Meta-things" do not automatically inherit the notability of the things themselves; there is no stipulation on Wikipedia's notability or verifiability guidelines saying such, and common sense suggests that "notability isn't inherited" is indeed a correct and necessary thing to keep in mind in this situation, just as much as it is for any other ("a certain lavatory of the White House" does not inherit the notability of "the White House"). To meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, citations are needed (and, obviously, ones outside of the site itself!) to confirm its notability. Why should we hold our sister-sites (more like estranged-crazy-aunt-sites?) to a <i>lower</i> standard than we hold other websites? If anything, we should hold ourselves to a <i>higher</i> standard, to circumvent <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self-referential</a> bias. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:55, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I used analogy only to prove that "meta-things" of notable topics inherit notability. I didn't mean to relate Jimbo to Albert or anything&#160;:D. The point is that Meta stands higher in the hierarchy than WP, <i>even if WP is far more notable in itself than Meta</i>. --<a href="../../../z/o/z/User%7EZoz_d0ff.html" title="User:Zoz">Zoz</a> <i><a href="../../../z/o/z/User_talk%7EZoz_2d49.html" title="User talk:Zoz">(t)</a></i> 21:05, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But it <i>doesn't</i> stand higher in the hierarchy, in any meaningful way (i.e., in any way that relates to notability at all). And I specifically demonstrated why your analogy fails to show why notable topics <i>don't</i> inherit notability, not to relate Jimbo to Albert either. The notability of an article must be established <i>in its own right</i>: simply saying "Meta-Wiki must be noteworthy because Wikipedia is noteworthy" is weak reasoning. If it's as notworthy as you imply, it should be fantastically easy to find reputable sources galore to add to the article, and then the issue will be settled. As of yet, that hasn't happened, so notability hasn't yet been established to a sufficient degree to merit an article; try harder. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 21:11, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think anyone who has become involved this discussion is seriously contemplating the complete removal of the information from this site. The question is rather: what would the best place for this material? In it's own article? Merged into another article? In the Wikipedia namespace? Maybe a merge and redirect is the best option, but <b>merge and redirect do not require an AFD.</b> At the very most one would start a discussion on the relevant talk page—and possibly not even that. Suggesting that the article should be merged or moved is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but <i>creating the AFD in the first place</i> looks very much like it.

<li><b>Keep or Merge with Georgia Tech article</b>. MaxVeers shows that the information in the article IS verifiable via the official Institute website, making arguments for unverifiability rather moot. Further, while ANAK may be somewhat non-notable on a world scale (since it is unique to the Institute), it IS rather notable among Tech Alumni and affiliated persons/organizations/businesses, which at least makes a case for the article to be merged, if not just left alone.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 06:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was it wrong for the Boxer Ali to believe he was the Greatest? As even Wikipedia explains to all who reads Muhammad Ali (b.January 17, 1942) born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky, nicknamed "The Greatest", is a retired American boxer. He is considered by many to be the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, as well as one of the world's most famous individuals, renowned the world over for his boxing and political activism.Frederick Percival</p>

<p>There comes a point where one may be caught up in argument so as to attain all his freedom. I am one. Are there any pages in Wikipedia, which support "one" so as to establish right and truth? No, there is not. I desire to give understanding. I seek only to establish both right and truth. But if you do not believe, then in the words of my brother before he was hanged on a cross, "I have told you openly the truth and you have not believed" he also stated when he was before Pilate, "You have no power unless God gives it to you, therefore it is God who has the greater sin." Pilate so no wrong doing in Jesus yet delivered him over to the people to crucify. Some of you may well indeed continue to seek "Deletion" the truth of this page and its establishment for both liberty and freedom in the Name of Jesus Christ for civil communities of the United States. My prayer and plea to any who would support the cause of freedom and liberty is to allow what may and will come from such my history of the course of my life supporting said values""fwp333""</p>

<dd><i>sigh</i>. Sad (if valid) but these should probably all be AfD candidates as too tactical in nature to be encyclopedic. It would be almost comparable to having pages called, "Road accident deaths in the U.S. in 200#". (42,884 in 2003, dwarfing anything in this little conflict.) Tragic, but most are non-notable except at the local level. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 01:35, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep but change radically</b> As I see it, this content basically should exist since they contain information not listed in the main article(s). However, they are not articles per se, they are lists which should support the main article. I'd suggest merging all these articles into several "List of violent incidents in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during XXX" where XXX is one of several clearly defined timeframes. As to POV issues, IMHO the main article Terrorism against Israel is itself inherently POV as a stanbda alone article. Such pages MUST be clear subpages of a neutral page like <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. And Terrorism against Israel does not make this clear. I'd suggest creating an info box used to navigate the whole conflict, thus ensuring that all pages are easily accessible from all others. But, of course, once this is done, nothing is wrong with listing every incident. OTOH, there is no reason to list just those incidents aginst one side. So my vote is <b>merge everything to Violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict XXXX</b> (creating new ones as needed). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 12:46, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not sure what to do with this one. Roberts once owned the land that the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmer_House_8045.html" title="Palmer House">Palmer House</a> was built upon.

The article does not contain a single assertion of notability; subject was a minor officer in the Mexican-American War, and owned some land that was later used to build a well-known hotel. (I'm even dubious about that; if he owned 160 acres in central Chicago in the latter half of the 19th century, he probably would have been the equivalent of a billionaire; if it was in the early 19th century, he has no connection except fortuity to the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmer_House_8045.html" title="Palmer House">Palmer House</a>.) <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:15, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Couldn't come up with any news articles using Lexis Nexis.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The notability criteria for this person do apply - significant contributions to several fields in his country. It's not cool that smaller languages/cultures get less prominance on the web when compared to English/American, but if Wikipedia does not work around that sort of (unintended, but real) <b>bias</b>, who will? For example, Macedonian language has 2 Mil. speakers, English up to 500 times more; Macedonian WP has about 7K articles, the English WP around 170 times more. Do the people who are prominent within their community have to achieve same level of prominance in the English-speaking world to be listed?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Why another <i>keep</i> if you're the same person&#160;? As for the "bias", I don't know if it's not "cool" that smaller languages/cultures get less prominence on the web, but it certainly is natural, why would 2 million people get as much prominence as 500 millions&#160;? Now *that* would be some bias. Finally, I don't see this person being prominent within Macedonia either. Active yes, but prominent&#160;? What kind of name recognition does he have in Macedonia&#160;? <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 17:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry for the <i>keep</i>, heading, I changed it to update if that's more appropriate for such an entry - if I attempted sockpuppeting, I would not disclose anyway, and would just pile up more "votes". Please be tolerant - I am learning the WP ropes as we talk. About the cultural bias, representatives of those 500 millions do get prominence. It's hard for small cultures to present their heritage outside their own community. For example, I bet the % of Albanian, Armenian, Serbian, Estonian... Catalan books translated into English is far smaller than English books translated into those languages. If you read Macedonian newspapers, you'll get more "information" about Paris Hilton's breast, than about local archeological discoveries, for example. This particular case is covered by the following <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">WP criteria</a>: contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field (software dev.); holding national office and influence on legislation (National Strategy); opionon maker receiving significant press coverage - a significant portion of articles dealing with information society in the Macedonian national media (press and TV) include his opinions. For instance, check out the <a href="http://media.a1.com.mk/members/kategorija.php?id=11" class="external text" title="http://media.a1.com.mk/members/kategorija.php?id=11" rel="nofollow">webcast of talk-show Chumu</a> on "Why Macedonians don't use the internet" (28.06.2005) on the website of the most popular national TV, A1.

<li><b>Comment</b> I saw someone deleteing it some time ago, and s/he should have, it was unreadable. But I've heard of the club and felt that the club was notable and created a new article pointing out the notability of the club (which the previous deleted article did not). Unfortunatly all the information on the club, that I could find, was in Spanish <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSD_Saprissa" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSD_Saprissa" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and I don't know the language well. In retrospect I belive I must have confused it with a club from Costa Rica (<a href="../../../d/e/p/Deportivo_Saprissa_5f06.html" title="Deportivo Saprissa">Deportivo Saprissa</a>). Since a Guatemalan wants it deleted, I'll trust his knowledge more than I trust mine on the issue, also the es.wikipedia.org article is taged with an {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">Importance</a>}}, maybe someone with an account there could list that article for deletion. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/i/v/User%7EEivindFOyangen_8646.html" title="User:EivindFOyangen">ivind</a><a href="../../../e/i/v/User_talk%7EEivindFOyangen_a46e.html" title="User talk:EivindFOyangen"><sup>t</sup></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_EivindFOyangen_607b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/EivindFOyangen"><sup>@</sup></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EivindFOyangen_8edc.html" title="Special:Contributions/EivindFOyangen"><sup>c</sup></a> 21:50, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I suspect that this article is a hoax. Aside from the terrible writing and spelling, I note that no sources are cited. The result is allegedly to appear in two journals. The first, Reflections, does exist but it is not a mathematics research journal. It is about mathematics education. See <a href="http://www.mansw.nsw.edu.au/members/reflections.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mansw.nsw.edu.au/members/reflections.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mansw.nsw.edu.au/members/reflections.htm</a>. The second title is in garbled French and not identifiable. Furthermore, I could not find either of the putative authors of this result by using Google - I question whether mathematicians by these names exist. Googling "Sheldrick's root" turns up no references other than to this Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillposer_1189.html" title="User:Billposer">Bill</a> 05:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, and also delete every band linked to on Esotype, and also delete Wall With One Side and Miracle Vs. Man</b> Aside from AfD pages, the five bands that come up when you hit "What links here" on the Esotype article are the only five articles that link there. If you look at the bands linked to on the Esotype page, it's quite obvious that all of the articles were written by the same person (and, of course, looking at the edit summaries confirms that, in fact, <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercurious_db67.html" title="User:Mercurious">User:Mercurious</a> has <i>never</i> made an edit that was unrelated to Esotype). All of the pages are advertisements for Esotype, as each of the bands' articles basically talks about how incredible the label is and how the all formed <i>because</i> they were big Esotype fans. Of the five bands, only Ethan Durrelle doesn't completely and utterly fail the Google test ("Tambersauro", "Wall With One Side", and "Meryll"+"Esotype" each with less than 300 total and less than 60 unique hits). The same parameters hold for "Esotype"+"Houston". "Miracle Vs. Man" gets only 19 total and 11 unique hits. While "Ethan Durelle" isn't quite as poor, with 11,700 total and 190 unique hits, it isn't particularly popular, either. <i>None</i> of the articles assert even the <i>slightest</i> amount of notability. The articles basically just say, "This band exists, it's on the label Esotype, and... the band exists." Ethan Durelle is the only article linked to by <i>any</i> non-Esotype article on WP, and its only other link is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christian_rock_artists_7e05.html" title="List of Christian rock artists">List of Christian rock artists</a>, which really doesn't count. So let's add this all up... advertisement, failure of Google test, no intrawiki links, absolutely no asserted importance... yeah, that's a delete. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is not a very well written article by any means; there's a certain style of Islamic articles, especially bios, that read in this tortured way. But they can be improved, it's a stylistic flaw not substantative. However, I have heard of (and skimmed a couple times) the column “Ask the Imam” for Beliefnet.com, written by Khan. I'm certain that column had a readership well over 5000. That meets the "author test". Moreover, the article at least claims that he was a co-founder of a notable university, which seems to easily meet the "professor test". Please, closing admin, don't close this as delete with so few votes... either let the article improve under "no consensus", or at least extend the AfD to get more input. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 06:47, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is there some chance that he is actually notable? Seems like there is potential since he was involved in Scouting as early as 1914, however, it is not documented. Could be the Indian equivalent of James E. West for all we know.

<dd>Posted a message on Arzan's talk page. Seems common courtesy to notify editors of afd. Good practice for the person afd'ing to do this themselves. <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 16:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, on the second line, the author does say so, just no documentation or specifics. I agree that an article that makes such a bold claim MUST include verifiable information. All I am saying is that the author should be given at least a chance to clarify and expand. If he cannot or chooses not to, then action (probably delete and merge) is warranted. At a minimum, someone should have posted a note on his talk page, don't you think? --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 16:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's highly POV.

There are thousands of great unit-level Scouters. There's nothing in this article nor the homepage that makes him standout and meet notability standards. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 20:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's exactly my point. There's nothing in this article that makes him notable, but that doesn't mean that this guy isn't notable. IMO there is some suggestion in the web page that this fellow may have been influential in expanding Scouting in India. Let's give Arzan a chance to edit and expand the article before we make that decision. It seems that I prefer to reserve judgment until I see what Arzan knows. Lack of poor writing isn't an excuse for afd, but rather an excuse for help with the writing. However, if there really isn't anything to this, then let's happily leave it in its current status in the Scouting in India article. <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 21:44, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Overall poor quality (though that's fixable); uses private blogs as sources; classic example of original research. If you read the reference to what Lind says about 5GW, it's apparent that him not thinking it has happened yet is a gross understatement - he doesn't believe we've even scratched the surface of 4GW yet. Given that the entire generational warfare paradigm is Lind's creation, we should go only by what Lind says about the fifth generation: Simply, it's the hypothetical next generation. Since that tells us nothing encyclopedic, there's no point having an article on it at all. (What would be a point on having an article on the year 2007 if all it said was "Next year"?) ---<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrLeebot_fec7.html" title="User:DrLeebot">DrLeebot</a> 16:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC), comments edited by self 13:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Fix it</b> Poor quality. Although the article uses sources, the use is primarily in links to those sources without a quality overview of the theories being expressed by those source. Lind is not the only author to have published on generational warfare, although he created the concept; as with most theories, others build upon it. Not sure that any blogs are really private, since most are quite public, but am also not sure to what degree these sources may achieve a status of reliability. Gravitons also are only hypothetical, but they warrant a Wikipedia article. The concept of gravitons has some basis, however dismissed by others, and the concept being addressed by the linked sources also has some basis. E.g., the recent purported document seized in al-Zarqawi's safe house clearly shows thinking in line with the theories being linked (<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/06/15/D8I8LJBG0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/06/15/D8I8LJBG0.html" rel="nofollow">document</a>) (not that anyone would know this from the bare article being discussed), but it is an approach to warfare that was not addressed by Lind's 4GW model. The problem with this article is that the arguments against the subject as well as the theories themselves have been largely ignored, i.e. have not been provided with sufficient depth for a casual reader to understand what is meant by the title and subject of the title --CurtisGaleWeeks 05:18, 17 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>I'm sure that this portion of the crystal ball policy will be cited by all individuals presenting a 'keep' vote. However, the fact is that this article has almost no content in it, and thus, "only generic information is known" about this "individual item from a predetermined list." Existing referenced and supported information about season three is adequately being cited in <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>, and once more specific, non-speculative information is known about the specific episodes of season three — which, given that the next season doesn't premiere until October, could be a number of months from now — the article can be recreated. To paraphase the policy I reference in my cite: "'Lists of episodes of 'Lost' is encyclopedic; 'Episodes of Lost (season 3)' is not, even though it is virtually certain that a third season of 'Lost' will occur in ABC and will have episodes." —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;•&#160; 16:08, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>While the article currently has little info in it, who's to dictate that it isn't a candidate for improvement when the information arrives? A huge percentage of articles start out as a stub, of which you could classifiy the list as a stub. Thus if anything this should be kept and allowed time to improve. Don't forget, although Season 3 doesn't start until October, information will probibally become avalable in the next few months as of to the nature of the first episode, and there might be pre-Season 3 episodes like there was for Season 2. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 21:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An event about which little or no information is currently known should not be included, even if it's "notable and almost certain to take place." Should we have an article on the death of each and every current living celebrity? Without some amazing advanced in medicine, they're all almost certain to take place, and will be seen as notable by plenty of people.

As stated at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, <i>"Before nominating a recently-created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape."</i>--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notice that the example used in support of deletion is 'Tropical Storm Alex (2010)', I find this to be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguement. There is only a weak analogy between a Tropical Storm in 2010 and a season of <i>Lost</i> that is (1) a few months away and (2) which information may become public before then (e.g. a list of episode names). Lastly, I visited the 3rd season episode list to find out what character backgrounds would be explored in the 3rd season, and so seeing that there is little info about the episodes has been informative to my purposes. Lastly, and here is my analogy, many movies have entries long before their release and sometimes before they begin production (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_11_2164.html" title="Star Trek 11">Star Trek 11</a>).

<li>It's not season three <i>itself</i> that's in question, it's the episodes within it. All we know about season three is that there will be one — just like all we know is that there will be a Tropical Storm in 2010. Once we know verifiable info about it, fine, recreate it.

<li>I don't see anything that's speculation or crystal ball at all. It's been confirmed that the first episode will air on October 4th. We could even create an entry for this episode if we wanted, but since we don't know anything about it, it would just look messy. We also know that the episodes will air in two blocks, a six episode block and a seventeen episode block, according to the official podcast. Also according to the official podcast, there will be a "mini-cliffhanger" at the end of the six episode block. This is all verifiable information with citable sources. None of it is speculation, and it all concerns the episodes within Season 3. --<a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlfin_e857.html" title="User:Kahlfin">Kahlfin</a> 03:43, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> It is unnecessary for a nominator to repeatedly respond to contrary opinions expressed during an AfD discussion; it makes the nom appear to be argumentative, rather than letting editors make up their own minds as to whether an article is appropriate or not for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The only content in this article will be speculation and will only exaggerate whatever little info the producers and writers will give out.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think it is unfair of you to keep repeating that this article is all "speculation" when the author of the article has repeatedly defended the information of the entry. You may complain that it is not enough info to justify an article on a future event, but just because something is in the future does not make all information about it speculation. Secondly, an editor with their own interests and time ought to concentrate on whatever they want. If the article violates wikipedia policy (which it argueably does) then it ought to be deleted, but if you think it is just a person's waste of time then that is no arguement against it. People edit wikipedia not for money, but because of a passion they hold for some specific set of topics; to belittle what topic a person decides to edit is to lose sight of how wikipedia itself functions. All that being said, your last point of the info being useless until October is a valid objection to make but ultimately one I think is incorrect (as I argue in my vote to keep, above).

<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</a> The article is merely a list of title translations, and no precedent for this type of article exists for other movies.

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>. Translated titles do not need their own pages. Also, maybe not every title need go in there. For example, the ones that are translated directly from English and have no changes in meaning or additional subtitles could be summed up in a short sentence with one or few examples given. The ones that do have subtitles, alternate titles, or mistranslations should be included. GassyGuy 18:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> A list of title translations is not exactly encyclopedic. For example, do we also need to list the titles of every Shakespeare play and what they've been translated into, too? There are already Brokeback Mountain articles in other-language Wikipedias; I think that's sufficient. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 13:17, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Since this is the English-language Wikipedia, it doesn't matter what things were translated into, unless there is something notable about it (like how movie titles sometimes get translated into wacky things in other languages). If there are foreign-language articles on Brokeback Mountain, link them, and then people can see what it was translated into. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 17:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional keep</b>. Last two times, I voted 'keep' unconditionally. There is undoubtedly a subject matter, connected to a product of note, and is a term that would be recognised by many thousands of people. Notwithstanding my support for its continued existence, it requires some changes: deleting the section called 'the phrase' (or changing it beyond recognition), writing it in a manner more accessible to non-C&amp;C players, and providing better references than those already there. If those things are done, the article's quality will improve dramatically, and I suspect that the number of nominations for deletion will dry up. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin</a> 09:25, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, this is a tough one for AfD. Articles is about a "rare" (that's an understatement) sexual "fetish" as the article puts it. See for yourself. Beyond my feeling that the subject is wholly inappropriate on wikipedia (but <a href="../../../w/h/a/WP%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_95f8.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not censored</a>), the subject strikes me as unencyclopedic due to it being rather obscure (again, an understatement). Note: Wikipedia has an article about <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">Autofellatio</a>, a fact that may be relevant here. I also suggest reading <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a> purely for information. <b>Warning, the picture linked at the bottom of the article is *very* explicit</b>, click at your own risk. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 17:28, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm curious about a whole lot of things here, and then I find all these people trying to take it away (no offence). If you find it offencive, do what others have done: put up a warning!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quote from the article provided by GassyGuy - <i>"Bennett has spent the past six years at the NBC affiliate in Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo, California at KSBY-TV as the top rated sportscaster in the market according to the Nielsen ratings. Before that Bennett was working for the NBC affiliate in Oregon as Sports Director. Bennett has also hosted several sports talk shows over the years with such stations as ESPN 1280 and Sports Radio 570AM. Bennett has also provided play-by-play for several fight promotions over the years such as K-1, Rumble on the Rock, World Extreme Cage Fighting, IFC and a number of professional boxing events with the most recent show being seen on HDNET in the United States. Bennett has also worked for the Ultimate Fighting Championships ("UFC") as an in ring reporter for UFC shows 33 to 40. Bennett is also a founding partner in MMA Weekly.com which is regarded by many to be the number one news source on the World Wide Web for mixed martial arts fans."</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The UFC, K-1, Rumble on the Rock, WEC and IFC are some of the highest profile events in MMA. Bennett's site, MMAWeekly.com, one of the highest-profile and most active MMA news sites and he broadcasted the popular and regularly-cited daily internet radio show "Sound Off" from that site, alongside fighter and broadcaster <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Trigg_19b8.html" title="Frank Trigg">Frank Trigg</a>. WikiProject Mixed Martial Arts are in the process of compiling a list of fighers, promoters and other MMA figures who are notable, and I guarantee you Ryan Bennett would have been on that list whether he died or not, alongside perhaps half a dozen other broadcasters. It's no exaggeration to say he was watched and listened to daily by significant numbers across multiple forms of media. And, sad to say, his death has not hurt his notability; high news presence will bring more people here to search for his article. — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 08:14, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for clarifying all of this. I found a lot of information, but because I really know nothing about this field, I could not make a strong judgment of notability and that sort, so I initially went with a weak vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Mixed martial arts has quickly established itself as one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Ryan Bennett is highly regarded within the mixed martial arts industry as one of the top five most influential individuals in the sport. With his work at KSBY-TV in California as a sports anchor, Bennett used his position to help solidify credibility for the sport in a more mainstream forum, beyond that, he pioneered the application of daily news coverage to the sport and co-founded the premier news-related website in the world for the sport, MMAWeekly.com. At MMAWeekly he also pioneered the first and only DAILY mixed martial arts internet radio broadcast. As mentioned, he has been a broadcaster/commentator for nearly all of the leading mixed martial arts promoters around the world. Bennett's influence on mixed martial arts and his ability to provide credibility by bringing professional news coverage to the sport cannot be measured. Bennett's influence touched many, many people in this world both in and out of the sport of mixed martial arts. He will long be remembered for his influence and will be an integral part of the history books that will be written about the emergence of mixed martial arts and if that isn't notable enough to be included here, I don't know what else the man had to do.

<dd>Comment: the music notability requirements state that if the artist has two or more commercially released recordings and has conducted a national tour, they're notable. So you're incorrect in stating that the use on NPR is the only point of notability for this group; it is one of at least three, and thus the question is moot. Why not stick to our own rules here? In any case, you shouldn't be in the business of trying to remove/censor clearly valid content from Wikipedia; why not create some of your own articles instead?

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. There are a large number of new users, and welcome to all of you, we're glad you are here and hope you choose to stay and contribute to our encyclopedia. In fact it was just such a discussion that got me hooked on Wikipedia, believe it or not... and it's great fun. But most of the commentors did not address the issue with the article, that it does not establish notability for a general interest encyclopedia such as this one. The longer time users all have concurred with this, and even though numerically the Keeps (not DO NOT DELETE!) have it, we don't count noses, we operate on consensus weighing the arguments and inputs given. This article is a clear delete on that basis, in my judgement. I think that some small portion of this article could be merged ito the school article and would be happy to userify it if requested. <b>Delete</b> --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Although Supercow does pertain to one specific department at one specific school, it is a source of pride, entertainment, and humour at schools across North America (let alone Canada). The reason for this importance, isn't just in its entertainment value, but also in how well it symbolizes the school spirit that so many engineering schools attempt to foster. Much like the Red Suits at McMaster, the Cannon at U of T, and the Tool at Waterloo, Super Cow symbolizes not just the sprit of a single school, but also the enthusiasm many have for engineering as a whole. Furthermore, SuperCow is regularly used as an example within provincial levels of engineering student societies, and internationally. The similarities between UofG's Supercow and Wisconsin's cow at the US national engineering conference were also a topic of discussion. Merging this article into a parent article would be detrimental to the subject material, because the concepts of engineering spirit embodied by suprcow transcend the subject of a single school. Rather than suggesting deletion, I think we should be pushing the original author to update the article to reflect reality a little more. <a href="../../../j/b/f/User%7EJbfung_0d1c.html" title="User:Jbfung">Joseph Fung</a> 19:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Engineering in Canada has a long history of traditions and symbols. This is also applicable to the various student organizations across the country that help to promote engineering and serve engineering students. Supercow is quite possibly one of the most recognized symbols throughout student engineering, alongside many othe symbols listed above. In fact, supercow's visibility is not just constrained to Canada, but is also recognized in the United States (through the auspices of the National Association of Engineering Student Councils) and Europe (through the Board of European Students of Technology.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Supercow is a symbol of the dedication/bull headedness needed to be an engineer. He is frequently abducted/imperiled and mus tovercome many troublesome situations. In other words, he represents the student experience to a T. While an iconoclast may point out that the grounding of ideas or attributes to a physical object inherently warps them, it also true that a totem such as Supercow allows students at U of C engg to identify with the aforementioned virtues in a tangible way, without getting lost in abstract discussions on philosophical underpinnings, as has been known to happen. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.56.86.20 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.56.86.20.html" title="User talk:142.56.86.20">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.56.86.20_387a.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.56.86.20">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Originating from the University of Calgary, Supercow is constantly travelling amoung engineering schools across Canada. Last year she spent most of the year in Eastern Canada, touring a number of engineering schools and starring in her own video. Merging with a school page is inappropriate, though I agree the history, pictures, and video should be elaborated on this page. Supercow is notable amoung a vast number of engineers across Canada. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Skovmose_da6e.html" title="User:Mark Skovmose">Mark Skovmose</a> 20:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> Being one of the co-founders of Supercow, I have a soft spot for this mascot. I was fortunate enough to have it accompany us on its first trip to a national conference, and we proudly displayed Supercow whenever we could. Somewhat surprised by the attention he was getting, students from across Canada began placing their school stickers on Supercow. He became an instant hit at the conference, with schools trying to claim him as their own (all in friendly fashion of course). It can be said with pride that I was among some of the first few to take Supercow on its first adventure, and it is amazing to see how far it has travelled and how much recognition it gets. I think it would truly be a shame to lose a piece of Engineering Pride across Canada by removing it from Wikipedia. More exposure to this mascot will only accompany more a sense of belonging as Canadian University student, and explain to those inquisitors exactly the signifance of Supercow. - Simmer <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Simmer2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simmer2_22e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simmer2">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Expand</b> The article in its current form only mentions supercows existance which is not significant enough to be an article. However if its history once provided and expanded shows that supercow has been involved in events which are relavant to undergraduate enginneering students in general it becomes a notable mascot. As there are about 48000 engineering students at anyone time if this mascot has been involved significantly accross canada I would consider it notable.68.147.36.105 -Greg</li>
<li><b>Strong Do Not Delete</b> Many special interest articles exist on Wikipedia that would only appeal to a very specific audience. Just follow a few links under art, literature, or any specific branch of science to see what I mean. The idea of "non-notable" is purely subjective, and, as can be seen from this discussion, Supercow is not "non-notable" to a significant number of people. I would argue against merging this article with the school's article, because the two topics are quite separate from each other. If the concern is about the substance of the article, the best solution would be to close this discussion so that the many willing contributors can be expanding and refining the article as opposed to fighting to keep it from deletion. It would be against the spirit of Wikipedia to delete an article to which there is an interested audience and willing contributors. Zuluct 17:15, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete but Expand</b> This article is not about a mascot for any particular school, but a mascot for tens of thousands of engineering students across Canada. Surely it would be a misrepresentation of the subject matter to hide this away in a mostly unrelated article, aside from the fact that this happened to be the school that began a nationwide tradition. That being said, I believe more detail on the actual mascot is required in order for this article to convey useful information, but deleteing it will most certainly not accomplish this. Secondly, the number of previous edits a user has on wikipedia really has no bearing on the validity of their opinion. Many users view wikipedia articles but do not edit, and these people have equally valid opinions as to what sort of articles are useful and interesting to the users of wikipedia. <small>—The preceding comment was added by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristanJ_f58d.html" title="User:TristanJ">TristanJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETristanJ_8762.html" title="User talk:TristanJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TristanJ_b7f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/TristanJ">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> I'm new to Wikipedia, but I think the article should stay. "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia. ... Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. <u>Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</u>" This article was written by one who is completely unknown to Jeff Lindsay (by his own admission). I myself have never spoken Mr. Lindsay. I do know, however, that Jeff Lindsay's work with regards to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is known to thousands of people. Many people, not just members of the LDS Church, use his work which is indexed at his site. He has several standing articles listed on LDS.org as well. I often find myself discussing Mr. Lindsay and his work on a weekly bases. I believe he is notable enough to deserve an article. He has been spoken about even by high members of the Mormon Church and has held the office of Bishop within the LDS Church, himself. I’ll agree with anyone who says that the article should be expanded, but to delete it would be wrong as well. If this is incorrect, or if I have stepped over my stewardship, then I apologize and figure this will get deleted, but I say expand the article and allow it to stay, or maybe move it to an appropriate LDS page? In fact, Mr. Lindsay is probably the most well known one man website apologetic.

<li><b>Fix/Keep</b> the Cortana Letters are of immense importance to the Halo and Marathon communities, and thus I'd hate to see them disappear entirely. Likely, this article just needs to be fixed. Original research ruining it? We'll get rid of it. Too textbook? Let's turn it into an article instead. Forcing a Keep/Delete/Merge just seems like an avoidance of the underlying issue- regardless of where it goes, this article has to be fixed before it can be sent anywhere. Fix it first, then talk about what we do with it once it's clear what should really stay.

I would suggest, since you claim to be agreeing with TruthCrusader, you demonstrate that you understand what you're agreeing to by ANSWERING the very simple question of why "[t]his entry is of IMMENSE importance to the Halo and Marathon communities", and why such pointless eye-glazing fancruft (assuming that it really is of IMMENSE importance to the Halo and Marathon communities) belongs in a general-interest encyclopedia? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why did I single you out? I guess because of your generally belligerent tone (once again demonstrated with your newest comment), lines like: "more fact-free spittle from the inaptly named TruthCrusader", and hostile vocabulary ("fit for the bit bucket", "gibberish", "ranting", "pointless eye-glazing", etc.). These discussions are not meant to be outlets for aggression. There is also no requirement for the kind of gutter brawling that is all too often demonstrated on AfD.

They also demonstrate Bungie's strong ties to their community, they may have been a relatively early if very primitive ARG (see talk)... how about the note that certain lines from the Halo 3 announcement trailer are directly taken from the Cortana letters?

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey guys, still working on things here. Please don't take this article as some kind of attempt to blatantly advertise Amie Street, because that is not my intention whatsoever. The reason I started the article was that we've been getting a lot of interest in the company over the last few months. What I really think makes Amie Street notable is the pricing system I detailled a bit on the talk page. Although its a pretty basic concept (supply and demand duh), its an innovative approach tp pricing when it comes to selling music. So please tell me, hwo can I make this better so its not deleted and adds to the community? Thanks, <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas%40AmieStreet_2104.html" title="User:Lucas@AmieStreet">Lucas</a></li>

<p>A Google search for "Manhattan North" turns up a lot of results, but it seems they all refer to the police precinct or the book of the same name.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Replace with article about NYPD precinct grouping</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> (or replace with article about a more relevant usage as noted above). As far as I'm aware, the normal local term is "Uptown", with "Downtown" referring to the opposite direction.

Just because it survived afD last time doesn’t mean that its notability was established.</p>
<p>During the last debate, I was not aware of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and therefore did not bring it up in the debate. I apologize for that; I was still learning Wikipedia at the time and in fact I am still learning it, and probably will not have the full hang of it for another year or two, but I am definitely learning.</p>
<p>Regardless, there is nothing in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> about the number of hits a web site gets; therefore the argument last time that it has a 15,000 or whatever ranking on Alexa is entirely irrelevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you believe it should not be deleted, then please point out examples of mainstream publications that have covered DVDR - i.e. magazines, newspapers, periodicals, etc. I am not aware that there are any, meaning that per Wikipedia policy this article should be deleted.</li>

Last debate, a few users were not so civil and as a result the discussion ended up going south pretty fast.</p>
<p>With all due respect to them, none of the writers from DVDR - be it Schneider, Rasmussen, Sweetser, or anyone else - has in any way significantly impacted the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>--i.e. like a Scott Keith or someone like that.

<p>Specifically, it must meet this criteria:</p>
<p>Web specific-content<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.
<ul>
<li>This criterion excludes:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">online stores</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This criterion includes <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>

</li>
<li>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The article itself <b>must</b> provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an <i>entire</i> website meets the notability criteria, its <i>components</i> (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</p>

<b>STRONG KEEP</b> I am only going to say this once: JB you are wasting everyone's time with your obsession to get this article deleted.

<p>Another user - User:Dustinroolez - added a prod tag to this article and listed it on AFD, without creating the AFD discussion page. I switched the prod to an afd and created this discussion page as a procedural nomination so that the AFD would be properly formed. As for my opinion on the matter, the only hits are from Wikipedia ... so this may be a hoax ... I vote <b>delete</b> unless someone can show that it isn't. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:15, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not believe this article was intended as a hoax, however it is in my opinion a non-notable neologism and one that really is not in common use. Acting roles are played by multiple actors all the time, it has been common for decades, and most audiences can cope with it without too much trouble. I can see this article becoming another horrible list type article where, because the inclusion criteria is vague and cannot be verified, people go in add all their favourite pop-culture items which can then never be deleted because who can say with any authority what should and shouldn't be allowed? User:Dustinroolez created the article himself so if the deletion procedure wasn't properly followed that's probably just an honest mistake. <b>No vote</b>. Format 23:40, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe this is a valid subject, whether it be named "Sargent York Syndrome" or something else. I've heard it referred to as "Darrin Syndrome" or as something similar. Bear in mind, people on the 'net who are probably likely to use the term are not likely to spell the names correctly (users on movie forums are not exaclty known for great spelling; just a side note), ie: "Darren" is a more common spelling of the name; also "Sargent" is more than likely to be spelled "Sergeant," so a Google search may not be decisive at first glance. Anyway, his college professor taught it, so it must be somewhat verifiable. Just my "two cents." <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 03:29, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b>. It should be Darrin Syndrome. People talk about Darrin Syndrome. Recasts on other shows constantly get compared to the Darrin recast. In fact, there are plenty of cultural references to it, like when Becky got recast on <i>Roseanne</i> and the characters talked about the Darrin recast. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 20:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The recast of Darrin on <i><a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a></i> was itself notable, and that can be, and is, mentioned and discussed on the <i>Bewitched</i> page.
