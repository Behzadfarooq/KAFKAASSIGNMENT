<li><b>keep</b> This term is in common use in the conspiracy community. I suggest that the concept needs to be addressed and that if the objection is the term itself, then the article may be merged into a more general conceptual article and forwarding simply provided. Conspiracy theories themselves need to be very carefully vetted here to make clear that they are not the opinion of one person and they are not presented as fact. However, the methodologies of corrupt national administration are largely known facts and have every right to be documented without regard to the debate about which leaders in which countries employ them and when. - <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_Harewood_3e61.html" title="User:Greg Harewood">Greg Harewood</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable neologism. Even if the phenomenon is real or even widely imagined enough to be notable, <i>this</i> specific term (problem-reaction-solution) is as far as I can see only used by a single uninteresting conspiracy theorist and his epigones. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_Esperanza_9f0d.html" title="User:Bucketsofg/Esperanza"><b><font color="green">ets</font></b></a><font color="grey"><a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucketsofg_e5d0.html" title="User talk:Bucketsofg"><b>ofg</b>✐</a> 02:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</font></li>

<li><b>keep</b> The most that might be wrong in this article is perhaps an implied bias against the Bush administration. But nowhere is the Bush administration, or even the US government directly mentioned in the article. Informative, regardless of whether or not the <b>title</b> is a neologism.</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Interesting &amp; plenty of references ... maybe could use a clean-up, but I don't see why it should be deleted (P.S. I was linked here from /., and I don't have an account, but I don't think that should negate my opinion entirely ... I have made at least 50 constructive edits under this IP ... one of these days I'll get around to making an account.) 24.7.106.155 02:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep?</b> Good topic, bad article. Suggest the NPOV flag. Ztras 02:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Good topic. The whole point of Wikipedia is for good topics to have improving content over time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.231.15.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.231.15.247_8191.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.231.15.247">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is an undignifiable argument of obvious bias and paranoia. Appears to be just a rant. Topic itself lacks foundation to merit an article.

If someone thinks there is a more appropriate title, then (s)he should suggest it. Regardless of my 'keep' opinion, I agree with some others that the article could use editing to sound less shrill and more in line with Wikipedia's trademark objectivity. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Smotricz_2994.html" title="User:Carl Smotricz">Carl Smotricz</a> 11:34, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs a lot of work, but defintely without doubt keep. Needs to include both seeing every real problem (not just manufactured problems) as an excuse to implement actually irrelevent measures (that may or may not be <i>believed</i> relevant) as well as seeing the problems that are created by irrelevant measures as <i>further</i> problems to be solved with even more extreme or comprehensive irrelevant measures of the <i>same</i> type. (As an example, suppose this were true: Homelessness means we need drug laws. Drug laws create more homelessness. Means we need stronger drug laws. OR Terorists attack. Means we need to increase our military presense in islamic countries. More terrorists attack. Means even more military presense is needed. ) <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, neologism by Alex Jones. Slashdot comments (especially ones which use Wikipedia as a reference) are not sufficient evidence of notability. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Or move into a discussion of group dynamics. I'm not sure the ghetto of conspiracy thinking will encourage quality here. This is a well understood tool in some management circles. I am more familiar with "manufacture a crisis" or "precipitate a crisis", but those phrasings fail to articulate the hidden agena at work. Michael Buckley 21:32, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> neologism. Widely used in small circle(particularly one prone to self-propagandization on wiki - see socks) is not notable. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 06:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Doesn't seem POV to me (in the current state at least), it doesn't state any opinion except when quoting one as such.

<li><b>Keep</b> As references (and Slashdot attention) show, what began as a neologism by David Icke (not Alex Jones) has spread into the mainstream media and mainstream consciousness, to the point where someone might want to look this up.
