<p>Unreal Tournament mod that doesn't appear to be particular notable. Its sourceless and googling doesn't bring up any <i>reliable</i> sources.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as one of the "resident experts" in the DJ/Rave field on wiki, I believe this band passes our notability criteria with flying colors... Per WP:MUSIC:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Has had a charted hit on any national music chart.
<dl>
<dd>Has charted several times on BBC Radio 1.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This one is hard to respond to because most people wouldnt consider even the largest selling Drum and Bass labels "a major label" or "important indie label" however they are signed to, and have had tracks published on one of the larger US and one of the larger UK DnB labels (<a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Renegade+Hardware" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/label/Renegade+Hardware" rel="nofollow">Renegade Hardware discography</a>, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Human+Imprint+Recordings" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/label/Human+Imprint+Recordings" rel="nofollow">Human Imprint discography</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>

</dd>
<dd>6. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.

Unless someone is seriously contesting the <i>existence</i> of this school, I cannot see why the sources used should be a serious issue. (Dividing schools into "notable" and "non-notable" based on whether a newspaper has or has not happened to write something about them is a poor practice, which is the very reason I have disputed the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guideline.)

<li><b>Keep</b> I added an external link to the Great Schools Web site. Since every or nearly every high school, at least in the United States, has its own Web site with information on the school, and since the Great Schools Web site has information and individual web pages on all or nearly all high schools in the country, you can <b>always</b> assume that a U.S. high school has at least two sources of information on it, plus whatever you can dig up on Google, Google News and Google News Archives. In addition, with the "No Child Left Behind" act, state departments of education are increasingly posting statistics on high schools on the state DOE Web sites. That should be enough notability for all public high schools in the U.S. It is hard for a public U.S. high school <b>not</b> to be notable by Wikipedia's definition. I think the only reason to redirect a high school article is lack of interest by editors in building up the article and letting the article become a vandal magnet. I argue <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">here</a> that all high schools are inherently notable. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> on the Great Schools website. As Noronton says, it lists essentially every school. The information it lists is posted by the school, and the word "great" in the title is an obvious misnomer. It is therefor an uncritical list, and inherently trivial, and cannot be used as a RS for any purpose. Ditto with DOE Websites: they list every school. Noronton argues that this makes all schools notable. I'd say that this is just about as notable as the mere listing on Amazon makes a book notable. They are both indiscriminate lists. The listings on these sites are trivial in the WP sense. Now, if something in such a listing is truly noteworthy, and confirmed by independent sources, that is another matter. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contains speculation, original research, non-encyclopedic, makes many claims not atributable to anyone. It was originally an article called "The Dirty Dozen" which was a made up term nobody uses and gives no sources for such a term. It also violates guidelines for living persons. Also uses weasel words. It also not a person, place, thing, or specific event requiring an entry into an encyclopedia. It is also redundant, and serves no purpose.

<li><b>Keep</b> Reading the talk page, this series of articles evolved from a single article on human rights in Iraq; a decision was made to split them up. It would probably be a bad idea to merge them back against the wishes of the editors. The POV of the article could certainly use improvement; a comparison of human rights in SH's Iraq to rights in other Arab/Muslim countries of the time might be instructive, for instance. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These are good points, but even though there are obvious chronological reasons to split the topmost article this way, it also results in a quasi-POV fork, with the pro-invasion group editing this article and the anti-invasion group the other, both seeking to prove their convictions correct. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The rightness or wrongness of the U.S. invasion isn't going to rest on human rights violations (other factors are involved: whether the invasion works in accomplishing various goals, whether the costs outweigh the benefits or vice versa, whether the invasion had to be done to stop Saddam's regime from using or getting WMDs or being or becoming a base for terrorists -- all sorts of reasons were given by Bush and others for the war; even bringing democracy to Iraq isn't quite the same issue as how bad the human rights record there was). And there's nothing inherently POV-forkish about separating the vast subject of Iraqi human rights violations into regime periods, since the situation obviously changed with different regimes: Before Saddam human rights were in various states; during Saddam's regime that regime was responsible for a certain level of human rights; after Saddam responsibility shifted elsewhere. The subject naturally divides that way. There is no inherent contradiction in one article describing the Saddam regime's human rights record and articles that describe human rights before or after, and no benefit to combining them that I can see. There is, without a doubt, plenty of sourceable information out there. The subject of the article is too important to delete. Too bad it hasn't been cared for better. The best argument for deleting, to my mind, is that the article shows no promise of being well-edited, despite it's importance and appropriateness.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>He was certainly no Boy Scout, but compare for instance the violent suppression of revolt in Syria (involving thousands of deaths), the actions of the army in the Algerian civil war in the 90s, Morocco's actions in the Western Sahara, Turkey's behavior in Turkish Kurdistan, and so on. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, but his actions occurred in an area of the world where Western-style human rights are not generally respected, and it is fairly common for governments to use force, sometimes brutal force, to suppress opposition, especially from minority populations. We should view him in context. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Several reasons, such as its branch from the founding by an award winning author, its several conventions, and its history. This article also inherits the notability of the SFLIS (unless we create an article about them and sub Mindbridge there??)

<dd>"Science Fiction League of Iowa Students" brings back even fewer returns (37 unique on 54 total) than does the Mindbridge Foundation. Had Haldeman actually *founded* this group, that might be one thing, but according to your text, his only connection is that he taught a class that some of the people that *did* found the group attended, plus they named it after something he wrote. How exactly does that confer notability on either the SFLIS or Mindbridge? Again, without reliable third-party sources to back up any of this, it's a *very* tenuous claim, at best, and I remain unconvinced. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 04:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your first <a href="http://www.dmsfs.org/dmsfslinks.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dmsfs.org/dmsfslinks.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> is nothing but a page full of links, and proves nothing about the Mindbridge Foundation.

You'll also note that I'm not using the low number of Google returns as the sole basis of my decision - I'm using the fact that very few, if any, of them are from reliable sources.

<dd>To quote from <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>: "A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability ... Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found." Lots of outfits hold conventions, and as far as Joe Haldeman goes, notability isn't contagious. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So let me get this straight: you're saying WP is biased <i>toward</i> books and <i>against</i> music?!? That's simply absurd. In fact, if anything the opposite is true. For example, looking at Barnes &amp; Noble's current <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/bestsellers/bestsellers.asp?CAT=914093&amp;srt=S&amp;z=y" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/bestsellers/bestsellers.asp?CAT=914093&amp;srt=S&amp;z=y" rel="nofollow">top selling fiction books</a>, only 2 of the top 5 have articles, wheras 4 of the top 5 in B&amp;N's top music list do.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hardly a great list, but dates and redlinks save this from being entirely redundant with a category. The redlinks should be in the article space and not Wikipedia space, because if someone searches for "Russell Braddon" without any clue to who this person is, they should at least be given a search result (hope our search function is working) to this page where they will at least find that the person is an Australian novelist. It is sparse info until we can get a full article, but I think lists in article-space (viewed by many) are more fertile breeding grounds for new articles than a corresponding list in Wikipedia-space (viewed only by members of the Australia or literature WikiProjects). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as there cannot be any reliable reference for the list. That means it attracts marginal cases and vanity edits.

<li>Grouping by time doesn't make a difference to <i>my</i> opinion. It might for others.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Such condescension here! "This noble creature...". For good or bad, notability needs to be established. I'm sure Joseph's art will out-live me.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Despite the fact that Joseph is not well-known enough to have been published, possibly due to him being homeless and poor, this page should be kept up in a visible location long enough for others to find and update it. Can it be moved so that it is found when "Joseph" is searched, thus giving visitors the opportunity to fill in needed details, such as reputable sources, more life information, etc? I am OK with it having a disclaimer warning that the article is up for deletion, but please at least let it be found so somebody may provide more information if possible. This is an entry that is so far out of the realm of "Google," so please bear with it. Thank you.</li>

<li>Ahahaha. See, here's the thing - DBZ will never even be able to compare to the popularity of Star Wars in any scenario. Star Wars is so unbelievably, immensely popular that someone made a Star Wars Jedi training school in Romania. All DBZ has is people putting on big plastic hair and fake Karategi and yelling Kamehameha. Ask someone what "The Force" is, chances are that they will know. Power level?

<li>No, it's barely notable in the series. It's a simple plot device to say who's stronger than who, used for only one and a half arcs. Nothing would be different without it. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>The difference</b> between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Force_%28Star_Wars%29_f4bd.html" title="The Force (Star Wars)">The Force (Star Wars)</a> and Power level (Dragon Ball) is "The Force", like the rest of Star Wars, is culturally significant while "Power Level" is not. You can see references to the concept in TV, films and music. There's books on the philosophy behind the concept and its parallels to different religions. And, more importantly, there's documentation of Lucas' inspiration for the concept... Not so much on "Power Level," is there? So, it isn't really fair to compare the two.--<a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohansen_aed8.html" title="User:Nohansen">Nohansen</a> 20:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I can't believe I'm defending Dragon Ball. The concept is important enough to Dragon Ball to warrant a seperate article. The article implies there's an "official" book detailing this stuff, and the other information is taken from the manga or anime directly. Therefore, I think the article is sourceable and the OR can be gotten rid off, and the speculation can be hacked out. It's a cleanup case, not a delete case, let's give the kiddies a chance to fix it.

<li>don't take this personally but thats just rediculus base stats of pokemon are completely random.

<dd>Ok let me explain this to you. many charecters like <a href="../../../n/a/p/Nappa.html" title="Nappa">Nappa</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeza.html" title="Freeza">Freeza</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Ginyu_b35c.html" title="Captain Ginyu">Captain Ginyu</a> cannot sense KI/Chi so they have scouters that let them see how strong charecters are via numbers. These concepts are interwoven with Ki/Chi MAJOR AND KEY concepts to Dragonball and Dragonball Z and GT. You also state that the list of Power levels should not be there. thats like not listing how fast a rocket can go (given that the number is recorded) or how many episodes are in an anime. Its not mega important info but at the same time it is not info that no one cares about it is enyclopedic and factual not a bunch of fanon garbage. The Daizenshu in fact consulted Akira Toriyama on the stuff they put in there it wasn't a bunch of Japanese Fanboys who decided to make a dragonball Z book.

<dd>did you just totally ignore the 7 lines of text up there?

<dd>A CONVERSATION ABOUT POWER LEVELS IS NOT IMPORTANT. And no, we should NOT list them for the sake of completeness. Under your logic, everything that ever existed or ever could exist should be listed simply to make Wikipedia complete. So what, if there were no power levels, Vegeta would have killed everyone and Freeza would rule the universe and destroy Earth before Buu or Cell could become? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Where are the reference or sources, besides dc company?, and somebody wrote that the force was explaining by George Lucas and has a book and everything, Who anyway can prove that the force exist? its all fictional, if this page was made in Japan i bet nobody will suggest to delete it as nobody would touch Planet Kripton from superman.</li>

<li>Well, I believe this article should exist in it's entirety (with some obvious cleanup).

<p>This is a game guide article that is much better suited for a gaming/fan wiki. Explaining how to play each and every mini-game isn't a notable subject for Wikipedia. It should be noted: many of these Mario Party lists were in AFD about a month ago (with a result of no consensus).

<li>No, personally, I don't like it, but that's not a reason, I'm fighting it, beacuse *I actually think that the article's existence is in accordance with wikipedia policy.

<li>What policy suggests that we should have a list of levels or mini-games?

<ul>
<li>okay, I'll say it again. I believe this article should stay, because it is a notable topic that could contain encyclopedic information. Because the article can contain (potentially encyclopedic) information that doesn't fit in the main article. Also, precedence is more along the lines of <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">WP:WAX</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/WP%7EALLORNOTHING_ed9c.html" title="WP:ALLORNOTHING">WP:ALLORNOTHING</a>.

<ul>
<li>Did you even read the links you just gave? Those aren't policies. Those aren't even guidelines. They're essays created by Wikipedians. You've more or less agreed that the article in its current state is not encyclopedic. So how many reasons can you give to say that Mario Party deserves a million lists of mini-games teaching people how to beat the mini-games, but no other mini-game game can have one? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't believe that the article in it's current state should be nominated for FA status, but that doesn't mean that it should be deleted (see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). I think that the article has potential to be a great article, if people will put some time into it. I've put more time into rebutting your concerns than fixing the article, and I've made it better. But there's still room for improvement. Yes, things from <a href="../../../a/t/a/WP%7EATA_2c1b.html" title="WP:ATA">WP:ATA</a> are essays. But they're good ideas. I think its funny that you're criticising me for quoting essays (after you did first from that page), when the effect of my statements is "lets stick to policy." <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not going to say that there shouldn't be an article on the "list of levels in SM64". I think that if SM64s page got large and there were encyclopedic information to be place there (and I think there could be), then there should be an article on the list of levels in sm64. Why should there be a list of mini-games on wikipedia? Because there is potentially encyclopedic information about these levels. Like maybe what people think of certain video games, or <a href="http://www.drinkinggamerules.com/view_game.php?id=563" class="external text" title="http://www.drinkinggamerules.com/view_game.php?id=563" rel="nofollow">which games make better drinking games</a>, or awards, or novel uses of the controller to do things in strange ways, or which ones <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mario+party+blister" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mario+party+blister" rel="nofollow">give you blisters</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This can easily be described on a gaming wiki, but in my opinion people are just being difficult and demanding it must be here. It's cruft, plain and simple. As A Link to the Past has said: it's not encyclopedic, and is similar to articles on levels. Wikipedia isn't a place for game guides, and that's what the mini-game articles are. Even if they are purely just listing the games: it's still listcruft. Take Monkey Ball and Rayman as recent examples: both had list pages in AFD, that were deleted. Does anyone have the links for them? If those can be found, it's proof this type of content isn't wanted here (except by a few users). Also: these list pages stem from a major conflict at the talk page of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_8_eafa.html" title="Mario Party 8">Mario Party 8</a>. The majority were against listing each and every game in the article: so a few users decided to just make these list pages with little to no consensus. I think the logic of "it's not wanted in an article itself, so branch it off to a list page" is a bit of bad faith. Users failing to understand the majority doesn't want it, is simply not helping Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia doesn't exist to make your life easier. Its sole purpose is to be encyclopedic.

<li>I wasn't very clear before. I meant to say not that its hard to find this content, but it's hard to source the article with reliable sources. Sourcing Wikipedia articles is hard (particularly when there isn't a search term that doesn't include 9 sequels).

<li>Articles get deleted if they can't be sourced. And I want it deleted because the content is of no worth. IT IS GUIDE CONTENT. For the love of God, what about that do you not understand? There is precedence to NOT have articles like this, there is absolutely NO precedence that suggests otherwise, and throughout this conversation, you've been waving around the "people like it" flag but never actually explaining why this is encyclopedic!

<li>Yes, Articles get deleted if the <b>can't</b> be sourced. This AfD has shown that the article <b>can</b> be sourced. Precedent means nothing. Lets stick with policy. And I have been explaining why I think it's encyclopedic. and I have helped the article to make it more encyclopedic. Also, I've said before that there's nothing inherently unencyclopedic about levels. It's possible that the levels in SM64 were encyclopedic at it's AFD. That doesn't mean that all levels are unencyclopedic, or that minigames are unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 18:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what policy do you use to defend this article's worth? What one says that the only game in the world that can have a list of levels/mini-games on Wikipedia is Mario Party? Seriously, I am sick of this. When will you explain to me why this article deserves to be on Wikipedia SO much more than List of (insert any game in the world) levels/mini-games? No other game series has such lists. NONE. Absolutely none. And yet, of course, for literally no reason whatsoever, THESE 8 mini-game lists are magically notable. There was no reasonable consensus over its creation, just a small group of people agreeing on it with no input from anyone else. Rayman RR's list of mini-games wasn't notable. Super Monkey Ball BB's list of mini-games wasn't notable. Explain to me why the List of MP mini-games is different. Explain to me why telling people the objective of every mini-game in the list is necessary. What encyclopedic value does this have? WHAT? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

There is a different hypothesis different than the one you're proposing -- maybe all those other articles were deleted because no one actually considered policy, maybe no one cared enough to do any research on whether articles had been written about them, maybe they didn't actually have articles written covering them. <b>Precedent means absolutely nothing</b>.

<li>When you haven't shown why this list of mini-games is particularly notable, or why it is necessary for it to be on Wikipedia, the fact that every other non-Mario mini-game list has been deleted from Wikipedia means EVERYTHING. If you can't show that it deserves to be on Wikipedia more than those deleted articles, under what argument do you vote keep? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have shown how it's better. On several occasions here, and on the articles page and on the articles talk page. <b>Because articles have been written about them, because some of them gave rise to a class action lawsuit (which spawned several articles)</b>. Are you not reading these statements I keep placing on this page? I've said that it's encyclopedic. The minigames were notable enough to warrant a class-action lawsuit (and articles have been written about that lawsuit). Is this not enough for you.

<ul>
<li>No, the design of a mini-game causing damage to peoples' hands and thusly resulting in a law suit does not make the mini-games notable. That's the silliest notion I've seen today, that because people sued over damage from playing certain mini-games warrants that a list of mini-games be made for them. Mario Party 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4, none of those have this problem. So why are they notable? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off, I would like to thank you for actually discussing the reasoning. You seemed to have missed that for the past dozenish posts. So, I think the information about the blisters is encyclopedic. In fact, you even seemed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_minigames&amp;diff=116806661&amp;oldid=116806105" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Mario_Party_minigames&amp;diff=116806661&amp;oldid=116806105" rel="nofollow">imply that you supportted it with a caveat that has since been met</a>. What would you qualify as encyclopedic information? Could you tell us why you think that it's silly? We hear about lawsuits about several other products, and those get put into wikipedia. Soemtimes the lawsuits themselves are enough to bring an entity to notability. Also, I merely presented blisters as one kind of information that could be encyclopedic. You challenged that one, so I showed an article, then you challenged how it didn't list the games specifically, so I found another source which did list the games individually, and you were silent on that issue for quite some time, now you're saying it's silly, and that seems to be a very subjective perspective, so I'd like more clarification. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 22:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So hey, guess what? We don't make articles on Magnetix's individual pieces just because they got sued over them. Similarly, Mario Party is notable for getting Nintendo sued over it, not the content of it. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>that's because there's nothing else to say about the pieces individually. Many of the minigames in MP have been mentioned in articles. Also, several of these minigames could be notable for other reasons, It's hard to come up with criteria for a game that I'ven't ever played, but in other minigames games, the minigames could be notable for being the first time two people shared a single controller, or maybe it's notable for being the first time a controller is used as a lasso. There's a bunch of thigns that could be said about these minigames. I don't think there's anything particularly notable about the levels in SM64, and people don't write about the levels much in articles, but because of the unique nature of minigames games, people talk about the minigames themselves a lot, particularly in a game review. Some of those mentionings might be trivial, but others won't be. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 22:57, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Suing over a game's content does not make the content notable. What about suing over Kadabra's swastika-like symbol? Or the scene that caused seizures in that Pokémon episode? MP is more notable for the lawsuit, not the mini-games. Also, Rayman and Monkey Ball's mini-games are mentioned in reviews and articles (Monkey Target, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, Monkey Racing, etc.), so your argument of "getting mentioned in reviews and articles" doesn't hold water. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because no one brought up that point in the AfD doesn't mean it can't be used in this one. Hmm, you keep comparing this to other articles, I don't particularly like that, and I've expressed it on several occasions, so i'm going to do it because that seems to be how you think best. Can you tell me how the list of MP8 minigames is less notable than <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a>? AFAIK, most of them have trivial postings in other locations.

<ul>
<li>You cannot use my argument for MP. See, the existence of an article does not necessarily dictate that the article is appropriate. However, the fact that articles that are no less worthy of being on Wikipedia were deleted says that these lists don't deserve to be on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Important question: Do you think <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a> should be deleted? I know that that's not the issue at hand, but I need to know for the purposes of the argument.

<li>You're right. Because he got rid of the content, the fact that the general consensus has been "lists of mini-games/levels suck" ceases to exist. Fact: There is no need for this article besides "it's informative", which now that you removed the game guide information, it is no longer informative. Why is this the only list of mini-games in the entire universe that warrants an article? Rayman RR was deleted for good reason.

<li><b>Comment</b> Mini-games in Mario Party are basically levels. We don't have level guides here, I don't see why mini-games should be made an exception. Sourcing is fine and all: but that doesn't fix how unencyclopedic it is. As I stated before: other mini-game lists were deleted in AFD, Mario Party shouldn't be an exception either. Just because it's probably the most known mini-games: doesn't mean it should be kept over Rayman game and/or Super Monkey Ball game lists. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 21:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, Game Guides aren't allowed, so it can be reasonably assumed level guides aren't allowed. Game Lists are allowed, though there isn't any policy saying they can exist. So level lists? There isn't any policy about that. So the article should stay, and we should watch to make sure the guide content stays off. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 21:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So game guides aren't allowed. And just because there is no policy saying "list of levels in video games are bad, mkay?" does not mean that they belong on Wikipedia. Are you saying that because it's not explicitly stated that I can't make an article about flying purple rocks with hats on, that it doesn't violate any guidelines? What is the purpose of this article? Why is this list of mini-games notable to Wikipedia? Also, the reason why Rayman and Monkey Ball failed the AfD was not that it was particularly less notable than other mini-game compilations, but because it is a mini-game list. Why is this mini-game list more than just any mini-game list? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is correct, just because there isn't policy saying that a type of page isn't allowed, doesn't mean it should be allowed. Also, Just because there isn't policy saying that a type of page is allowed doesn't mean that it isn't. We need to evaluate the article based on it's own merits in accordance with wikipedia policy, which is what this discussion is all about. Also, I would say that the RRR list was not removed just because it is a minigame list. Also, I'd say that it didn't get the "fair" treatment that this one is getting. And the monkey ball one? It died from a prod. I'm going to claim that they never really had their time in court. Don't claim that mini-games lists are inherently non-notable.

You can either explain to me why this article is notable and necessary or stop saying it is. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:19, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, I'm having a hard time fully understanding your arguments, so I'm requesting clarification. Is this article absolutely necessary? No. Is the article on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Slytherins_43e3.html" title="Minor Slytherins">Minor Slytherins</a> necessary? No, is the article on <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codd%27s_12_rules.html" title="Codd's 12 rules">Codd's 12 rules</a> necessary? No. But an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> is "a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." "As a general encyclopedia, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> seeks to describe as wide a range of topics as possible." so while an article on the effects of salt on slugs, or an article about me might not be strictly necessary it might be desired to have such articles. But Wikipedia can't police information about everything under the sun, so wikipedia has established a few core guidelines, namely that of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The first two are what's being discussed here, and are neatly covered in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. We don't add an article about something (like me for example), unless a couple of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> have written something on the subject.

<li>Also, wikipedia has the guidelines contained in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Here is the real concern. Some have said that this list is an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Indiscriminate collection of information</a>. It's the original concern that RobJ mentioned, specifically that little has been done to fix the article. Since the listing of the AfD, Bowsy has cleaned out the "Instruction Manual" portion of the article.

<li>You also keep bringing up the other articles that have been deleted. <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html" title="WP:WAX">WP:WAX</a>. What makes this one different? Well, I think it's got encyclopedic content. I think it's got reliable sources, I think the information is at least partially verifiable. Sure, there's some work that could be done in all three areas, but I think it's better in those areas than those articles that got deleted. I keep saying that precedent shouldn't be used, namely because I think this article may be different (it's hard to say that that's the case, because if the articles are deleted, I can't see what they're like). Please, give me the benefit of the doubt. Assume this article is different somehow. And Evaluate, on it's own merits which wikipedia policy warrants its deletion.

<li>Just because you think it has encyclopedic content does not mean that it has encyclopedic content. The fact of the matter is that Rayman RR and Monkey Ball's mini-games have more substance than Mario Party's, yet still failed to continue to exist. If you wish, make a deletion review for them. If they come back, MP can stay. If not, MP goes. MP is no more notable than them. Also, I can use the precedence argument for deleting - you cannot use it for keeping. The fact that no other game series has a mini-game list and the ones that did were deleted is usable. The fact that another article exists with questionable notability is not. You're comparing a list of minor characters from Harry Potter to a list of mini-games in Mario Party. The fact is that those Slytherins are probably more notable than these mini-games since there IS precedence to have list of characters. If it's there, it either deserves to be or it has yet to be put on the slate for deletion. Being on Wikipedia is very different from deserving to be on Wikipedia. Your comparison of a list of minor characters that spans an entire franchise to a list of mini-games in a single game is apples and oranges, but my comparison is of two like-minded articles. So why is this a notable mini-game list? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you think the article doesn't have encyclopedic content, you're going to have to attack that point directly, saying that my thinking it's encyclopedic doesn't make it so, isn't an argument against it. I don't think a Deletion Review is necessary, because policy was kept, but that participation seemed partisan, and there's nothing that happened wrong from an administrative perspective (unless <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVAS_b8fe.html" title="WP:CANVAS">WP:CANVASing</a> can be shown, but that might prove difficult). It appears as if almost your entire argument is based on precedent (You keep saying "unencyclopedic" but haven't mentioned why since I've shown it's encyclopedicness). If we go off of precedent, Disavian has shown that 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 have all survived an AFD. Some more than once. Precedence clearly shows that these articles should stay. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 15:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, that shows that MP fanboys are too vast. Oh, and it's funny that you seem to expect me to argue why it's not encyclopedic (such as levels and mini-games list being guide content), but you won't answer why it is besides "Omg, if Minor Slytherins gets an article so does Mario Party mini-game lists!". - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:35, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you think that MP Fanboys have overwhelmed the discussion with worthless content, maybe you should open up a deletion review. With regards to encyclopedic content, I have answered that, I mentioned that Bowsy cleaned up the article and removed guide content. A list of something doesn't a guide make. Obviously that's the case, because a list of minor slytherins is not a guide. So, you'll have to tell us why you think that the article is non-encylopedic. Why you think it's an indiscriminant collection of information (and that it can't be cleaned up). I think it's clear that there is at least some encyclopedic content on the page, the blister stuff is notable enough. I have several arguements for the article. But note that it's your responsibility as the person voting for delete to bring up the issues, and my responsibility to say, "yes it's notable because it has sources, yes it is encyclopedic because it has information about the games involved in the blister lawsuit." You say I've only got one argument? Yes, I brought up the minor slytherins issue after you brought up the RRRmg. I've also brought up that the content is notable. I've also brought up that the content is encyclopedic. If you would like to explain <i>why</i> you think I'm mistaken, please feel free to do so, but you haven't brought up anything besides saying "game lists are guide content BBQ!" and I've said that they aren't inherently so, and that you must show me why game lists are inherently guide content, and you haven't done that. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strongly disagree. At worst, repeat AFDs are an annoyance. However, there is no need to set an arbitrary deadline for the improvement and/or completion of articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree, something needs to be in place, otherwise all the list pages need to be re-nominated and deleted. If people think it's encyclopedic: then fix it already. But the issue is: it can't be encyclopedic, and it's just people wanting it because they like it. As I stated before: mini-games are basically levels of the Mario Party games. Wikipedia should <b>never</b> become a level guide. It isn't one now, and MP lists shouldn't be the start of major fancruft level guides. Let's look at the possibilities, shall we? 1: A plain and simple list of the games = fan/listcruft. 2: a list of the games, with descriptions = still fan/listcruft. 3: a list of the games and how to play them = listcruft/game guide. What else is there? Sourcing the article doesn't change it from being listcruft, fancruft and/or a guide. I don't understand why people can't understand Wikipedia isn't a video game guide. There is gaming wikis, yet people refuse to use them in this case. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 08:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - This is game guide material. It may not explain exactly how to play them, but it's no different than listing levels.

I don't see any defense for this besides the usual "I like it", "It can be improved (yet five months later it's the same)", "There's nothing saying this can't be here (when most of the guide lines and policies are against it), and all of the other pointless arguments.

<li>Personally, I would classify that as trivial. It's about the level of a minor clean up. And is it going to be improved past that? Just because people want to save it from this AfD doesn't mean they'll actually touch it after. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 00:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I suppose it's a matter of perception; that's why I chose to write "non-trivial improvement" rather than "substantial improvement". My main reason for arguing that it constituted a non-trivial improvement is due to the addition of references, which were previously wholly absent. In any case, as long as you are/were aware that there had been changes, the issue is moot.

<dd>I could suggest three things offhand. First, rename the title to "Mario Party minigames". Second, add more prose covering the types of minigames, the lawsuit, and any other relevant topics for which there are sources. Third, remove anything that isn't purely descriptive.

<dd>The purpose of the list isn't to provide information on real orangutans, it's to follow how orangutans are used in cultural artifacts of whatever sort. The purpose of the list article, aside from being entertaining, is to be a serious resource for someone researching or studying or wanting to be educated about how orangutans are depicted in popular culture. That can be a serious topic, which in turn justifies the article in a serious encyclopedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>.The implied criticism by the nominator needs addressing very carefully. <i>This isnt how Wikipedia should be working</i> - good to see the idealism, but practically every animal that exists on wikipedia has enthusiastic watchers of tv culture, obscure books and pc game culture providing unalphabetically added - ad hoc- poorly written lists of information. Very few articles appear to incorporate reasonable sections regarding explanation or context of the popular culture context (then the large questions 'whose popular culture?' arises as well)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the basis of this nomination, it might be that every article in the category 'Animals in Popular Culture would need to go through similar process - and then after that - every animal that is listed in wikipedia probably has had a similar addition. The issues that arise from one and which have a consequent precedent set for almost every animal article in wikipedia - are (a) do the enthusiastic watchers of t.v. culture and obscure p.c. games have adequate warning that their moments of genius in associating their favourite with an animal with a wikipedia article have some avenue now implicitly cut off? (b) have editors who either watch or maintain (but not Own) of course - articles about animals - to be warned and aware of popular culture articles about to be have forced merges? I strongly suspect apart from Rat - which seems to be living happily in both worlds for some odd reason - many editors find popular culture sections offensive and out of place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(My emphasis - as most seem to be missing the point) - <i>I believe this aFd is out of place</i> - and the issue - as it affects at least two categories and potential edit wars regarding merges over a number of articles - should be levered higher - and perhaps a wider view needs to be made of the whole range of articles which have been created - and the overal fate of the nature of the '..in Popular Culture' tendency and habits need to be broached higher up the food chain rather than this one article...<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 10:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete or keep - NOT merge</b>. The <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orang_utan.html" title="Orang utan">Orang utan</a> article should be a serious encyclopedic article on orang utans. THis on the other hand is a list of junk that has nothing to do with orang utans. One of the most common criticisms of wikipedia is it's (lazy?) over-emphasis on pop culture. Like all the other useless pop culture trivia list, does anyone really think that a mention of the video games in which orangs appear is (a) encylopedic or (b) actually assists us in understanding orang utans? The answer is surely 'no'. The insistence on such lists in serious encyclopedia articles is a serious blight on wikipedia. Me thinks it's got more to do with bored teenagers (who actually know nothin about orang utans - or whatever other subject) wanting to list their favourite cartoon or video game. 'Orang Utans' and 'Orang Utans in Pop Culture' have nothing to do with each other. However, although i think it is a junk article, i can live with it's existence <i>IF</i> it means that the junk doesn't get into the orang utan article (as it does for so many other topics). Once the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Opera_House_ea14.html" title="Sydney Opera House">Sydney Opera House</a> article had a list of the most obscure films and TV shows in which it had appeared - the list was half the article. Let's put a stop to this rubbish please. Or, if we must keep it somewhere, at least keep it seperate to the real articles.

Orangutans cannot be villians, it is completly inappropiate to suggest that any animal is in some way a villian. Orangutans are orangutans and the article should be about describing them as such.

<p>Unsourced crufty article that is another example of the mass trivia cruft all these pop culture/cultural references that has invaded Wikipedia. The excuse of "it was made to help the article be less bloated" has been said many times on Wikipedia, when it comes to this. But a section (in this case, and most/all culture references) should be just trimmed: instead of moved just because it gets too big. Let's use <a href="../../../i/n/_/Category%7EIn_popular_culture_e405.html" title="Category:In popular culture">Category:In popular culture</a> as the root of this problem. 12 subcats, along with 81 pages in the regular part of the category.

<li><b>Keep</b> This long list convinces me that pigs are just too important as cultural symbols. You can't merge all the citable items into any article without them overwhelming that article. This list is long and deserves to be long because thare are, in fact, a lot of significant cultural references to the porkers and the myths we've attached to them. I think the nominator has stretched the meaning of "cruft" so that it's meaning isn't "something that only fans of the subject would be interested in" to "something I think is too trivial for an encyclopedia". But pigs, like pterodactyls and orangutans, we will always have, and all it takes is to be interested in culture in general to be interested in this subject. I don't like the lack of references, but again, I think we need to wait for someone to stick the footnotes in, because Wikipedia would be worse off for not covering this subject. And it's too obvious that these items can be referenced for us to use that alone as the reason for deleting. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OTTO4711, you are wrong. You have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. Too many skeptics do not believe except [what] they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, OTTO4711, whether they be men's or children's, or even pop culture consumers', are little (especially pop culture consumers, come to think of it). In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.</dd>

<dd>Yes, OTTO4711, there are pterodactyls.

Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no pterodactyls. It would be as dreary as if there were no OTTO4711s. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance or <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Million_Years_BC_5bfe.html" title="One Million Years BC">One Million Years BC</a> to make tolerable this existence.

<dd>Not believe in pterodactyls! You might as well not believe in fairies!

Nobody sees pterodactyls, except fossilized in museums or on "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers", but that is no sign that there are no pterodactyls. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see unless they rent the right DVDs. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. (On second thought, don't answer that last question.)

<p>Instinct theory does not site any real sources and is obviously made up. There is no book by Jacques Theroux named Instinct Theory, nor is there anyone by the name of Jacques Theroux. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></p>
<p><b>Question</b>: What do you mean by "obviously made up"? "Instinct theory" garners approx. 44,000 exact hits on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22instinct+theory%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22instinct+theory%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and is mentioned in several authoritative webpages, so there is at least such a thing.

<p><b>Answer</b>: There is no one by the name of Theroux, nor does the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen have anything to do with this. "Instinct theory" may get a lot of hits on google because there are theories on instincs but how many come up when you type in jacques theroux? or the name of his book? "Due to its dubious credibility, many scholars doubt Theroux's theory. Because of a sore lack of citations, and a ludicrously short bibliography, certain scholars have come forward and declared their disbelief in these ideas." Oh, come on! There is no truth behind anything that has been written if you look into it. "certain scholars" "many professionals" there is NO proof behind this. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A.Ou's sentiments are well-intentioned, but the sense in which these authorities use the phrase is clearly not the way any portion of the article depicts it. Indeed, it depicts nothing, except a nonexistent author (Library of Congress catalog search confirms that it doesn't have anything by a Jacques Theroux). The first paragraph is okay; the entire first section is demonstrably false; and the "Popular Culture" sections are at best original research and at worst a joke ("The 2004 film Collateral, Tom Cruise's character Vincent sees a coyote on the street and, in a very metaphorical scene, it reminds him of himself."). And the "Musical Theatre" section none of these "established editors" have seen fit to remove? Get rid of this blight, then we'll see if there's something encyclopedic in the topic. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 04:17, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Changed to delete</b>User:Eidolos and the convincing ones who say delete convinced me to take another look at it by narrowing the search including Theroux, Kenkel, Jacques Thiroux. So just from googling I found there is or was a person by the name Jacques Thiroux but he seemed to have nothing to do with this theory and the other two don't seem to exist. This convinces me it's a hoax. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/103-4628464-0089426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jacques%20Thiroux" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/103-4628464-0089426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jacques%20Thiroux" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>

<dd>Yes, I did make this account to point out to the Wikipedia community that my friends made a false article. I admit to that, and there's nothing wrong with it. I also made this account to fix other errors and such as I see them. I simply had no reason to create an account before this, just to fix things anonymously. This is my first account.

<li><b>Final Word Here</b> Well, this is really out of my comfort zone... Never done this before. I am only here to point out the site to you. Please make your own decisions based on what is in this article. I just feel that this is completely untrue and needs to be taken down. There are no such people as Theroux or Kenkel, it does not site credible sources (makes a lot of generalities like "many philosophers" or "certain scholars"), there is no such book as Assertations on Instinct Theory, the main writers/editors of this site do not have any other posts or edits, and the pop culture references are a stretch to say the least. Rumors on blogs about "Instinct theory: the Musical"? "Very few details are known about this future production, except that it will contain a score with every genre of music from jazz to reggae[citation needed]. The unnamed producer has little to say about this future film, except it might be released by mid 2008." There is no way this is feasible. I have looked for Instinct Theory and even if it does exist none of the sites have anything to do with topics described here. I am sorry for the excess of posting, I just want to prove my point in hopes of persuading you that this is fake. If you want to keep the site up and simply edit it to what Instinct Theory actually is, be my guest. A site I found from google searching (allpsych.com) says that Instinct theory says that we have innate instincts that help us to survive, like how spiders know how to make webs. It has nothing to do with comparing humans and animals. Maybe this topic could be expanded on rather than what is there now, but it does not seem nearly important enough to add.. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: A joke on science? Really, how is reporting a site as false information worse than writing a false page as a joke? None of this on the page can be proven as real. This is simply a hoax with a real name, as Arkyan said. Looking at the sites you have given, every single page is a theory by a different person with different ideas, and are not a single unified scientific theory that should be given its own page. If it is decided to salvage what they can from different sites and just rewrite this page, then so be it. <a href="../../../e/i/d/User%7EEidolos_11aa.html" title="User:Eidolos">Eidolos</a>

<p>Just a neologism that's already been transwikied. The article—even the quotes—provides no evidence the term has ever really been used.

<p>Fancruft/listcruft for a popular independent wrestling promotion. Imagine if a list for WWE existed: it would be insanely too long. These types of lists are better suited for a wrestling and/or fan wiki.

<dd><b>Comment</b> What was deleated in the past were several articles on different ROH events (i.e. Glory by Honor, the Anniversary Shows, Crowning a Champion). <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_WWE_pay-per-view_events_9a72.html" title="List of WWE pay-per-view events">WWE</a> does have list containing all their events, as well as different pages on the individual events; and the same goes for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_TNA_pay-per-view_events_1d6d.html" title="List of TNA pay-per-view events">TNA</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_WCW_pay-per-view_events_5222.html" title="List of WCW pay-per-view events">WCW</a>, and the original <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ECW_pay-per-view_events_f610.html" title="List of ECW pay-per-view events">ECW</a>.PepsiPlunge 04:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. All 3 promotions you listed are big promotions with PPV event list pages. The list pages for WWE, WCW and ECW are for PPVs, not every event. Ring of Honor usually has names for most (if not, all) of it's events: that doesn't make them anymore notable. Many ECW supercards (that had special names) had articles in the past, but were deleted, because of lack of notability. The list page is a fancruft guide to the event history of Ring of Honor. I don't see how a cleanup could even help it out, as people would just re-add it to make it look like a comprehensive list again I bet. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 04:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>What makes this different from say, a WWE list of house shows for example, is that almost every single Ring Of Honor Show has been released on dvd, in chronological order, and there are many collectors who this page would be useful to. If this page gets deleted, they might as well delete every page about WWE, WCW, ECW and TNA pay-per-view events and video releases.207.69.139.144 05:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Ring of Honor (like many indy promotions) releases DVDs on their own website and a few others. That's not very notable. Any group producing a DVD and releasing it online shouldn't be put on Wikipedia as a list page. With WWE and the big promotions: they sell it to actual stores, and it's released in many countries (if not worldwide). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 05:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On what basis do you define notable? ROH runs shows worldwide, and judging on the basis that they aren't on TV is wrong in this case, as the company does not want to be on TV. The DVDs are shipped worldwide and sold in independent shops all over the world and the company is covered in all wrestling media. As I said this page was deleted accidentally, the pages on the individual events were deleted on the basis that this list was enough and the guy who deleted the other pages did this one by mistake.--Stuarthinde@gmail.com 16:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It shouldnt be deleted because there are links to a website about it so it is obviously a real sport. There are also pictures and videos on that website of people hedgediving so that shows you that its real. Also, a popular ska-punk band called Operation Ivy wrote a song about it and talked about it in the interview that there is a link to in the article. - written by Mr. tippie, the article's author.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - While this is all well and good, none of those purport to make the concept anything more than non-notable neologism.

<li>Cut it out? You have a problem with my having a problem? Interesting. This superfluous AfD isn't helping anyone.

<li>Sure. Get back to me when this closes. Then again maybe we'll have a revolutionary shift in plolicy in the next three days.

<p>The library doesn't assert notability beyond your typical city library. All all libraries, like all high schools, considered notable by their existence, or are they held to the general standard? (I don't mean to raise the can of worms with <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, but I'm interested in the comparison between schools and libraries. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> into its community's article, but don't delete so that the article name stays available in case the library becomes notable. I've been thinking about the differences between libraries and schools, and the arguments I'd use for high schools I wouldn't use for libraries. Let them prove notability like any other subject. The material in the article would be a fine section in a town or city article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Libraries are not inherently notable, this article does not make a strong case for notability or cite independent sources, and there is not enough content to warrant a merge. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon%2C_Florida_1cd4.html" title="Brandon, Florida">Brandon, Florida</a>. Not a particularily famous or important library on a worldwide basis, and the article is only a paragraph long, but still covering the various cultural and educational institutions within the community article is valid. (For comparison, I'll mention that the library system in <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <i>Deichmanske Bibliotek</i> has a separate article in my Norwegian <i>paper</i> encyclopedia, and in <a href="http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9307249" class="external text" title="http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9307249" rel="nofollow">this encyclopedia</a> but that is a city-wide system of libraries, not a single building.) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Would probably work best in Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative, I think the regional library systems are generally going to all have articles eventually.

<li><b>Delete</b> this as a topic not suitable for an encyclopedia. Maybe an extended yellow pages wiki could make use of this article. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Berry_ce71.html" title="User:Mr. Berry">Mr. Berry</a> 07:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as absolutely nothing notable is even hinted at. In the extremely unlikely event that this library becomes notable, the name can be resurrected. There's no point holding article names for the indefinite future. (As for a suggestion above, I think an article on the country library cooperative would have exactly the same problem. I certainly would support an effort to examine very critically articles on regional library systems below the state or large metropolitan area level, though there are a few that are indeed notable. (The only two I can think of offhand is Hennepin County Library, which needs an article--but in the meantime see <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanford_Berman_93f2.html" title="Sanford Berman">Sanford Berman</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Public_Library_4c50.html" title="Brooklyn Public Library">Brooklyn Public Library</a>. ) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:03, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Since it's only an article for sale, I don't know if it's just a trivial reference (and the headline doesn't indicate the story is necessarily about him).

<li><b>Delete</b>: I tagged it as a speedy delete because I don't consider doing your job to be notable. If your job is to be a pastor, that's good. If you are pastor at a large church, that's fine, too. If you publish a ton of books, that's rather meaningless in the age of print-on-demand, and it's not even very meaningful in niche publication markets like "spirituality." Therefore, it looked to me like some guy doing his stuff. I'm sure he has a ton of charisma, at least in one sense, but the authors look like the subjects, and the entirety looks so puffy that I suspected a boosterist agenda, and that combined with no serious claim for notability to make a speedy delete candidate. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 12:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> The Sideshow Cinema entry contains a list of Michael Legge's stable of actors. This list includes award winning actors and actors who have appeared in award winning films.

I will point out this entry <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegan_Community_Players_36fb.html" title="Allegan Community Players">Allegan Community Players</a> which gives no background information on any of the actors and is just a list of names of actors who played in community theater.

<dd>If individual actors are notable then by all mean they should have their own articles. If Sideshow Cinema is notable then it should have a real article that demonstrates it's notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>; the article isn't even about Sideshow Cinema, rather it's an article showcasing amateur (unpaid) actors who don't qualify for articles on the own. Many have been deleted only to be recreated here. This is much like having an article on a random Restaurant in the form of mini-bios on the entire staff. In addition, the assertion that anything having to do with this is "award-winning" is a bit misleading. We're talking B-movie awards of very limited notability here, not the Oscars. If any of the "actors" listed do warrant articles of their own that's a different issue.

<p>Chambersburg Area Senior High School is the sole high school of a tiny town in rural Pennsylvania. It fails all three counts of the (not accepted) <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESchools_f044.html" title="WP:Schools">WP:Schools</a> policy. It has not been the subject of a non-trivial work, it has no notable alumni, it has not gained recognition for special achievements, and it has no special architectural history. Moving on to the more general <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> criteria, a Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> reveals that there are no published works available on the Internet with Chambersburg Area Senior High School as their primary focus, except primary sources published by the school itself and its associated organizations. Finally, the article has already been merged into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg.html#Chambersburg_Area_Senior_High_School" title="Chambersburg">Chambersburg#Chambersburg Area Senior High School</a>. Looking through <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg_Area_Senior_High_School_1f75.html" title="Chambersburg Area Senior High School">Chambersburg Area Senior High School</a>'s edit history reveals that a fairly large number of the edits are vandals or non-sense. Merging the article will ensure that more people will see the content and be able to revert the vandals faster.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would advise you to examine the "improvements" in the article more closely. The first paragraph has been copied three times with minute variation to make the article appear bulkier. Notice that the school's enrollment of 1,800 is mentioned <b>three</b> times once in each of the article's three paragraphs. It's pretty obvious that no one is paying attention to this article.

<p><b>Comments on nom statement</b></p>
<p><b>Comment on nom statement</b> - While the stated purpose of this AfD as a discussion of a merge is decidedly odd and may be misuse of the AfD process, I think that there is sufficient question as to the notability of the subject to warrant this AfD, irrespective of the outcome of previous AfDs. It is odd that an AfD is being brought by a nom that thinks the article should be kept and, again, I wonder if it is a misuse of the process. It might be more appropriate if this AfD were resubmitted by an editor that feels that the article should be deleted and perhaps this AfD should be "shelved" pending such a submittal. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Keep <small>Since <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> and I have worked/are working together this isn't a formal vote, even though an AfD isn't supposed to be a "vote" anyway.</small> If <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> were only a critic of Scientology, I'd agree with the merge proposal. After all, he would belong in such a category if that was all that could be known for. In my opinion his software development and the coverage it has received clearly makes him notable for more than being a Scientology critic.
<blockquote>
<p>Hausherr's Xenu's Link Sleuth software was called the "fastest link-checking software" by PC Magazine.</p>
</blockquote>
To be fair though, since he did include the name "Xenu's" I understand why some Scientologists may feel he is a full time critic. However such people are most likely forgetting that the bulk of time spent on the application involves programming/coding, the name is almost an afterthought. (Which means if a person spends 100 hours developing a program, and then takes two seconds to call it the <u><i>no FAT chicks file manager</i></u>, said person <i>could</i> be called insensitive but would <u><i>have</i></u> to be called a developer. Especially if the software <i>works</i>.) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 10:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>; it is true that most of Hausherr's notability derives primarily from his anti-Scientology campaigning.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The concept is relevant in social sciences, where there is some literature around it, and ideally it deserves its own page. It is more of a sociology stub than a linguistics stub. But since I am not personally conversant in that literature and so not able to do the work, I will concede if the editors wish to remove it to the human extinction page for the time being. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaedalus71_a683.html" title="User:Daedalus71">Christopher Powell</a> 05:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Ok, I have made some edits and the page is now a bit more substantial, so I would like to advocate for its retention.

<li><b>Comment</b>: seems to be well-written, but is there a need for more than one article on the same subject? One possible resolution might be to merge the articles by replacing the first section of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_extinction.html" title="Human extinction">human extinction</a> article with the content of the <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnicide.html" title="Omnicide">omnicide</a> article; however, there are other possible ways to merge the articles as well. 38.100.34.2 21:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My hesitance about a merge between the two is that "omnicide", unlike "human extinction", is a rather specialised term. Although the two are essentially synonymous, omnicide should not be presented as a (or the) commonly-accepted term. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten, with kudos to Christopher Powell for his work on the article. My understanding is that the term is distinct from the broader "human extinction". It is also notable (per the multiple sources), so I think a separate article is appropriate.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 01:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_extinction.html" title="Human extinction">Human extinction</a>; move any additional content there.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I understand it, omnicide is the deliberate killing of the human race by humans, while human extinction is any scenario that leads to the wiping out of the species. So, omnicide should certainly be mentioned/discussed in the human extinction article, but they are different concepts. Merge and redirect is not a bad solution. However, human extinction is getting to be a pretty long article and the normal practice is to break out individual notable elements if an article starts to get too long. Based on the references provided, it seems (at least to me) that omnicide is a sufficiently notable concept to justify a separate article with room for expansion.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 17:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems to be an autobiography (uses "my" several times as an adjective). The main problem is the lack of sources, none are mentioned in the article, and I can't find any searching around.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, although I'm convinceable. Heavy googling (including Google News Archive) does confirm that he's a photographer for (mostly Australian) Vogue and there are quite a few web galleries of his work and plenty of photo credits, but very little information actually about him, even though several Australian dailies are on GNA.

<p>That's why I wrote about him. There is very little information available on Richard Bailey. However, I just found some information from his NYC rep: <a href="http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html" class="external free" title="http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.judycasey.com/RB/artist_detail.html</a> This has a bio on him.

<p>Why do you want to delete this? part of the beauty of Wikipedia is you CAN find information on subjects that don't pop up as soon as you enter their name in Google! If you look at Richard Bailey's work and still believe he is not notable or worthy of being in Wikipedia fine. But as a photographer with 30 years worth of contributions to Australian Vogue he IS important.

<li><b>Delete</b> The problem with this article isn't so much that he might not be notable in the grand scheme of things, its that we have absolutely no way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> his notability. I looked to verify a few of the facts, and the only thing I could reliably establish was that he indeed did shoot for for Australian Vogue, though for how long, and how successfully, I don't know. Wjwallis - I'm sure you are a upstanding and ethical interviewer, but unfortunately, we simply cannot take your word that the information in this article is accurate. We must use reliable third party sources to check the facts - and if the reliable sources don't exist, the article must be deleted. I searched around a bit, and couldn't find anything, but you can change my mind if reliable sources appear before the five days are up. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC) (<small>Edited to correct spelling - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</small>)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> nailed it on the head and said it better than I could. To take it one step further, lets use the comparison you made previously, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bailey_1f4a.html" title="David Bailey">David Bailey</a>. Looking at his article, I can tell you something about his life, he is a member of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> as well as his career from 1959 to present day. I can also tell you he's written or collaborated on three books and been interviewed in a fourth. He has pointers at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a> and has at least three published interviews. Comparatively speaking, Richard bailey is a man of mystery. There appears to be your interview, some reference to his work in Austrailian Vogue and online galleries of his art. Honestly, I think we'd all like to see an extremely well-written article for Mr. Bailey with a plethora of details on his life and career. The problem is, there isn't enough there even for a properly sourced stub. You mention other articles that are of equal stature. I won't deny that. As time moves on, all of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">1.5+ Million articles</a> will get touched in some way. Some will go away, others will be improved. Still more will be created. Right now, it's about Richard bailey. A suggestion I might make in your sourcing is to read the most excellent article by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> called <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">On Notability</a>.

<p>Notablility?!! That's rich. Wikipedia has all sorts of trivial people with dubious notability (ie American Idol contestants etc.) who have done nothing. If you are a photographer and shoot for huge clients and shoot for Vogue for 30 years I think that makes you notable!</p>

<ul>
<li>I am still not convinced. Adding a bunch of wiki links to notable people and things he has photographed does not help to assert his own notability, and the POV of the article has taken a turn for the worse (übercool agency??). For obviously reasons, his publicist is not a reliable source, neither are blogs. The picture gallery is pretty, and he takes nice pictures, but <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not a criteria for inclusion. At least the B&amp;W Magazine seems to confirm that he is a "top photographer", but WP:BIO demands multiple sources. If the Capture Magazine article listed in paragraph 2 is available - then that might push it over, though somebody would have to go through this article with a hatchet - get rid of the model names, the agency names, and the publicist links. Vote remains delete. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Once again: if you shoot for <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue.html" title="Vogue">Vogue</a> (the top fashion magazine in the world) for 30 years that would make you notable!!!! Most of the top photographers of all time used Vogue as their showcase: <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Ritts_214b.html" title="Herb Ritts">Herb Ritts</a>, Steven Meisel, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Von_Unwerth_f8da.html" title="Ellen Von Unwerth">Ellen Von Unwerth</a>, Anne Lebovitz, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Weber_3cb0.html" title="Bruce Weber">Bruce Weber</a>... etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on some lame reality show apparently you are notable so why not a professional photographer who works for <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue.html" title="Vogue">Vogue</a>?</p>
<p>If you judge his pictures are "pretty" and "nice" that is subjective and irrelevant. The fact is he is one of the top photographers in the world and his agency (top photographers have representatives) is relevant because that is where his work is displayed!!!</p>

<dd>This issue here is the common misconception that notability and importance are related on Wikipedia. When editor say non notable they mean that there are not sufficient sources from which to write an article. Since many reality TV stars are interviewed in magazines it is often possible to write a good biographical article about them. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Sourcing is not an indication of notability, on which this nomination is based. His appearance on Letterman is not an indication of the fact that he is notable, not for an encyclopedic article. What about the the Guinness World Records show, they showcase a huge number of record attempts on TV; should all the people who attempt a Guinness record be notable? The basic fact is that his "fame" is based on a trivial event, and is therefore not encyclopedic. --<span class="user-sig user-Shreshth91">May the Force be with you! <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreshth91_b54e.html" title="User:Shreshth91">Shre</a><a href="../../../s/h/r/User_talk%7EShreshth91_b218.html" title="User talk:Shreshth91">shth91</a></span> 12:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You can order copies of the DVDs off that LRS website. That's how I even heard of the show and saw it in the first place. I have several respectable magazine articles where the show is featured or mentioned (2 of those in national publications), so apparently some of us consider it notable. Do I have to come to your houses and show you the TV show and magazines or what? (ha ha, just kidding!) Seriously though, I don't understand why this page is being picked on. Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it isn't notable or whatever. One last thing (for Stuart) - why did you say the links go to the author's homepage? I don't have a homepage listed on there. The links go to the websites of people featured on the show. You guys are getting carried away with your posts... you're doing quite a bit of that "crystal ball" gazing yourself! All the same, it's not the end of the world to me. Do what you gotta do, but I would appreciate it if you guys took a deep breath before rushing to judgment.--Brasky 20:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>No-one's rushing anything or picking on anyone but I can't help but think you're not help ing your case by saying "that LRS website" as though it were not connected to you when the image (10thLRS.jpg) which is prominently displayed on the Wiki LRS page and which you uploaded is also the dvd cover on the LRS website (<a href="http://theleonandrustinshow.com/db3/00257/theleonandrustinshow.com/_uimages/LRSre1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://theleonandrustinshow.com/db3/00257/theleonandrustinshow.com/_uimages/LRSre1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>) - and on the licensing tag for the wiki image you say "I made it myself. I willingly release it into the public domain". I don't know if this counts as COI, but pretending to be impartial when you're not isn't brilliant behaviour. There's still not a single notable source on the page either. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 17:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I e-mailed a copy of the article I wrote for Wikipedia to the webmaster of that site and I previously sent them a picture I photoshopped from various clips of the show for fun. That hardly means I own the site or that I'm any more connected to it than you are. THEY chose to put it on there, not me. You're turning this into a personal thing, Stuart, maybe because you feel I'm challenging your experience or authority? You are making claims and assumptions about me, the show, and the websites without knowing ANYTHING about me, the show, or the websites. My intention is not to continually argue with you about this stuff. I agree with you that I am not an "impartial" person - I love the show and I think it is hilarious. But I did write an impartial ARTICLE about the show for Wikipedia (on behalf of myself and other fans around the country) and I think you should respect it. That all being said, I disagree strongly with you that there are no notable sources on the page. Apparently, someone at Wiki agrees with me as well because the page has never been deleted. I appreciate your input, and I respect you as a person - but I really wish you would give up your crusade against me and my article.--Brasky 21:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I have asked the author on the talk page of the article to clarify whether this theory was published in a peer-reviewed journal or not.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User_talk%7EDorisH_786f.html" title="User talk:DorisH">DorisHノート</a> 21:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Benedant 23:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)Yes, this monograph was published officially in the mentioned University, as an end course requirement. It's there, printed and was analised by the profssors of the university and accepted as valid and unique writing. Since the book, based in the monograph, is being edited by the author and will be reliesed this year, I don't see any harm in deleting this for a while, althoug it may hinder some discussion about considering the law forces as vectors coming from a social covenant and based on a main principle of reciprocity. If passed the test of deletion, I will increment the article.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A theory supported only by one university thesis is not notable. There is the need for a least one other source than the university that anyone besides the examining committee and the author thinks it's notable. No institution can validly peer-review its own publications. peer review, just like our own standards, requires independent sources. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The published works might possibly fulfill our standards, for adoption as a text by multiple colleges has consistently been considered to make for notability. However, this hasnt been shown. The listings of the books on Amazon is not enough.

<dd>Whenever these Gundam articles come up people always claim that they are notable because Gundam itself is notable. The problem is that these articles on individual mecha contain little real world context ie how these fictional concepts fit into the real world. Fictional characters and machinery are not really separate concepts from the media that creates them unless they have been discussed separately in some "out of universe" media. In response to the IDONTKNOWIT arguement, while I don't know that much about Gundam I did nominate and merge most of the characters from my favorite movies the Aliens series. While I love these characters and know alot about them, all the info in the articles comes from in universe sources and it was impossible to provide real world context. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This AFD seems rather convoluted, with various suggestions to keep one, delete another, merge some, and do unspecified things to the rest. As the general consensus seems to be somewhere between merging and keeping, I would suggest that discussion about a merge to a main article or a "List of characters" article be taken to the respective talk pages. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:31, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just to be clear, my comment above constitutes a recommendation to <b>keep all</b> pending discussion on the talk pages and merges as appropriate. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:33, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is generally what happens when people start hit-and-run AFDs instead of contacting the appropriate editors about article content. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrainor_8470.html" title="User:Jtrainor">Jtrainor</a> 22:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect all</b> to <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshiyuki_Tomino_a74b.html" title="Yoshiyuki Tomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> and report this result on the Talk pages of all the relevant articles. It will then be up to the discretion of the editors at the different Talk pages as to where the material should be merged to. The separate articles are too weak to stand as they are, they are an embarrassment. If the editors can come up with a smaller set of articles that are reliably sourced, and tied back to the original shows, they are quite unlikely to be challenged in any further AfDs. Note that a redirect will not wind up deleting any content; the content will all survive in the histories of the various pages, under the redirects. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 01:23, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>merge</b> everything here into one article? I would think that a separate topic for a specific thing within a fictional world is acceptable <b>if</b> there's a lot of important content to the article. E.g. in the recent <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">lightsaber combat</a> AfD the article was very detailed and well-researched, and would have taken up too much space within <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> -- whereas these articles are rather tiny and don't seem to have any value outside of their fictional universe. Maybe if the info gets merged into one single article, someone will see it and actually fix the content up a bit.</s> Holy crap, do you see how many articles there are within this category? MS-05A is a tiny article that doesn't seem to have much value, but RX-75 and RX-77 are huge articles, and check out the large chart at the bottom of those 2 pages before casting a vote! At this point, I have to think the only options are <b>keep</b> all, <b>move to their own wiki</b>, or <b>delete 1000 pages of Gundam content and watch a firestorm ensue</b>. I think only a fan would be able to make an informed vote about this content, and only a suicidal person would want to discuss this issue from the standpoint of cruft. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 16:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article only concerns Eric qua the Howard Stern Show and in so far as he is represented in that capacity this is as neutral as possible. Indeed, since he is <b>only</b> notable qua the Howard Stern Show neutrality need only concern itself with this aspect of him; it is not unneutral to fail to assess Eric from the point of view of his family, friends, or non-stern related figures because the point of view of these figures is not important in relation to the notable aspect of his existence.--<a href="../../../i/w/p/User%7EIwpoe_9a9b.html" title="User:Iwpoe">Matt</a> 09:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>STRONGLY KEEP</b> Eric has been a near-daily-appearing show character since 2002. From 2002 through 2005 the Howard Stern show, Monday through Friday, had over 10 million listeners per day. With the Sirius/XM merger the show could in the very near future attain those type of numbers once again. The Howard Stern Show is as mainstream a piece of American pop culture as one can get speaking in the most strict, capitalist terms. I've seen wiki of dozens of programs with literally a thousanth of the audience of the Stern show per week who have seperate profiles for characters or personalties of parallel profile to what Eric has had with Howard. It takes quite a lot of moxie to judge the impact of a character or what he has meant to a show when one hasn't been a listener/viewer to it, as many of those pro-delete zealots show a clear indication of. Or even the absurd notion that Howard Stern fans can't be the best arbiters, or arbiters at all, for keeping acuracy on Howard Stern centric profiles. Do you see we Stern fans trying to create seperate profiles for every Wack Packer? It would be helpful if the people in these arguments stated their basic opinion on the show they're making judgements about BTW, I have no problem removing the mystery and acknowledging biases. Also excuse me if I assume an Englishman,<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatestrowerever_c779.html" title="User:Greatestrowerever">Greatestrowerever</a>, wouldn't be the best barometer for the American radio atmosphere and who it registers with in the American culture.

<p>STRONGLY KEEP! Eric is a crucial part of The Howard Stern Show. He's done to much for one person to deleate one's page. He makes people smile and laugh each day.</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP!!! For the simple reason that he should not be censored from Wiki. If someone wants to learn about Eric, they should be able to find valid information about him.</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP! Eric is one of the most beloved members of the WackPack. His calls to the show are the stuff of legend and he has truly separated himself from average WackPackers. He is and always will be a lexicon of The Howard Stern Show and rightly deserves special recognition for his contributions and works. --Sir Brentallica-- Knights of the SFN</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP. Eric the Midget is a very big part of the Howard Stern Radio Show. If this post were to be deleted, you would also have to delete other members of his show. This Wiki should not be censored, or otherwise it loses validity and becomes biased.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. For the love of God, delete it. Why we need to have articles on people who only appear on nationally aired talk shows is a major mystery to me. It's different for someone like Stuttering John, who has notability outside of the show. But it's just ridiculous in this case. He isn't notable just for being on the show alot. It doesn't work that way. And to whomever closes this, good luck counting the votes. I wish non-Wikipedia users wouldn't flood AfDs like this.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I came here specifically for knowledge about eric the midget. It's not like the internet is running out of disk space.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I have an issue with some of the comments made in this discussion, as I think <b>everyone deserves a BIO page</b>, regardless of what their claim to fame is, or even if they have none. Wikipedia is supposed to be the encyclopedia for everything that has ever been, and everyone has had some kind of impact on society and the way of the world. Eric is no exception to this. Eric is a real person, who has a life and has had an impact on society, just like everyone else who has a BIO. Having said that, I do admit that the article reads less like a BIO and more like an article about "Eric's antics on the Howard Stern show". Maybe a new article should be created for *that* topic, and those portions of the BIO can be moved out of the BIO page and onto that topic page. Then, people can argue about whether *that* page should be deleted. But the BIO page itself should remain, if for no other reason, than out of respect for Eric.

I have made repeated requests for citations on the talk page, and about a month ago I tagged both the article and specific sentences, with no response. I am more than willing to withdraw the nom if work is done, but as it stands now the article must be nominated at least. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> interesting article, and I don't usually go for conspiracy theory stuff... perhaps a better title for this article might be "alternate theories" or something. At any rate, while referencing is bad currently, I have added 1 personally, and most of the items on the list are hardly out of the blue, they mention books and scholars who support the ideas in question, but just lack the formality of inline citations just yet. Thus I think it's clear this article just needs improvement, not deletion. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. These theories definitely exist, but to keep an article titled "Bible Conspiracy Theories" requires that collectively they be a topic of debate. There's no citation to underly that claim, which in any case is not really asserted in the article. As it stands, the article is OR - interesting but disqualified for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - but the nominator has valid concerns that apparently have failed to be addressed for some time.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I thought that the whole point of having the {{references}} tag was to avoid having every other sentence flagged with {{fact}} tags. My other option would be to invoke WP:RS and simply delete everything that is unsourced - which would leave, at most, two disconnected paragraphs. By the way... I thank those who are actually adding sources to the article instead of simply saying "keep it" but not helping to aleviate the problems. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> - I understand, but there is a difference between a general, "This article has no citations" notice, and specifying <i>this</i> needs a source, <i>this</i> needs a source, <i>this</i> needs a source (and I don't know of any policy stating they can't both be used where necessary).

<li><b>Keep</b> this is a notable subject, and the article is useful. But he individual entries have to be sourced directly or indirectly, and not all of them are.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The problem with citations is a red herring. Ignore it. The real problem is that this article is a mish-mash of articles that are only tangentially related through their alternative views of what constitutes the "true Bible". Each individual topic may be encyclopedic but there is no Bible conspiracy theory, at least not one that unifies the various theories. Most of these theories are not "conspiracy theories" per se. They are just theories about what is or is not the "true Bible". At the very minimum, this article needs a new title that is more descriptive of its content. Better yet, merge this into an existing Bible-related article. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Easily passes the primary criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject." (No use even addressing <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> since it is apparently being eliminated-- 4 points of notability have been removed within about a month-- any point she may pass there today may be gone tomorrow). Multiple magazine layouts, multiple magazine covers, multiple video appearances. Clearly an article on a celebrity, not a vanity page. To use "Notability" to delete articles on celebrities, rather than vanity pages, is an abuse of the term. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This argument is absurd. Are actors independent of the films they appear in? They are studio employees. Are you planning a deletion campaign on film next? Why do you refuse to deal constructively with whatever it is that is bothering you? Why are you intentionally disrupting Wikipedia with <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> AfDs? You have made over a dozen of these over the past few day, few of which are justifiable, and no doubt several of them will be deleted because editors do not have time improve each article or even to respond to each AfD before it closes. If you were really concerned about notability and sourcing, you would put a source-tag on the article, as I did with your still insufficiently sourced stub yesterday. Instead you continue to disrupt Wikipedia by wasting editor's time. You don't even put any thought into your responses at these AfDs, you just paste the same nonsense. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you think that mens-mags.com is a reliable source and that the "reliable source" is asserting notability by demonstrating that she has been in a porn mag "X" number of times...well then I don't know what else to say to you. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, the old "Any source on porn is unreliable if it and when mentions porn" argument... IMDB is perfectly fine for thousands of articles, but suddenly invalid if it covers a porn subject. mens-mags.com is not 'reliable' enough to prove a subject has appeared in men's mags. Scans of the model's picture on those men's mags is not 'reliable' evidence that she appeared in those men's mags, because they are men's mags... If that's the kind of reasoning you engage in, feel free to say nothing more to me.

Deleting a U.S. subject from English Wikipedia while it exists in another language?

<ul>
<li>So the existance of one policy violation is justification from additional violations? I would hope the point is that we want to keep this encyclopedia inline with its policies. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. When an article on a minor U.S. celebrity is put up for deletion from the English Wikipedia, while it exists on non-English Wikipedias, the question of whether the English Wikpedia's policies are being abused to keep out certain subjects comes to mind. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The term "Notability" is <i>abused</i> when it is used to delete articles on minor celebrities. It should be used to keep out vanity pages. This subject is clearly a celebrity. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Clearly? Funny, the notability guidline for <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">porn actors</a> says otherwise.

<li>I have no problem with Wikipedia policies, I have a problem when they are abused to waste editor's time, and to delete articles on subjects that some editors dislike. WP:PORN has lost half its "notability" criteria within about a month, so I go by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which this article clearly passes. The nominator has started stubs which are completely unsourced, yet frets about sourcing in over a dozen AfDs in the past few days.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added five published interviews, an article, more magazine pictorials and covers. To clarify the IMDB reference: A listing at IMDB is not being used as proof of notability. Rather, like at hundreds of other film articles on Wikipedia, it is being used as a source. That source gives these published interviews, etc. Again, clearly notable. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Interviews are primary sources and therefore cannot be used to establish notability. An article in a porn magazine is not independent source as the subject of the article is an employee of the magazine.

It is normal and expected in this area to publish journal and conference versions of the same work, but it's much less normal to publish two journal and two conference versions of such similar work; it is the similarities between the Romanian journal paper and the DSD'01 paper that are of most concern to me.

<dd>I have the impression that WoS underrepresents computer science in general, largely because of WoS' focus on journals while a lot of the CS literature is in conferences. And what I was complaining about isn't the preliminary-conference polished-journal thing; as I said, that's normal and expected. But it doesn't seem that we are in any disagreement about the AfD decision. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 03:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Whadaya mean, as <i>PMC</i> suggested? I tell ya I get no respect, no respect at all. As far as the articles by suit being too long, none of the articles look to be more than a paragraph or two, some of which is duplicative, so merging shouldn't result in anything overly long.

<li><b>Merge by suit</b> - The arcanas may be notable, but the cards themselves are not particularly notable independently of their meaning within the overall system.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Just because a minor arcana tarot card is nothing but one of many pip cards in a game of tarot, it does not imply a lack of content related to the non-gaming side of the card. There is much content that can be added based upon the usage of a card for divination. There is still more that can be added about the symbolism and background of the card.--<a href="../../../p/t/d/User%7EPtdecker_b311.html" title="User:Ptdecker">P Todd</a> 02:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think Otto's MERGE proposal seems most reasonable. Also, to UsaSatsui This AfD is intended to promote discussion. Despite what Bill O'Reilly may have told you, there is no "war on tarot" being conducted here. I think tarot is a fine card game played in France! Seriously, I think Ptdecker is doing good faith work with the POV concerns. However,whatever POV issues I and a few others may have raised about games and divination are not related to this proposal. My purpose is to see what the community here thinks we should do with all these stubs before any sort of work is to be done on them. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 03:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm afraid if we MERGE, we will end up breaking them all out again sometime in the future. If they were merged even by suit, if each card was fully fleshed out as they should be the article would be huge. I don't think there is a "war on tarot" (nice pun, Smiloid). But, I do think by pure numbers there are many more users of tarot for esoteric purposes then users of the cards for game play. Seems like a 50%/50% balanced bias towards game play is actually a bias away from the majority of physical people (just my opinion).--<a href="../../../p/t/d/User%7EPtdecker_b311.html" title="User:Ptdecker">P Todd</a> 19:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That would be fine to break them out again when that time comes. As of right now these cards are not in any way fleshed out. I think the authors of all these individual card articles have placed the cart before the horse (excuse cliché ). There is one article on one of the suits. The other 3 suits have been neglected. Articles on the parent class should have been created prior to all these articles on individual members. Also if you look closely, Knight of Swords has an exact clone. At the very least one of those two should be merged/deleted. Again this is not for the games/esoteric debate. I am simply raising a question as to how all these cards should be treated.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 06:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b> There are multiple schools of thought and research regarding Tarot cards. They can be viewed as historical cultural symbols, they are used by some philosophical systems as spiritual or meditative icons, they are used by many in various ways as so-called "divination tools" (in both formal and informal contexts), and they are used by some for playing of games. Another consideration is that there are many systems of Tarot and the cards do not have the same meanings in each system. If we merge the articles into one larger article, then it would be likely that the merged article will contain images and discussions of many cards and would quickly become be overly long. So, although many of the individual articles are currently stubs, if we leave them be, Tarot enthusiasts and experts of all persepctives will populate the pages with interesting info. Why do we need to be in a hurry about that? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParzival418_18da.html" title="User:Parzival418">Parzival418</a> 04:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WikiCommons needs more "minor arcana" images. I could make a comment that the Waite 3 of Swords is a clone of the Sola Busca 3 of swords or the ribbon on the 2 of coins Waite deck was inspired by the ribbon that carries the card makers name and date eg "Conver 1760" but I think the lack of appropriate images is one factor hampering the development of these articles.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 06:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just like filing a lawsuit, anybody can start an AfD for any reason valid or invalid, and they usually do. The reality is that many of the articles listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Schools_93a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Deletion_sorting/Schools</a> were perfect examples of articles that had already demonstrated notability, or could be (and were) improved to further demonstrate notability. The fact that you and others have decided to nominate schools for deletion is no indication of the merit of these AfDs. I have expanded this article and other similar articles because they deserve to be retained. I never attended Holmen High School, I'm not even quite sure where it's located. But I do know that the article has multiple, non-trivial <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to demonstrate notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Yes, you are correct that anyone can start an AFD. My intention by sharing the page was not to add weight to this deletion, but simply to share the information in the hope that everyone will make a more informed decision. I have no personal stake in whether or not this page is deleted, except my desire to improve Wikipedia. But I should add that the original article that I nominated for deletion is very different from its current state (which contains much more information). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 11:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> This article needs wikifying, expanding, cleaning up and improving - not deleting - at the moment its just a lot of copied text but a good editor could really make this article shine.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the speedy delete is without prejudice to a new article being recreated.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have just done a large edit to the article and removed most of the copied text. I've tried to rewrite a lot of parts but the article still needs work. I have added a schools info box as well as three seperate references (one of which is the actual schools site). I have placed the hang on to contest the speedy deletion as this article is no longer a clear copyright violation.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Zines are an important element of culture and counterculture alike. The zine wiki is a good resource in both the cataloguing and promotion of them. I personally discovered the zine wiki through wikipedia and it would be a shame if other people didn't have the same advantage. Besides, it's basically a sister site using wikimedia technology - you'd think that all of those wikis (certainly the well-maintained ones) would have a place on wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - A quick search on Google reveals hundreds of webpages linked to Zine Wiki. The site itself has many thousands of visitors. This is a social and artistic movement that is obviously of some importance. It's imperative that Wikipedia includes articles on such topics, otherwise it will become an encyclopedia that only includes articles that are commercially endorsed or sanctioned by large corporate interests, such as television shows or basketball players. Obscure episodes of television shows are not the true indicator of the culture of a society, no matter how many advertising dollars are behind them, and no matter how many articles have been written about them. Culture can emerge from the internet, from small press publications such as the type that Zine Wiki documents, and may appear to be unnoticed by the dominant culture while having a noticable effect. If Wikipedia is to reflect the culture at large, rather than just that which is commercially sanctioned (a small percentage of the cultural production that affects peoples' lives), then it must include articles such as this one. If we applied the criteria that only aspects of culture that have been throughly documented by large corporate media are to be included, then half the articles on Wikipedia will disappear, particularly many articles on topics such as Punk, and punk bands; the Arts, such as Underground filmmakers; Feminism, and Gay cultures, for just an example, all of which are 'marginalized' cultures, and all of which received little exposure in mainstream media until years after their effect had already permeated the culture at large. Even if the culture of zines and the small press does not personally affect you in particular, be assured it is having an effect on many thousands of others. Many noteworthy writers and artists are, or have been, involved in zine culture and Wikipedia carries pages on them; zine editors such as <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Cometbus_303f.html" title="Aaron Cometbus">Aaron Cometbus</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Perry_9c7e.html" title="Mark Perry">Mark Perry</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johanna_Fateman_f09e.html" title="Johanna Fateman">Johanna Fateman</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Hanna_0cd9.html" title="Kathleen Hanna">Kathleen Hanna</a>, <a href="../../../g/2E/b/G.B._Jones_1b98.html" title="G.B.

Will Wikipedia now delete all those pages as well? If so, then it's good that Zine Wiki does exist and documents precisely this culture.

<li><b>Keep</b>Wikipedia needs to revise its definition of 'reliable sources'. It could reasonably be argued that the most significant impact on the publishing world in many years has been blogs. Bloggers such as <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a>, to give but one example (and there are many), are regarded as credible journalists whose writing is widely dispersed in a manner comparable to syndicated columnists of the previous century and have greatly altered the publishing landscape. Wikipedia, it would appear, is one of the very few places where they aren't taken seriously. In contrast, Wikipedia touts the likes of <i>The New York Times</i> as being a 'reliable source' of information when only recently headlines throughout the world exposed the fact that they published false facts about an individual who had knowingly lied to them. My point is that Wikipedia is pursuing an antiquated notion of what constitutes a 'reliable source'. As Dan 10things argues, you are not the best judge of what a reliable source is. And, as Jonathon Penton asks above, why wouldn't you consider the Small Press Exchange a reliable source? A question, I note, you have not answered. Zine Wiki is quite obviously about zine culture. It is an article about a wiki that documents zines, zine editors and distributors and zine outlets. In essence, zine culture. ZineWiki is an extremely important part of that culture and will only grow in importance. All of the fanzines I mentioned previously never, in their lifetime, had a readership anywhere near the amount of readers who have visited ZineWiki and yet they influenced the culture and you have pages devoted to them. ZineWiki has in all likelihood more readers than any of those zines and is impacting zine culture and the culture at large as we speak. Its documentation of zines and zine editors, its determination to take seriously what is often denigrated as not being serious, is changing the nature of what constitutes publishing; of what is a 'free press', as Leafypie argues rightly; and most importantly, of what is 'trivial' and what is not. You pride yourself that your vanity website gets half as many page views as ZineWiki: you could also be proud of the fact that the amount of viewers of your website probably exceeds the readership of most of the zines I mentioned above. However, your vanity website has not had an impact on the culture. The zines I mentioned did. Likewise, Natalie, the town you lived in, the school you attended had an impact on your life. You wonder, in your comment, why there is not an article on Wikipedia devoted to you: it's because your life did not have an impact on your town or your school and that is why there is not an article on Wikipedia devoted to you. Zine Wiki is having an impact on the culture it is a part of, in the same way that the zines I mentioned and the zine editors I've listed above have had. Therefore, if Wikipedia has pages on those zines, however many readers they may have had, and regardless of whether or not they've been mentioned in <i>The New York Times</i>, then Wikipedia <b>needs</b> to have an article in ZineWiki.Intheshadows 21:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. I'll try to be more clear: the argument you are presenting is the exactly what was presented four months ago and no one agreed with you. They thought the Portland Mercury article, along with the others, met notable criteria. Overwhelmingly. So presenting this recently failed argument with no extra evidence or effort makes no logical sense. What I ask of you, is what new evidence or argument can you present beyond the one that recently failed? From what I can tell, the article has only increased in notability.

<li>The Portland Mercury is a fairly large alternative paper owned by Index Papers, they also own The Stranger, Chicago Reader and a few other papers. It's home of (and partly owned by) syndicated columnist and radio host Dan Savage. They generally have a lot of paragraph sized articles and blurbs on notable national and regional subjects, which is what that was. It certainly was more than one sentence saying it exists. It's also had similar blurbs on the Punk Planet and Rivet Magazine websites. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> 06:24, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, you are completely wrong. It's unfortunate that as a Wiki editor you place so much importance on print articles, yet have absolutely no experience or knowledge of the industry you are relying on for evidence to support your opinion. You display a complete lack of understanding as to how editorial works at a large or mid-sized publication. To you when I say "blurb" it means "trivial," something without much editorial oversight and review. When I was the music editor at a mid-sized regional magazine, a website or print blurb meant an editorial highlight of the most significant, interesting, or entertaining event, band, album, etc. of the issue. Blurbs are short, usually with a 150-200 word limit in most print and web publications, but they are hardly insignificant. A blurb that runs is picked from a number of submissions by an editorial board, discussed in depth, and the most significant article is picked as the one that runs. It's edited, proofread, layed out, goes through copy editing, etc. just as every other article in a magazine. That's a blurb, it goes through the same proccess as a longer article, only it's shorter. It pains me to have to explain this in such detail, but only someone that has never worked in the media would call a blurb insignificant or trivial. Hell, that kind of talk could get you fired by your editor. If you are going to base your opinions on articles that have run in print publications, by all means, consider actually getting involved in the publishing industry so you can know what you are talking about. That way you may actually be able to contribute an informed opinion to this discussion instead of being so obviously wrong. Don't get me wrong, I love this discussion, although I feel even though I've put together a stronger and more logical argument based on experience in the subject at hand, I'm up against a small group of Wiki editors who ban together in support of one another rather than really thinking about the subject matter and it's significance. Have you actually contributed content to any articles about zines, magazines or the publishing industry? What's your depth of knowledge on the subject matter you so happily judge? Your rules put you in a very narrow and defined box that doesn't let you see the forest through the trees. And when it comes to the subject at hand, which really is zine and self publishing resources, you definitely are not the expert here on evaluating what is or is not a valuable resource. I come from the library/information science world, where experts in the field evaluate and select resources, rather than people like you, the security guards, who usually enforce rules by telling people they can't drink soda pop in library or they are talking too loud. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> 09:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Only people who have already committed themselves to fairly extensive involvement in the project get deep enough into the mechanics and politics of editing to read that material. As such, quoting them as gospel to newcomers to the project is intimidating, may be seen as hostile, and contradicts current guidelines: "Nothing scares potentially valuable contributors away faster than hostility or elitism".

<li><b>Keep</b> - The problem with asking for more credible sources from ZineWiki is that the Independent community has none, by your definition. We're rarely covered by the major media sources and our only history lies in what we remember and what we've recorded for ourselves in blogs and in 'zines. My question to you is; does this make it any less valid? Free media, true free media, is defined by the people and their right to free speech, to publishing underground papers and 'zines and their right to disseminate these works. Certainly, under major media attacks on the credibility of Wikimedia and its sources, one might feel the need to do away with all things which cannot meet so-called "higher standards", but one must also ask if this isn't overkill? I believe that ZineWiki is part of free media and therefore held to different standards of what can be considered credible. It's a resource to the independent community, for better or worse, and there-in lies its value. --Leafypie 01:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— Leafypie (<a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeafypie_c4ca.html" title="User talk:Leafypie">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leafypie_7ed2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leafypie">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<dd>The print media industry is dying. Believe me, I know, I've spent the last 20 year of my life in it publishing zines, newspapers and magazines as well as working in academic libraries. While you may be an expert at Wikipedia rules, my expertise lies in information science and publishing. I've lost tens of thousands of dollars trying to keep print publications alive, but our readers are moving every day away from magazines, zines and newspapers towards websites for news and entertainment. I've watched multi-million dollar library serials budgets move from print publications to online full-test resources. This point is non-negotiable as well, the online media is already taking over the print media, who's days are numbered. At some point Wikipedia will have to deem online news resources as credible media, and honestly, the point isn't now, it was two years ago. It's amazing how far ahead of Wikipedia the academic and commercial world are in this matter. ZineWiki has currently been written about in the following credible and verifiable media resources: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Portland_Mercury_ff6f.html" title="The Portland Mercury">The Portland Mercury</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_Planet_e401.html" title="Punk Planet">Punk Planet</a>, Rivet Magazine, the Underground Media Alliance and the Small Press Exchange. All have an extensive staff and editorial oversight. As someone that's owned, edited and published a magazine with paid staff, editorial oversight, and incorporation, I fully support the ZineWiki article. It's an amazing resource that pulls together in an encyclopedia form decades of independent publications, something you cannot find anywhere else online or in print. Obviously you are not a librarian, nor do you care about the independent press, but realize that for those of us that are and do, ZineWiki is a highly valuable resource. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan10things_9bb1.html" title="User:Dan10things">Dan10things</a> 03:07, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Before there was the internet, there was the 'Zine. Now, to clarify, the innovation of cheap photocopying created an explosion in the 'small press' that again magnified in the years when powerful graphics capable home computers became affordable BUT the internet was still limited and expensive to get on, or to have a webpage on. This golden era, around 89-94/96 had a renissance of zines. Ah, that young idealism again. bOING bOING...anyone? Yeah, I'm personal on this, I started doing artwork to put stuff in 'zines, then made my own on the computer when I got one, but printed and photocopied them. Comics, artworks, raving rants, etc. It sure beat trying to scale down things to almost Atari 2600 level, then pushing them through a dialup modem who's speed was crippled by companies (from the big dogs to the startups) who didn't FEEL like giving good speed to 'rural' people. I never had an ISDN, it went from 1200 baud to 56k to CABLE. However, I've had stuff published in zines here and there and my zines have reached around the globe. Zines still are an important element of culture, mainly as a bridge between the "Underground" and "Mainstream" and will become quite popular again when either the government or the big companies do a real assault/takeover on the 'net.

<li><b>Keep</b> The bulk of contemporary publishing for the last few decades has been zines. There have been more zines published than mainstream publishing - more variety and more innovation by far. Seeing mainstream publishing of mostly bad novels by a handfull of conglomerates, as all that is, is insular thinking. The world publishes zines more than novels. Zinewiki is a reflection of zines, which are the choice of most writers today. I have edited for zinewiki, and I think it has the same reason to be as wikipedia itself - it is an encyclopedia - in this case - of independent publishing. Zinewiki contains all the entries from the Zine Hall of Fame, that Musea started. It is a 10 year celebration of the best of zines. As editor of the 15 year old zine, Musea, I think Zinewiki is the major source of documentation on the major source of publishing of our era. An online encylopedia without zinewiki is an online encyclopedia that is denying the thousands and thousands of indie publishers that have made zines the key literary movement of the last few decades. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusea_e111.html" title="User:Musea">Musea</a> 01:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The section on Jefferson includes the relationship between him and Sally Hemings, which is covered extensively on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Hemings_cccb.html" title="Sally Hemings">Hemings'</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_jefferson.html#The_Sally_Hemings_controversy" title="Thomas jefferson">Thomas Jefferson's</a> pages. The accusation of rape is merely speculative. The accusation against Ronald Reagan contains only the account by the accuser. There is simply not enough evidence for this to be considered a notable accusation, an argument which is supported by the brevity of the section. Perhaps the only notable accusation on this page is the one against Bill Clinton, but that accusation is already covered on <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juanita_Broaddrick_fb76.html" title="Juanita Broaddrick">Juanita Broaddrick's</a> page. The accusation against Bush is a joke. The demented ramblings of a crazy person are non-notable.

<li>False and slanderous. I created the article for exactly the opposite purpose. Anon's kept jamming the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton articles full of this stuff. I got sick of it and decided to spin it off to a sub-article. <b>That</b> avoids the undue weight problem that was in fact present in the main articles. It certainly does not disparage, but makes quite clear that there's not much evidence in any of these notable accusations. It's plainly equal-opportunity politically, so I can't imagine what soapbox you think I was standing on. "Accusation" is not OR, what a bizarre statement, there clearly was an accusation. The article <b>reports</b> the accusation and the evidenced adduced for it elsewhere. It does not make the accusation itself. If you care to make an argument without shrill hysteria about the nefarious motives of other authors, it would be welcome. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It sounds to me like you were upset that anonymous users were vandalizing those pages with this stuff (as well you should be), so you created this page and filled it with the content with which these anonymous users were vandalizing the page.

<dd>No, I said nothing of the kind. It wasn't vandalism or I would simply have deleted it. This is a perfectly legitimate subject for Wikipedia; it meets all criteria. The problems was that the material violated the undue weight section of NPOV policy given the emphasis in the main article. I created this at approximately the same time that Arbcom itself recommended the <i>exact same remedy</i> for the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article. The point is to keep the main article on a subject to the main points; that doesn't imply that other lesser points can't be included elsewhere in Wikipedia.

<li><b>delete</b> POV fork to address vandals, undue weight, etc but POV fork nonetheless. It needs to be in the articles with apropriate weight which is less than a sentence. Or better yet, if the accuser is notable, it should be in the accusers bio and leave the details out of the presidents' bio completely. Even having an article that addresses presidential rape accusations is undue weight. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 01:30, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The accusations against Clinton have never been shown to be unreasonable and there's always been a lot to them. <s>To blather on about slander shows a partisan spirit and POV.</s> If accusations against the other presidents have something to them or don't, we might as well present them fairly.

<dd>But that's simply not accurate. The Reagan accusation received quite wide coverage at the time, though it was not widely believed. Jefferson is hugely well known and publicized, though it is admittedly of a different character than the others (and was added by someone else). Clinton goes without saying. The Bush accusation is the most tenuous; it surely would have gone without note in the pre-internet age. However, it is in fact widely known, and the coverage here does a public service I think because neutral coverage pretty clearly implies that the poor woman was desperately ill. Many of the highly partisan sources on the web make it sound like there was a cover-up. I personally think that none of these accusations is accurate, but then the article is not titled "rapes by presidents". <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think we can put the Clinton discussion to rest. It seems to be consensus that that accusation is notable. Jefferson's <i>relationship</i> with Sally Hemings is widely known, and it is clearly notable. What I don't like is that there is no evidence of rape in the article. Instead, the article quotes speculative sources, and in turn, appears speculative itself. I'm not sure that the Bush rape is that well-known. Should we include content every time a crazy person accuses the president of a misdeed (and I'm sure they've been accused of far worse deeds than rape)? <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablothegreat85_bfd1.html" title="User:Pablothegreat85">Pablothegreat85</a> 02:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some argue that consent is not possible between slave and owner, thus rape by modern standards. The point is arguable, but the accusation has clearly been made.

<li>Thanks for your AGF Mongo. I understand your concern. However, when a story has been covered by the likes of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times as each of the Reagan, Clinton, and Jefferson cases was, it's not indiscriminate information. It's already notable, we're not adding to that. Its notability that means we have a role to play as a neutral repository of information whether or not the accusations are true. Certainly a great many of the crazy claims against the Clintons are completely unsubstantiated and meritless, and yet we have articles on those which received national coverage and rightly so. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 04:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> - See first AFD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_superhero_film_and_television_series_fd08.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of superhero film and television series">here</a>. In the six weeks since the AFD closed there has been no improvement to the article, indeed, no edits at all other than a bot-assisted disambiguation. In re-reading the discussion from that AFD it's clear to me that the "delete" arguments were far superior, especially the arguments put forth by Serpent's Choice. With theatrical releases, re-releases, special editions, director's cuts, double dipping DVD releases with previously unreleased bonus footage, etc. there is no real clear consensus as to the running times for many of these projects. Add to that the concerns with how to count various projects featuring one character or another. Much was made in the previous AFD of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> that talked about Doctor Who being the longest-running sci-fi show, however, that citation indicates a fundamental misinterpretation of the BBC article. It was talking about what series had been on the air the longest with the most individual episodes, not what series, with all episodes run one after the other, would take the longest to get through. Many of the&#160;!votes to keep were based on sentiments like "it was kept the last time and that's good enough for me" (referring to a completely different AFD of a completely different article), ignoring the reality that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a>. Others talked about how <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> or interesting the article supposedly is, which are not strong arguments for keeping. Still others compared the article to other articles to justify its existence, which again is a <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">weak argument</a>. Finally, consider <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series_bd53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of fantasy film and television series">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series</a> for a similar article which was deleted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Questionable notability for this singer, she's released an album on an obscure label, "Starfisch Records" - most Google results for it are in connection with Karen Louise. Apart from the she was one of the support acts on a tour for a moderately successful band.

<p>Originally listed as a speedy and deleted by me as such, but after that I reversed myself and decided to give this the benefit of an AfD. There is no credible claim for this podcast meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and from what I can tell, the one "reference" in the article actually makes no mention of the podcast.

<li><b>Delete</b> Few (if any) podcasts are notable. I've only seen one mention of the podcast in my 2+ years on the VFTW boards, so its importance in the AI community is disputable. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 20:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> you were right with the speedy tag, actually - this is a fan review not an encyclopaedia article and the claim to notability is not credible - "one of the most popular" is completely unsupported by any kind of data. Plus the creator's only contribs are this and spamming podcasts to other articles. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Save</b> any help to make it a more encycopaedic article is welcome, as it is similar to 'Keith and the Girl', another podcast that is one of many listed. The new medium of podcasting will only grow, so more podcasts will need to be listed. Sound quality, production values, listenership, comments about the podcast are good enough for me. As for it being "notable"- that's highly a matter of personal opinion. Libsyn does not release figures to prove their audience, but itunes listeners have great comments about it, as do those on podcast alley.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Senatorsfan (<a href="../../../s/e/n/User_talk%7ESenatorsfan_2cd1.html" title="User talk:Senatorsfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Senatorsfan_8cf1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Senatorsfan">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Senatorsfan (<a href="../../../s/e/n/User_talk%7ESenatorsfan_2cd1.html" title="User talk:Senatorsfan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Senatorsfan_8cf1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Senatorsfan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Save</b> Not really sure how to use this site yet, but thought I would throw my 2 cents in. I'm a big fan of pottercast and mugglecast. This podcast may not be notable yet, but it is well on its way. I just listened to an episode and it is polished and well-produced. If it is deleted, try again next year.

<ul>
<li>Well, two reasons. Firstly, I generally prefer merges to be conducted outside of AFD. I know this is just a personal preference, but I think it allows for a merge to be performed with more deliberation and more participation from other editors. Secondly, <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a> sorts by year, whereas this article (which <i>really</i> needs to be renamed) sorts by country and city (formerly just city). The two are currently not redundant, as <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a> does not include information on failed bids prior to the 2000s. Ideally, all of this information should be in one article, but the problem as I see it is this: how can we merge all of the information into one place without reducing readability and usability? All of the information in this article <i>can</i> be merged into <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a>, but I don't see how the alternate presentation format can be preserved (simply converting to a sortable table won't suffice). Perhaps you can offer suggestions? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your points. How about adding another column for successful bids, and then simply adding the resulting table as a section in the Bids article? And regardless, as you say, this discussion doesn't really belong here. Shall we move it to the talk page of the article? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 13:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I speedied this earlier today but the author's made a potentially valid point on Talk:Scooping - since I've not got the knowledge to expand/cite it and s/he doesn't appear to be doing so I'm AfD'ing to give the 5 days to clean it up or provide material to clean it up. As I say on the talk page, if the author can provide sources I'll happily expand the article myself and request the AfD be withdrawn. Since (on <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarahpw4444_2bd6.html" title="User talk:Sarahpw4444">User_talk:Sarahpw4444</a>) the author says "I'm a semi-vandal too.

<p>None of these terms are actually neologisms or even protologisms.

Only one item is sourced, and its source doesn't assign any importance to the term, nor does it establish that the term is used in the general population, but rather is used by the Family Guy writers. In fact, the only term in the list that's even used in more than one episode is "giggity", but reducing a list to a single item is stupid, and in any case that's not a neologism. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_neologisms_on_Family_Guy_b0c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of neologisms on Family Guy">1st nom</a>. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Clemen," "dipsoluscious," "fastizio," "gatilsday," "giggity," "hic-a-doo-la," perhaps "sideboob," certainly "slappywag" and "tumorsyphilisitisosis" are all <i>Family Guy</i> neologisms, deserving of listing just as much as <i>Simpsons</i> neologisms. Even if it turns out that none of these were coined by <i>Family Guy</i> writers, <i>Family Guy</i> remains an important means of transmission and take-up for these terms and the show gets credit for them. Each item is sourced to the episode in which it appears, and prior to this second nomination, the article has had three other sources (not just "one" as the nom claims). The second source, alphabetically, [Delarte, 2005], which is mainly concerned with nitpicking <i>Family Guy</i> continuity, apparently finds "hic-a-doo-la" important enough to list as a "dictionary" entry (misspelled on page 29 with an extra H at the end, a correction was issued in August 2006!). [Callaghan, 2005] does indeed establish that "slappywag" is used by staff writers, not the general population. But if we limit ourselves to the main target demographic through the filter of myspace.com, Google searching gets the following number of results:</li>
</ul>
<p>clemen 1030</p>
<p>dipsoluscious 4</p>
<p>fastizio 209</p>
<p>gatilsday 0</p>
<p>giggity 72300</p>
<p>hic-a-doo-la 175</p>
<p>sideboob 1210</p>
<p>slappywag 303</p>
<p>tumorsyphilisitisosis 4</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm of course surprised by the lack of results for gatilsday, but even just four results for the hard-to-spell "tumorsyphilisitisosis" confirms that the general population will make an effort to take up <i>Family Guy</i> neologisms. In conclusion, I think it's a vulky idea to delete this article. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShutterBugTrekker_03a7.html" title="User:ShutterBugTrekker">ShutterBugTrekker</a> 21:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC) Frank Grimes will deflate each one of my arguments in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...</dd>

<li>I disagree. What Google tells me is that there are a number of Family Guy fans out there, which is hardly revolutionary information.

<li>"It speaks to the notability of one phrase being used as a ringtone." Yes. "Not the notability of that phrase." The phrase = the ringtone. "(or any other)." I'm not talking about any other phrase. "Being a neologism with a life outside of the show." If it isn't a family guy neologism, delete it, the ringtone and the article are definitely outside the show. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 06:05, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that people have Quagmire saying "giggity" on their phone doesn't make the phrase a neologism. It makes the phrase a popular thing to have on your phone as a ringtone. A friend of mine has "Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!" as a ringtone, but that doesn't make the phrase a neologism. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If it's not a neologism, remove it. This page should only contain neologisms.

The order is not an act of parliament, but has the same effect as if it was. If the proposed stations are on the route defined by the order, or on a different route defined by another order of the same kind, then I would argue that stub articles about the stations are legitmate rather than crystal-balling. As well, Great Bridge tram stop discusses the former railway station at the same location. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 05:18, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
