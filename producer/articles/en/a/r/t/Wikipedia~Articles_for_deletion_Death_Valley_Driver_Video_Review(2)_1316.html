<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>, bordering on "No result". This is an AfD of the worst kind where two or three editors simply continue a debate they were already having without getting any much input from anyone else. This isn't helped at all by the descent into namecalling, bold and capitals at the end. This debate is not very useful for determining any kind of outcome, does not lean clearly in the direction of a delete, and anyway the previous AfD is much more sane and useful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Delete</b>: As I said, it doesn't have the notoriety to be featured on Wikipedia. If we put every well known wrestling site that exists on here it would be clutter heaven. Where is Smarks/Rantsylvania? 411Wrestling? RajahWWF? SoCalUncensored? tOA (Otherarena.com)? Seriously, where are the entries for those web sites?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, there used to be an article on wikipedia for TheSmartMarks.com and it was since removed, presumably because it is a web site and that is all. It is not fair for a web site such as that to have its entry be removed from Wikipedia and this one to remain. TheSmartMarks reaches a FAR FAR FAR broader community as it is one of the most frequented message boards in the pop culture world. It even got its own official poker line recently (<a href="http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker" class="external free" title="http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker" rel="nofollow">http://thesmartmarks.com/partypoker</a>). Yet where's TSM's entry (which previously existed...if it calls for it I'll try to dig it up)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where's the articles for WrestlingObserver.com? PWTorch.com? The article itself is not exactly written from a neutral POV. It makes a small comment Lance Storm made out as if it was something that stirred up the entire <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>, when in reality it was so minor the fact that its spotlighted is a joke. The day Lance Storm "goes to war" against DVDR (as is indicated by "DVDR vs. Lance Storm") is the day the Internet's existence should just end...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even furthermore, SirFozzie, it is not fair for you to criticize me for trying to supposedly add comment after comment when just a few days ago you were editing my user page relentlessly to remove hostile comments you made a few weeks ago (such as "Don't know why I'm helping you since you decided since you weren't going to have your way with the article"---I've since reverted the page to the version it was before you removed those comments).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PS - Here are some recent threads about the downfall of DVDR: <a href="http://www.czwfans.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=10857&amp;highlight=dean" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.czwfans.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=10857&amp;highlight=dean" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have to go but I will post some more threads later on if I get the chance. There is another one I am having a lot of trouble finding. It is on CZWFans and illustrates my point that the site has suffered a grave downfall in reputation over the last few years, but I am having trouble finding the thread.</dd>

<dd>Again, I worked with you through several revisions on the talk pages of DVDVR and our talk pages to find a statement that would fit your request and reamin NPOV. The reason why I reverted my copying of how to list the article for deletion, is because if you look at the bottom of your talk page, the categories "Articles: Listed for Deletion"? Was trying to do you a favor because it was my fault that your page was so listed. If there are other such noteable communities.. why doesn't someone write them.. I'm not familiar enough with the sites to do it justice. (Resigning this since I can, thanks Bix) 24.62.82.234 20:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I find it difficult to understand the comments of "X and Y don't have entries, why should DVDVR?", that simply means people with the sufficient knowledge should spend their time in a more constructive manner and create entries if they feel so strongly about it, rather than engaging in a campaign against the DVDVR entry? <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasaki_9634.html" title="User:Sasaki">Sasaki</a> 22:20, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: In addition to what the above user posted, with regards to the earlier comment "Where is Smarks/Rantsylvania? 411Wrestling? RajahWWF? SoCalUncensored? tOA (Otherarena.com)?", according to alexa.com's traffic rankings, deathvalleydriver.com gets more traffic than any of those sites, and more hits than smartmarks.com as well.

<p>They look about the same.</p>
<p>Sir Fozzie - there are other notable communities (such as TSM) and someone did write an article on that but for some reason it was taken down. I also think that Kchase02 was right initially in that there isn't any evidence of any mainstream credibility for DVDR. <b>The point is that its not fair for one site's entry on Wikipedia to be removed while another one is still kept even though they have similar statistics.</b></p>
<p><b>The reason why I reverted my copying of how to list the article for deletion, is because if you look at the bottom of your talk page, the categories "Articles: Listed for Deletion"?</b> - That sentence doesn't make sense gramatically so I dunno what you mean. <a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB</a> 00:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: What constitutes "mainstream credibility"? There are many entries for independent wrestlers and promotions on Wikipedia which are less well known than DVDVR, should they be deleted as well? Should articles about say for example less well known jazz musicians be removed because they do not have "mainstream credibility"? <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasaki_9634.html" title="User:Sasaki">Sasaki</a> 03:08, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The mere FACT that Lance Storm has had a real life feud with this website because of its work-rate top 500 rankings should be more than adequate to show DVDVR belongs on Wiki. There are VERY obscure entries on VERY obscure artists, musicians, people etc that NO ONE outside their respective genre's would recognize, yet their articles stand. This whole AfD is the product of a few disgruntled users who were booted off the board, and whose names I will NOT mention here..though i will say one of them has a VERY uncivil remark on his User Page about DVDVR that Wiki, in its usual double-standard admin action theory, has YET to erase.</li>

<dd>This is a totally invalid point. Its a web site. He simply mentioned it, and I don't even think mentioned it by name. It's not a "Feud." Again, the point here is that there's a double standard. If TSMs entry was deleted, there's no reason why DVDR's entry should be kept either.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 12:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The SOLE Reason this article is even UP for deletion is because YOU have a personal grudge against it. Instead of being the bigger man and just letting it go, you are trying to take out your frustrations. The FACT is that Lance Storm did indeed have a VERY public feud with the website..the FACT is DVDVR IS one of the, if not THE biggest fan site devoted to wrestling on the planet..its gets MORE visitors and MORE Google hits than "The Smarks", which is a professionally maintained site. This whole process once again is a waste of time. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 17:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>TruthCrusader, why don't you first try to change your tone from this hostile manner and THEN come back and discuss the issue? <a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 20:56, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forget concensus, that's not the issue anymore. The issue is why is past Wikipedia precedent being violated by having this article be maintained while the Smart Marks entry was deleted.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 18:12, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for the scope of this AfD, I certainly would believe consensus is an issue, after all, that's what we're trying to reach here.. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 18:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said I'm fine with the afD being withdrawn but in that case I think a neutrality message should be placed at the top of the article.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 18:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You had a shot to work towards a NPOV before this, and instead decided since you couldn't get statements from other boards calling the admins Nazis into the article, that you would try to get it deleted. Again,, I worked with you for several go rounds before this started.. you aren't looking for a NPOV, you're looking for a Non-NPOV that supports your acucusations. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 19:12, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SirFozzie - <b>HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF CALLING ANYBODY A NAZI</b>. I don't appreciate your tone nor your lack of civility as it pertains to this issue. I have never nor would I ever call anybody a Nazi, let alone somebody who runs a web site.</dd>

<dd>How dare I? I dare because it's the truth. Remember this comment, you posted to my talk page? "Yes, we definitely do need to come to some kind of concensus or else we're gonna continue trading edits. It is not "unbias" to argue that the public perception of DVDR has drastically deteriorated over the past two years. Prominent message boards such as TheSmartMarks.com, CZWFans, ROHWrestling.com and many others have seen an influx of threads hating on DVDR. Just a few weeks ago there was a 2 or 3 page CZWFans thread where poster after poster after poster criticized the "Naziism" of the DVDR crew. Now obviously "naziism" is a stretch, but its not a stretch to say the general opinion of the board has very much changed for the negative as of late. So what do you see wrong with my wording in my edit?" <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 19:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>SirFozzie I don't know how you're able to get away with such blatant uncivility (sp?) on Wikipedia. You really have some cahonies, first to make this issue personal when it shouldn't be and then to accuse me of calling somebody a Nazi. The paragraph you quoted supports my statement that I have never nor would I ever call somebody a Nazi. <b>HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF CALLING ANYBODY A NAZI.</b> Talk about offensive... You may have missed <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> so please take a good look at those pages. <a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 20:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
