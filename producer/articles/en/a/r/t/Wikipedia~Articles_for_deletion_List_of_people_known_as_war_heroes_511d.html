<p>This list is not and has no potential to become encyclopedic. The concept of a "war hero" is inherently POV and, more often than not, dependent on specific cultural context. As such, this page is liable to become the breeding ground for edit wars. The page, at present, lists a somewhat random collection of soldiers without any apparent rhyme or reason. The page has lasted for at least eighteen months without the development or use of inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is so because there is no possibility of developing a satsifactory system that would be both neutral and useful. For most people heroism is not simply the effective discharging of one's duty. It implies something special, something particularly daring. Yet the phrase "war hero" seems to generally connote any effective military leader. On that grounds, this list might contain thousands upon thousands of generals and admirals, with endless debates over whether each one is "heroic" or "considered heroic." Therein lies the other problem. Someone who is heroic for one group of people is anathema to another. The British might still consider <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener_d207.html" title="Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> a war hero, but to many people of Afrikaner descent he's a war criminal. Which is he? Depends on who you talk to.</p>
<p>Brings me to my last point. This list, as it stands, is original research. It's a compilation based on subjective criteria and value judgements, which cannot be independently verified. We aren't here to judge who's a hero and who's not. Now, the link at the bottom to recipients of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>â€“<i>that's</i> useful. That's a list of people that the British consider heroic. This is a list of people that members of the Wikipedia community consider heroic. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 10:32, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this list is a dead loss. It can never be sufficiently comprehensive as to be fair. I agree that it is not and can never be encyclopaedic. Any value it has is easily outweighted by the counterproductive controversy and likely offence that it will cause. Keeping it will only result in further argument over who should be known as 'edit war heroes'. <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPperos_d8fc.html" title="User:Pperos">Peeper</a> 11:41, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but maybe not in this form, I was surprised by the 'worst movies ever' page, and how good that article was, this seems to be the same issue. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 16:45, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Let me suggest to the above two voters that what they really want is an article entitled "<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_hero.html" title="War hero">War hero</a>," which currently redirects to this list. At war hero there could be a discussion of what a war hero is, without attempting to create a list. This way, someone can read the discussed criteria and decide for themselves, who they think is a war hero. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 19:45, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I disagree with the above two votes. This can never be comprehensive or even consistent and therefore is inherently unencyclopedic. There is no standard for asserting someone is a war hero so who judges whom to include. Most of the soldiers who have died in Iraq are being called 'heroes'. Four Canadian soldiers who died in a friendly-fire accident in Afghanistan are referred to as heroes. Slaughtered Belgian Peacekeepers in Rwanda are considered Belgian heroes. None of these should really make this list - but <i>whose call is that going to be</i>? I say this should be tossed as a flawed enterprise. If it stays it should be renamed to List of people known as war heroes that we can think of with more to be added as they occur to us. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 16:58, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or at least retitled to "people declared by the media to be war heros". <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 17:30, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Is there any notable soldier that's not being called a war-hero in the media? It's too broad, it's too vague, it's too POV.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 17:52, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This list will always be POV and controversial. Also a war hero is a subjective definition. Usually war heroes are defined by the winning side of a war/conflict while the "heroes" of the losing side are usually eliminated from history.--<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelr31_1d76.html" title="User:Joelr31">Joelito</a> 18:00, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> just because it will be difficult to reach an impartial middle ground on this issue doesn't meen that we should ignore it. True, the line between hero and terrorist is similar to the line between rebel and revoltionary, like I said, difficult, not impossible... <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHoratioVitero_d804.html" title="User:HoratioVitero">HoratioVitero</a> 18:16, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
