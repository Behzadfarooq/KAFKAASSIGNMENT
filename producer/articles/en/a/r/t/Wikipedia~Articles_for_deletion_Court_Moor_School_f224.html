<li>I agree that it was rubbish, though two months is really much too short for any kind of organic growth--from experience I'd say that six months is a reasonable minimum. I removed the vanity stuff about the new headmistress and plonked in very brief summaries of what OFSTED and DFES have to say about the school. And the BBC league table for good measure. It's a very good, though not exceptionally good, secondary school.

If you, personally, don't like the idea that somebody might read about this school (as I have), you don't have to think about it. Just blank it from your mind and eventually the horrible memory will fade.

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, that is a collection of data. This distinction is actually important. Elsewhere (incidentally at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a> we have a definition: "'An encyclopedia is a written compendium of knowledge.' -- '... Knowledge is an appreciation of the possession of interconnected details which, in isolation, are of lesser value.'" The article in question presents a few facts, nothing more, nothing to put the data into context, and we should have the article deleted for those of us that want to keep Wikipedia an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 12:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I strongly disagree with this. The article describes the school as one of two of its kind in Fleet, it relates the school's educational performance to the local area and to the country, and the standards of teaching to the inspections that are carried out by OFSTED. The article is also categorized as a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_in_Hampshire_d41b.html" title="Category:Schools in Hampshire">Hampshire school</a>. It is thus simply incorrect to state that the article provides "nothing to put the data into context". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:40, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is nothing but a directory entry. It's "one of two of its kind in Fleet", so you say, now in which regard is it different from the other? Why would anyone prefer to go to <i>this</i> school instead of the other? The entry doesn't provide for an "encyclopaedic", i.e. well-rounded education. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collis_P._Huntington_High_School_886f.html" title="Collis P. Huntington High School">Collis P. Huntington High School</a> participated in the fight against segregation, but how is anyone who has read <i>this</i> entry better off? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:58, 3 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question "in which regard is it different from the other?" is easily answered. it's a completely different school. You seem to be arguing that an encyclopedia should server a pedagogic function--you ask how reading this article make someone better off (I presume this is intended to ask how does the reader learn an "improving" lesson). Well that isn't the function of an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia provides useful, verifiable information on a subject. This article does that. It doesn't set out to answer imponderable questions such as was Huntington High somehow better than Court Moor, or will the reader be "better off" for possessing knowledge--the reader who chooses to read the article can answer those questions himself if they're the kind of question that interest him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:38, 3 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An encyclopedia provides knowledge, not data, as in the quotation above. The entry reads as if it were taken from a directory of schools and thus is not up to scratch. In fact, it <i>is</i> mostly data from the OFSTED website. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:14, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A person reading the article by the time he gets to the bottom of the page will be aware that the academic and vocational performance of the school with respect to the local area and to the nation is rather good. It is true that is could also be described as data, but it is undeniably knowledge. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:37, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/e/WP%7EBEEFSTEW_1799.html" title="WP:BEEFSTEW">WP:BEEFSTEW</a> point H puts it down more succincly than I ever could. The OFSTED data is nothing <i>distinct</i>, nothing that sets it apart from other schools. Also see point I. It's disappointing if nothing can be said about a school <i>apart</i> from its OFSTED/DFES evaluation. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:14, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually that is one of the problems I have with BEEFSTEW. It's requirements are arbitrary and use words like "distinct" that tend to be interpreted in a non-intuitive manner by some who adhere to it. Schools are self-evidently distinct--they reside in different locations, they have different staff and students, they teach different ages, they teach different subjects and they provide different extra-curricular activities. Their academic performance is distinct and they have different connections to their respective communities. While you may be disappointed by a school article because it doesn't tell an improving moral lesson, or OFSTED figures bore you, I don't see this as a reason to delete an article. It's obvious to me, but not to you, that the OFSTED figures distinguish this school from the average. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:50, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We are discussing <i>articles on schools</i>, not schools themselves. (You are referring to "moral lessons", why is that?) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:24, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article makes the distinctions of the school clear, in my opinion. If it didn't then we wouldn't be able to say whether the school was distinct from any other (indeed we wouldn't even be able to discuss its name, location, school system, curriculum or OFSTED figures because those in themselves are distinctive). I use the term "moral lessons" because it's the only way I can interpret your earlier use of the phrase "but how is anyone who has read <i>this</i> entry better off?" in the context of a school in which clearly a person who reads the article has absorbed some information about the school. It seemd to me that, since knowing that the school was considerably better than the run of English schools didn't seem to qualify as being "better off", you must be using some other meaning of the term, and so I plumped for the moral dimension. I did mention this conundrum at the time. Feel free to be more specific. I feel better off for knowing that the school is in Fleet, a town I know reasonably well, and is considered a good school. Since the information could be useful to me and was acquired as no cost to myself, I consider it excellent value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:27, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. And the other Fleet school is Calthorpe park. I went to that school and it is absolutely NOT notable. Oh yes, hang on, I forgot it does have a swmming pool next to it that was incorporated into the old sports hall. Smoking was prohibited but the sports hall allowed students at Calthoprpe Park to stay hidden while smoking. Could Court Moor be notable as having a lower rate of lung cancer in it's alumni? I'm sure this could be verified if we document all the deaths in fleet over the last 25 years. I suggest one distinct page for each alumnus with a discussion of whether they were non smokers etc. What a great collection pages that would make to go along with all the school pages.

<p>The <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet%2C_Hampshire_f57d.html" title="Fleet, Hampshire">Fleet</a> page previously mentioned the area schools in this manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet%2C_Hampshire&amp;oldid=22464085" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet%2C_Hampshire&amp;oldid=22464085" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>:</p>

<dd>The town has a number of schools including Heatherside, All Saints, Velmead, Calthorpe Park and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_Moor_School_d6f8.html" title="Court Moor School">Court Moor School</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rather than linking all these schools to their own page such as Court Moor School. It is much simpler to link to the OFSTED data set. The <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet%2C_Hampshire_f57d.html" title="Fleet, Hampshire">Fleet</a> page could more easily, and informatively, address the schools in this manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet%2C_Hampshire&amp;oldid=22798553" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet%2C_Hampshire&amp;oldid=22798553" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>:</p>

<p>Obviously if one of these schools has something exceptional to expand the 'knowledge' in wikipedia beyond the 'information' in the OFSTED database then it warrants it's own page. There is nothing in the current Court Moor School page that can be regarded as knowledge over information. If information is the priority for wikipedia then bus timetables etc. should be acceptable. Even stock prices that change on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Why is it better to link to schools that do not add to the information already in the OFSTED databases? This has the advantage of being vandal free and up to date. Note that the main reason would be for the information to be current. One might argue that the links will be vandalised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Silensor#Why_not_link_to_OFSTED.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Silensor#Why_not_link_to_OFSTED.3F" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. This is true but it is still preferable to having the actual information on a wiki page. If I vandalise a link it is clear since the link will not work. If I change a data point on the page from 15% to 25% it is not obviously vandalism and might even be considered a legitimate update. Once the Court Moor School page has more than OFSTED and DFES data on it's page then it will be worth keeping. For now I do not see the problem of having it associated only with the Fleet page. i.e. merge or redirect to that page. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 23:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
