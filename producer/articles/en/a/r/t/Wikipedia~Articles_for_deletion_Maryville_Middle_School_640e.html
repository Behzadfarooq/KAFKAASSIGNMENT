<li>There is no bloody cabal, deletionist or otherwise. Nobody is organizing keep or delete votes on school articles or any other, and the "Association of Deletionist Wikipedians" (just like the "Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians) is more or less a tongue-in-cheek reference to the good-faith disagreement between Wikipedians about what is appropriate encyclopedic material. I daresay you, Yuckfoo, and Kappa aren't conspiring "Inclusionists" any more than Denni, Dunc, and I are conspiring to annoy you personally by nominating schools for deletion. Please stop being intentionally divisive and realize that everyone here, whether they agree with you or not, is acting in good faith.

<li>In fact, I'm even more mystified. Of the people on the meta AoDW page, <i>one</i> (Denni) regularly votes to delete school articles. Dunc occasionally votes to delete, and purplefeltangel feels that all high schools are encyclopedic topics. Really, don't take those pages too seriously.

<li>And despite Nicodemus' likely desire to ignore it, I do vote to keep school articles. Of three articles on AfD on one day last week, I voted to keep all three. This, I believe, demonstrates that I am willing to do something I would not have done in times past - accept that there is a place for articles on schools. I remain convinced, however, that school articles are subject to the same inclusion criteria as <b>all other articles</b>; that is, they are about notable subjects, and they have sufficient content to avoid speedy deletion per CSD:G1 or CSD:A1. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>100 "no consensus" results doesn't mean a consensus to keep; it means that the articles are being kept until consensus is established.

<li>However, there is an 85%-90% <b>precedent</b> to "not delete" school articles on the specious criteria of either being a stub or being "non-notable" (in the subjective opinion of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles"). This circumstance is a product of the application of WP policy, in that some 40% of those articles were closed as "no consensus" and are thusly "not deleted". The <b>fact</b> that school articles are simply not deleted on the basis of either being a stub or being "non-notable" is clearly not accepted by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" is truly baffling. Despite my repeated questioning of why the <b>precedent</b> clearly established by the utilization of the AfD process and the implementation of WP policy is continutally disregarded, I have yet to read a single response that justifies the chronic war of attrition that is being waged against school articles, other than the repeated assertions that they are "non-notable" and that individual editors oppose the existence of the articles themselves. My question is (re-stated): "In the face of <b>overwhleming precedent</b>, why do "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" continue to nominate and vote to delete them? - What is achieved by these repeated nominations other than the continuation of a (clearly lost) battle? - How does nominating and voting to delete school articles that clearly will not be deleted in any way contribute to Wikipedia?"--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:04, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are referring to individual discussions of individual schools. In some cases, there has been consensus to keep and in some there has been consensus to delete. There is no consensus on any policy as to <i>which</i> schools should be kept.

<li>We have a good faith belief that all schools should be kept, just as all countries are kept, even the smallest, so there is no need for more detailed criteria.

<li>It is absurd to compare deletion of a school article to deletion of a country article. You may have a good-faith belief that school articles should be kept, but that is just what it is, a belief. There is no hard and fast policy that school articles should be kept, and in fact there isn't even a clear consensus to do so. And your intransigent attitude toward compromise will get you nowhere here. I am probably the hardest-core deletionist here, but my ability to obfuscate and stonewall is dwarfed by people such as yourself, who have moved not a millimetre in the direction of a middle ground for school articles. While I have demonstrated my willingness to accept in principle that school articles have a place in Wikipedia, I have seen not the slightest suggestion of a complementary gesture from the inclusionists that perhaps school articles should have to meet certain criteria, as all other articles here do. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because it conflicts with what is objectively true.

Explain how a neighborhood grocery store is any less deserving of an article then this school? It effects more people's lives then this school, and exists... so it seems to meet the criterion that are the basis for this school having an article. Why you think this is a straw man argument is beyond me.

<li>I don't think it is less deserving. I just think that YOU think that your Albertson's store doesn't merit an article, based on the history of your arguments about schools and other institutions.

Yelling 'Assume Good Faith' at people does not excuse you from explaining your actions, and making a habit of it will convince people that you're acting in bad faith."</i>. You cried "Assume Good" faith when accused of the hoax you later admitted to, so please give it up.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A school is not a grocery store. This argument stems from a misconception of what a school is. Schools have an existence quite apart from the simple bricks and mortar from which they are constructed. Schools are social institutions with distinct cultures and histories which often extend beyond the life any any individual person or building which forms part of that institution. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 00:09, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>While what you say is true of SOME schools it is not true of all schools. I've seen plenty of schools closed as quickly as a KMart and with as little consequence to their community as a store closing would have.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 00:13, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What a nice piece of dreamwork I see here. Schools no more have "distinct cultures" than Safways do. Except for the obvious differences between, say, a rich suburban school and a poor inner-city school, you can pretty much exchange one school's culture with the next and find zero real difference. If there were a big difference in histories, I would expect to see that reflected in the content of school articles. But despite reading over a hundred school articles (no word of lie, I read every school article Wikipedia currently possesses for California and Texas), I saw nothing to demonstrate that most schools have a distinctive history beyond differences in their opening dates. In fact, one of the biggest differences I saw between schools, based upon the information that these articles contained, was their school colors and mottos. While I'm sure the reality of the situation is different, it's a sad comment on the dismal quality of most school articles here. As far as I am concerned, if schools are important, it is incumbent upon the authors of these articles to convince us of that importance or be prepared to see their articles deleted for lack of content. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:14, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
