<p>"They came here under work permits during the British rule while the British had promised the Malay sultanates that the immigrants were to return to their countries once their work permits expired."</p>
<p>In my knowledge of history of Malaysia, some immigrants (often Indians) came at their own expenses to travel to Malaya to work (source:Form4 History textbook and umm chapter 10). Therefore, not all immigrants came with work permits and did not promise to return to their home country. Sandakanboy 15:02, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While copyediting, I found this sentence..."Eventually, the Tunku decided to ask Lee to secede from Malaysia. Eventually, Lee agreed to do so, and Singapore became an independent nation in 1965."</p>
<p>Should this read "Eventually, the Tunku decided to ask <b>Singapore</b> to secede from Malaysia." rather?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well, the disagreement was more with Lee than with Singapore, which is what makes this whole crap so frustrating. We actually have a very long article (<a href="../../../p/a/p/PAP-UMNO_relations_224c.html" title="PAP-UMNO relations">PAP-UMNO relations</a>) devoted to just trying to describe the relations between the governing political parties of Malaysia and Singapore. Anyway, I'll try to copyedit that sentence. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:10, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have finally had enough time to finish copyediting this article. Most of my changes in the final few sections are fairly minor but I do have a few questions and suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph under the section "Meritocracy" discusses matriculation. I presume this is solely in reference to higher education so I have changed it to read that way. Though I'm still unsure exactly what is meant by this...Is this simply students entering into colleges and universities or does it go beyond that?</li>
<li>You do not explain the PKR's reason for speaking against the NEP in the Present Opposition section.</li>
<li>You mention Hishmuddin brandishing the keris twice in the article. First in the Meritocracy section and then again in Present Opposition. Should it be repeated?</li>
<li>With an article that describes such a controversial subject, there is a great need to use inline citations in order to be completely NPOV. The citations I used in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandan.html" title="Mandan">Mandan</a> are probably the easiest to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fine article! Keep up the good work! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">''*Exeunt*'' Ganymead</a> [[User_talk:Ganymead|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;Dialogue?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Matriculation refers to courses students sit for before entering university itself, so matriculation here is a bit different than in other countries. I've fixed up PKR's stand on the NEP, and removed the accidental duplication of the Kerismuddin incident. I'll cite inline sources when I have more free time. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:36, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I just want to expand on the subject of matriculation in the context of Malaysian's education (bare with me, this is my first contribution!). Matriculation can be seen as the path that a student wishes to take after they have completed their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), or the Certificate of Higher Education, to continue on with their education. Usually, in this case, their entrance to university. However, as a student could choose to study locally or abroad, the path to enter these higher institute of learning are different. Each matriculation is tailored to allow a student to enter the university of their choice. Thus a student would do an A-level if they wish to study in the UK or the SAT for the USA. For any local university, a student would sit for their Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) which is the entrance exam to an local university. All these different path to enter University courses are generally known as Matriculation.</p>

<p>Very well-written and interesting article; I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the lead section, it says "Technically, discussion of abolishing Article 153 is illegal...", but this isn't explained later. Doesn't the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Malaysia_0da0.html" title="Parliament of Malaysia">Parliament of Malaysia</a> has the power to amend the constitution with 2/3 majority, including this article, let alone discuss about it?</li>
<li>What are the social effects of this Article 153 and the policies? For example, is this the main reason why many non-Bumiputra students are studying abroad (including many wikipedians!) and why there are so many private colleges in Malaysia?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 11:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paragraph 3 of subsection "Present opposition" explains the legality (or lack of it) regarding the discussion of Article 153. I wouldn't know about Parliament, as the constitution doesn't explain it - it merely authorises Parliament to ban discussion of abolishing Article 153, which Parliament did by passing the Sedition Act. As for the social effects, not much <i>credible</i> writing is available on Article 153. There are a lot of rantings about it, but most of them tend to pertain to Mahathir and the NEP, or just make blanket accusations about Article 153 and related provisions of Malaysian law. As a result, any in-depth writing on Article 153's social effects would be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>They read awkwardly. It reads as though "there was great inequality in 1970, so the commission made a recommendation. It didn't work, and therefore there was rioting in the late 60s." I think the 1970 stats are only being cited as an example of the inequality that led to the rioting, but it reads as though the commission made the report around 1970.

<p>In this excellent article I have noticed that the history and backgrounds of the article are very well explained. However, could some data be produced on the longterm effects of the policy? For instance I heard that (as is mentioned) the rural Malays did not profit very much from it, however I also heard that the rural Indians are not very well off at all. Some say suffering under it......</p>

<dd>Agreed. I read a lot of this article, and it's pretty interesting and very well-written. Never even knew about it before. Something so controversial should have had a lot more non-NPOV around, but this is pratically 100% NPOV. Great friggin' job. 67.68.153.41 04:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I brought this issue up earlier.

<p>I have two issues I didn't notice earlier. One is the concept of "ostensibly maintaining support" which doesn't logically flow with the concept of "against the implementation" of Article 153; does someone mind correcting this, as I don't know what the specific nuance in meaning is intended for. Secondly, it concerns that the UMNO retaliated the PAP's running for federal elections in Malaysia; I believe it is the other way round, that the PAP retaliated against UMNO for running for Singapore's state elections, so the PAP decided to run in the federal elections (winning one seat). Or were there three elections? Can the dates be cross-referenced from the <a href="../../../p/a/p/PAP-UMNO_relations_224c.html" title="PAP-UMNO relations">PAP-UMNO relations</a> article and forth, because it's slightly ambiguous in that area. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 22:15, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Natalina is right about the elections, Singapore's election was in September 1963 <a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/past_parliamentary.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.gov.sg/past_parliamentary.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, Malaysia election was in April 1964.

<dd>It is roughly the same; they were engaged in political conflict. Does it really matter? ;-) Either way is fine by me, although I prefer "retaliation" as it represents the hostile mood then. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 22:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have a letter in my possesion, scanned here, from a Malaysian university. I am unable to find any English sources from the govt websites of malaysia that supports one way or the other the malaysian law against <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shias</a> that the letter talks about.</p>
<p>I think this is not a federal policy, but rather a local state policy. But I cannot verify it.</p>
<p>Can anybody help verifying this?--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 01:18, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure. Why was the address censored out? Johnleemk would probably be able to help you on this - I am not sure whether the Shi'a/Sunni distinction applies in Article 153. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 02:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IIUM is a private university funded by the Malaysian government. Anyhow, I don't see what this has to do with Article 153. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:50, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is clearly a case of religious discrimination. The Shi'ah denomination is proscribed in Malaysia with some local adherents actually put under administrative detention under the Internal Security Act. Nonetheless, I agree with John, it is discrimination but not within the interpretation of Article 153. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobK_c52c.html" title="User:BobK">Bob K</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobk_c01a.html" title="User talk:Bobk">Talk</a> 10:55, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikisource includes the full text of Article 153 - do we need to include it here? As I understand it, an encyclopedia does not usually contain such extensive quotations from primary sources (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>); in addition, the formatting of the beginning of the lines looks rather odd to me from 8 onwards (I see open bullet points - "o" - before 8(a), (b) and (c); then "1. (8A) ..."; then "9 (9) ..."; then "1. (9A) ...").</p>
<p>I appreciate that this article is partly about disputes over the meaning of the text, and that it is a relatively obscure text, but it is already freely available at Wikisource. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:55, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Last sentence of last paragraph of the article introduction: <i>Malaysia has escaped the riots that have plagued other multi-cultural countries in Southeast Asia</i>.</p>

<dd>Surely you misunderstood the context of the sentences, and most likely the paragraph. The context of the article is set in the late 1990s. Try to read that the whole paragraph again, keeping in mind that the NEP was introduced after 1969. Moreover, the article refers to allegation by its supporter - it's a positive statement, not normative. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarth_60b0.html" title="User talk:Earth">Talk</a>)</sup> 04:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
