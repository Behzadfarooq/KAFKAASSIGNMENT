<li><b>Keep</b> — Article contains information that couldn't be readily displayed in a category. It would be useful for the page to be limited to noted practitioners.

<dd>Note: even though I vote "keep", I'm really annoyed by the <i>very poor</i> quality of this list. Like a bunch of other "feel good" lists where the goal is to stick on as many names as possible (by editors who want people "like them" listed), this one had a bunch of names lacking <i>any</i> evidentiary support. I've been working on improving it, but I fear a backlash (I've had such from LGBT and born-again Christian lists, where the "feel good rather than evidence" editors pushed an agenda).</dd>

<dd>What I fail to understand is, if Jews are a "nationality," why can't they just have a list by country and categories like every other nationality/ethnicity on Wikipedia has (and seems to be satisfied with)?

<dd>Pages get created because editors create them, no? I created that article because it <i>should</i> exist on WP.

<dd>Btw, Antidote, I agree with most of the delete votes you have cast recently. I don't like overbroad lists or categories. So <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_Americans_735d.html" title="List of African Americans">List of African Americans</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a> are definitely no good. Well, neither is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> worth keeping. Actually, modify that: the catholics one is just a list of lists, no names are directly at the top, so I don't mind it. However, I find that a ethicity, religion or nationality followed by an occupation is sufficiently specific. So "List of &lt;Nation&gt;ish &lt;Foo&gt;ers" seems fine to me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:18, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the same way that you and I dislike broad lists, I dislike overly specific and redundant lists that could EASILY be made into categories. I just don't understand what is all the fuss with these Jewish lists; people are literally making new usernames to keep them on here. The deletion of these lists doesn't change much of anything in terms of listings, as there are literally dozens of others with the same people. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 00:13, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is something weird about some of the reaction to the Jewish lists/categories. Sometimes you see "hysterical keep" reactions, with unfounded accusations of anti-semitism bandied about (for either keep or delete votes actually, oddly enough). So deleting List of Jewish basket-weavers might be "another Shoah", while the anon voter 65.9.143.76 above seems to insinuate that it's a racial slander to note that some Jews are bankers or lawyers.</dd>
<dd>That said, I <i>do</i> think that sometimes lists are better than categories, or at least slightly different. When I created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_American_jurists_528f.html" title="List of African American jurists">List of African American jurists</a> today, I was careful to annotate each name with a helpful one-line description of the main accomplishments of each individual. Of course you can find out much more by reading their full article, but you can't get the one-line bios by looking at a category. Of course, my AA jurists are <i>very</i> partial right now—I just added a very minimal set of scholars and judges who came to mind. But if it is extended with similar annotations, I think it would be worth browsing through. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:08, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Much of the legal system in many countries is strongly influenced by canon law, which in turn is strongly influenced by Jewish law.
