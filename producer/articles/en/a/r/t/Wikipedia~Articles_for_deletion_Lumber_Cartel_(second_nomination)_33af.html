<li><b>Comment</b> To nitpick <i>further</i>, it is only a vote with respect to the question of overturning/relisting, ie. whether further discussion is required. To do anything else, it requires typical consensus. By definition, on the first question only (of overturning vs. endorsing), a DRV consensus does equal a simple majority, and -- in that limited purpose -- the terms are interchangeable.

<li><b>Keep</b> As before.

<dd>as we pointed out before. The Wired article isn't credible per their management, and the Salon article isn't an article on the Lumber cartel. Its simply mentioned in passing and other then stating that they spoke out against the DMA, contains no other usable information in relation to this group. Simply establishing existence by a credible source does not give license to use whatever source you want to present facts about that subject.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wired article requests information: if there were a real problem the article would surely have been pulled. The Salon article devotes an entire paragraph in a not-particularly-long article to the "Lumber Cartel", hardly a mere "mention-in-passing". Your querulous attempts to forbid the use of Usenet messages as evidence of their own contents (which is the real situation here: we're not using that content as further evidence of anything else; <i>that</i> argument lies elsewhere) is becoming tedious.

<dd>1 paragraph out of 3 pages? There are a total of 32 paragraphs in the article (some are longer some are shoter), which means its got a grand total of about 3% of the article. That is trivial, even if its not trivial, it establishes nothing other than the fact that a group called themselves that and had those opinions. The wired article does ask for information, but doesn't say whether or not that article was one they couldn't find sources for. However the fact that they're asking for sources in relation to that article does indicate they had trouble with the sources on it. They don't specify what they need sources on, or what the problem is, but it does taint the article and make it a dubious source.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, and you keep misunderstanding this (which makes one wonder if it's deliberate): Google Groups presents as an accurate archive of the messages which were posted to Usenet. The issue here is whether particular messages contained particular text: whether that text <i>itself</i> contains accurate information is another layer of verifiability altogether. The analogy could be drawn with messages in a foreign language: there's a step between ensuring that you have the correct message <i>in the original language</i> and ensuring that you have an <i>accurate translation</i>.

<dd>I'm not questioning the accuracy of the archive. I'm questioning the accuracy of the original posts. Using them from google groups would be no different than using them from usenet. Since google does nothing other than package them up, there is no difference. Prior to this debate WP:RS read that usenet posts were not to be used as primary or secondary sources (the wording has since been changed by someone involved in this debate) and since google groups doesn't do anything to the posts, its no different than usenet. This article does more than say "People talked about the lumber cartel on usenet". It goes on to make accusations against individuals based on "facts" provided in those posts. There is a world of difference there.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:23, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> in its present form. I've raised important issues on the talk page which remain unanswered. It is not clear whether this is an article about 1) the Lumber Cartel or 2) about Usenet chitter chatter. If the former, then Usenet is not an acceptable source. If the latter then Usenet can be used as to show Usenet rumour, without any implication that it's fact. At the moment it is claimed that it is about 2) but in fact that material is used to substantiate 1) in complete violation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a>. Thus Duane Patterson is implicated on the basis that <i>someone on a google group said that he was sent something by his General Manager who got it from a wannabe spammer who got it from Duane Patterson</i>. This would be laughable, were it not being used seriously as verification.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 17:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Without even reading the article I know this is about Sanford Wallace saying e-mail spam is going to save the forests and therefore the "lumber cartel" is plotting to put him out of business.

<dd>Actually my problem is with the fact that this is (among) the best the keepers can come up with. This article has been through process for quite some time, AfD, DRV and now AfD again, with ample keep voters, and all the sources it cites are five scraps? I see 2 homemade websites, 2 articles where LC is "mentioned", i.e. not the central subject of the article, and one article where the magazine itself disclaims <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliability</a>.

<dd>He put forth how many posts were made as some evidence of notability. I'm well within my right to call that into question. By your own admission this is only notable within a small group. Most notability guidelines read, that regardless of the subject require it to be the subject of multiple non-trivial articles, reports, etc. Its only non-trivial coverage is Wired, and even that is honestly trivial. While its mentioned in the opening its not really covered as the subject of the article. However if we allow for it to be non-trivial, the rest of the coverage is trivial and it wouldn't pass any kind of notability guidelines.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There's barely twice that amount of posts referencing <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a> in that same period. 1.2% of all posts mention Godwin's Law. Is that notable? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 17:29, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Godwin's law is also covered extensively outside of Usenet. It gets 340,000 google hits while Lumber Cartel gets 20,400. So yes, it is notable in comparison. Though I'll remind you that we're discussing this article, not Godwin's Law.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:33, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Edit conflict) The argument about lack of verifiability is an absolute one, not a relative one. In absolute numbers (and in quality terms), Microsoft easily jumps verifiability/NPOV hurdles.

<dd>I'm neutral on verifiability, though trialsanderrors sees WP:V issues. I certainly don't see notability here from anything you've shown, or I've pulled up on google search.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is clearly a verifiability issue. Notability is a judgment call and established by consensus. Verifiability is a policy that overrides consensus. The test is simply can I, who have heard never of the term before, check the reliable sources in the article and verify that the term is used in the way it is presented? And as it is, the number of reliable sources that help me determine this is zero. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you believe that your reasoning correctly reflects Wikipedia policy, you are misreading Wikipedia policy. We do not delete articles about known phenomena simply because someone is able to interpret Wikipedia policy in such a manner as to require an unattainable level of verifiability of those phenomena. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 19:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers.

<dd>"Compatible with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>" is not the same as "reasonable".

<dd>My evidence is your belief that the Lumber Cartel article must be deleted on the basis of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> policy.

<dd>You don't seem to understand the meaning of evidence. I don't see a policy WP:What User Tony Sidaway Thinks or a policy WP:General handwaving.

<dd><b>Please remain civil</b>. If you don't recognise when I'm citing Wikipedia's deletion policy, my apologies. "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" has long been a subcategory in the list of "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed" in that policy. If there is a suitable article to merge to (I cited one such above) then we don't delete.

<dd>We're obviously seeing things completely differently. I see no verifiability problems; indeed there is ample primary and secondary material to support provenance, period and usage. As I said earlier, if you think Wikipedia needs more verifiability than this then your interpretation of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> policy can be said, with a high degree of confidence, to be invalid. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article doesn't make any claims to that effect. It just says, to paraphrase, "It's a conspiracy theory that spammers came up with and then anti-spammers appropriated it to make fun of them."

<li><b>Delete</b> - It's a buzzword and a meme which hasn't seen any use outside of USENET for six years; One article it uses to establish notability has source disclaimers; Another smells of a olden-age scamsite with its flamboyant exclamation, flashing lights, long sidebars, and buzzword usage <i>(Does it meet <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>?)</i>; And the last is, at most, a passing and aged reference.

It satisifies neither. And, finally, "Who cares about the Lumber Cartel?" Does anyone at all outside of USENET care about the phrase? It hasn't become commonplace in anti-spam efforts, it hasn't been mentioned at <b>all</b> in a published article <i>(Neither the WIRED or SALON articles appear to have been included in the respective print issue.)</i>...
