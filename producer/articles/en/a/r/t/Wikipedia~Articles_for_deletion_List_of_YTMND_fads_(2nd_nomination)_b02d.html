<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirect to <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>.</b> This was a long discussion with lots of anons and newbies. However, it seems clear to me that the consensus <i>among experienced editors</i> was that this is not an article and should not stand alone. However, since some folks mentioned the possibility of a partial merge, I think closing this by redirecting is better than by deleting. This way we preserve the history for anyone who wants to try to merge. I discounted people who gave no reasons, or reasons like "we have even worse articles"- this is not an argument for keeping. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:04, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>rename</b> (Yes, I know I just made the vote 1-1-1). YTMND fans are a little full of themselves. Nothing YTMND has ever spawned has been popular enough to even register as a "fad". I would have voted for delete but kietotheworld makes a very good point above, that this keeps out dozens of little YTMND-fancruft subpages. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 21:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a>. The list has grown way too long with some entries not really counting as fads. I suggest us list the largest fads (top 15 "hall of fame" fads) in the fads section of YTMND, then redirect the article. If we really would like a list of YTMND fads, might as well use www.ytmnd.com/wiki/index.php?title=YTMND_Fads&amp;action=history the list on YTMND's wiki (which was merged from the article on the 11th). Then link it from the YTMND article's "External links" section. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 22:30, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this page was made because the <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> page was getting too long. I see no difference between this and any other page that was split because of the main article being too long. Furthermore, if you go to the talk page you will see that the page has been listed as a source for articles twice. And lastly, as, kietotheworld said, it will discourage creation of each individual fad page which will definitely happen if this is deleted or redirected.<a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is composed entirely of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and so the content does not belong on Wikipedia at all, let alone in its own article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 23:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Every fad listed is (or if it isn't already can be) linked to a YTMND or several YTMND's as a source, hence it not being OR. As far as YTMND pages being a reliable source, obviously they cannot be one for anything EXCEPT proving their own existence, which is exactly what it would be doing in this case. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 23:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Virtually none of them are so sourced, nor is there an indication that they ever will be. More importantly, the judgement that a fad <i>is a fad</i> is original research which cannot be backed up by a couple of links; it is a synthesis of the entire site, which we are incompetent to provide without secondary literature. The organization of the article is also OR; how are we to judge what is "most popular"? It's a joke. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll agree that the way it is currently presented is OR as to what constitutes a fad. Perhaps it should state a requirement to be considered a fad is a certain number of keywords or another such measure. Popularity can be determined by keyword count as well. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 05:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Only the major fads deserve mention, and should be on the main <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> page. The fact that people will make their own pages for the fad is irrelevant. They'll just get deleted (speedily, too, no doubt). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 23:19, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Absolutely delete.</b> Listcruft, no sources, few if any claims to notability, few enough that they could be included at the main article. Let's not give webcruft a beachhead. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 02:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly keep</b> It clarifies many of the fads for someone who does not know about YTMND. If you must get rid of this page, at least merge it with the main article. Lalala1087 <i>(Four edits, three to this AfD) <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a></small></i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as JDoorJam. These rather sad derivative works do not become fads by mere association with the original YTMND. To qualify as a fad requires popularity (or at least <i>awareness</i>) outside its core constituency. These fail that simple test, because no-one gives a toss. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Memes are unencyclopedic bullshit that no one gives a damn after a few weeks, apart from the Drama types who think that funny pictures on the internet should be documented forever because they profoundly affected their un-lives. However, if we delete this list of things that only the die hard YTMND guys care about, then it's bound to crop up in the main article, and unbalance it. So whereas I don't want to see this list on Wikipedia, it may be a necessary evil. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 08:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Totally sub-trivial, unencyclopedic. Sample line: "<i>Adverb, inkdrinker, and tehpwner2, three YTMND users who downvoted almost every single site that they came across. Inkdrinker, being the most infamous due to his comments on each page he gives a 1 to.</i>" Are there really people out there who think this is what an encyclopedia article should be like?!? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If this article is deleted we'll have even more trouble monitoring the vandalism that YTMND members constantly hurl upon Wikipedia, not only that but we'll also need to monitor individual fad articles, I say we keep this article and sever a finger so that we can save the arm. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheChimp_9994.html" title="User:TheChimp">TheChimp</a> 16:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> This is a very good reference for people who use YTMND. True, the article does need some clean up, but memes and fads are part of the Wikipedia, are they not? If not then there are many many articles that need to be promptly deleted. Also, I doubt that anybody would argue that YTMND is not a highly visited and influential website. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigeriz_34b4.html" title="User:Tigeriz">Tigeriz</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This site is an excellent reference and has helped me find the names of many songs from YTMND fads. I think it's important to keep it! Ohana 03:02, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> However, this could use something of a clean-up. Some time ago, it was very nicely organized - of course, it got deleted. If it is deleted, I'd suggest the notables be stuck under the YTMND main article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Is anyone actually going to clean this up? Because not being a YTMND forum member, which seems to be the sole requisite of knowing what a fad is, I'd just delete everything.

<li><b>Keep</b> Every fad is sacred, every fad is great. Although they may just pop up and disappear. One get's a much better understanding of ytmnd if you know the old fads.

<li>We're not an indescriminate collection of info, either. A list like this should be kept, just not here. Useful doesn't always mean encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 19:51, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge notable content with YTMD. If the YTMD article is getting "too long" then it needs trimming, rewriting, etc.: spilling over into a list is not the answer. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 10:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> It's useful for reference, but doesn't deseve it's own article - <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurriKaty_caf5.html" title="User:HurriKaty">HurriKaty</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for random lists of supposed fads and OR. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be fair, though, this stuff really isn't OR (or at least a bit of it isn't), as it can be verified with links. It DOES have some POV though (the nn fads which don't even fill up one page), which is also criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 02:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Several variations of fads were showcased on <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a> (Facial Expressions, Picard, and Dire Straights) and the site was a fixture of several radio interviews with the Baumans as a result of the E-Baums World fisaco. People who don't "get" YTMND also don't happen to <i>know</i> any of this. Picard Song and Batman: Ulleeeaaaaah attratced tremendous records of site visits, and two of them were part of a feature in the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, again, people who don't "get" YTMND don't actually know any of this. Dr. R.K.Z
<ul>
<li>This doesn't explain why the fads should have their own article. If you are suggesting that people are making incorrect judgements by not "getting" it, the article has somewhat failed in its purpose to make people "get" it. So I don't see how you are endorsing it. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 14:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It shows a clear history of the site and is really useful to look for the origin of a fad; you can't find that information anywhere else. Lord Oppy</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article is just full of worthless self-congratulation of absolutely no interest outside the YTMND community. <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKundor_08ba.html" title="User:Kundor">Kundor</a> 20:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a knowledge of YTMND fads is important to understanding the humor of the much sites. -<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiut_edd2.html" title="User:Shiut">Shiut</a> 03:09, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Clean up</b> the list really is important to readers as it bring the magnitude of social impact that YTMND.com has had on the internet. This list has been around for quite a long time on Wikipedia and it's not seen any dispute until now... Kujila</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> Not cruft, is necessary to understanding many of the sites on YTMND and the internet. If it is kept though, clean it up by purging non-notable "fads." Also recommend to delete links to soundtrack, as they are illegal downloads. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZig973_7c35.html" title="User:Zig973">Zig</a> 03:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep/cleanup</b> It can get messy, but keep it. People who appreciate YTMND value this subject, as arcane and meaningless as it may be to others. People who don't see the point of YTMND can keep fans of it here instead of running rampant putting useless vanity pages for every fad all over Wikipedia. I'm not the first to say it here but Wikipedia is not paper. It should have room for all sorts of ridiculous subjects. <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleeper99999_3e66.html" title="User:Sleeper99999">Sleeper99999</a> 04:39, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
