<dd>The real question is how is it the same war when the players are all completely different to those that fought in the original 1991 conflict. Somalia has been in a state of chaos, this is clear, but only recently has the war with the ICU been occuring.

<dd>Somalia has been in chaos since 1991. All of the armed conflicts in Somalia from 1991 to the present are part of the Somali Civil War. The article you created uses the name “Somalian War”; Somali is the proper adjective form for Somalia and the “Somalian War” is a name that you picked that is not recognized by anyone else. I will not say it again, the article’s information should be incorporated into the Somali Civil War page. – <a href="../../../z/n/t/User%7EZntrip_e9b2.html" title="User:Zntrip">Zntrip</a> 04:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, Somalian is used when pertaining to the country, somali is only for the ethnic group. Now that that is settled, how is it the same conflict when its obviously different groups fighting each other in a defined conflict totally different to the one in 1991? The state of chaos probably should not be treated as it is now where its Barre vs. Aidid, but instead as the state of chaos that it is. Within this state of chaos is this defined conflict between the ICU and other parties, and it does deserve an article. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 04:04, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly, and like Afghanistan, it should <b>not</b> be merged. You cant merge the Soviet War in the 80s with the American War going on now, even though there has been constant fighting. Like with Afghanistan, the Somalian civil war should be viewed as the general term to describe the chaos, whereas there are individual articles for the defined conflicts within it.

<dd>With respect, that's kind of what we're doing here. As I see it, "working on the article" involves both adding text to it and making certain it's named correctly and should be here in the first place. If there happens to be a source out there calling this conflict by this name (and editors more knowledgeable than I have said there isn't), then it should be added to the article and so forth. As it currently stands, though, there's a number of people suggesting that the best way to do things is to merge this information with another article - where it can be worked on - until later on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:38, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A fair point, but the Afghan Civil War article cited earlier on here is a good example of an article which breaks with that definition. Should it do so? I'm not sure, but it certainly does. The point about Wikipedia is that we're bound by what other sources refer to something as, so if this conflict is referred to as a "civil war" (as it appears to be), then a civil war is what we must call it. To call it something else would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">a cardinal sin</a>. Likewise, one can argue until the proverbial <i>vaches</i> return to <i>la maison</i> that a given world leader shouldn't be called a President or whatever, but if that's what people call him, then that's what we have to call him. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To add to what BigHaz has said: It does not matter what this conflict SHOULD be called. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for changing the terminology. It is NOT a vehicle for changing ANYTHING. The only valid question is what do people ALREADY call this conflict. They call it the Somali Civil War. There is no compelling evidence of widespread recognition of a different conflict, or a different name for this conflict. Ergo, merge the non-redundant information into the Somali Civil War article, and redirect this one. It doesn't need to stay. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 17:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Merge with existing article if journalists and commentators are not drawing a strict distinction (despite my belief that they are separate and distinct), but the main article should be VERY CLEAR that this is a seperate conflict with different participants and roots. Also, define "Somali Civil War" at the outset as an ongoing set of distinct conflicts. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 20:11, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is just a case where a discussion should have been held before putting something up for deletion. The article could have just been moved to that name to begin with and we could have avoided this lengthy talk and instead put the effort into writing the article instead. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 17:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well put - page discussions seem to sort out a LOT of issues, a deletion nomination so shortly after the page was made seems way severe. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 18:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
