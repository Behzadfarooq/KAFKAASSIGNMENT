<li><b>Keep</b> Arbusto is repeatedly seeking to delete Christian articles. Why doesn't he do that for any other religion? I can understand only adding to the stock of articles about one religion - a person may not be particularly interested in all the religions, but deleting all articles of one religion has got to put a question mark over someone's neutrality. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 23:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Itake, who are you accusing of abusing admin powers? That is a serious matter. If you have evidence of abuse of admin powers you need to take it to ArbCom. You will see from recent arbitrations that not even Tony Sidaway can get away with abusing admin powers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see any problem with this since we have an article on <a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a> and these schools apparently exist. I also note that this nom tried to have this list speedied as patent nonsense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_TRACS_members&amp;diff=45750122&amp;oldid=45561403" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_TRACS_members&amp;diff=45750122&amp;oldid=45561403" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, which looks like bad faith to me. Furthermore, the so called POV fork seems to have resulted from this nom's edit warring to remove the list. Lastly, what difference does it make that these are Christian schools? For all I care, they could be Jewish, Muslim, or Rastafarian. Why did that need to be immediately specified in the first words of this nom?

<dd>You comparing TRACS to the NCAA? I fail to understand the connection. It should not be listed because (as I wrote in the nom.) "<a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a> has a list on their webpage, which is more accurate and informative than this control-c list. Interested parties can visit the TRACS page and link for further information." The list is updated on the TRACS page according to schools that lost accreditation and earned accreditation. Most recently in Feb. 2006. There is no reason to think the wiki page will be updated to be accurate. Thus, the information will be incorrect and provide misleading details on school accreditation.</dd>
<dd>If this list is kept then the other accrediting agnecies will also have lists. That includes <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_4015.html" title="North Central Association of Colleges and Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, which accredits 10,000 schools.

<dd>Those are all very weak arguments. What may or may not exist on the web is not my problem. Almost every topic we cover here is covered in greater depth somewhere else. That should never be an excuse to remove content. The bottom line for me is that if we are going to do school lists such as these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, I can find no reason to remove a list of accredited schools from a group such as TRACS for which we have a page. In my view, it is just as essential to know what institutions are under the TRACS umbrella as with any other accreditation agency. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody is likely to nominate a project-space article listing articles for <i>universities</i> which need to be created, even though lists of redlinks tend (as with the Schools project) to spawn substubs of no encycloaedic value. If this was in project space - part of the Christianity wikiproject, for example - I think it's unlikely it would have been nominated. As it stands what this list does is to duplicate the list at the TRACS website (only with much less detail and not necessarily up-to-date). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, they are part of the regular users. Those who think they are better then the rest of us, because unlike the rest of us they don't move away from their computer chairs. Good for me and Uncle Davey that we had to courage to stand up, even though we risked getting banned for our opinions. You want proof? Just go to the old AfD discussion pages for the list of louisiana baptist university people, and the entries for some of the individuals there. See how the people that had admin powers temp banned users for "violating civility rules", when they did infact not violate said rules after the first warnings. The admins in question however, continued to violate those rules. But they didn't ban themselves, nor did they ban each other. Not suprisingly, they were all on the "delete" side of the vote. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 20:20, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the comments of the socks have been removed from the main page I'll do an unoffical tally: 10/14 keep votes are by new users/suspected socks.

<p>No actually, its 14 keep votes against 15 delete votes. Definently not a consensus.

<dd>No, actually, it is no keep votes to no delete votes, because this is not a vote. The closing admin is free to ignore some contributions, and to place more weight on those which are supported by policy. The closing admin may be particularly swayed by the fact that if we have a lost of institutions accredited by each accrediting body we woul end up with lists of thousands or tens of thousands of entries. Theyu may be disposed to move it to Project space, or to decide that it genuinely is redundant per category. But <i>it is not a vote</i>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:44, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
