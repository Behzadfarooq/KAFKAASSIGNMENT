<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Notability is asserted due to longevity of the 'daily' comic (6 years). Notability is asserted in that it's in it's second print volume.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As is usual for <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a>'s webcomic AFD nominations, a deceptively low Google search value is given based on a rare search term combination. Even "pirate cove"+Angelo gives 656 hits. "Pirate Cove"+webcomic gives 3450 hits, and "Pirate Cove"+comic gives 74,600 hits, about half of which seem to be about other things. Top two hits for "pirate cove"+comic+wired give you Wired news and also (oddly enough) Buffetnews.com, which mentions it several times. At this point I'm not sure about notability of the article, but I am disappointed at Fram not having improved the AFD habits which I have criticized already. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 02:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As has been shown in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Parking_Lot_is_Full_e90f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Parking Lot is Full">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Parking Lot is Full</a>, your extended searches are good for boosting the numbers, but not for retrieving more reliable sources. Why would I change my search habits when they seem to return all the hits that could possible be non-trivial mentions from reliable sources, while excluding passing mentions and irrelevant hits, mostly about unrelated things? Take e.g. your buffettnews.com: this is a fan site for a musician, not a reliable source at all. So again, it looks to me like you can't find any reliable sources beyond those I already provided, but still you feel the need to attack me. Please stop doing this and defend the comic with good sources instead. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:28, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've asked you numerous times to engage in more than a cursory effort to find sources before putting up an AFD, but you clearly haven't. In this case, for example, you searched for <i>Joe</i> D'Angelo rather than simply D'Angelo as would have been standard. As has been demonstrated in the case of The Parking Lot is Full and other AFDs, your searches are (a) inadequate and (b) do not establish a lack of notability. I cannot in good conscience vote to delete the article until an adequate argument has been offered for lack of notability, not simply "I searched using a poorly chosen combination of terms and managed to get a low hit-count." <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Addendum: As I've mentioned, I feel quite uncertain as to whether or not this webcomic will turn out to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standards if well investigated... so don't misrepresent what I'm saying. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To start with your last comment: what have I misrepresented? Further: I cannot prove a negative (i.e. "establish a lack of notability"), it is up to you to show the opposite, that there indeed is some notability. As for the rest of your comments: search for "Pirate Cove" "d'Angelo" -"Joe d'Angelo" (i.e. all the links my search didn't have, but your "standard" search finds):<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22pirate+cove%22+%22d%27angelo%22+-wikipedia+-%22joe+d%27angelo%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22pirate+cove%22+%22d%27angelo%22+-wikipedia+-%22joe+d%27angelo%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> you get 31 additional distinct hits, but <i>none</i> of them are about the comic. Conclusion: all your "standard" search has done when compared to my "inadequate" and "cursory" one "using a poorly chosen combination of terms" is increase the raw numbers to make the return look more impressive, without even adding one single relevant hit, nevermind it being from a reliable source or being more than a passing mention. For the final time: please refrain from making these completely baseless attacks on me and my search methods: you haven't given in any of these webcomics AfD's a relevant and even slightly reliable source that was not included in my original search. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:04, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Fram's nomination. No sign of sources or importance. Googling for the name of the comic plus the name of author is a great search when looking for nontrivial sources, since only a trivial source won't bother to at least mention the author's name. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Such as the 600 hits Fram excludes by asking for an exact search on "Joe D'Angelo" rather than simply "D'Angelo"? I stand by my criticism that Fram has <i>not</i> been making sufficient effort to verify webcomic articles' notability or lack thereof before putting up AFDs, and the arguments set forth in the AFD title almost universally invoke Google hit-counts based on poorly-selected search terms in order to claim greater obscurity than is actually present. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Search engine hits are not a measure of notability</a>, after all. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, so why are you pursuing this? Googling is a means to find valid sources, and a notable article may very well get only 3 hits. Noone is misled by this. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 13:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>See my reply to Balancer's similar complaint above, and note the irony of complaining that my search gives lower numbers than his, and then saying that "Search engine hits are not a measure of notability".

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> now that I've reviewed the actual content of the Wired article (non-trivial, and precisely matching the examples <i>used</i> in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) and also a similarly non-trivial article in Silver Bullet Comics<a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/real/10833622802551.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/real/10833622802551.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<ul>
<li>There must be some confusion. Balancer is referring to a different Wired article than this? <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62408,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62408,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> â€”<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 22:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There surely must be some confusion indeed. This article<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,44478,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,44478,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, also by Wired, also discussing a webcomic in a very similar fashion, is <i>used as a textbook example</i> in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> of <i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple and non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i> Precedent is perfectly clear, and it is unclear what standard of "non-trivial" is in use by Fram in order to claim triviality. The standard outlined in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is to disinclude directory listings and similar such non-selective batch mentions. The comic is mentioned multiple times in the article, and the author is being interviewed specifically <i>as the author of the comic.</i> Ergo, it is a non-trivial mention; ergo, between that and the Silver Bullet article, we have multiple non-trivial mentions from published sources independent of the Pirate Cove webcomic; ergo, it is notable by the standards of Wikipedia. Remember, notability is not subjective. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 00:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet somehow it is. This webcomic is nowhere near <u>the subject</u> of that Wired article. Its author is one of several briefly quizzed about how tough it is to get webcomics noticed. On the other hand, pending how Silverbullet fares as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">RS</a>, that is one source. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 01:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Silver Bullet bills themselves as the "most diverse" comic zine on the web. By "comic" they don't mean webcomic, actually. They're talking about comic <i>books" - the printed kind - but apparently they occasionally decide to review a webcomic for the heck of it. It's apparently won an "Eagle Award"<a href="http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, which looks neat to me, and is described as "popular" and has been around publishing regular columns for a couple years.</i></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Speedy delete</i> is not interchangable with <i>tag for cleanup.</i> And is anybody going to actually <i>read</i> the argument for notability I presented above for <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a>'s sake (I know NetOracle has, in his one week here, never voted <i>against</i> a webcomics-related AFD, so it's wasted on him), or did I waste the time it took for me to investigate and establish the reliability of multiple independent sources discussing this comic in a clearly non-trivial fashion? <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 08:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, editors generally add AFDs they've commented on to their watch lists. If your comment is persuasive, early commentators will edit to reflect their change of mind. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 10:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
