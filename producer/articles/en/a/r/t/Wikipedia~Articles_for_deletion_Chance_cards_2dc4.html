<dd><b>Comment</b>: Not entirely true. What's mentioned in the History article has to do more with which artwork was implemented when (Uncle Pennybags/Mr. Monopoly starting in US editions in 1936, but not in most of the rest of the world until later, and even then only on the game's logo). A major point that tried to be made in the two articles is how the cards, and thus the gameplay, changed from 1933/34 through 1936 in the United States, and how further changes were made from US to UK editions (and elsewhere), because of cultural differences. The articles deliberately do NOT go in depth into EVERY variation made for EVERY edition of Monopoly since the 1990s, as that would be ridiculous and an absolute violation of the point you made. They are currently brief lists, and works in progress. My only OTHER suggestion would be to merge them with information about selection/retirements of tokens (and the UK wartime spinner, etc) into an article along the lines of History of Monopoly game equipment. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia does not need "to cover Monopoly fully" and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for that purpose. Wikipedia needs to cover Monopoly "encyclopedically", that is, describe how reliable sources discussed it and how it influenced culture, game design, any gaming hobby that may have existed then, the modern gaming hobby, or other things that might pass the "hundred year test". Changes in particular cards -- cards which do not drive the game and rarely have more than a minor influence on who wins or what choices players make next -- don't belong in this category, unless multiple sources clearly demonstrate that they do. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have to disagree here - I'm in full agreement with what JJay states (which is why these articles got forked off in the first place, along with the history article, which is an FA, and the pop culture references article, which is also a work in progress). The Monopoly article is TOO LONG to take on any more material. Again, I'd go for a "Monopoly Equipment" article, but I wouldn't upmerge these into <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly (game)</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly_af1d.html" title="History of the board game Monopoly">History of the board game Monopoly</a>, simply because of the length. I just pared down the lists to reflect the major differences between the 1935/1936 US editions and the 1936 UK edition, the two most widely known versions of the game in the English speaking world. Cards in other editions (South African, German, French) have based their texts on the UK edition. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What kind of a comment is that? These articles are not lists. And where exactly do you think the articles should be merged? That needs to be specified. I agree with you, though, that this should not be a discussion. AfD is singularly unsuited to address complicated editorial questions involving featured articles. I'm willing to venture that few of the commenters here have read any of our extensive coverage of Monopoly. Given that, drive-by comments by editors who have devoted one or two minutes to the issue do not serve much purpose. It is insulting to the editors who have devoted extensive time to working on the monopoly articles. The articles should not have been nominated without a prior discussion on the article talk pages. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: These articles (as has the history article) have been developed wholly independently of ANY WikiProject. I'm offended that anyone would want to impose ONE project's guidelines on any article or series of articles. One project should NOT decide content or rules or guidelines to apply everywhere, not even EVERY game article. And even if these were developed by project members, exceptions are, should be and will be made. These two articles were developed with the game's early history in mind, modified to reflect cultural differences, and I'm pleased to see others calling for either a more in-depth view of the game's elements as a historical whole and others calling for a broader cultural view. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not trying to "impose one project's guidelines" on this, I'm trying to hold it to Wikipedia's core standards. The guidelines at the BTG project are clarifying how those core standards apply in more detail to boardgame articles, which is why I referenced them instead of WP:V or WP:NOR. If the significance of these component changes in the game's early history is so significant that it should be featured in encyclopedic (not fansite) coverage, then you need to show why this is strong enough to be an exception. (I agree that the guidelines have flexibility for special cases, but WP:ILIKEIT is not a special enough case.) This is "excessive detail not appropriate for an encyclopedia" in my view as a gamer and as an editor; show me where reliable sources demonstrate great impact of the "cultural" "historical" differences, or stop being offended by people upholding WP policies. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> After a day-and-a-half of this discussion, the nominated article still contains <i>only</i> trivia about minor component changes, and only one reliable source, a book about the game's early history. The article still contains <i>no</i> claim of notability, <i>no</i> content about cultural influence, <i>no</i> content about how gameplay might be affected, <i>no</i> references indicating that anyone except the single niche author has ever cared, not even a link to anything on BoardGameGeek or other modern gaming reference sites. I would consider this article (and its Community Chest twin) candidates for <i>speedy deletion</i> were they not part of a Featured Article walled garden worked on by sincere (though policy-weak) editors. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If I were to execute a create and merge (as has been suggested by several editors), then the two existing articles would wind up being redirects, and the AfD notices (while not necessarily deleted) would not be visible. That's in violation of the spirit of the process, as near as I can tell, and I'd rather let the process run its course rather than trying to conclude it prematurely as you seem wont to do. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 19:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
