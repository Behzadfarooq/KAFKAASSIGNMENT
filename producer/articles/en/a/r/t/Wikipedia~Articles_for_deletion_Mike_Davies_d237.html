<li><b>Inconclusive</b>. While he would probably not meet notability were he a disc jockey in the US, he is an on-air personality on BBC's Radio One. My understanding is that this is an extremely popular, widely-distributed station (see <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_1_3f66.html" title="BBC Radio 1">BBC Radio 1</a>, and in fact one of the few official broadcast outlets in the United Kingdom. By UK standards, he could very well be not only notable, but a celebrity. I'd like to hear from some of our colleagues over there--is he notable? --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 08:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> As far as a quick search of google shows, this guy is legit. I get 45,000+ hits. No doubt a lot of these may not refer to the same man, but the fact that he does indeed appear to be a DJ on the BBC makes it a speedy keep and a rather daft nomonation for AfD. Please research a little more before nominating - or else prove me wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 15:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I think you're probably right about this being a keep now. I must say though that the article at present does a pretty awful job of asserting the guy's notability, so I think I should be forgiven for this. I'm from England originally, so I realise that Radio 1 is a significant radio station, but in my day the presenter of the Rock Show was never anyone notable. Google hits for such a common name are meaningless too – I sat behind a Mike Davies in school. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 15:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>--Kelly, I certainly don't think you need to be "forgiven" for AfDing this. You should be thanked for taking the time to raise the issue, which is how it's supposed to be done. Also, you're quite right that this isn't exactly a sterling example of writing. I think Marcus22 might want to step back a bit from calling this AfD "daft". There's certainly no reason for you to be on the defensive here. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 16:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> er.. actually I don't want to step back from calling this AfD a "daft" one. For a start, 'daft' is hardly a strong word to use, but more than that, if everyone nominates an Afd without checking it out a little first, how is that going to make Wikipedia look when, as will happen, far more famous names are AfD'd? I'd hazard the word daft... Oh and as the nom has withdrawn, should this not now be speedily kept? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 16:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I didn't withdraw my nom, otherwise I would have said so. I was thinking out loud – admittedly that's probably also daft behaviour. Moreover, this isn't an issue of me not knowing the facts, OK? I'm English, I know what Radio 1 is, that's not the issue. It didn't occur to me that Radio One DJs were notable by dint of that status alone, which seems to be what you're arguing, not implausibly, which is what I was trying to say: hey, that's a good point, I didn't think of that. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 13:33, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Fellow BBC on-air personalities such as <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Mills_2193.html" title="Scott Mills">Scott Mills</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Nelson_45fc.html" title="Trevor Nelson">Trevor Nelson</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Bowman_496a.html" title="Edith Bowman">Edith Bowman</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Moyles_d980.html" title="Chris Moyles">Chris Moyles</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Whiley_505e.html" title="Jo Whiley">Jo Whiley</a> all have their own articles, so there is a precedent for BBC hosts, I suppose. But I'm not convinced that simply being an on-air employee for the BBC should automatically make one notable. Not all DJs from even the most popular U.S. stations get articles. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 00:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But on this matter the US and the UK are not comparable. Believe me, a BBC Radio 1 DJ is notable. It's as simple as that. There is absolutely no question about it. I am very surprised to see this AfD still standing. Are all the admins. on holiday? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:54, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: article says nothing to assert notability. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> says: <i>Believe me, a BBC Radio 1 DJ is notable. It's as simple as that. There is absolutely no question about it.</i> Sorry, but faith-based assertions don't sway me. I hereby raise that very question. I'm willing to believe you and change my vote; now <i>persuade</i> me that I should believe you. (You'll have to hurry, as soon I'm heading off on internet-free vacation.) Certainly my own experiences of flicking the frequency dial of a newly rented car in the Youkay in desperate search of something that isn't inane chitchat or inane muzak (entertainingly described example <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1841197,00.html" class="external text" title="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1841197,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) doesn't suggest that Radio 1 DJs are the slightest bit noteworthy (though I realize that there have been occasional and justly celebrated <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">counterexamples</a>). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike you to be so unobservant Hoary. For a start, what about the 45,000+ google hits? As fas as I can see - and I'm not going to go through all 45,000+ of them (!) - the greater part of these refer to this Mike Davies. Not convincing enough? Well, I'm rather surprised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now how about my comment that <i>Believe me, a BBC Radio 1 DJ is notable. etc...'</i> - I'm guessing you were either not quite awake when you said that 'faith based assertions' etc.. or, much more likely, you just don't know the situation via a viz Radio 1 in the UK. Well, I'm afraid I can't prove anything to you or anyone else about how major a player Radio 1 is but - and so you'll just have to believe me (or do a little research!) - but it's a little like ABC or CNN or whoever else is the main media organisation in the US. This guy has a potential listening audience of 55,000,000. He's not some 2bit DJ on a backwoods station. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 08:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
