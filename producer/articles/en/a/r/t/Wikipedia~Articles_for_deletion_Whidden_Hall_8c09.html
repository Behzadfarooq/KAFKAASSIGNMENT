<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> Whidden Hall is a real place with real characteristics with a real reason to be in Wikipedia. There are many more frivilous entries than this genuine residence hall. Please remove the delete tag, it has every reason to be included in this site.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a> 16:57, 7 February 2006(UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> That is the most ridiculous reason ever. Whidden Hall is a genuine residence at McMaster University. I can see nothing wrong with it. The information is factual and accurate. I don't see why I even have to dignify the removal of AFD tag. 24.57.131.18 04:44, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><strike><b>Keep and expand</b>. I'm not sure how the residence system is set up at McMaster, but if they are set up in a manner such as the colleges/houses systems of Yale, Harvard, Cambridge, or Oxford, I would support keeping and adding more information on the page. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 05:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</strike> <b>Delete</b>. After further review, an article on Whidden does not really meet the criterion for keeping. It's not particularly notable in the sense that it is a "house" or "college" in the Yale/Harvard/Cambridge/Oxford model... it is essentially just a dorm. Most colleges have them, and they are not noteworthy in and of themselves. (After all, why keep this and not <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chaparral_Village_ed17.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chaparral Village">Chaparral Village</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chisholm_Hall_4870.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chisholm Hall">Chisholm Hall</a>?)

<li>OH PLEASE..you don't have to be that anal. The consensus is TO KEEP IT since nobody knows anything about it you have no right to delete it either. My question to you is how is it considered as unencyclopedic? It has accurate facts which all encyclopedias should. Now all points are supported by evidence. How can you judge it as "trivia"? are you familiar with the topic at hand? If it is trivia, its only because it is written in that way, if so re-write the article, EXPAND not delete. 24.57.131.18</li>

<li><b>Comment1</b> All the opposition is coming from power hungry wikipedian editors who have no outside life, but somehow yeild ultimate influence on trivial matters such as this and need to make decisions here to make up for the lack of say they have in thier own lives. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a></li>
<li><b>Comment2</b> The above warning, that suggests people are being "puppeted" into supporting this page is an unfair advantage to the delete side of the debate, I suggest it be removed. Or the non-deletionists present be allowed to post a similar banner supporting their side. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a></li>
<li><b>Comment3</b> I have posted valid reasons for keeping the article, I have referenced the details in question and made attempts to have the page fit the standard. At no point have the deletionists listed more than one-word reasons to delete. <b>Support Summarized</b>: <b>1)</b> Real place at top three University in Canada <b>2)</b> 1000s of people have lived there <b>3)</b> at least 2 famous people are associated with the building <b>4)</b> Building has 45 year history <b>5)</b> major movie satirizing contemporary North American college life was inspired by events at this Hall <b>6)</b> There are FAR more articles that should be recieving more attention for deletion than this one, this article is pretty innocuous. The Hall is not obscure, nor "non-noteable" and passes multiple so-called Wikipedian tests of relevancy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a></li>
<li><b>Comment4</b> I contend that the users suggesting deletion, either have nothing better to do or are alumni or current students at competing universities. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most dormitories are non-notable. The claim in this article that life at this dormitory inspired the movie <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lampoon%27s_Animal_House_95cf.html" title="National Lampoon's Animal House">National Lampoon's Animal House</a> is questionable, given that none of the three writers of the movie attended this university -- only one of the producers did, and he didn't even live in this dormitory according to this article. The only source for the dormitory having inspired the movie is that an article in the college newspaper says it was "rumored" to have done so. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Also, as to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a>'s earlier points: Comments 1 and 4 are irrelevant and seem like violations of the Wikipedia rules about not engaging in ad hominem attakcs. As for Comment 2, are you advocating the censorship of comments regarding possible meatpuppetry/sockpuppetry/stuffing? Let people look at the evidence and decide for themselves. Now as to Comment 3: "Real place at top three University in Canada" - so? by this standard we would have literally hundreds of building and dorms that would need to be added. "1000s of people have lived there" - same problem as before. "at least 2 famous people are associated with the building" - again, hardly a big deal, and while John Candy may be the famous, the other individual is not at all. "major movie satirizing contemporary North American college life was inspired by events at this Hall" - This has already been dealt with by Metropolitan90, so let me just add that many colleges and dorms at colleges claim to be inspiration for animal house. " Building has 45 year history" - 45 years is hardly a long enough time to contribute to noteworthiness. "There are FAR more articles that should be recieving more attention for deletion than this one, this article is pretty innocuous" - this is simply irrelevant. If there are articles you feel should be deleted then nominate them (please however refrain from engaging in revenge AfD, they are seriously frowned upon). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as there is no solid evidence that it is the inspiration for Animal House, and even if that were the case, it would only be worth a mention in the Animal House and/or McMaster University article. That a famous person, John Candy, lived there is not exceptional. Medium and large universities that have been around for a while are bound to have famous almuni who stayed in the dorms, but that does not confer notability them, or even much to the university. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:09, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - articles such as this would be so much less troublesome if they were just redirected to the university to which they belong. I've rarely had my redirect of non-notable topic to related notable topic reverted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Halls of Residence, University Colleges are important places and there are many articles on WP about them. To those people who want to delete them, I ask you to be consistent. There are about 11 articles on Halls from this university alone. They have links from the main university page. This is just one. If it is worse than the others and it is indeed a poor article, it can be improved. If you want to delete all of them, then give reasons why Halls are not notable. I finally suggest that WP will be the poorer without good NPOV articles on Halls and Colleges so prospective students can look at them as an alternative to the POV articles from the university concerned. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:19, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> I'd also vote to ban <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a>. It should be noted that on the IMDB site it clearly states that the insipration for Animal House came from "co-writer Chris Miller's experiences at Dartmouth College." Furthermore, the other co-writer, Harold Ramis brought his inspiration from his days at Washington University in St. Louis. Nice try guys, but this is a clearly non-notable dormitory at a less than notable university. It is not at all encyclopedic. 4.224.192.35 11:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

(On a side note I will also nominate <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuts_Hall_dd08.html" title="Smuts Hall">Smuts Hall</a> for deletion on the same basis, even though I went to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cape_Town_658c.html" title="University of Cape Town">UCT</a>.) <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 13:16, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
