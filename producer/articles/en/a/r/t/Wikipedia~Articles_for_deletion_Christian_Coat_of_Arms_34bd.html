The contents of the article are not POV. The article sites Biblical scripture which is noted all over Wikipedia. The article also describes the history of this particular piece of art associated with the topic. Your petition to delete seems more POV than the article now revised (which was originally taken from a website so PARDON the Preacher). I read that you are accustomed to editting and petitioning for deletion in Wikipedia for a personal response; in order to have things "answered" to you. This is not neutral as Wikipedia Policy sets forth. Now articles need be neutral TO THEIR TOPIC but not neutral to the societal debates that some folks create over the topics. At this point there is no violation of Wikipedia Policy in the article as written by the original author, however if you care to cite specifically what elements you feel are POV they will be considered as Wikipedia gices the author th option of editing to get article under Policy before deletion occurs. If you cannot cite specifics than you are pursuing deletion without cause.</p>

<dd>Agreed, if you wish to retain copyright, do <b>not</b> post it here - go delete it yourself as soon as possible.

<p>Tony: You state your arguements but they are based on your interpretation of the facts posted in this article. So again your submissions are POV, not the article. You debate seeking to learn more as your PROFILE states so you inquire about things that aren't elements of the article so as to get a response for them.</p>
<p>You state that "Firstly, content included in wikipedia must be factual, verifiable and notable. A poem you have written is not factual. If the organisation "Custodians of Time" is notable, you have to show how and why (or preferably, if you are involved in that organisation, let someone else do it).</p>
<p>Secondly, there is already a factual article on the historical "coat of arms of God" at Shield of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Thirdly, everything posted on Wikipedia must be released under an open licence; this means anyone can use it, for any non-commercial purpose. If you are claiming copyright to your poem and drawing, then you can't submit them to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Wikipedia is not the place for original research (WP:OR). Even if you think you can make an argument from scripture, don't. On the other hand, if someone else has made an argument from scripture, and that argument has been published in a notable publication, then you can report that they have made that argument."</p>
<p>I respond: Firstly, the article's contents do provide this, yet you seek more but there isn't more... it is all right there factual, verifiable and notable. Secondly, the Shield of the Trinity has a different purpose for Christians. The Coat of Arms in the article you disrupt and vandalize this page for is cited from the Bible. Thirdly, there is no violation copyright. There are no commercial rights released and that is allowed. Fourthly, If you suggest I make an arguement than you are trying to engage in a debate and that is not the proper use of this page. In addition, the scripture containing the Full Armor of God has been published in a notable publication; the Bible. The writer of it has established that "arguement" as you call it. Since I did not WRITE the Bible then this is not personal research as you propose it is. I am reporting no other argument except from you. The article is not an arguement nor is it a debate forum it is a factual, verifiable, and notable element from History. It's too bad it bothers you but there is nothing I can do to make these facts untrue. They have all already happened and are just reported to Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.33.215.131 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.33.215.131_a7f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.33.215.131">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It's better, but you're still making claims (<i>This depiction of the "Full Armor of God", has become accepted by a large group as the Official Christian Coat of Arms or Coat of Arms of God's Family.</i>) that you're not supporting. <i>IF</i> you can provide evidence that there <i>are</i> a large number of people who recognise this coat of arms as a Christian symbol, then you might have the beginnings of a vaild article. BTW, even if this gets deleted now, there's nothing preventing you putting up a (better) article with the same title at a later date.

<p>As I click on each user who wants this article deleted I see some reference to anti-Christian perspective. Now, I don't care what your POV is. But it seems there is some "ganging up here" in relation to that tangent which is not appropriate for the Wikipedia Community. Granted this article may have started with some "preachiness", HOWEVER, it has since been edited down and cleaned up and is in line with Wikipedia Policies. AS IT IS NOW, it is a good addition to this legitimate encyclopedia, but somehow I think arguing that point to most of the opposition here will be falling on deaf ears. Might I remind you that this page is a discussion for the article AS IT IS CURRENTLY and as to whether it ought to be deleted for violation of Wikipedia Policy or Standards, this is not a forum to debate Christian/Anti-Christian POVs. Please take note of this and Please assume good faith when dealing with other editors. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> for the guidelines on this..

<dd><i>Please</i> don't start on the "poor little persecuted Christians" line. Yes, I'll agree that the article is now less preachy. However, all it is now is a description of a passage from Ephesians; it doesn't describe a coat of arms, much less demonstrate why that coat of arms is notable. <strike>It <i>still</i> fails the notability and verifiability tests, and is still obviously just an advertisement for your website.

<p>From the "poor little..." statement, you seem to assume that the <i>author</i> is Christian?!... and THAT would be a personal comment toward them... not allowed. The fact is that the article references Christian belief or culture and it seems that those who oppose anything Christian might also oppose this article for personal reasons, so that isn't the Wikipedia Community's purpose or problem for that matter. Thank you "ALBA" I like it!! 68.33.215.131 19:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
