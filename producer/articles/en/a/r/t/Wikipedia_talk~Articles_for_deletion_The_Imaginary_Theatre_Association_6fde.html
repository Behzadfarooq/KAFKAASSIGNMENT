hello to all this is my frist post and posting - what do you think? talk to you all soon - - Mister Hoppe.</p>
<hr />
<p>A good start. A few notes: 1. You're encouraged to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your posts on talk pages</a>. You can do so with ~~~~ 2. The intro paragraph needs a serious overhaul, it's so warm-fuzzy non-specific as to be useless. I <i>think</i> the ITA is primarily a LARPing association; it's connection to the individual games isn't terribly clear. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 06:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello Alan, Mister Hoppe here - first thank you for your input - please clarify your meaning on the following:</p>
<p>1) "warm-fuzzy non-specific as to be useless. " please let us know what you would like to see/read on this in the hopes to make this less "useless." And as well scents we are new to Wikipedia, we understand that Wikipedia ahs quality standards, and we are trying to meet that standard. so in short we didn't whant to sound too over the top, we hope you understand..</p>
<p>2) the ITA is more then just an other "LARPing association" - it's just that, at this point in time the games are are joining just happen to be larp games. The ITA is always looking for other format of games to be apart of.</p>
<p>3) the ITA connection to the individual games is to help find the Storytellers/ Game master to find players, And players to help find games that they would like to play in.</p>
<p>if you would like to know more please post here. thank you for your time</p>
<p>- Mister Hoppe.</p>
<p>PS I don't have a "sign thingie" - i don't think that i really need one, again thank you for your time. If you would like to talk more about this point , plaese send me an e-mail&#160;:) thank you</p>

<p>I tenatively believe that the ITA might be large enough to be notable. While it's a bit confusing (I'm working to get the details and clean it up), I believe at the very least it's a meta-organization composed of a number of LARPs, especially a bunch of "X by Night" Vampire LARPs. A regional organization of multiple different groups seems notable to me. All that said, I'm open to discussion (indeed, I plan to continue my own investigation into the group), but I believe the situation isn't so clear as to warrant speedly deletion. -- <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 20:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, My name is Mattew L'Allier, and I'd like to say that the ITA, is by far from what I can gather and see one of the most eleborate free roleplaying associations on both the net and real life. I had the privilage of meeting with them at Anime North and I was blown away by the size of games they run this year I belive it was around 80 people in the game they played. This might not seem to much, but it is extremely difficult to run a smooth game with that many people, in which they did exceptionally well. In my opinion, they have a fair amount of resources and websites for the games, and to tie them all together for people to find in one page I think Wikipedia is a great site to do it on. I do admit they need a bit more information that is a bit less generalized on the artical but I think it is a promising start&#160;! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Matthew L'Allier (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matthew_L%27Allier_64d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matthew L'Allier">contribs</a>) 03:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Im sorry Im still new to this and I forgot to sign the post hope this works.. thanks Alan&#160;! Matthew L'Allier 03:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)2</p>
<p>I apologize I am new to posting and just signed up but i wished to comment. I am a member of the ITA and we are working on improving this page. However at this time I do not understand why this is under "speed deletion" or any form of deletion. My understanding is that Wikipedia is a place to get information. The ITA exists and is not small in my opinion. We are trying not only to promote ourselves but to let people know who we are. We are always looking for new members but that is besides the point. I do agree this could be a bit more clear but we are trying and do intend on fixing it up and adding info. We would love to hear feedback from you on how to improve this but I don't think this is offensive in anyway and i don't think deleting it would really be in the spirit of wikipedia. To date this is the most accurate knowledge we have. Dates and further information will be added as it becomes available and corrected as is appropriate. thank you mastaVirus</p>

<p>Howdy. my name's Aleks, and i'm storyteller of two of the current ITA games. We do exist, and we are noteworthy. There are hundreds of people out there who have met us at various conventions, and there have been numerous interviews confirming our existence and noteworthiness, including an interview on cbc's the hour. If we've made it onto a nation television show, i figure that's likely good enough. I even believe there's a link somewhere we can send but i don't have it myself.Horatio Tyllis 04:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening to all. My name is Alex V. Helverson. I have been apart of the I.T.A for years now, and yes, and the dose exist, and reading from what the other's have posted - here is the link from the CBC interview; <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615&amp;q=ITA+%3D+LARP" class="external free" title="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615&amp;q=ITA+%3D+LARP" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615&amp;q=ITA+%3D+LARP</a> and i think that there are others too. If Ron needs anymore help, or the I.T.A for that matter just let me know.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
