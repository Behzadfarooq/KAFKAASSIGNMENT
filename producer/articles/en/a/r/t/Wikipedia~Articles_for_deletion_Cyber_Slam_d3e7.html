<li>For a start, CBN Media, the owners of the website in question (Cyber Slam), which is a lot more than the forum section pictured has <i>nothing at all</i> to do with IGN. Please at least get the facts straight if you wish to flag an item for deletion. Secondly, it takes time to make a great Wiki entry (for some us anyway). I'm learning as I go but at the moment all I'm noticing is people who are very keen to get rid of new content and discourage people from contribiting. Third point, there are a number of people on the same IP as me, my guess is one of them wrongly removed the original 'flaged for deletion' item. On a fourth point there are many website Wiki entires with a lot less content and many with out-dated and very <i>nn</i> content. While this point may not be a valid argument to some people, it does make you wonder why its hard to get new stuff on Wikipedia when the <i>delete happy people</i> seem unable to find anything unless it is new. With more time to add the <i>notable</i> content, I'm sure people will reconsider the entry (again, some of us do not have as much free time as others). Sixth point, If the <i>delete happy people</i> read the Cyber Slam entry they would have noticed there is more to Cyber Slam than just a forum. The <i>delete</i> vote above by Capitalistroadster referers to <i>webforum</i> which implies a skim of the content and a click on the image. The entry by Terenceong1992 is the same and states <i>nn web forum</i>, again clearly someone who did not even read the entry. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 12:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> there are two claims of notability. Firstly, that it is a notable web forum - I don't see evidence currently that supports this claim. Secondly that it is a notable organiser of FPS tournaments. Capitalistroadster's point refers to the need to verify this information. If either of these claims are verified by independent sources then that would probably satisfy the notability criterion and I'd change my vote to Keep. As it is, the article currently says that Cyber Slam is a forum for buddies to hang out at and is an organiser of some FPS tourneys. On the process, it isn't wrong to remove the Prod tag - it should come with an explanation as to why it is being removed. That tag is different to the AfD tag that is currently on the article which wikipedia process does not approve of removing, there's no blame attached here. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> I said that I'd change my vote if the sourcing happened and the emphasis of the article reflected something notable and I have. Good job by the editors of this article, much better than those who just complain about their article being deleted and do nothing to improve it. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 17:31, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Update</i> - The Cyber Slam entry has been updated. This is far from complete, however I just throught I would inform people. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 00:05, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once again we see a very clear delete vote from some one that has not even read the entry, and if they have, feel that a site dedicated to running and hosting online Tournaments in Australia can be classified in one word as <i>forumcruft</i>, a word that does NOT appear on Wikipedia, nor could <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=forumcruft" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=forumcruft" rel="nofollow">dictionary.com</a> find an entry for it. Clearly this user has <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">no intentions of leaving a valid delete reason</a>, but is more than happy to delete an entry from <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">newbie</a>. I would like to ask that Krash's vote be seen as a non-vote on the grounds that <i>forumcruft</i> is not a word. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 22:47, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Please reconsider.</b> I have been doing some research and I now understand a little bit more of the Wiki culture. While every effort was made to make the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber_Slam_e490.html" title="Cyber Slam">Cyber Slam</a> entry valid as far as the Wiki guidelines, I can't help but think there is something drastically wrong with the deletion process.</li>

<li>The user/admin <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> flagged Cyber Slam as a <i>non-notable subsection of an <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> web forum, dedicated to organising Halo tournaments in Australia.</i> Cyber Slam has nothing at all to do with IGN and while Cyber Slam has organised Halo PC events, it has also done a LOT more for online gaming in Australia. Key word, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, which has a much smaller population than the UK or USA, so the impact on a global scale may make Cyber Slam appear as <i>non-notable</i>. Australia wide however we are known.

<li>The user/admin, <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">Terenceong1992</a> stated the reason for deletion - <i>nn web forum, vanity</i>. Terenceong1992 is currently on a <i>Wikibreak</i>, so it is unlikely this 13yr old Singaporean has seen the changes that have been made.</li>
<li>The user/Admin, <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe">Computerjoe</a> stated that Cyber Slam did not meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standard. The entry has been updated since then. If there are now any sections that the Cyber Slam entry is weak on, please inform me so I can source the content from Cyber Slam staff and players.</li>
<li>I have also been looking into <i>vanity</i> (in relation to Wiki entries) and the use of <i>fourmcruft</i> and I'm guessing the Cyber Slam entry would come across as vanity to many people outside of the Gaming community of Australia. It is a real shame very few of the online Gaming community of Australia are not also Wiki Admins. These people would be the real judge as to how notable Cyber Slam is, at least in Australia.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've noticed heaps of Wiki entries that seem to <i>really</i> be <i>nn</i> in comparison to the Cyber Slam one. I do totally understand that just because there are invalid entries does not mean there should be more invalid entires. It just seems to me that some people are keen to delete new stuff because it is so much easier to find. Here is a very short list that took all of 5 minutes (I've noticed heaps more, I just can't remember them!):</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You've done a good job updating the article. Please assume good faith regarding AFD discussion - Terence Ong is a very experienced AfD debator for instance. There is a tendency to bias in favour of internet/gaming articles on wikipedia in my opinion so there has to be something that makes the article stand out as notable which I think you've achieved. A couple of votes have changed to keep as a result of your good work and at present, I'd be surprised if the end result was delete. Of those you've listed, Fileplanet is notable in my opinion but I haven't heard of the rest. If you want to list any of them for deletion then you should feel free. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 17:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, even with the references it doesn't met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The SMH reference makes only the slightest passing reference, the 2nd one is coverage about a tournament, the 3rd is an online entry form!, the 4th is simply information about ACON 5 event, the 5th an opinion piece by someone clearly not independent (he later became involved in running this event) and the 6th is a info piece which is clearly sourced from Cyber Slam. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECursive_f668.html" title="User:Cursive">Cursive</a> 12:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Response to Cursive</b> I don't see how coverage of a Cyber Slam Tournament on free-to-air television could be seen as invalid at all! To get <i>any</i> coverage of any tournament on TV can only be seen as <i>notable</i>. The opinion piece was from someone independent at the time the article was published. Part of what makes Cyber Slam interesting is the fact that the players and the public can and do get involved. Cyber Slam invited Mike Longley to assist with the Final because he had such strong opinions. There are more <i>References</i>, however (sadly) its taking time to get them from the Cyber Slam staff. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 12:06, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
