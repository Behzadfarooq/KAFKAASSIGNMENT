<li><b>Comment</b> I've reviewed the edits by UncleG and concur that it is now a verifiable, sourced article, so I'm willing to withdraw the AfD nom. That said, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I made it clear in the nomination that the article, in its then state, was unsourced and unverified, and that I was unable to find either. It was the <i>entire</i> article that I had problems with, not just the final line, as it was <i>all</i> unsourced and unverified. Based on the edits, it appears the term to search for ought to have been "jugged", but that was not apparent at the time. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:54, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, it wasn't apparent to someone who didn't already know the subject. (One of the things that I came across in my search for sources was a 2006 study in the U.K. that revealed that only 1.6% of people under 25 actually recognized the name "jugged hare".) I was referring, however, to the editors above who thought that "jugging" was yet another nonsense sex protologism. (I understand that one might have thought that the cooking definition was simply there to make the article seem legitimate. But this is in fact a case of a silly sex protologism being tacked onto an unsourced stub.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, actually, it is the place for notable unproven claims, just like it is the place for notable hoaxes, so long as both are (a) notable and (b) attributable to reliable sources. You may be referring to <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>, but reporting claims that the US, Syria, Sri Lanka, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, India, North Korea, the UK, etc, etc were/are state sponsors of terrorism isn't soapboxing. The claims exist, with varying degrees of evidentiary support. But we're not here to determine the validity of claims (that's original research), only to report that they have been made, without giving undue weight to any part of the arguments.

<dd>Yes and they should at least be renamed as it seems the term state terrorism is not consistent in all sources in all articles, meaning there is self defining going on by editors which is the very proccess of WP:OR. The very idea that you can define "State terrorism" when the term "terrorism" does not even have an international definition is quite absurd and as such the term should not appear in article titles either. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 01:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia does not have "Allegations against XYZ person" because of very real concerns with violating libel law, at least that's how I perceive why there are more strict codes regarding bios. That said, allegations with merit do have a place in Wikipedia, even in bios. In the case of various countries' foreign policies, allegation might be the only appropriate word, given the nature of the deliberate concealment that is performed by all governments in undertaking actions that might damage their reputation. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 02:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is exactly my point, if we know its wrong to accuse people we should avoid accusing entire nations. The problem with these articles that even goes beyond naming and basic idea is that the sections within them are usually sourced to limited articles and not presented with counter claims. Wikipedia is not a place to promote Chomsky's definition of what "terrorism" is, however it gets its own section in the US article ... Your personal opinion of some countries "foreign policy" is not appropriate terminology to define state terrorism. As noted above State terrorism does not have an definition so its the editors defining the term to match the article, which is also a violation of WP:OR. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 02:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Either allegations from notable groups or individuals exist. Or they don't. In this case they exist. NuclearUmpf's statement above doesn't hold water. A government statement in a state newspaper, or a government's statement to the UN is a perfectly legitimate source to carry allegations on this page. The BBC is state media, controlled by a director general appointed by the British government. Would you suggest that the BBC is not a legitimate source? Allegations made by one government are as valid as allegations made by any other. As wikipedia carries many allegations made by the United States government about other nations and individuals, taken straight from US government websites, it seems perfectly reasonable on this page to also detail allegations made by other governments about the United States.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 13:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If it weren't for the well-referenced material, I'd argue for deletion. This article pulls disparate information together in a way that promotes some (albeit weak) conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is "The United States has allegedly committed terrorism". The entire article serves to promote this insipid thesis. It skirts the boundary of original research by presenting unrelated incidents in the form of a discrete encyclopedia topic. Academics make their living from this sort of clerical work. Furthermore, this article has a misleadingly bland title. The word 'allegedly' is the only preventative against an extraordinary conclusion (consider Lies allegedly told by George W. Bush or Alleged war crimes of Henry Kissinger). Presenting an extraordinary assertion in the form of a seemingly innocuous and trivial assertion is pathologically sinister. In general, we should avoid turning propositions into encyclopedia articles. Such articles are trojan horses for POV warring and original research. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 19:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This appears to be a content dispute put forward as an AfD. Per the article, the US and Britain use the "State Terrorism" term to refer to actions of other states as a major reason for foreign policy and military actions against rogue states or members of the Axis of Evil. If there are reliable and verifiable sources reporting that other countries allege the U.S. to have done similar actions, then a case is made for having such an article. Rather than deleting the article, <i>edit boldly</i> and remove any non-reliable sources such as partisan blogs, and correct any POV pushing. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:22, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - This is ridiculous! To say that the Allegations of Terrorism by U.S.A. article is poorly sourced or references improperly biased material is patently and utterly false! It includes:</li>
<li>Citations by a leading international Military, Security and Terrorism researchers</li>
<li>Citations by several international organizations who routinely advise the United Nations</li>
<li>Citations from reports issued by several International Law organizations</li>
<li>Citations from leading Human Rights organizations</li>
<li>Citations from leading political and social scientists</li>
<li>Quotations from the Geneva Conventions, both first and second.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all of these sources i mention involve <i>specific</i> mention of "state terrorism" as a phrase (some do involve commentary on the concept of "terrorism" in general). They amount to clear demonstration of an international legal and academic consensus on the use and meaning of the phrase "state terrorism"; moreover, on the page we have gone out of our way to give every opportunity for objections and contrary evidence to be provided.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has become clear that several "editors" are intent only upon seeing the information provided there deleted from the Wikipedia record. Among others, these include "Morton Devonshire" and "NuclearZero" or "NuclearUmpf" or "Zerofaults".</p>
<p>In the Charges &amp; Evidence section, we have in each case mentioned clear citations from widely available media and journalistic sources which clearly describe defined, limited conditions (as proof) and/or use the words "state terrorism" (accusations).</p>
<p>These are not articles making unprovable, skewed observations about negligible issues! This is not a "Brittney's Black Babies", "American Racism", or "American Evil" article.</p>
<p>These constant AfD's about "State Terrorism" articles are really silly. I have no idea if the Sri Lankan and Syrian articles adhere to the same rigor as we have worked to bring the U.S.A. article in line with, but obviously i think that insofar as they can, they should.

<dd>The Geneva Conventions do not mention international terrorism, the only political scientist is Chomsky, the Human Rights orgs are not the major ones like Red Cross etc. they are actually ones I never heard of, though I am sure they are real. There is 1 citations from an international group, wouldnt call it a law org, they write about how you cannot define terrorism, they use state terrorism in the article but not in a real way, they are saying you cannot define it because terrorism lacks a definition. The leading military expert is Ganser, which I wouldnt call a military expert after that document was proven to be a forgery. SO while I am sure this will be a keep, it would be nice if you actually looked over the sources fully and researched them. There is a political scientist being used as a source because he runs a human rights group, oddly enough the web page for that group has nothing on it ... it looks like a home page. The actual "allegations" come from Cuba State News, Chomsky, obscure french human rights groups, World Workers Party etc. And next time you accus eme of something I will start going to admins, I am tired of your baseless accusations, you still never apologized for accusing me of "deleting" those other section even though I proved they were just moved down a section, woops, egg on your face. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 10:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Everyone please witness: this is the sort of nonsense i must put up with on this page (and more than likely the author of this RfD, as well). This person has already seen that the Geneva Conventions are -- as cited repeatedly on the page in question -- the basis for most (but not all) of the official (i.e. -- legal, political, and NGO) definitions of both "terrorism" as well as "state terrorism". Similarly, there are more than a mere few political scientists quoted on the page...and no 'egg on my face'.

<dd>Not sure what you are talking about, who said anything about deleting references? If you participated on the page you would see I never had a problem with it, while the source is bias, WP:RS doesnt say we cannot have bias sources. Also the people who have admitted to wrong doing have not admitted to commiting terrorism. So the actual allegations of terrorism come from only bias sources and not government admissions. This is part of the problem, the US gets accused of commiting "unlawful warfare" from a non bias source, however the source alleging terrorism is Chomsky, by stating all instances of "unlawful warfare" is terrorism, hence making a redefining a legal definition when he does not have a legal degree. My only gripe has been WP:RS sources and Seabhcan provided those. My bigger gripe will never be resolved because some people do not mind an article filled with state run papers as sources, and I do not either since educated people reading the article will see the blatant bias in it.</dd>

<dd>Either the sources pass WP:RS and this page should stay - or they don't, meaning this page should be deleted. You write "[the sources] pass WP:RS". So is that the end of the matter? Will we still find you discussing the issue of these sources in the future? Even though you admit here that the sources meet WP:RS? If you think that a Cuban ambassador to the UN's statement on terrorism against Cuba is a "fringe source" - then that is merely your view. To most people, it is no more fringe than Colin Powell's statement to the UN in 2003. But as you now admit that this meets reliable source guidelines, then why is there a need for you to keep bringing this issue up? Perhaps our confusion about why you repeatedly mention these reliable sources whilst calling for a deletion of a page, may explain why you are reading what you term "circular arguments". --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article could be stronger since there are many many credible sources of information regarding the extensive use of and support for terrorist activities perpetrated by the USA. 'The Trial of Henri Kissinger" by Christopher Hitchens comes to mind. But, this article is of much higher quality than many on Wikipedia and has over sixty sources, many of which are extremely credible, ie the Guardian Newspaper in Britian (Englands third largest paper). Furthermore, there has been very little counter evidence on this forum, nor any actual discredidation of the used sources. I am annoyed at the petiness of this debate. Calling people anit-american because they are critical of a countries human rights abuses is a terrible rhetorical tactic. Much like calling anyone who crticises Israeli policy and marginalization of Palestinians anti-semetic including academics like Prof. Finklestien, who had two parents survive Nazi concentration camps. Many of the most committed American citizens including numerous members of the National Public Radio have presented evidence of US terroism. I will stop here. Please do not delete this article, make it better, or atleast come up with some credible accusations either against the sources used or disproving the facts cited. If we only count as credible those institutions and academics who are lauded by mainstream discourses then they will be free to dupe us at every turn.--<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mahakaya (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mahakaya_be04.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mahakaya">contribs</a>) 01:47, 14 December 2006 UTC.</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>We are not judging the merit of the accusations against a country. The accusations exist, they are well known world-wide, they are the subject of legal and political action.

<li><b>Keep.</b> An article is suitable for inclusion in wikipedia if it supplies documented, non-obvious, non-source-text information about a notable phenomenon from a neutral perspective and in a summary format.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The concern that this article is an instance of content-forking is not misplaced; but because the article treats allegations, and as such, could include official US Government responses to the charges, the article is not necessarily POV.</dd>
<dd>I am worried that the article is beginning to "plead evidence" rather than confine itself to an overview treatment. Wikipedia should report controversies <i>but not resolve them,</i> no matter how dispassionately that resolution is attempted. External links and references can direct readers to sources that attempt to analyze and resolve the controversy. Accordingly, some of the lengthier block-quotes and more detailed statements of accusations should be <b>summarized</b> at a level more appropriate for reporting rather than analysis.</dd>

<dd>I think part of the problem is that Nuclear and others define "fringe" any person or group who makes these allegations. Thus even governments of large important countries, such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, become "fringe" as soon as they mention US terrorism. Whole universities become "fringe", however selectively. ETH Zurich is now a "Fringe" university for the purposes of discrediting this view, however, when one of their faculty published the Theory of Relativity, they are not "fringe". I don't see Nuclear putting <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> on AfD because he worked at a "Fringe" university. There's no way to win against this kind of logic - they want it both ways.

<dd>I think the government of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro are not the most neutral of observers. I have no problem with ETH Zurich either, not sure where I said I did. If you watch the news you would see how the Iranian president hosted a "serious conference" on if the Holocaust happened, so serious he got the best researchers, like David Duke, and did not permit anyone with an Israeli citizenship present. So while you may find the president of Iran to be neutral on certain issues, I surely wouldnt consider them neutral on issues related to the US or Jews. I also did not put Ganser up for AfD, so not sure why you would assume I would put Einstein up either. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have to say I find this misleading as well because I never stated Ganser was not a reputable source either, simply that if you wanted to avoid the talk page drama with others, you may want to bolster your sources with non Ganser material. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 19:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Chavez and Castro may not be neutral, but Bush is no better - I'd put them all in the same salt jar - an the US is certainly not neutral in their denial of terrorism. (I'd didn't mean you alone, but you are certainly on the more reasonable end of the same spectrum). My point is that the label "fringe" is used to dismiss things witch conflict with a predefined notion of reality. I have a Chinese friend who doesn't believe the Tiananmen massacre really happened.

<li><b>I actually agree with many of these conservative editors position</b>, that most of these conspiracy theories are bullshit.

<dd>What do governments as sources have to do with WP:NOR? The more you attempt to summarize the more you seem like you really do not get the point. Allegations is not encyclopedic. There are NOR problems that arrise, however none currently in this allegations article, but come up because people want to assume that a source stating "US violated human rights" is equal to "US commited terrorism" because in their opinion all violations of human rights are terrorist acts ... The real problem is an article on accusations is not encyclopedic. I think I will start one if this is permitted to stay soon on "Allegations of terrorism by Taiwan" and cite China's claim that they attempted to create missles that would reach the Great Dam. Then soon after another one on "Allegations the Democractic Party of America is aiding terrorism" and source it with Republican far right commentators. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 23:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> reliable sources, factual information (about allegations, there were no trials, no independent investigations, how would you expect a strong proof here?). NPOV issues should be resolved by <i>adding</i> opposite views, <i>not by deleting</i> well sourced material. It's difficult to watch how some people cannot stand this article... it only presents different worldview that they happen to have. If you feel it's innacurate, please add reliable sources of your own. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 01:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If we're going to talk about several "allegations / conspiracy theory" pages at once, we need to set a common standard, especially since a precedent here could affect pages like <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a> and <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. First, let's get the definitions straight:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Allegation: X did Y<br /></dd>
<dd>Verifiable fact: The allegation that X did Y has been seriously discussed in several notable sources, such as... (list sources)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia cannot make the claim, "X did Y", but it can publish verifiable facts, like the one listed above. We can simply <i>report this fact</i> (the fact that such allegations have been widely discussed in notable sources), or we can write an article which <i>discusses this allegation</i>. This is where POV comes into the picture. Any in-depth article about an allegation or conspiracy theory <b>must cover both points of view</b>, without slipping into OR. I'd have no problem with an article in this format:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1: Verifiable fact: The allegation that X did Y has been seriously discussed in several notable sources, such as...<br />
<dl>
<dd>(mention a couple sources which summarize the allegation itself, but in a NPOV tone)<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2: Verifiable fact: In the book ("They Did Bad"), Bob discusses...<br />
<dl>
<dd>(summary of all the published sources which support the allegation, no extra OR)<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3: Verifiable fact: However, an alternate explanation was put forward by the "Real Beef Research Institute" ...<br />
<dl>
<dd>(summary of all the published sources which refute the allegation, no extra OR)<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>4: List all references fully at the end.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, btw, "Hillary Clinton acts like a bitch" will always be a matter of personal opinion and judgement. Conspiracies and allegations deal with matters of fact - "It is alleged that, on this date, this happened...". People might hold opinions about it with varying degrees of confidence, but a simple allegation of fact (X did Y) is either <i>right</i> or it is <i>wrong</i>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Interesting points. But I'm not quite sure how events on this page affect various conspiracy articles. In the area of the article I am concerned with, the allegations are made by the Cuban government that perpetrators of terrorists acts were employed by the CIA. The alternative explanation comes from the perpetrators, who say that yes they were employed by the CIA, and admit to the acts. Its fairly straightforward. There are no opposing points of view, and it is all recorded in declassified files anyway. Just as there is no opposing view that the CIA initiated the Bay of Pigs invasion, conducted assassination attempts on Cuban leaders, tracked down Che Guevara in Bolivia and oversaw his execution etc etc. These events aren't conspiracy theories or wild allegations.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 11:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Zleitzen, Re: US article - I haven't looked that closely at any of the articles yet, which is why I wanted to setup some ground rules above. Still, here's a couple random thoughts about the United States article:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The title itself is a matter of opinion - what exactly is an act of terror? Does rigging an election count? What if someone says they're freedom fighters? I <i>really</i> don't want do get into that debate, so I'll simply suggest that <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_operations.html" title="Covert operations">covert operations</a> might be a more NPOV term to use. Any claims that act X was a (terrorist act / liberation) need to be made when discussing that specific act.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) I'm concerned about the "Other allegations of American terrorism" section. This section simply takes a historical event (e.g. war in Iraq), and lists a single source which puts forward the <i>opinion</i> that it was terrorism. First, a Saddam spokesman is hardly a neutral source. Instead of putting these quotes here, they might better be used on a "war in Iraq" page, as an example of the "pro-Saddam POV'. Secondly, if you want to find some independent evidence of the US sponsoring acts of terror in places like Iraq, be my guest. But note that "a group of soldiers comitting a criminal offence", and "an act of terrorism ordered and sponsored by the US government" are two <b>very</b> different things. If the only evidence that such terrorism occured is that a Saddam supporter said "what the US is doing is terrorism", this should be treated as propoganda and dismissed. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 15:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good points.</dd>
<dd>1) We have been arguing about a title for months, with several informal and formal straw polls, changing the title is like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding_cats.html" title="Herding cats">Herding cats</a>. In addition, I argued over and over that "alleged" in the title violates <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. The unsuprising response was what "is" is. (this has been a common argument for months, what <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> <i>really</i> mean, does source x meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? )...</dd>
<dd>1) Several editors have attempted to define what is terrorism, using US terms for terrorism. I think it is a good idea, similar to the short definition at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> another controversial page. The definition section has been deleted repeatedly (in fact, every single one of these sections has been deleted by a small core group of wikipedians, opposed to this page)</dd>
<dd>2) The "Other allegations of American terrorism" section was supposed to be deleted, at least that was the result of the straw poll, along with the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Gladio_6040.html" title="Operation Gladio">Operation Gladio</a> section.</dd>

<p>Non-notable beauty pageant contestant - only holds local title and has not even competed at the state pageant yet. The only instance where a contestant who has competed in but not won a state level pageant has been considered notable is <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Whitehead_2282.html" title="Cassandra Whitehead">Cassandra Whitehead</a>, who competed and placed in the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Texas_Teen_USA_1443.html" title="Miss Texas Teen USA">Miss Texas Teen USA</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Texas_USA_d52c.html" title="Miss Texas USA">Miss Texas USA</a> pageants over a number of years. However, she was also a contestant on ANTM and was the first to quit that show. The article was kept after an AFD.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think there is precedent that we can have both. Lists can do things that categories can't--such as have both romanji and kanji/kana. It's easier and nicer to browse than a category in many ways. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How so? I find it difficult to search through so many different individual articles when I could just have all the notable musicians in one category. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In categories you may have to go "next 200" several times before finding what you want. On a list you just have to scroll down. Also lists allow for annotation and red-links. The red-links on the list could include significant J-Pop artists. Japanese people are, surprisingly, underrepresented at Wikipedia when you consider that Japan is a large and modern nation.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 02:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I wasn't going to use T. Anthony's argument... but... In a category you will see a link to Hitomi Yaida. On a list page you can see "Hitomi Yaida (矢井田瞳)" You may not think that's a big deal... but, it can be useful I believe. Lists are more versatile and I just don't see a reason to delete it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 13:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I find that being split up into 26 articles is less convenient than pressing a button a few times. I also don't see how catering to lazy users is a reason for keeping such articles. Also, if an artist is notable enough, an article will be created for him/her/them. If not, then including a red link does nothing but spam up Wikipedia when some random obsessed fan decides to clog up the AfD process by writing an article about a non-notable musician. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Red-links can help when you're interested in improving coverage of a style of music even if you don't know every individual in it. For example I found <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_pianists.html" title="List of jazz pianists">List of jazz pianists</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brazilian_musicians_19e6.html" title="List of Brazilian musicians">List of Brazilian musicians</a> useful in starting articles. I saw a name I wasn't familiar with and then checked if it was notable at music sites I know. Then on creating it the article is now available for those who know more. That's how the article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cables_0a54.html" title="George Cables">George Cables</a> got started.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'll concede that, but the article gives <a href="http://wiki.theppn.org/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://wiki.theppn.org/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">this website</a> as the source for most of the names. If nothing else, that link can be saved while the rest can be deleted and each musician judged on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 03:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As there <i>is</i> no kanji/kana names in the list right now, we have no way to argue for or against such an addition because we don't know what it will look like. Also, the threshold of "J-POP" is not defined well in the list. Remember, J-POP covers rock, soul, R&amp;B, and other genres, so it's a very wide category. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 03:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Indiscriminate list that's better served by a category. The kana argument is invalid. There are two or three entries on the list which use kana. It's not a big loss. The red link argument is invalid as these titles can be added to the Japan requested articles red link farm where they can be properly fed and looked after: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested_articles/Japan</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 13:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not invalid... just hasn't been done yet. There is a big difference.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think both gren's kana/kanji argument and the red link argument are valid. It does serve good as a good starting point when I find wikipedia has zero information on a particular artist. Also converting this to a category is uncessary since it is largely covered by <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_musicians_733b.html" title="Category:Japanese musicians">Category:Japanese musicians</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_musical_groups_5f53.html" title="Category:Japanese musical groups">Category:Japanese musical groups</a>.

<li>Hey, guess what? This is EN Wikipedia, not a place to cater to Japanophile interests. Most people will not know the Japanese kana or kanji. Per <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">User:Kunzite</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a> is a much better place to store red links and since this list has zero information on any artist besides the name, this article is a terrible place to start research on them. A sub-category for J-pop musicians is entirely feasible too. In conclusion, this list does nothing unique. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, I like how the reasoning has changed since the AFD was opened. "not notable enough to have their own article" has morphed to "well, list them someplace else". So, are all red links in articles a bad idea? Red links should just be added to a project which may or may not be accessed by the users who read the article (list) and would otherwise have an incentive to create new information for Wikipedia? And the premise that there is no room for both categories and lists for a topic has been debated many times in the past, and judging from the 110 lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_musicians_by_genre_f63f.html" title="Category:Lists of musicians by genre">Category:Lists of musicians by genre</a> alone, I would have to assume that there must be a good reason to keep both the lists and categories. Adding kanji to the name in the categorization is an interesting idea (a rarity for AFD lately, it seems), and I think I'll bring that up at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> where Japanese naming conventions are discussed. It still wouldn't change the fact that the list is useful. The 26 sub-lists are less useful, and I agree that they can be deleted, because they duplicate info on the main list. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added that addendum because <a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">User:T. Anthony</a> explained that some notable artists may not have articles simply because of Wikipedia's systemic bias against non-English speaking subjects. The notability of a person is independent of the state of having an article and I changed my argument to say that this list is not the proper place where articles should be requested and that <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a> is the proper place to do that. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you. However there are reasons some of us prefer working on lists rather than requested articles. I worked on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_music_7fa9.html#Jazz" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/music">Wikipedia:Requested_articles/music#Jazz</a> for a time, but then went back to working on lists. Why? Because frankly lists are usually better done. Requested articles is often just a dumping ground that mixes notable people with some local musician someone like. Lists actually tend to have more legitimately notable people because lists are

<li><b>Keep</b> Lists can be more informative than categories, by adding more information than a simple article title, and by arranging the subjects in a more informative way than a category can. However, beyond the red links, this list does not yet take advantage of the advantages a list can have over a category. Keep, but make the list more useful. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 23:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categories can have organization too. It's not too difficult to simply have sub-cats for a Category:J-pop artists which would include things like Category:J-rock artists, or the like. In that way, the categories could organize the articles in the same way you mentioned, if not better. For example, if someone wanted to find other visual kei artists, they could simply click on the sub-cat "Visual kei artists" and be linked to all the other artists in that group. However, unless you want to spam the link to this article on every single J-pop artist's page, it would be difficult to locate this page in the first place and even then, it would be difficult to find the artist you're looking for. If there's something else you'd like to add, please do. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep, with stipulations</b> (Edit conflict) This list has the potential to be useful, but needs some serious work first. First and foremost, the list needs to be renamed, to something along the lines of Japanese musical artists. It includes not only J-pop artists, but it also claims to include <a href="../../../j/-/r/J-Rock_a7c7.html" title="J-Rock">J-Rock</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_Kei_fa9d.html" title="Visual Kei">Visual Kei</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_hip_hop.html" title="Japanese hip hop">Japanese hip hop</a> artists as well. Second, loose the sublists. All the information contained in them can be found in the main article, really the only reason for a sublist in this case would be if the page over the size limit, which it is not. If there are any sublists to be in there, I would say that this should be made into a hierachical list, because the list says it includes 4 distinct genres. Third, the article needs to have some serious clean-up work done. Mainly, it directly conflicts with <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a>, specifically the section on <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html#Names_of_modern_figures" title="WP:MOS-JA">modern names</a> by going in Japanese, rather than Western order. If people have a problem with all the red links, there probably wouldn't be any problem with them being summarily moved over to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a>; somebody wanted them, might as well see if someone can make a decent article on them. I personally don't have a problem with them, though, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_violinists.html" title="List of violinists">List of violinists</a> has plenty of red links, and its more well-done than this list. Finally the list should definantly note that it is incomplete; I'm sure that some of the Japanese musical artists we have on Wikipedia who fall into the genres covered by this list. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 02:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I never said that it was too broad, just improperly titled. I find that lists are generally tend to be, when well-maintained, much more user-friendly, which is the basis of why I feel it should be kept. It needs clean-up, but lists have value in that it make it more accessable for the average user. If you take note, most musical genres have both lists of aritsts within them and categories relating to them; this seems to be standard in almost every single case. To give a <i>very</i> abbreviated list, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_metalcore_bands.html" title="List of metalcore bands">List of metalcore bands</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetalcore_musical_groups_1c0a.html" title="Category:Metalcore musical groups">Category:Metalcore musical groups</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_death_metal_bands.html" title="List of death metal bands">List of death metal bands</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Category%7EDeath_metal_musical_groups_7a2b.html" title="Category:Death metal musical groups">Category:Death metal musical groups</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_musicians.html" title="List of jazz musicians">List of jazz musicians</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_jazz_musicians_47ee.html" title="Category:Lists of jazz musicians">Category:Lists of jazz musicians</a>, etc. There doesn't seem to be any reason why there cannot both be a list and a category.

<li>For the sake of argument, is there anything those lists provides that the categories don't? Personally, I find it easier to navigate between articles within a category. For example, let's say that hypothetically, I wanted to from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Precious_Blood_%28band%29_e4ee.html" title="Most Precious Blood (band)">Most Precious Blood</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_by_Stereo_e69b.html" title="Death by Stereo">Death by Stereo</a>. With a category, I could simply click on the category link at the bottom to see a list of articles within the category. For the list option, I would fist have to know that a list exists (which most people who randomly browse Wikipedia don't), then find it, then find the person I was looking for, if I didn't already know the name. That seems like a much more involved and unintuitive process compared to just having a category. The point is that we don't have two articles on Isaac Newton so we shouldn't have two articles documenting the same thing (in this case, J-pop artists), especially since one of them seems to do it better. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 03:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Umm no. When I first started here lists were easier for me. I'd heard of listing things well before I came here and Encyclopedias themselves have index. In addition to that type <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_pianists.html" title="Jazz pianists">Jazz pianists</a> and you get redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_pianists.html" title="List of jazz pianists">List of jazz pianists</a>. Or if you prefer type in "heavy metal bands" and you will get redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_bands.html" title="List of heavy metal bands">List of heavy metal bands</a>. Now if I'm thinking "who is that jazz pianist whose obituary I saw in 2001?", how is a category going to help me?

<li>I think all those lists fail to grasp what it means to actually be a list, by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia's standards</a>. Now, let's take a look at a list that isn't redundant with its category: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a>. While <a href="../../../h/i/v/Category%7EHIV-positive_people_3d33.html" title="Category:HIV-positive people">Category:HIV-positive people</a> exists and is useful, this list goes beyond simply listing the name for the sake of having that person's name there. It provides a <i>substantial</i> amount of useful information that can't be achieved with a category and is also well-referenced. In its current state, this and all the other list articles that have been mentioned fail to justify their existence by including such information that a list would be required at all. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 20:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not about how long it is, it's about the J-Pop artists! I'm sorry if i sound stupid, but I believe we need to keep this list, because i've used it before, and it is very helpful, sometimes I try to find new and exciting bands using this very list. What would be the main point of destoying it? Would it be to long? There are plenty of other categories where the list is far more longer than this <i>mere</i> list, eg. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_left-handed_people.html" title="List of famous left-handed people">List of famous left-handed people</a> is one such example.<a href="../../../b/l/k/User%7EBlkeddie%21_ee6c.html" title="User:Blkeddie!">Blkeddie!</a> 02:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you saying that if this article does not exist that they will be any less than J-pop artists? Do you have any specific reasons why a list is preferable to a category? The presence of another list does not justify this one's. It simply means that someone with a critical eye has not yet questioned its value. I can say right now that I can see myself nominating that article for deletion in preference to a category as well. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:38, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I'd say keep</b> There's a lot of good that can be derived from an exhaustive list of J-Pop artists.

<li>Remember, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">not an advertisement</a>. We are not here to "promote" anything, only document existing notable things.

<li><b>Keep</b> A lot of Japanese artists may not be notable enough to have their own articles, but they’re worth being mentioned anyway, in case someone wants to do research about them or look up a name. Categories only list artists that have their own articles – that is, only the “notable” ones – while omitting a lot of names. ～<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArterialFear_4cc1.html" title="User:ArterialFear">Michelle</a> 16:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would disagree. If they're not notable enough for their own article, why should their name be mentioned at all in a professional encyclopedia? There are enough fansites that can do that. Also, what kind of research would you be able to do here if all that's mentioned is a name? If we were to go by your criteria, then the list would be nearly endless since there are literally <i>thousands</i> of non-notable J-pop artists. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 20:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as completely unmanageable. There are literally tens of thousands of J-pop artists, and more are coming out daily. A category is much better suited for keeping track of them. For any that need articles, they can be listed (along with the kanji/kana for their names and any supporting links) on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a> pages.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists serve purposes that categories don't. Most importantly, they can be checked and monitored for thoroughness, which is critical to Wikipedia's mission of building a truly comprehensive encyclopedia. Splitting might be a good idea, but I'm really not sure <i>how</i> this list would be split. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 04:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of lists by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia's standards</a>. Lists should provide a substantial amount of relevant information about each entry on it in order to separate it from its related category. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a> is a good example of a list of people which provides enough relevant information about each person to warrant separation from its parent category: <a href="../../../h/i/v/Category%7EHIV-positive_people_3d33.html" title="Category:HIV-positive people">Category:HIV-positive people</a>. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then how about instead of senselessly arguing for 4 more days about how little relevant information is contained in this list you go through ever artist and put in a table a brief summary on each artist. You know just because it isn't relevant to you doesn't mean it's not relevant to the other whatever million people that use this encyclopedia.<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColenFace_0146.html" title="User:ColenFace">ColenFace</a> 08:35, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I don't think I'm misunderstanding anything. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists">Wikipedia:Lists#Purpose of lists</a>, particularly item 3: "Development." I'm not saying this list couldn't be done better, but it is <i>already</i> a useful resource for development, and could readily be made even more valuable in that regard (for example, by adding entries from other (reliable) online J-pop lists). -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 10:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is roughly the point I tried to make above. A list doesn't magically begin in the best format. It has been established that lists can be done well, and just because this list is not done well, it is not suitable grounds for deletion either. Grounds for improvement, yes. I'd prefer to encourage the development of the article, not removing it because it is not up to the standards of some other lists. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 09:13, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that the pro-deletion and pro-keeping people are basically making the same argument: This list is not worth keeping <i>as it stands now.</i> The "keepers" say, let's keep it and improve it. The "deleters" say, it's not useful <i>now,</i> so let's delete it. I won't be working on the list, but my vote remains "keep," and those editors who are interested in the list should work on it. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that's a good summary of the arguments. The list in unmanageable in scope. There are lots of J-pop artists and even if the article were cleaned up or expanded beyond a mere list of artists, it would be unmanageable, out of date, or a red link farm inviting people to submit articles for artists who really aren't notable. There are a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a> style arguments here with people expressing a desire to keep because they find it easier to edit or keep track of a list. Those are not reasons to keep as you can easily do the same thing with a category. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 03:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I had to hazard a guess, I think that the number of J-Pop artists is significantly LOWER than the number of HIV infected people. I don't like making that comparison, but, since that list has been pointed to above, seems to be a good example of a list, and also seems to be managed well, claiming that the J-Pop list is unmanageable is a flawed argument. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 11:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. This whole situation is totally counter productive we're all volunteering our time to build wikipedia, a large number of hours have already been put into this page. An example of a well compiled list was given and can be replicated with the J-pop artists but for some reason the push to delete this list continues. It's easy to argue to delete a list you yourself have put 0 hours of work into but it's extremely difficult for those of us who have dedicated solid hours into building this page to see it all go completely to waste for what appears to be totally selfish reasons. This list holds extreme potential and that potential will be displayed as soon as this hostage crisis is resolved.<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColenFace_0146.html" title="User:ColenFace">ColenFace</a> 05:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't do the same thing with a category. The reason for this is simple: a category is not a list; aside from the intro text and cat tags, a category is simply the result of a live database query. Thus, a category cannot be reliable monitored, because it is impossible to track when articles have been removed from a category, and for what reasons.

<li>Thanks for pointing this out.

<p>Found while clearing out <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>. I actually deleted this page, but I undeleted per request to my talk page. The request read: <i>Hi, you recently speedily deleted the Twelve project entry due to the fact you considered it as not being notable. It was notable in that it features at least one member (more than one actually) from a notable group (<a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_By_Seven_fe67.html" title="Six By Seven">Six By Seven</a>).</i> Surely this article should have been put up for discussion under the articles for deletion section. The reason that I am saying this is that <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_me_USA_5961.html" title="Fuck me USA">Fuck me USA</a>, which is linked back to this group and also has the same relationship with six by seven, is currently being discussed. In fact Twelve should be more elligible to have an article on Wikipedia seeing as two albums have been released. Both Twelve and Fuck Me USA are an essential part of the Six By Seven history/timeline. <i>Therefore I nominated this to afd. Opinions on what to do with this? <b>No Stance</b> —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">ask me for <b>help</b></a>) 19:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I feel this article should not be deleted. As I said on Eagle's talk page, this band is notable in that it features more than one person who is a member of another notable band. 2 official albums have been released. Twelve is an essential piece of the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_By_Seven_fe67.html" title="Six By Seven">Six By Seven</a> timeline (along with <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_me_USA_5961.html" title="Fuck me USA">Fuck me USA</a>) - also up for discussion).</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criterion 6 says 'Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.' So there should certainly be something there, but it's not obvious to me that it needs to be a separate article. Is there any reason not to merge and redirect?

<dd>Pardon me if this seems like lawyering, but one article being a directory&#160;!= Wikipedia being a directory. And the WP definition of directory is a phone book, Internet guide, plot summary, or cookbook. This is neither. Lists aren't uncommon in WikiPedia. If Keep nom fails, though (and I don't think it will, based on the quality of the arguments I have seen - in this case, I'm judging by consensus, not straw poll), allow article time to be <b>gamiafied</b> to Encyclopedia Gamia.

<li><b>Keep or categorise</b> The fact that the article already has references and external links already proves that the article has some sort of notability. Let me also bring up the fact that <a href="../../../g/a/m/WP%7EGAMES_2f8a.html" title="WP:GAMES">WP:GAMES</a> states that notability can be achieved if a game or the like has been reviewed by non-trivial published works; that's good enough for me. Unfortunately, I see no reason to AFD here, other than people saying, in short, "because it's crufty", which is a vio of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. That being said, blocking out people from saying "Keep, I've played them" knocks out a large portion of people who intend to vote in this debate, since those who have played the mods know the full degree of their notability. You could easily domino-effect to games in general, which I certainly hope you are not implying. The article is fit for print, according to the policies and the reasons through which I have cited. In fact, in the previous AFD, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> was close at hand, so this whole DRV and repeat AFD hubbub shouldn't even exist.--<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaltCip_235e.html" title="User:WaltCip">WaltCip</a> 03:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, no one has used that argument yet, but by denying people that argument, you're effectively suppressing them regardless. And AFDs have been decided on non-policy arguments before as well.

<li>We haven't "suppressed" them. We can't prevent them for using whatever reason they feel like, it'll just get discounted because it's not policy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two basic issues at hand here- do the individual mods pass our policies? If so, should we have a list of them in addition to a category? Most, if not all, of the mods listed in these articles have received independent coverage in gaming magazines/websites. So... should we have a list of them? Lists are much more useful than categories, especially in the case of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Half-Life_2_mods_bcbc.html" title="List of Half-Life 2 mods">List of Half-Life 2 mods</a>.

<li><b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is really nothing other than a list of external links, i.e. a web directory. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If this were considered encyclopedic, then lists of links to popular <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> videos can't be far behind.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles are of a good quality (hey, I've seen a lot worse) and they're not just lists, they've had work put into them, there's images and an infobox and all the formatting is correct. All of the information in the articles is verifiable. The reason I bring up the amount of work put into it is that that means people <i>do</i> pay attention to it and so the wiki process will improve the articles over time. As the two users above me have stated, a list is not redundant to a category because articles allow for more content than lists, (explanations of individual mods, pictures, not just a list of articles). If I'm not mistaken it is possible for things to be notable enough to mention them somewhere in Wikipedia but not notable enough to have their own article so lists contain more information. They're not really lists <i>per se</i>, so maybe editors ought to consider making them more like just "Half-Life mods" and "Half-Life 2 mods" and then of course have the whole "history of modmaking" and all the rest of it (with reliable sources cited of course). Oh and there should be a brief mention of what ModDB is and how "authoritative" (for want of a better word) it is, it's referred to for a lot of them.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiSlasher_63a7.html" title="User:WikiSlasher">WikiSlasher</a> 09:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> These articles have good encyclopedic content and actually serve an important function for gamers.

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel that the mod community involved with these games is strong enough to generate enough verifiable info in order to list articles on individual mods. In turn, a list like this can be useful for skimming and acquiring info on each mod.</li>
<li><i>However</i>, both lists should only contain mods with articles on WP - if it can't stand on its own two feet it shouldn't be crawling around on this list. There seems little point trying to maintain an incomplete list (even in terms of not containing every HL mod listed on WP) if the articles contained on that list aren't properly referenced and could be AFD'd at any time. I'd ask contributors interested in these articles to make sure their efforts are aimed at improving the articles already on WP and ensuring they remain.</li>
<li>As a side note, having websites listed after each mod name is irritating to read and smacks of advertising - they should be in the mod's article as an external link. Also, there are several mods with articles on WP which are not listed here. Hooking up articles to this list and any categories that exist will be of use to readers and encourage contributors to follow the path and improve articles/update the list - that's what it's all about. There's an opportunity here. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>The purpose of a list of Half-Life mods is mainly just that, having a list. The partitioning into categories makes sense but it shouldn't be used as a reason to keep a list.</s> A reason to keep a list would be that it offers significantly more information than a mere category (such as the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Category%7EHalf-Life_mods_4fe9.html" title="Category:Half-Life mods">Category:Half-Life mods</a>) does. I don't think that a link to the article, description and optional award is sufficient to justify a list. Perhaps it should contain the same information which is given in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>: Name/link to article, author, date of first public (playable) release, date of last update, and ... the link to the website. This last piece of information is arguable because WP is not a repository of links, however it's also in the web comic list, so why not here? --<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzahut2_8d0a.html" title="User:Pizzahut2">Pizzahut2</a> 11:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>After reading <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">WP:LIST</a>, I guess partitioning into categories counts as "grouped by theme". --<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzahut2_8d0a.html" title="User:Pizzahut2">Pizzahut2</a> 19:45, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is it not possible to rather have a wiki book or something on Half Life and transwiki the material their.

<li><b>Keep</b> Resaon: it useful to both the user and the mod maker. It gives the user a easy place to find the mod. It helps the mod maker becaues it avertise (is that spelled right?) mod.

<li>One <b>strong delete</b> doesn't match several <b>keeps</b>, I'm afraid. Also, a <b>strong</b> in front of your delete without a proponent argument or policy other than "cruft" deserves no attention on the nominator's part, especially since you haven't explained why it isn't notable, other than from point-of-view.

<li><b>Keep</b> IF it can be restored to its former usefulness - the current edit is totally useless and ought to be deleted. Single-player mods are the 'red-headed stepchildren' of the gaming world and this article was the _only_ place where one could get a feel for the status of the community (can't do that now, of course. Looks like the thing was edited by a very non-npov person from the 'single-player mods suck!' school of thought.) Also, to the idea that a non-released mod is, by definition, non-notable, ah...hogwash. I'd to like to hear the argument that the Black Mesa mod is non-notable; that project has Valve's direct blessing, for one thing.</li>

<dd>1. <b>None of the incidents in the article are disputed</b></dd>

<dd>4 I'm strongly against the merger this with "Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE" .<b>That article surprisingly do not mention a single massacre carried out by the LTTE in the 1980's'</b>.I do not know how the writer missed clear LTTE massacres,such as Aranthalawa,kent and dollar farm,Vallamundal,Kokilai,Dehiwatta,Mahadivuwela, Andakulam and etc(if I write the whole,even a day or two wont be enough!!)</dd>
<dd>So its obvious that the LTTE have carried out thousands if not more, number on attacks on Sinhalese civilians and that article hardly mention any of them.So I see no point merging with that article.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 12:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Every attack listed resulted in the death of at least five or six innocent people and therefore there can be no dispute over notability. There is also nothing wrong with using government documents in Wikipedia articles. It is the right of every government to record the deaths of its nationals. In any case it states "attributed to the LTTE" not "carried out by the LTTE". Also the overwhelimg consensus among the WIkipedia community is that the words like "terrorist incident" or "terrorist attack" are acceptable (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_terrorist_incidents_7376.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of terrorist incidents">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_terrorist_incidents</a>). And many of the incidents are sourced from nutral external sources like the BBC, CNN and the Hindu.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also the articles should not be merged. The reason is the Notable attacks article was spun off from the main <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html" title="LTTE">LTTE</a> article due to article size issues. See this discussion for more info <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Notable_attacks_by_the_LTTE_2e00.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Notable attacks by the LTTE">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Notable_attacks_by_the_LTTE</a>. It lists only the most notable of the LTTE attacks.

<p>Fictitious concept created by a small faction of Wikipedians in an effort to be politically correct. This concept is clearly separate from the real topic it pretends to address, <b>Islamic terrorism</b>. The same thing applies with Zionist political violence, which should be Zionist terrorism, and "Allegations of Israeli apartheid," which should be Israeli apartheid. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While some editors might suggest moving the current page to the title Islamic terrorism, there really isnt anything worth salvaging from the current, pov, uncited mess. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Delete</b> I wonder these people who claim to be philosophers and intellectuals on wikipedia. Tell me, you people really dont know the hypocrisy of news media? Did you ever hear the term 'terrorism by israel'? How many times you hear the 'christian extremist terrorism' on FOX and CNN. Does one FOX, CBC and CNN comprise all the media of the world. You Americans please come out of this Bubble created by few news channels. There is more to the world than a couple of hypocrite American channels.</li>
<li>Now people will think why am I criticizing in this way. My point is, there is no such thing called 'islamic terrorism' or 'islamic extremist terrorism' in under the definition which is being provided by wikipedians here. How many countries North Korea or Syria or Iran have ruined??? NONE. How many countries American regime ruined? Dozen. How many people killed by American regime? Millions. Even then there is not even a single day when the channels dont yell the self created term 'islamic terrorism'. So my point is, the same is happening on the wikipedia articles. Muslims just cant defend by correct editing because very very minor percentage of Muslims have access to the internet. Any website goes to number one in the ranke which is used by Americans , that does not comply that it is number one in the world too. Please see the www.msn.com ranking on www.alexa.com <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.msn.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.msn.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Its number second, but in non-American and non-Eu countries, nobody even thinks to visit that site.

<ul>
<li>About 40% of the article is uncited. And for your information, I have done more to correct Wikipedia's information on terrorism than is required for me to open a debate on this topic, which is none at all. I suggest you take a look at <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Kazakhstan_a7b2.html" title="Terrorism in Kazakhstan">Terrorism in Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-terrorism_in_Kazakhstan_6caa.html" title="Counter-terrorism in Kazakhstan">Counter-terrorism in Kazakhstan</a>, the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Movement_of_Uzbekistan_4513.html" title="Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan">Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../../j/c/a/JCAM_430f.html" title="JCAM">JCAM</a>, and <a href="../../../h/t/_/HT_90d6.html" title="HT">HT</a> before making such bold statements. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 05:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If 40% is uncited, then add cite tags. Just because an article lacks citations for asserted facts does not mean that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, which then would prompt deletion. In any case, the fact that you've tried to make other articles neutral has no bearing on this article. Deleting for POV concerns comes only after thorough attempts have been made to make the article NPOV. Only irredeemably or inherently POV articles get deleted. The current POV tag was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_extremist_terrorism&amp;diff=83505788&amp;oldid=83505513" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_extremist_terrorism&amp;diff=83505788&amp;oldid=83505513" rel="nofollow">added 24 October</a> and there has been no conversation related to <i>that</i> POV claim on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamic_extremist_terrorism_0719.html" title="Talk:Islamic extremist terrorism">talk page</a>.

<li>Sure, footnote 24 is citing a source discussing the issue. Googling "Islamic extremist terrorism " gets me a few thousand hits (not counting Wikipedia and its derivatives).

OTH, if all it is you want is "Islamic extremist terrorism" together, your barking up the wrong tree.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is there <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Christian extremist terrorism">Christian extremist terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Islamic extremist terrorism">Islamic extremist terrorism</a> but no <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Zionist extremist terrorism">Zionist extremist terrorism</a>? Instead, there is <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_political_violence.html" title="Zionist political violence">Zionist political violence</a>. I see a clear double standard here. Either the Zionist article should be renamed to this convention, or the Christian and Islamic terrorism articles should be renamed to "political violence", i.e. Christian political violence and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_political_violence.html" title="Islamic political violence">Islamic political violence</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> applies especially to cases such as this. metaspheres 06:08, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think the article is supposed to be about <i>extremist terrorism</i> but <i>terrorism by Islamic extremists</i>, highlighting the fact that only a minority viewpoint within the religion have engaged in terrorism.

<li>I'd suggest a centralized discussion in an attempt to create a consensus for the naming of all three articles. That's what was attempted with the "...apartheid" articles, though I'm not sure how successful it was at achieving consensus.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This kind of thing is always prone to stubbornness, so I agree that it is probably very difficult to reach any consensus, but I believe it's still possible, though we could probably kill two birds with one stone by renaming this right here and now. Though KazakhPol's point is valid, the fact remains that we have to be consistent with NPOV, which would necessitate replacing "terrorism" with "political violence" in the article titles. The reason being that the article does not simply discuss al-Qaeda (which is universally viewed as terrorist except by its own supporters) but other groups as well. I'm not sure why KazahkPol would nominate this article for deletion when he seems only opposed to the article title. Anyway, for what its worth, I say <b>rename</b> to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_political_violence.html" title="Islamic political violence">Islamic political violence</a>. Same for the Christian one. metaspheres 06:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that should be discussed here. Usually renaming discussion happens on the article's talk page. If you need more input, list at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>, which is also linked above. Forcing mergers sometimes happens at AfD, but there's really no point in forcing a rename, especially with the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamist_terrorism_Archive_of_page_move_debate_20c8.html" title="Talk:Islamist terrorism/Archive of page move debate">enormous history of controversy</a> over the name of this article. AfD, with its five day time limit, is too quick and stressful and dirty for a rename of this article, let alone a completely different one. Also look at <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html#Religion_and_terrorism_pages" title="User talk:Kchase02">User_talk:Kchase02#Religion_and_terrorism_pages</a>, as KazakhPol may be starting a centralized discussion on the names of all the articles sometime soon.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The AfD process is not a vote, but a discussion by which to reach consensus. Often times the result is to merge or rename an article, rather than to delete. See for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan_2890.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic politics of Khuzestan">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic politics of Khuzestan</a> which resulted in a rename to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>. This is as good a place as any to discuss and the issue is clear cut and simple. Either you are in favor of "terrorism" or you are not, and five days is more than enough time to reach such a consensus. If consensus can't be reached within five days, it won't be reached in five weeks or five months. metaspheres 08:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'd be surprised how many AfD's can't reach consensus in five days and go through relisting, deletion review, mediation, etc. Anyway, it's unusual for a rename to happen at AfD, in part because the forum isn't necessary for that purpose. Just look at the numbers below "move" that you see at <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_All_8df7.html" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary/All">User:Dragons_flight/AFD_summary/All</a>. Frankly, saying it's as "clear cut and simple" as whether you favor "terrorism" in the title or don't is reducing the issue to a vote. My experience through hundreds of AfD discussions has taught me that a simple vote isn't usually helpful for consensus building.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 09:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep, rename</b> metaspheres is right on. These articles should be kept. But there is no justification whatsoever, other than home bias, for naming the "Christian", "Zionist" and "Islamic" forms differently. "Political violence" is probably more appropriate than "terrorism", but the most fundamental thing in keeping with Wikipedia's NPOV and <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> is that they be labelled <b>the same</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> on rename. If these pages are to be renamed I propose the format: "<i>terrorism by X'</i>" or "<i>political violence by X</i>". Otherwise it reads as if one can commit acts of terrorism/political violence in a Christian or Islamic manner. The religion is relevant to the cause the terrorists are attempting to advance, not the acts of terrorism per se. An act of Christian terrorism would be in substance the same as an act of Islamic terrorism, but with a different objective. -<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 14:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, no move</b>. Articles like this make WP superior to many other info sources, even if they're controversial and under contention. My OED (Concise, 11th Ed.) defines "Islamist" as both <i>n.</i> and <i>adj.</i> but moving pages just for a usage of similar words is trite and disruptive. I also find the grounds for deletion to be FAR from neutral. Better to work on the article to make it concise, NPOV, and well cited than to complain.

<li><b>Comment</b>The crusades deals with a specific historical event (actually a series of events) which is very well defined. "Islamic extremist terrorism" is whatever any editor wants to make it of it no matter how ludicrous including at various times, believe it or not, the Barbary Pirates and the PFLP (Marxist-Leninist organization). Recently there's been an endless revert war over whether to include an enormous chunk of quoted material from a US university student (reputedly a heavy stoner) who went nuts and injured some people with his car. Since the guy claims to be a Muslim and he claims that God told him to do it, therefore it's "Islamic extremist terrorism". I argued against it till I was blue in the face and finally gave up in disgust. There is NO need for this article. It's just a place for people to vent their paranoid fantasies about Islam. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is a violation of NPOV for Wikipedia to call anything terrorist. We can have sentences like "X claims that organization Y is terrorist...", but not something like "Organization Y is a terrorist group founded by Z". Terrorist is a pejorative term, and unacceptable as a classification in a encyclopedia.

<dd>???? You have to do your homework better. "Terrorism" is a legally defined term by a United Nations Convention. <b>It is not a pejorative</b> term, it is in the same category as "murder", "rape", "theft", as defined by laws. Calling someone a murderer if he has been convicted of murder is not pejorative. There is a distinct definition of the word "terrorism" (see the relevant UN Convention) and <b>those who commit terrorism are terrorists</b>. It is as simple as that. I had enough of this politically correct bruhaha jumping into a wide range of articles and pretending that they know better as if the others are not aware of the bulk of human knowledge and civilization. Terrorist is not the same thing as nigger, since there is no such act "to nigger" - if there was such an act, then the people who niggerded would be niggers. However terrorism is an act, and people who "terrorize" (as defined legally by the UN) are terrorists. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:56, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're missing the point. Using the United Nations Convention's definition of the term "terrorism" is a violation of NPOV. This is Wikipedia, an international encyclopedia that should not adhere to any points of views, and in this case the view of the United Nations. I am arguing this point because if we use "terrorist" or "terrorism" the way you intend to do so, it will contradict our very own article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> which discusses this in depth. Also, "murder", "rape", and "theft", are not internationally agreed upon crimes. In one country, an action can be "murder", while in another "manslaughter", while in yet another "justifiable homicide". by calling someone's actions <b>murder</b>, Wikipedia is promoting a POV, which is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>. Same goes for "rape", "sexual assault", etc. We <b>can</b>, however, say that "according to the UN, these are acts of terrorism" etc., but if we go and say "This is an act of terrorism", then that is impermissible as content for an article. This has nothing to do with political correctness, and has all to do with Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 22:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aha.. Why are people pretending not to have "common sense" and the basic rules of the English language? <b>Those who are committing their acts <i>with the intent</i> of terrorizing civilians are terrorists</b>. I mean, is this so hard to understand? It doesn't even matter one bit what they believe or feel. This is the BASIC tenets of English language, your intent is to terrorize? Then that's terrorism. Quite simple really. It is definitely political correctness to say "oh well, he murdered that guy, but we cannot call him a murderer; we have to say "he was convicted of murder by this court". WP:ENGLISH also applies in Wikipedia I am afraid. There are those who have been repeatedly called terrorists, and they do act to terrorize others, therefore they are terrorists. You honestly cannot expect others to say "September 11 was a militant attack committed by those who have been labelled as terrorists by X, Y and Z"!! It doesn't matter that those wackos falsely believed that they would be banging 40 virgins after they exploded into thousand pieces&#160;:) They did it to terrorize others, ergo they are terrorists. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:06, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Lee Hunter is absolutely right, you know. If there was an admin with the balls, he/she would delete this on the grounds that it's an egregious breach of the policies here, regardless how many vote for it. Articles that are titled with epithets should either be about the epithet or have their titles and tenor changed to something more neutral. And an epithet is what this is. It's a ragbag term for any act of violence that a/ we disapprove of, b/ is done by Muslims, c/ whose views we can characterise as extreme (while ignoring that they would characterise our secularism as equally extreme). We do not call the bombing of Baghdad "Christian extremist terrorism" even though Mr Bush a/ is a Christian, b/ is intolerant of solutions to governance that he doesn't approve of and c/ has ordered the destruction of civilian infrastructure and acts that he knew would kill civilians, among other acts of violence. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Brain Trauma wants to remain underground to maintain there artistic integrity. That has nothing to do with "failing". They have been featured in two separate articles in The Charleston Gazette, which is southern and western West Virginia's largest circulated newspaper. They have a very large fan base. They were linked to from articles involving Horrorcore and R Budd Dwyer and didn't have an article to point the references to.

<blockquote>
<p>Go set on your pedestal and feel important because you waist your life deciding what is and isn't important for people to know. No one gives a shit about what college you went to or what kind of degree you have. You aren't better at deciding what is and isn't important for wikipedia visitors. the reasoning behind this is... If something has a "cult" following, it s quite possible that none of the fans know about wikipedia, hence a member of the group would be the only person viable for the job of creating the article. Although yes this does interfere with the neutrality, if no one else is available to create the article then the band shouldn't be deleted for simply creating the article as long as the article is used as a "history of the band" rather than "hey buy this bands next cd!". The notability of the band in question might be under suspicion, but, the band does have a very large underground following, and has shared the stage with such notable acts as Tech N9ne, Project Deadman, ZugIzland, Wolfpac, and others. Also, the Charleston gazette (wv's highest circulated newspaper) has ran articles involving brain trauma, twice. if that doesn't qualify as reasoning to keep the article up, i could really give a shit, honestly, at least I'm not someone who sits around all day judging other peoples creativity.</p>

<dd>Upgrading my vote to <b>Strong delete</b> after the angry rants above. First, they used profanity. Second, the writer at first misunderstands the issue, then does but basically without intending to makes the case for deletion. If the band has a small enough fan base that none of them are likely to have heard about Wikipedia, then it's a safe bet they're not notable. Oh, OK, they aren't notable by our (very objective) standards, but they have "a very large underground following". <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> says nothing about the size of a band's fan base justifying inclusion ... after all, Brain Trauma <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Frantix_59e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Frantix">isn't the first band</a> to make that claim (Nor does saying "they've shared the stage with notable bands" cut it, either). And the <i>Gazette</i> coverage, as other users reported, doesn't rise above the trivial level.
<p>No, that doesn't qualify as reasoning to keep the article up. As linked above, we have our own very clear standards on that.</p>
<p>I'm genuinely sorry if this is how you discovered we have standards here (and, BTW, comparing the standards for bands with the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">standards for neologisms</a>, most of which belong on Wiktionary if they're truly notable, is <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples_and_oranges.html" title="Apples and oranges">apples and oranges</a> in the metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>But really, I get very annoyed when someone creates an article about a band or something else that talks about how "underground" and "outside" whatever the subject is, then complains when the article gets nominated for deletion on the grounds that people won't know about whatever it is without a Wikipedia article. You can't have it both ways. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not Google</a>, it is <i>not</i> the be-all and end-all of universal knowledge however much it may seem to be to younger readers. If they want their favorite band to be the subject of a Wikipedia article, I would suggest to the Trauma Victimz that they focus their energies on getting more attention on the band (but uh-oh ... that would make them <i>commercial</i> and thus less cool). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, so slang terms are allowed to be on wikipedia, but an article about Brain Trauma is not. These guys are awsome and deserve a break, just because some person wants to discriminate against Brain Trauma for their beliefs and wishes does not mean that the article or anything pertaining to Brain Trauma should not be on wikipedia. Brian Trauma is not slang, they are a group of people who produce good music and an article should be allowed on this site, they have the Freedom of Speech just like the rest of us.

<li><b>Delete</b> When it comes to music and books, my history proves I lean towards inclusionist-views, however we DO have a guideline, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, that all bands and artists articles need to meet. They may be a great band and if they had some MP3s of their music I'd be more than happy to listen to them, but for wikipedia...they don't 'make the cut'. That is <b>NOT</b> saying anything about their music, fans, band members, or act nor does that somehow make them less of a group. It simple means that certain guildlines were set by the wikipedia editors as to what the 'cut off' line was for bands. Just like Billboard's top 100 qualifications to get on their list, wikipedia has qualifications that need to be meet to have an article. On a side note: Freedom of Speech does not apply to Wikipedia or the Internet. Most servers on the 'net are privately owned and that means the owners can censor anything you post on their server. I'd be all for this article...IF they could be proven to meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and have at least three (multiple) Independent, Reliable, Reputable, Non-trivial, Third-Party sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> Whatever, I don't give a shit anymore. I would like to point out though, that my "rants" above weren't in the least bit angry. "Profanity" is nothing more than a word used for something, like the word DOG means a four legged animal that barks, FUCK is the word used to describe the physical act of love. This isn't profanity. In the above "rant" my usage of the word "SHIT" was not used literally, as in it was not used to describe excrement, therefore it is NOT profanity. You would think someone with a masters degree in English would notice something like that. But, I'm not the one in here trying to act like he's smarter than anyone else, I know my IQ, I know my knowledge, I don't have to get on a computer and convince people Ive never met of my superior intellect by making smart ass quips about something a band member posted as an article on wikipedia. But, you have won, for the time being. Some day soon, we will have the three articles, and the notability, and all that super important stuff.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> As a member of the US military, and yes a Brain Trauma fan, I would like to say that your want to delete this article from this site is deplorable. You call yourself a "free" encyclopedia, yet you are by no means an encyclopedia. A true one would cover all subjects, great and small. Where would some of the greatest musician be today had it not been for humble beginnings. This group may not be as large as some, but they are still just as notable. All groups must first crawl before they run. Look at Metallica... once upon a time they too felt it unneeded to play to a large fan base, but as they grew as a group so to did their fans grow in numbers. Many have started with just a handful of faithful listeners, only to later become musical entities. Take for example The Greatful Dead. They began as a garage band of hippies who simple wanted to smoke pot and play music. Now today they are a universally recognized supergroup of their time. So to conclude I feel that to leave out this group would be to say that to succeed you have to start at the top.

<li><b>Comment</b> (edit conflict) There are rule for wikipedia. This band does not pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, which outlines if a band or artist's article should be kept or removed. As a person in the military I know you understand what it means to have rules to be followed. If you need a certain security clearance to get into a certain area of a military base, then you don't get to go there if you do not have the clearance. Wikipedia is the same. We have a 'standard' and this band does not meet it...yet. Doesn't mean they will not in the future. About the Metallica and Grateful Dead reference...<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipeida is not a crystal ball</a> and will not keep an article based on 'maybe they will be famous in the future'. Even the most notable Rock singer ever, Elvis Presley, started off singing at state fairs and was not notable until his record deal. Had we had wikipedia back then and someone made an article on him before he would meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, the article would be deleted. Same with metallica and the Greatful Dead. Notability must be verifiable NOW, not based on some possible future. As for success, I guess that is up to how you define it. Notability? Well if they do not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> then I guess they do not meet wikipedia's standards for notability. Would you be upset with the Billboard Hot 100 if they didn't place the band in their system? No? Why? Because they do not meet Billboard's standards...yet. Again, this is not an attack on the band, the fans, nor their music. This is a discussion on if the band meets Wikipedias standards... They don't... yet. When they do, feel free to provide sources for this, cite the hell out of it, and recreate the article. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, so the Charleston Gazette does not go above your "trivial references" as one of you put it. I understand that you have guidelines; the guidelines it seems are suited for artists that are well known and well published. At least that is how I understand the guidelines; you make it near impossible for new artists to get "public” whether they are underground or not Freedom of speech does not apply here, that seems asinine to me but it is your site and you can do what ever you want. However, Milf, FOAD, and other slang that people just have to know are so very important. As for the comment “Wikipedia is not Google, it is not the be-all and end-all of universal knowledge however much it may seem to be to younger readers.” You are right Wikipedia is not the “be-all, end-all,” but the assumption that younger readers believe that your site is the “be-all and end-all” of Universal knowledge is a bit much. What does the age of the readers or fans have to do with anything? In addition, the comment “I would suggest to the Trauma Victimz that they focus their energies on getting more attention on the band (but uh-oh ... that would make them commercial and thus less cool).” How do you know that they have not been, and it is not a matter of being cool, it is a matter of getting out there. You have made the assumption that Brain Trauma’s fans are a bunch of “kids” therefore you people must be old geezers, this follows with the assumptions that you have made. Some of you may not have been as critical as the others but your standards seem to high for new artists to get anywhere, you have to start somewhere. Webster’s definition of Underground: produced or published outside the establishment especially by the avant-garde. 70.105.149.49 16:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)Michelle</p>

<dd><i>What does the age of the readers or fans have to do with anything?</i>
<p>Just that most deletion debates over bands that follow the same pattern as this (and there have been many) often seem to involve younger editors who have a very different understanding of what Wikipedia should be than the community that's been here and shaped it over the past several years.</p>
<p>I'm glad you posted this because I'm going to pull some things out that I want to direct your attention to further your understanding of why this article will almost certainly be deleted.</p>
<p><i>...you make it near impossible for new artists to get "public” whether they are underground or not...</i></p>
<p><i>...it is not a matter of being cool, it is a matter of getting out there...</i></p>
<p><i>...your standards seem to high for new artists to get anywhere, you have to start somewhere...</i></p>
<p>Would you not agree, then, that rereading your statements above that you believe the purpose of this Wikipedia article about Brain Trauma is to <b>promote the band</b>? Or if you don't, that then a reasonable person could make that assumption? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a promotional vehicle for anyone</a>. Not Brain Trauma, not the many penny-stock companies whose pr departments put up press releases here and think we won't notice, not the kids who want the world to know <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">how cool they are</a> or what dorks some other kid is. We delete all those articles too.</p>
<p>The obvious assumption from your comments above is that, if there is no Wikipedia article about the band, no one will know about them. Again, that's not Wikipedia's purpose. That might be MySpace's purpose; I can't speak for them. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia on which you can (hopefully) learn basic information about a lot of things. But we merely reflect the world, we write articles about what the world has taken note of. We reflect rather than report.</p>
<p>I checked out our articles on MILF and FOAD since you brought them up. Guess what? <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MILF" class="extiw" title="wikt:MILF">MILF</a> is on Wiktionary, not Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../f/o/a/FOAD_b5e2.html" title="FOAD">FOAD</a> is in a glossary of Internet slang terms.

<li>The same rules would apply if it were the <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston_Daily_Mail_0cb9.html" title="Charleston Daily Mail">Charleston Daily Mail</a></i>, the <i><a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington_Herald-Dispatch_7dd8.html" title="Huntington Herald-Dispatch">Huntington Herald-Dispatch</a></i>, the <i>Lexington Courier-Journal</i>, or the <i><a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo_Blade_cd5a.html" title="Toledo Blade">Toledo Blade</a></i>. First, if the interview is reported in only one local newspaper (as opposed to the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, which are national in reach), it still wouldn't contribute much in terms of meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> any more than all those <i>Herald-Dispatch</i> articles on the band Oney (a Huntington band that had only local popularity, it seemed) a decade-plus ago. Second of all, the article is not sourced, namely that it doesn't have a single specific citation to a link or literature from a third person that supports the contention (granted, the <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston_Gazette_7cef.html" title="Charleston Gazette">Charleston Gazette</a></i> is mentioned, but in what issue - and what's the name of the article - does it have an online link? If not, perhaps it can be found offline, but only if the issue date were given). So if we take away the unsourced assertions, we are left with.... nothing. That's a major reason for the "delete" recommendations. Well, that and no references from outside West Virginia could be found in my short search for Brain Trauma the band. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 19:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Michelle, the thing is the band must have been reported on by multiple, independent, reputable, reliable, non-trivial, third-party sources. The articles on the band have to be about the band and nothing else (no coverage on any other bands or just a mention of the band being part of a concert). Look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. We have a MUCH lower standard than a hardcover encyclopedia, but we still have standards or every garageband would be able to have an article. The other reason is having standards for bands and artists means they have to meet a certain level of notability and fame. This makes it easier for people who are not familiar with the band to add information to the article because any reasonable adult who is not a specialist in the music industry would be able to find information and post it about the band. You have a certain standard for the people you would date or let into your home. Does that mean your standards are bogus or wrong? --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> sorry if I sound blunt but what exactly do you think the "lost pet" search in Google Scholar proves? That "lost pets" are an academic subject?

<p>There's a good reason why you get no hits other than this article when you search on this phrase: One of the Arabic words is misspelled. The preposition إلى ila only has one l. The article's author must have confused it with a different Arabic word, the conjunction إلا illa. The phrase in standard transliteration from Arabic would be nazar ila al-murd. The word murd meaning 'beardless youth' is Persian, and the phrase is a mixture of two languages.</p>
<p>If the article isn't deleted, please spell the word right! The world has been slow to catch onto the concept of standard transliteration of Arabic, and it keeps causing information screwups like this.</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> The charge is spurious. Quite aside from the fact that a cursory search subtracting "wikipedia" from the search field <i>will</i> yield several useful links, there is a clear scholarly source in "Paidika" volume 3 issue 4 (1995) on p.13: "Love imagery in Persian Sufi poetry usually flows from this mystical, symbolic appreciation of love's spiritual power. In some works, however, the imagery refers also to specific practices, code named 'nazar ill'al-murd' or 'contemplation of the unbearded,' namely, the unbearded boy." There are others in the literature who discuss nazar (also rendered as "gazing") at length, though it is not always rendered in its complete form, the "al-murd" being either left out or translated into English. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 00:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is mostly original research. For instance, the reference from Iranica ignores this part: <i>"PEDOPHILIA In Persian love lyrics, however, one can hardly find the kind of homosexual relationship that is understood in the modern West; love is a one-sided and asymmetrical affair. As a rule, it is between an adult male and a boy or youth. Therefore, it should be characterized more properly as pedophilia, and its physical aspect as pederasty, rather than described under the more nebulous concept of homosexual love."</i> <a href="http://www.iranica.com/articles/v12f5/v12f4026c_contd.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/articles/v12f5/v12f4026c_contd.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Perhaps you should rename this article to Pedophilia in Persian poetry.

<li>I'm sorry, but but it's a bit difficult to keep "calm" when I see someone trying to whitewash obvious pedophilia. There is nothing in the article from Iranica which supports the Arabic phrase used in the article's title. Not one iota. A I said, the article from Iranica is discussing several different issues. This article focuses on the pedophilia part, yet the article title is something else. This article should be deleted. Haiduc, who I assume created this article, can then create a new article called Pedophilia in Persian love poetry or something like that. But don't whitewash this crap or try to hide the fact that it's pedophilia. metaspheres 10:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a problem here, but it has to do with the multiple uses to which the terms "pedophilia" and "pederasty" have been put. The current accepted definition of pedophilia in the US is that it refers to a longstanding sexual relationship with a child thirteen and under. At the same time, in Europe, it is often used to indicate a predilection for falling in love with children, even if no relationship comes out of it, regardless of the age of the child. <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Pederasty</a> (see article) however is academically defined as a man's love relationship with an adolescent boy whether or not sexuality actually occurs, though some still use it in the limited sense offered by several dictionaries, "anal sex with a child", a definition that is not in use in academia. As far as nazar is concerned, usually, only anti-Sufi polemicists suggested that it was a hidden path to sodomy, while scholars did and do treat it along the same lines as the philosophical pederasty described by Plato and others (with, at times disbelief in the West that the Moslems could "come upon it by themselves" without first having been inspired by the selfsame Greeks). So the idea of whitewash is itself spurious. And I will second Bsnoball's admonition that one should not rely on Google for academic research of this nature. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Virtually everything you just stated is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. You can say what you want, but even the Iranica article calls a spade a spade. Academic definition of "pederasty"? Give me a break. There is one definition of pederasty and if you claim otherwise, I want to see the evidence. Iranica is as scholarly a source as one can find and the article is pretty damning of what you're claiming above, and even goes so far as to disconnect this "pedophile love poetry" from homosexuality. Anyone can read the article for themselves and I guarantee that most will not support your bizarre assertions. metaspheres 16:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>the contemplation of God through focusing on the face (especially) of a beautiful boy, the shaahed. &#160;:::: But to claim that this equals pedestary or homosexuality is seriously flawed. Once place where the image of a beautiful young boy comes from is the Surah Ar-Rahman of the Qur'an (a text btw which condemns homosexuality as a great sin). Of course there is a lot of homo-sexual scholars who are biased and have power in the academia. But they can not even show one example of explicit homosexual act in sufism or Persian poetry. The contemplation of the beauty of the youth to achieve spiritual divinity did not have any sexual connotation and even this practice was condemned by Rumi. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 04:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why was it condemned if not for its dangerously erotic aspect. And we are told that the transliteration "-murd" is related to "amrad," as in "amrad kaneh," a Persian word relating to a Persian institution, if I am not mistaken. But it is not our prerogative to declare or deny the pederastic nature of these relations and traditions. This has already been done by scholars qualified to do so and we are here documenting their published research and conclusions. And to denigrate these individuals, male and female, of various nationalities and various orientations, as a gay cabal is to introduce bigotry and prejudice into the discussion. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 04:44, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>a Gay scholar or clost gay (like the British person mentioned in this article by the name of Burton) can not be taken as neutral source. Furthermore the word Murd (dead) is not related to amrad. Look up any Persian dictionary and there is no such a word as amrad. I speak Persian. And we have no word by the pronounciation of "kaneh" either. I am not sure where you are getting these ideas and words from. Do you speak Persian? If not then you are citing a source. Your source then does not speak Persian. And finally the article does not have a single quote or single book or single text from any sufic text alluding to any physical homosexual behavior. And yes sufism has had its enemies and one way to absolutely trash it was that sufis practiced aldultery, homosexuality, smoked hashish and all sorts of labels. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 05:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And let me add that Persian poetry of Hafez or Rumi can be intrepreted thousands of ways. Communitss in Iran think of Hafez as a communist. Liberals as a liberal and winde-drinker. Conservative religious figures as a cleric reading the Quran. Zoroastrian and Zoroastrian wannabe's as anti-Islamic hidden Zoroastrianism. And finally of course, a Gay scholar would interpret his verses as gay. But the fact is that there is not a single verse of Persian poetry from any of the famous Persian poets that have any homosexual or pedopholia verses. The issue is simple. The emotional relationship between two males, specially one being a spiritual mentor to the other is manifolds greater than the emotional love felt between a husband and wife. As per the youth image, it comes from the Qur'an and youthfull beauty was something that reflected the divine beauty in some sufi circles. The Qur'an states: <i>And round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness): If thou seest them, thou wouldst think them scattered Pearls. And when thou lookest, it is there thou wilt see a Bliss and a Realm Magnificent."<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/076.qmt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/076.qmt.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Note the spiritual image of the Qur'an was taken by some sufi circles. There is also another symbolic quranic image about "houris" (a feminine creature of extreme beauty) which actually has deeper symbolic meaning according to sufi interpretations of the Qura'n.</i></dd>
<dd>Bottom line is that there is not one verse in any of the famous Persian poets that alludes to any sexual act and if someone wants to prove the contrary then they need to bring the actual Persian verses since so far I noticed words that do not exist in Persian. All the google searches about this subject have only brought other wikipedia articles. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 05:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not fortunate enough to speak Persian, though I would love to. However, others who do have written on this: "Some of the famous love relationships celebrated by classical poets were between kings and male slaves. The beloved could also be the slave of another more powerful person. Many erotic Persian love poems, in which the lover describes the secret and sporadic nocturnal visits of the beloved, refer to such situations. Outside the royal court, homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses and coffee houses. In the early Safavid era (1501-1723), male houses of prostitution (amard khaneh) were legally recognized and paid taxes. Bathhouses and coffee houses were also common locations for illicit [homosexual] sex...."<a href="http://www.globalgayz.com/iran-news05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalgayz.com/iran-news05.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> And once again, I will not accept your disqualification of "gay scholars" because in that case I will disqualify "straight scholars" and then where would we be?! <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 05:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>in the lead the phrase "Nazar ill'al-murd" is clearly stated as being <i>arabic</i>, the phrase "Shahed-bazi" is in persian. i have no idead wether either of these is true, but all the above about persian 'amrad' etc is irrelevant to the article as it stands. otherwise can we please leave out the opinions about homosexuality &amp; debate sources? haiduc is correct in pointing out that you can't just ignore scholarship based on claims about the author. if you wish to establish bias in a particular author you will have to provide justifications based on that authors writing. tho arguably the para about burton shld go, absurdly generalised ('easterners'), &amp; if he spells out that interpretation, then the quote shld to.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 09:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

From what I can read, the homosexual scholars in question are not even talking about pederasty or anything about men having sex with children! It's bad enough that the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a> article is far, far from NPOV and makes it seem like a harmless practice!

<dd>I am sorry but reference from Global Gay! is not a valid reference. Or else I would have to write an article for the global heterosexual. Now don't get me wrong, of course homosexual behavior has existed in every society. But we are here talking about sufism and sufi poetry. Sufi poets like Rumi and Shams very harshly criticize homosexual behavior and sodomy and drugs. Yet anti-sufis (wahabites) in order to disown sufism have made all sorts of remarks about it. Some of the worst literature has been written about Ismai'li sects from Sunnis. They claim ismaili's freely have sex in massive orgies and etc. And btw I speak enough Arabic to know that Al-Murd is not word in Arabic. The word Al-Murid though means student and perhaps this is a story about sufi master and his student. Nothing homosexual and etc. about it. The fact is there is not a single evience of one verse in sufic Persian poetry referring to any homosexual and pederasty behavior. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 00:51, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been a degradation of Wikipedia principles in the foregoing discussion that must be resolved before we can go any further.</p>
<ol>
<li>The persistent attempts to demean sources attached to queers studies or the gay community must cease. They are no more appropriate than attempts to disqualify sources on the basis of the skin color of the writer.</li>
<li>The repeated efforts to confuse age-structured homosexuality with a mental dysfunction having criminal overtones is nothing but a slur and ignores all the preceding academic study (history, anthropolgy, philosophy, sexology, etc.) which has identified pederastic practices as a traditional form of same-sex desire (which like any desire can have normative or transgressive aspects).</li>
<li>The consistent sexualization of same-sex desire in Sufi practice in order to "prove" its irrelevance to Sufism is a blatant straw man argument which ignores previous scholarship which clearly demonstrates the existence of a tradition of chaste (or "philosophical" or "pedagogical", as it has been dubbed) pederasty which consists of a relationship between a man and a boy premised on the unconsummated desire of the man.</li>
<li>The editors arguing against the substance of this article are basing their comments on their personal knowledge base, be it linguistic or cultural or historic. That is not a recognized foundation for discussion in this project. Please cite here the arguments of scholars in the field who support your contention, as I have, and let's see if we can integrate their points of view into the article. <i>That</i> is how the Wikipedia game is played, not through emotional outbursts or personal attacks.

<dd>Firstly quoting a Gay scholar on homosexuality in Persian literature is like quoting David Duke on Hitler. There is an agenda behind it. It is non-neutral POV. Secondly the gay scholar you quote does not know Persian well enough obviously or else he would know how to pronounce Persian terms. Thirdly I can quote Dr. Franklin Lewis who has written the most important book on Rumi and clearly shows that Rumi (who is the ultimate Sufi) condemns homosexuality as does Shams condemn sodomy and hashish (in the Maqalaat). The word pedastry should not be used as in www.dictionary.com (which is more reliable than wikipedia) this term refers to actual sexual abuse on a child. Where the sufi practice was to actually divinity in the youthfullness and I quoted the Qur'an here. And finally Persian literature and sufi literature should be explained by Sufis. Not by Wahabists, Gays, and other people from other religions who might have a bent against sufism. There is absolutely nothing sexual about the emotional love felt between two man in Persian literature. It has to do with a master and disciple relationship where the disciple believes that the Master's command is God's command. Also Professor Lewis Franklin <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/lewis/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/lewis/index.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> has written the most comprehensive book on Rumi and his words are much more reliable than someone writing in a Gay magazine (which is non-scholarly to begin with).

I vote keep because the article content seems more or less accurate, it seems well cited, and it seems NPOV. Also, perhaps an article that honestly discusses pederasty in Muslim culture may eventually expose the truth about pederasty in roman Catholic culture. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 19:35, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well you said Murd is related to amrad and etc.. Murd means beardless in Arabic. Thus the whole concept is that of contemplating youth as a divine sign of God. There is no sexual basis on it and the stuff from a Gay british person of the 19th century is totally invalid. The whole concept of nightgale, flower, candle and moth in Persian poetry have absolutely nothing to do with sexuality and homosexuality. Anne Marrie Schimmel is the major scholar on Persian literature and she has written on this symbolism and there is absolutely none of the intrepretation that the homosexual Burton has madeup. Any terms that are related to sexuality and specially homosexuality and child abuse and pederasty must be removed from this article as they have no support in relation with sufism. They are all allegations from Burton who was a 19th century British homosexual whereas major scholars of Persian literature like Arberry, Schimmel<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annemarie_Schimmel" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annemarie_Schimmel" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> have described these terms. As per the practice of nazar illa-al-murd although there is no sexuality involved, rumi who was a sufi totally repudiated it. Also the picture from Jami's work did not show up directly from the website. SO please provide the correct link. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 07:38, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again I asked for a single source that shows pedestary in Persian Sufic poetry. Now I will bring some reliable sources. Lewis Franklin (Rumi Past, Present and East and West, pg 320): <i>Shams al-Din counseled the young Sultan Valad (Rumi's son) to avoid Hashish and sodomy, and condemned Owhad al-Din Kermani for his practice of Shahed-Bazi in this case his attenton to beautiful boys, in the Hellenstic tradition of the ephebe. Shams and Rumi both condemened the excesses of Sufi behavior, as did other Sufis, and were opposed to libertinism. Rumi held a very unfavorable opinion of Owhad al-Din, believing that Owhad's relationship with the boys in his circle was not chase:</i> Shaykh Owhad al-Din left a bad legacy in the world.<i>.</i></dd>
<dd>Now I have quoted the most important Sufi in history yet some people want to attach this practice to sufism. Note also pedestary is different than shahedbaazi as I have explained already. Sorry guys you can not quote some British 19th century Gay scholar who ridicolously sees the Moth and Candle and Nightgale and Flower in Persian poetry as sexual. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 16:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You want evidence of pederasty among the Sufi? Why do you not read the <i><b>uncensored</b></i> and <i><b>unwesternized</b></i> history of Sufism? Instead of acknowledging the complex debates engaged in by the mystics and their critics, you delete from articles _and from your own user page_ whatever passages make you feel uncomfortable about your ancestors. Excuse me, but that kind of behavior does not belong here. What did the critics say about the Sufis? Here:</p>
<ol>
<li>"But they are in depravity the most elevated of men, as you see without doubt<br />
They have taken beardless boys as their aim unabashedly, thus coveting perdition."<br />
And called them their beginnings -- of dishonor, evil and disgrace. ---Hasan al-Badri al-Hijazi.</li>
<li>"The Sufis of the age and time, the Sufis of the wine-press and the eating-tray.<br />
They have outdone the people of Lot by adding the beating of drums to fornication." ---Ahmad al-Murshidi</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not interested in your focusing on the Persians, this article discusses the Sufis and the proper references have been given. Be forewarned that your repeated removal of Burton is a disruption of Wikipedia and if it does not cease it will be dealt with accordingly. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 17:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks like my Rumi evidence did some damage to your attacks and distortion about sufism. As per the two quotes you brought, they are not by Sufis. Burton who lived in the last century and was a homosexual with no credibility in Persian literature. But Professor Franklin is a expert in Persian literature at the University of Chicago <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/lewis/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/lewis/index.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and has written the most comprehensive book about Rumi in any language. Professor Franklin says: <i>We know that (some) Sufis sometimes used the dervish cloak to hide antinomian behavior and libertine excess, for authors sympathetic to Sufism, such as Sa'adi, Owhadi of Margheh and Ibn Jowzi all condemn it. Shams counsels the young Sultan Valad to avoid Hashish and sodomy, two great vices.</i>. Thus the practice of some antimonian sufis does not represent sufism in general and if there was one person that represents sufism it is Rumi and Shams. Also I have asked three times to show the exact link where the Jami picture in this article is taken from and in which one of the 7 chapters of the haft awrang is the story mentioned. Note Jami has three chapters on Salaman and Absal, Lili o Majnoon and Yusuf and Zuleikha in the 7 chapters of the Haft (7) Awrang. The other 4 chapters deal with matters that are not about love. And one poem specially chastizes any sort of lust. Note the two quotes you brought are also from not Sufis obviously and the teaming up of Wahabites with Gays is amusing. The fact is real sufism as exemplified by Rumi does not condone even shahedbazi (which is different than pedestary) just like real Christianity condemns homosexuality and pedestary. Now if some priests act in that manner it does not mean that the official church condones it. So your generalization to sufism when the most notable sufi of all ages, Jalal al-dIn Rumi and his mentor Shams condemn Awhad ad-din Kermani is actually academic dishonesty. And finally the moth and candle, and the nightingale and flower are just Persian symbols of love and have nothing to do with any sort of sexual relationship. You are imposinv western values on Sufi literature. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 18:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Looks like my Rumi evidence did some damage..." Rubbish. But your contribution of a quote is a step in the right direction. Please be so kind as to include it in the article. I have no intention whatsoever of deleting it, it does not contradict my agenda. No information on this topic, pro or con, contradicts my agenda. The only thing that contradicts my agenda is editors on a crusade who are out to impose their point of view by removing properly sourced material that makes them uncomfortable, like your persistent vandalism of the Burton quote. And by the way, I noticed that you inserted your Rumi reference at <b>the very top</b> of the article. As my parents used to say to me when I was a kid and barged ahead, "The donkey goes first." Please do not disrupt the article to make a point. That reference too is welcome, but only if properly placed.

<dd>Every fields has its experts. In terms of Persian Sufi poetry it is Lewis Franklin and Anne Marrie Schimmel as they have published a lot in this arena. Not some british gay person from the 19th century or political writers. Also let me add Ehsan Yarshater is not a scholar of Persrian poetry and his training is linguistics. Thus you either quote scholars of Persian poetry or else it seems it is just intrepretations specially from sites like gay world and etc. As per Rumi, he is the most well known Sufi in the east and West. My sources like Franklin and Ann Marie Schimmel are from scholars of Persian poetry. Thus Rumi and Shams warning admonition of sodomy and hashish are very relavent to this article and since Rumi is the most well known sufi poet in the world, his statement should be given prominence. As per Jami his Haft Awrang is here: <a href="http://rira.ir/rira/php/?page=view&amp;mod=classicpoems&amp;obj=poet&amp;id=16" class="external autonumber" title="http://rira.ir/rira/php/?page=view&amp;mod=classicpoems&amp;obj=poet&amp;id=16" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Show me the verses. The manuscript could be about another poet whose work was included in that art work as well. Also there is absolutely no hint of any sex feelings even in the picture or pederasty. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 20:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He said, "The (true) sufi [Sûfî] is the one who becomes a seeker of purity [Safwat]; not from (wearing) garments of wool [Sûf] and sewing (patches) and sodomy. With these vile people, sufism [Sûfiyî] has become stitching and sodomy [al-liwâTa] and that is all" (V:363-64). This contrast between purity and sodomy would appear to echo one of the passages in the Qur'an which mentions the Divine punishment of the people to whom the Prophet Lot was sent. When he confronted them ("Would you commit this abomination with you eyes open? Must you approach men with lust instead of women?"), they responded with sarcasm by urging that Lot and his followers be expelled, "For they are a people who would stay pure" (Qur'an 27:54-58).</i> Note the most prominent sufi in the world was against deviant practices. Thus the article is doing a great injustice against sufism by trying to connect a practice (shahed bazi) (which in itself was not sexual) to sufism. My suggestion for some people is to stop misrepresnting sufism. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 20:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are discussing main stream sufism which clearly condemns homosexuality. And when we discuss sufi literature we refer to authorities like franklin and not homosexual sites. And when were looking at the most exemplary and notable sufi in the world, we are talking about Rumi. I have not seen you guys quote one scholar in Persian literature here. It is just couple of Gay people and some non-scholars who have an axe to grind against sufism. (like wahabites or others). Whereas the Rumi quotes from Rumi himself are crystal clear. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 00:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I just perused through the article and it simply resembles some sort of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a> sewn together from wildest pieces of information out there. A few Google hits? Is this a joke? Considering the gravity of the subject matter? I am not a historian, but I can see that some of the sources are being stretched to the breaking point to prove I don't know what. Since when is homosexuality=pedophilia? The notions in the article are so confused that it might as well be arguing that Pyramids were built by Martians. Half the article is about quotes on how Islam condemned pedophilia. Condamnation of an act doesn't prove its existence nor its proportions. If the question was if there has been homosexuality or pedophilia in Islamic countries over the ages, then the answer is obviously yes. Just like every part of the world. And it has also been condemned by every religion on those places <i>as well</i>. I just cannot see how exactly this connects with a particular spiritual school of thought. The only quote I can find, and that based on an <i>interpretation</i> of the text, is a poem. And reading it, I honestly cannot understand how it can be interpreted anywhere near to referring to pedophilia except having read it as such, knowing it beforehand. I mean, is this it? One half-interpreted poem? This proves that there were major currents of pedophilia in Sufism? I can prove that Atlantis really existed with more ease! The gravity of the subject matter implies that there will be serious and extensive sources to back up the obscure claims of the article. I mean, what exactly is it about anyways? Homosexuality? Pedophilia? Eroticism? Yoga? Homosexuality is Islamic countries? Sufism? Isn't anyone aware that these are not connected with each other? We gotta turn off the electricity of this Frankestein, otherwise it would be zooming in Wikipedia as some kind of zombie knocking everything around it! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 08:15, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I mean, this is not even a pro-gay or anti-gay issue. I am atheist, so it is not like it is going to derange me by its nature. But I have also read Sufist literature, and I have a lot of respect for it. I suppose that anything can be true in this world, however sewing up unrelated information to create some sort of thesis is not right, and also breaks WP:OR. It is not even clear how most of those sources cited even refer to currents of pedophilia in Sufism. There are mentions of Yoga, Eroticism, Homosexuality in the Islamic world etc. How are these even related between each other, let alone with Sufism?<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 08:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable cocktail, entirely unsourced. Even if a reference were found for the recipe, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a recipe book. The article indicates that the term is used in <i>parts</i> of Southern Ontario, and claims that the drink requires a particular brand of beer. This suggests very limited regional interest and probable severe <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 07:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike>KEEP</strike> - for now at least. I agree that this article is in need of improvement. However, whomever prodded this page for deletion apparently did not read the notice on the talk page that states the entire series of cocktail-related articles are undergoing evaluation, improvement, and/or merging of useful information into other articles. Prematurely deleting pages while the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">WikiProject Cocktails</a> is still working on them severely hinders our progress. If deleted, it requires us to request the deleted information back from an administrator so that we can cull the useful bits out of the original article. Once the project is finished with this cleanup, we will be nominating many articles for deletion. If we cannot find more information to improve this article, it probably will be one that will be deleted at that time. Thanks. --Willscrlt 11:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A quick search of Ogre Juice does turn up a few hits in places outside of Ontario.

<li><b>Comment</b> Technorati is not an internet search engine, it is a blog search engine. As such, it's results would obviously be biased towards blogs, and anything that is a blog would rank higher on Technorati than on an internet search engine, regardless of the notability of the subject. If you'd like to use another search engine as an additional test of notability, feel free to pick one that treats all websites equally, rather than assigning a higher rank to the class of website that you would like to have a higher rank. Might I suggest you use one from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_internet_search_engines.html#General_search_engines" title="List of internet search engines">here</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b> Technorati is not an internet search engine? To quote from the first sentence about <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technorati.html" title="Technorati">Technorati</a> on Wikipedia "<b>Technorati is an Internet search engine</b> for searching blogs, competing with Google, Yahoo, PubSub and IceRocket." If you would like to use search engines that compare sites like Amazon.com vs people like Mr. Zawodny, please keep using that strawman technique. If you would like to try to see where people like Mr. Zawodny stand in his field, Technorati is a far better judge, in my opinion - and by its Alexa rating, I'm not alone in using it as a helpful tool. Some people today might want to use ghits to use as strawmen against those who are well-known in the blogosphere, some in the past threw alleged witches into water to see if they'd float. It appears that you wish to avoid any tool that would show this subject notable, as opposed to seriously trying to discover how notable he is. That's too bad because it makes you appear biased and not not neutral. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 22:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

To quote from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_search_engines.html#Blog_search_engines" title="List of search engines">The Wikipedia list of BLOG search engines</a>, "Technorati". We are trying to determine how notable Zawodny is, <b>period</b>. Not in his field, not among bloggers, but among everything. Realtive notability is irrelevant. One could use your logic to determine that my dog, Skip, deserves a wikipedia entry, because he is notable among the rest of my pets. But I digress - It appears that you wish to avoid any tool that would show this subject non-notable, even if that tool is Wikipedia policy, as opposed to seriously trying to evaluate his notability.</li>

<dd>In fact, this whole argument is irrelevant. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that, in order to meet the notability requirements, the subject has to be "the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works". To elaborate upon that, "Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing" are explicitly excluded. Jeremy Zawodny does not meet those notability requirements. Therefore, Jeremy Zawodny is non-notable. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUSER-cacophony_7d2b.html" title="User:USER-cacophony"><b>cacophony</b></a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUSER-cacophony_1e5f.html" title="User talk:USER-cacophony">◄</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_USER-cacophony_1fac.html" title="Special:Contributions/USER-cacophony">►</a> 01:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid you continue to misread <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Nowhere on that page does it say that if someone fails at one of the bulletpoints then they are nn. Indeed it says that even if a person doesn't satisfy any of the items, they are still not necessarily eligible for a Speedy Deletion. The item that you quote is simply the first of a long line of things that *could* determine notablilty. Meaning even if Mr. Zawodny had several non-trivial published works where he was the subject, it still doesn't guarantee notability. "People who satisfy at least one of the items below *may* merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." With thousands of links to Mr. Zawodny as well as Top 500 Technorati ranking, and several non-trival newspaper articles where he was a subject, it would appear that he has what WP:BIO is looking for which is "a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest." But if you want to continue the charade that not perfectly meeting one item disqualifies you, then go right ahead. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 06:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, you're right, he fails at all the other bullet points as well. You are also correct in noting that people who meet the requirements *may* merit their wikipedia article, and they *may* not. You are also correct in that he does not merit speedy deletion, which is why we are going about non-speedy deletion in this AfD. So, on to the AfD;

<li>It's clear you just want to be argumentative here. The same line that you claim deems ghits an accepted means of determining a person's notability is part of the Alternative tests section that is prefaced thusly "Other tests for inclusion that have been proposed (but haven't necessarily received consensus support) include:" Therefore your claim that "Number of google hits is an accepted means of determining that person's notability" is false. Just like many of your other opinions. Just like your opinion on Technorati, which I have suggested fits in with the Alternative test section as an "other well-known Internet search engine". Therefore if ghits counts, so does the Technorati ranking. Whatever, when you decide to read the entire article that you reference and throw in some common sense, and think about the spirit of WP:BIO as well as what it says (and doesn't say), you will probably have better luck with your opinions seeming less biased. In closing, and I'm not the first to say this, WP:BIO needs to include standards for determining bloggers. And I would suggest that until a consensus is reached regarding what makes a notable blogger, AfD's about bloggers should be tabled. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 23:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello, if I may reiterate, blogging search engines such as Technorati do not search the internet, they search blogs, and thus do not fit into the "other well-known Internet search engine" with Google, Yahoo, and Alexa. I really don't see why bloggers should be treated any differently than anybody else, that they should have their own special notability requirements. Other, more notable people who are bloggers seem to meet the notability requirements just fine. What we have to remember, though, is the fine line between blogger and blog, between website and website operator. Even if his blog were notable, then it would be notable in it's own article. Managing a notable or successful website does not automatically make one notable in their own regard. That would be notability by association. Thus, we cannot judge this <b>person's</b> notability by the notability of his <b>website</b>. That's why we have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> separate. If you continue to insist that his blog is notable then, should it meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, feel free to create an article on his blog. Just remember though, that none of the criteria for determining the notability of a person in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> includes them being the manager of a notable website. Having said that, I will again reiterate that Jeremy does not meet <b>any</b> of the notability requirements suggested in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hello - I'm the author of this article, wrote it on behalf of Media Republic and I'd love to not see the article deleted! I'm not an expert enough user of Wikipedia yet, and I don't really understand the deletion policy. I'll do some reading, but could participants of this discussion please offer some pointers on what might be adjusted in the article in order to keep it around? For example, GarrieIrons, what needs to be done about the graphics that you mention? Do they need to be made "low-res"? Could you let me know? And GRBerry, I can certainly shorten the Gameplay and Chat section. I appreciate everyone's help very much and will be checking in again! Ginettissima1054 12:54, 17 December 2006 (GMT+1)</li>

<p>While I do not deny the presence of Malays with European descent, the title of this is a neologism. It only garners two hits on Google not including the Wikipedia link.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In addition, the article is poorly sourced. Contributions from the anonymous editors of this article also leads me to believe that it was written by someone from Malaysia who, for some reason or another, has a deep preoccupation to human races (what <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> would have termed as "racial sciences"). Take note that one of this article's sections is titled "Can the Euromalays be accepted as part of the Malay community?" which appears to be unencyclopedic and, in my opinion, biased. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 08:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Upon explaining the differen between Eurasians and Euromalays, Eurasians refer to the broader aspect and involve all types of Eurasians (Anglo-Indian, European-Filipinos, Filipino mestizos etc.) - it's more like generalising all types of Eurasians. Like Indos and European, this article specialises information relating to those who are a mixture of both European and Malay races. Furthermore, this article does not only relate to those who have Malay and European parentage, but also including those who have more dominant European genes (e.g. a person who is 1/4 or 1/6 Malay) - an example of a person who is of such descent was <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Hertogh_0eb0.html" title="Maria Hertogh">Maria Hertogh</a>. This is what makes the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euromalays.html" title="Euromalays">Euromalays</a> article stands out from the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_%28mixed_ancestry%29.html" title="Eurasian (mixed ancestry)">Eurasian (mixed ancestry)</a> article.
<dl>
<dd>The article could be improved by making a separate section for Euromalays who are from Malaysia, Brunei, etc. However, Euromalays (as proven by genetic research) can't include Filipino Mestizos, since Filipinos aren't Malays in the first place. Same goes with the Indonesians. However, if you still want to include Filipino Mestizos as well as Indos, one suggestion would be placing a tagline that "Euromalays can refer to people who are of mixed European and Malay Archipelago (not necessarily ethnically Malay, but <i>living</i> in the Malay archipelago) descent". -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewprc_06ba.html" title="User:Matthewprc">User:Matthewprc</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: please explain how this differs from <a href="../../../../ms/s/e/r/Serani.html" class="extiw" title="ms:Serani">ms:Serani</a>, which is a far more widely-known term. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 14:59, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, as it has been stated in <a href="../../../../ms/s/e/r/Serani.html" class="extiw" title="ms:Serani">ms:Serani</a>, refers to those of partly European and Asian descent (it doesn't specify 'Malay' as the one and only term). That's why I've decided to use the term "Euromalays" (abbreviation for "European Malays") to distinguish this group of people from other Eurasians (i.e. "Serani" refer to Eurasians of whatever racial backgrounds - partly Chinese, Indians etc.). Note that the Malays are an ethnic group, not nationals of Malaysia (Malaysians are nationals of Malaysia). Therefore, to use the term "Serani" just specifically for someone who has Malay and European admixture would then be an incorrect usage. Do you understand what I mean? --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantastic4boy_3dc2.html" title="User:Fantastic4boy">Fantastic4boy</a> 17:51, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Furthermore, that <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Fernandes_3c1d.html" title="Tony Fernandes">Tony Fernandes</a> man looks partly Indian and partly Portuguese, he doesn't look Malay at all. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantastic4boy_3dc2.html" title="User:Fantastic4boy">Fantastic4boy</a> 18:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am also Malaysian and well aware of the difference between Malays and Malaysians. What you seem not to be aware of is that Wikipedia has a policy against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which, among other things, advises that we should not be inventing new words. You state <i>That's why I've decided to use the term "Euromalays"</i> --- however this is not your decision to make. The name of the article should be based on what these people are referred to in newspaper articles, scholarly works, etc.</dd>
<dd>In any case, creating an article for every possible type of mix seems like the wrong way to go about subdividing the topic of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_%28mixed_ancestry%29.html" title="Eurasian (mixed ancestry)">Eurasians</a>. Those of the same descent, but in different countries may have very little in common with each other anyway. I'd suggest Eurasians <i>by country</i> instead. So I vote to <b>Keep</b> the article, but only on the condition that it's renamed, refocused, and most importantly, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sourced</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 01:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you for your helpful advice. I find you to be a generous person. I now understand that Wikipedia does not allow us to invent new terms since that they have not been shown on newspaper, magazine etc. as solid evidence yet and that they consider doing such thing as talking nonsense and making arguements without proof - Wikilawyering. Do you then think the term "Eurasians with European and Malay lineage" or "European Malay descendants" be appropriate for Wikipedia? --211.24.155.43 09:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is a hot subject, and I understand that. I can relate to people who want to talk about and commiserate after the tragedy of this brave man's death. Nominating this article for deletion is going to make me a villain to some, but so be it. <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/07/MOOD.TMP" class="external text" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/07/MOOD.TMP" rel="nofollow">It has been noted</a> that this story garnered a great deal of attention from media spectators, particularly on the internet. I imagine with so much attention being paid, it was inevitable that this story should come to Wikipedia. Be that as it may, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BLOG" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a blog.</a> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a memorial.</a></p>
<p>There was no article for <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kim_20f8.html" title="James Kim">James Kim</a> prior to his being featured in the 24/7 news cycle. The <a href="../../../j/a/m/Talk%7EJames_Kim_71c7.html" title="Talk:James Kim">talk page</a> for his article mentions his notability through his journalism career. This can only be seen as a revisionist justification; no one had seen the subject as noteworthy until the news media placed so much focus on it.</p>
<p>Others have argued that his death may serve as a lesson to others; that some may learn from the events. I can see from the article and the talk page that there is even discussion of "mistakes" made. Personally, I find the subject extremely distressing. I actually got a little nauseous reading what I felt was morbid overanalysis of a horrifying series of events. Personal feelings aside however, if people are looking for lessons on <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survival_skills.html" title="Survival skills">Survival skills</a> or to read about the dangers of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothermia.html" title="Hypothermia">Hypothermia</a>, then let them go to those articles. I can honestly say that I don't think anyone will come here seeking knowledge on subjects of this sort.</p>
<p>I think it is best to leave current event stories to current event story outlets, regardless of the emotional component. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 08:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>hugely inappropriate for deletion.</b> This is a truly bizarre suggestion, given that anyone who has published anything with an ISBN number attached to is appropriate fodder for a wikipedia article, no matter how obscure and insignificant they are. Some people become known through life, and others through death. The article is quite thorough and factual, and these facts are thought-provoking and capable of stirring public debate about travel safety. Case studies of particular people are relevant to these debates. This is Wikipedia at its finest. If this is a candidate for deletion, then I am going to recommend the 5,000,000 nobodys who have been awareded publishing contracts and now have stubs that say "John Doe is the author of..." for deletion. If there is ever another family stuck in the woods through misfortune, and the news says "In an incident reminiscent of the demise of James Kim..." people should be able to come to Wikipedia to find out who this man was, how he came to be known to millions, and how he died. Aron Ralston has an article here because he got trapped in a canyon under a rock for days, cut off his own hand to free himself, and live to write a book about it. Kim, already in the media due to his career, walked 16 miles through the remote winter wilderness to save his stranded family and died. While we're at it, should we delete both of these articles using the very logic of Mael-Num? Or is it the book written by the survivor that makes all the difference? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.108.68.7_e498.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.108.68.7">86.108.68.7</a> (talk) 11:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: <b>Inappropriate reasons given for deletion.</b> Mael-Num, your reasons for deletion do not conform to Wikipedia guidelines. For an individual to be included in Wikipedia <b>that individual does NOT have to be noteworthy before the events for which he garnered media attention</b>, whether he is alive or dead. If there was no article about James Kim prior to his notoriety in the 24/7 news cycle it would be irrelevant and has no relation to Wikipedia guidelines; again <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state an individual must be noteworthy prior to the events for which that individual garnered media attention</b>; obviously if that was the case, innumerable articles regarding individuals like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Klaas_adaa.html" title="Polly Klaas">Polly Klaas</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mark_Karr_8053.html" title="John Mark Karr">John Mark Karr</a> would also be deleted. James Kim need not have been noteworthy for his journalism career. Furthermore, <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual's death necessarily has to provide "lessons" or useful information regarding survival skills, any other skills, or practical information about the physical ailments from which they died</b>; whether the events surrounding the individual's notoriety are practically useful to the reader or not and whether or not those events provide "lessons" is <b>absolutely irrelevant under Wikipedia guidelines</b>. Furthermore, you cite emotion and memorializing in this article, but no such emotion or memorializing is present in the article (perhaps you could cite specific instances of it?). The only memorializing I see is a link to CNET's memorial of James Kim; whether that link is valid to include <b>within</b> the article (rather than solely as an "external link") is another discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. One could argue that an article was warranted before his disappearance, but sufficient information about the man was not available to those who would write it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mael-Num, your rationale that James Kim was not notable before the events surrounding his death which garnered media attention <b>is NOT part of Wikipedia guidelines regarding inclusion OR deletion</b>. Neither is the fact that you wouldn't recognize him in the street. <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual must be noteworthy before the events which garnered media attention and focus on that individual, whether that individual is alive or dead.</b> <b>Wikipedia guidelines do NOT state that an individual must be personally recognizable to you before or after the events which garnered them media spotlight.</b> You have NOT used standards which conform to Wikipedia guidelines in order to justify your nomination for the deletion of this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, don't muddy the logic either...I didn't say that two individuals were comparable. I used Mr. Jordan as an example of a case where an article was kept solely for the situation surrounding his death; before death, James Kim was notable for other things (of course, James Jordan did beget Michael, but I'd generally say that biological notability is a little different). I'm sure that if it stays, the article will ultimately be about his life and career, not about his death. And again, for what it's worth, if I had bumped into James Kim before his death, I definitely would have recognized him. Notability doesn't mean that everyone everywhere will know the individual&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 21:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Question</b> Why is anyone even trying to use <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">WP:IMP</a> for a basis of arguement? It holds no more weight in this AFD than something I would write in my userspace and then quote. It was replaced with the Notability articles. It's obsolete and IMHO can be ignored. Can you base your comments on Current, recognized guidelines? To use <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">WP:IMP</a> is like grasping at straws since <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> replaces it (along with any other notability guidelines).

More importantly, may I ask why you are picking nits and lawyering rather than addressing the content and spirit of a guideline that is significant enough to the owners, operators, and admins of Wikipedia that they cite it themselves as things to consider when authoring an article?

<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b> With all due respect, I find this nomination for deletion to be self-evidently absurd in the extreme. The emotional components and memorializing that you cite are not included in the James Kim article, so I am unsure why you cite them as reasons for deletion. James Kim and the events surrounding his disappearance and death had focused media attention and headlines not only nationwide throughout the United States, but throughout the world as well. To suggest this article should be deleted means that articles about Eizabeth Smart or Nicole Brown Simpson should be deleted; neither of them remotely qualified as noteworthy people under Wikipedia guidelines until the media focused on the unique events they were involved in. For a person to be noteworthy <b>that individual does *NOT* have to be noteworthy prior to the circumstances in which the individual garnered media attention</b>, furthermore <b>Wikipedia contains *NO* guidelines regarding an article's deletion or relevance merely because its details make you "nauseous"</b> and finally <b>Wikipedia has *NO* guidelines requiring that an article pertaining to an individual must contain some usefulness regarding lessons to others or survivial skills</b>. None of the reasons you have given regarding this article's potential deletion conform to Wikipedia standards and rules, and until your reasons for deletion conform to those standards, they must necessarily be considered irrelevant. James Kim qualifies as a noteworthy person under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines, and his article conforms to those guidelines. Therefore, under the circumstances, and provided that you have so far given no reasons for deletion that are relevant to Wikipedia guidelines for inclusion or deletion, I am bound to recommend this article be kept.

<dd>Sorry, media coverage (even by major souces) does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability and I don't see the equivalence of Klass, Karr or Ralston. Klass has a foundation and an arts center in her honor. Karr represented a major turn in a culturally significant murder case (supersensationalized by the media, but had long-running ramifications and reverberations for the contemporary moral debate over US culture), and Ralston has authored a book which has been nominated for at least one national book award (Quill Awards 2005). In addition, none of these articles have been subject to afd discussion. If the Kim incident has a substantive impact on a law, or leads to creation of a significant foundation or something, that would increase his notability in my eyes. What I object to is the immediate inclusion of stories simply because they receive news coverage without judging if there is evidence for long term significance or substantive current social impact beyond the news story.

Your comments about whether an individual has a foundation in their name or has written a book and what impact that would have on a person's eligibility for inclusion in Wikipedia are completely arbitrary on your part and do not in any way conform to Wikipedia guidelines. Your rationale justifying the inclusion of John Mark Karr (his relevance to some kind of debate over US culture) is extremely subjective and highly debatable at best. Aron Ralston may not be "remembered" years from now, whether he has written a book or not; and if the creation of a foundation or book is some kind of subjective pronouncement of worthiness, you would be naive to think that the James Kim story will not find future outlets in various American media forms. Nevertheless, even if the creation of a "book or foundation" with James Kim's name on it never comes to pass, they would have little if any relevancy to Wikipedia guidelines. Foundation or no, James Kim certainly meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and his is arguably the most famous wilderness ordeal story in recent American history. Indeed, fame alone *is* enough to warrant inclusion. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not state that an individual must have a lasting impact on law or a foundation named after him.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I only wish my death would come while I was a well-liked employee at anonline media company. Then too would my passing be memorialized by throngs of internet users on wikipedia. Not to insult the late Mr. Kim, but can anyone say with a straight face that but for his death, a wikipedia article on him would have endured? I doubt it. Let's be honest: there is a massive selection bias going on here; the majority of wikipedia editors are probably in the tech community, and thus they're a little more invested/interested in the story - this much should be obvious when someone actually takes the time to chart out his walking path with a google maps graphic. I don't think it speaks well of Wikipedia (in terms of preserving neutrality/non-bias) that just because a member of their own community has passed, there's a rallying to ensure that the general public will never forget their lost colleague. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that screams "memorial". Bottom line, information-seekers 5 years from now aren't going to be saying "shucks, I really wish Wikipedia hadn't deleted that article on James Kim, because I was really looking forward to learning all about him".

<li><b>Comment</b>: Why does becoming famous after or as a result of a death mean that a subject isn't worthy of a Wikipedia article? There's even a whole article -- People who became famous only in death -- populated exclusively by such people. By that criterion, that an article is only acceptable if the subject was well known during his or her life, we'd have to delete the articles on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polly_Klaas_adaa.html" title="Polly Klaas">Polly Klaas</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra_Levy_52b3.html" title="Chandra Levy">Chandra Levy</a>, and even <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_van_Gogh_769c.html" title="Vincent van Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>. James Kim was on the cover of <i>People</i> magazine, and saying that only people in the tech community (not that I agree that most Wikipedians are in said community) are interested in this story just isn't accurate. You may find the story unappealing or unimportant, and wish that others shared those sentiments, but the fact is that it was a major story. Wikipedia, like any good encyclopedia, isn't in the business of molding reality to some ideal form, but rather we should be describing reality as it is as NPOV as possible. The fact is that this was a notable story, even though you may wish that it was not and you might personally dislike the media that propelled it forward and dislike the reasons it became a major story. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 19:03, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that's my point. Anne Frank and Vincent van Gogh (save Polly Klaas and Chandra Levy; the propriety of those article I'll put aside for a moment) have had some significant contribution to society. The majority of people (and I don't even know who decides on the qualifications for inclusion on that list) on that "List of people who became famous only in death" have notoriety for reasons other than the mere fact they died - their death was notorious because of a resulting change in social policy or notorious because of their association with a bona fide famous person. To address your argument "well what about the Chandra Levy's of the world" I would submit that a victim of violence, especially where the situation surrounding the murder is somewhat notorious, is a lot more intrinsically "worthy" of note than a mere accidental death. The headline for that aricle says it all: "Those on this list have become famous in death to a degree beyond the immediate release of the notification of their death." In my opinion (and of course you're entitled to yours, that's the point of this forum) is that he's not famous in any degree worthy of inclusion in wikipedia beyond "the immediate release of the notification of their death." If you want to pursue the argument that he was famous prior to death, so be it, but you (not you in general) can't conflate the two and make a circular argument that goes something like "ok, he died, nothing really special. but now we're going to highlight his pre-death accomplishments to make his death special." And if you're able to make some argument for inclusion absent of his death, I'd simply ask "where was his article before he died?". Ocap8 20:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your personal standard for the notability necessary to generate a Wikipedia article seems to be much higher than the Wikipedia consenus and that outlined in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I suppose you would want to delete the articles of every obscure B-actor, and people like <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelyne.html" title="Angelyne">Angelyne</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_McClure_e28b.html" title="Jessica McClure">Jessica McClure</a>, who have not necessarily made any "significant contribution" to society but who are known to many people nonetheless. Since Wikipedia is [<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper|is" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper|is" rel="nofollow">not paper</a>] and because there is willing free labor to build Wikipedia, and since Wikipedia has become a unique one-stop/first-stop resource for who-knows-how-many users, such people have articles about them, and their articles (and countless others like them), if well-written and factual, do nothing to harm or detract from Wikipedia. If you think James Kim isn't notable enough for a Wikipedia article (yes, only in death and only because the media and public attention on his death made him notable, whether the media or Joe Q. Public "should" have given him that attention or not), and you wish not to provide a resource on Wikipedia for people who will turn here and have turned here for information on Kim*, then all I can say is that I sincerely wish you well, as your fight for massive deletions will be an arduous and uphill battle, to say the least. *(If this James Kim article were deleted, which obviously it won't be, I wonder how long it would be before someone new started a new one. Ten minutes?) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I would just add explicitly that I never said that fame prior to death was a necessary condition for wikipedia inclusion. And to the extent that there's a huge difference between posthumous recognition of a person's societal contributions (i.e. famous after death) and poshumous recognition merely because of the circumstances surrounding death (i.e. famous because of death), I would reference my above comment. Ocap8 20:43, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose I was reacting to this comment -- "Not to insult the late Mr. Kim, but can anyone say with a straight face that but for his death, a wikipedia article on him would have endured?" -- to which I would respond: I'm not sure -- if well-written, my money is on yes -- but it's a moot point. He became notable <i>because</i> of the attention generated upon his disappearance and death. And so what? That's reality. I don't see the need even to justify whether or not he was notable before he died. Personally, I would never have thought to start an article on Kim before he died (nor would I have thought to nominate it for deletion if it was decently written), just as I never would have thought to start an article on, say, <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laci_Peterson_cec6.html" title="Laci Peterson">Laci Peterson</a> before she died. They both became widely famous only in death. And? So? This fact doesn't trouble me as a Wikipedia editor; it's just the way reality panned out. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In 5 years (or maybe 90 days) he will be remembered only as "that guy who took a wrong turn and wandered around in the mountains until he froze," right up there with the "three guys currently lost on Mt. Hood with dozens of people looking for them." Do they have articles yet? Kim's only "involvement in a newsworth story" was his getting lost and dying of hypothermia. It must have been a slow news week. He was not "assassinated," so why that even mentioned? There are certainly as many news stories about the 3 lost guys as for Kim. Kim is no more notable than the 600 plus other people who die each year of hypothermia in the U.S. 67.162.79.243 19:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How, exactly, do they harm Wikipedia, those articles? They appear well-written to me. Are you concerned about a lack of bandwith to support them? I guess I don't understand why they trouble you.

<dd>The harm to Wikipedia is that they serve as a vandalism honeypot and that they will not receive, by dint of their impending obscurity, the collaborative effort and attention that we use ensure well-written, verifiable articles. Bad articles, even those infrequently read, taint the wikipedia project as a whole and detract from the credibility of even our best articles. Our bandwith may be well-nigh infinite, but our editors are not. Is this the type of article that will be policed five years from now and ten? That <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> must be understood to include the project's longevity as well as its bandwith. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 22:24, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia has grown exponentially since its founding, so deleting an article based on what <i>could</i> or <i>might</i> happen to articles in the future seems unecessarily pessimistic to me. It's impossible to know which articles users have on their watchlists, and it would be a really arbitrary task to delete articles on the basis of a perceived paucity of editors and what may or may not happen five or ten years from now.

<li><b>Keep</b>* And how noteworthy does one have to be? I do notice that there's still an article here on Jessica McClure, what noteworthy accomplishments had she managed to acquire before she fell into that well? While we're on the subject, who the heck were these Donner Party people? Would they merit a wikipedia article if it were not for the circumstances of their journey west? I daresay they would be like other brave pioneers, remembered only in the dusty scrapbooks of their descendants, or possibly in the town's historical society. Human history revolves around the triumphs and yes, the tragedies of ordinary human beings caught up in greater events. Whether or not they were noteworthy before these events has no bearing on whether or not they will be noteworthy in the eyes of history, and as baby jessica and the donner party have, perhaps one day this article will move from the realm of current events into history, and this article help someone who wasn't around to know what happened to him.

<li>Your answer makes no sense... and it simply reflects the reason that the specious article should be deleted. It doesn't tell the reader who/what this so-called person actually is. Similarly, since you've been following it from the beginning, apparently, and can't say specifically <i>what</i> Isabella V is, I must presume that such specific information is not available in any form, much less via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Thus no matter how an interpretation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is stretched, she cannot be verified as either real, hoax, or a piece of web fiction. This returns to my contentions in both here and the previous AfD, and cannot sustain a <i>keep</i> from me. <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not a valid reason to keep an article that would otherwise be deleted.<a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Kendrick7: Hungarian <a href="../../../g/o/u/Goulash.html" title="Goulash">goulash</a> is probably more authentic. People are missing the point entirely. There was and is absolutely <i>nothing</i> notable about Ignatz/Isaac either as a Jew or as a Christian. Note: Real rabbis with more achievements get deleted on Wikipedia simply because they are not notable, even if they have given speeches that were published. That Ignatz/Isaac allegedly wrote a few pamphlets and is quoted in missionary works and what the Messianic Jews are doing with him is an outright hoax because there is neither any meaning nor any impact of the tale about this totally insignificant "rabbi" from a Hungarian village having done what he allegedly did. Sure, those out to missionize the Jews may have thought they "struck gold" by grasping at this pathetic straw just as today's missionaries think they have uncovered some great "hero" here, worthy of a Wikipedia piece, when all they are holding onto is <a href="../../../f/o/o/Fools_gold.html" title="Fools gold">fools gold</a> - a true hoax. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Lots of fictions up in the air today it seems, take your pick... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi Dweller: You seem to be mish-mashing a number of unrelated subjects. Ignatz/Isaac was not a "founding father" of <i>anything</i>, he died many years before the Messianic Jews and the Jews for Jesus movements were concocted by various <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical.html" title="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> churches in the USA. (BTW, The Catholics don't get involved in attempts at creating disguied versions of Christianity, they have enough confidence in their brand name.) And you are not clear, are you saying that you may even agree with me and that the entire story may be hype that is ultimately fiction? And are you implying that Lichtenstein is worthy of article based on a distorted "reciprocity" of "if you respect my hoaxes then I will respect yours" what kind of logic and basis for an encyclopedia is that? The Messianics (who are Christians) will grasp at any straw to further their self-appointed mission of converting the Jews and will stop at nothing, including accepting stories that they know nothing about, in order to buttress their mssionizing which is doomed to fail because it is based on half-truths (beginning with the biggest one, that they insist on calling themselves "Judaism" when they are in actuality Christianity.) But I guess, we will just have to allow this to play itself out over time... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand your point(s?). Evolution is notable and therefore has an article. Messianic Jews' claims about Lichtenstein make him notable, I'm afraid. It's not about respect or hoaxes, it's about notability. If a substantial group of people suddenly claimed that my aunt was important for some trumped up reason, even if they were wrong, she'd be notable and encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 11:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dweller: I was responding to your point that: "the Biblical characters that non believers also consider to be fictional" which is a pretty wild thing to throw into this discussion about a supposedly religious figure, since both Judaism and Christianity agree that the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> is 100% true, (and they obviously disagree about the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> because if they agreed to the New Testament as being true then there would not be Judaism, and if they agreed that the New Testament was false there would not be Christianity.) And I was merely adding an abvious rejoinder that if you throw in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> about "Biblical characters" perhaps being "fictional" then the counter-argument that evolutionists believe that they come from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baboon.html" title="Baboon">baboons</a> is an equally fantastic fiction and hoax for those who do not buy into mythological and known-to-be fraudulent unscientific evolutionary "theories" -- as Abraham Lincoln said "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time." What is so hard about grasping that? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nom is based on an incorrect premise - this not a fan-produced but produced by actors from Star Trek (I'd argue with it being a "series", but that's what the article says). The official startrek.com website has covered it, and I can find reports in various press sources about it being filmed. I shall try to source stuff. This is not your common-or-garden fan film, but something that really is notable. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 13:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK. I have added sources, to startrek.com, to the official press release, and to a newspaper in the area which covered the filming. Is this appropriate now? This has probably been covered in the specialist SF press, but they don't tend to make their archives online. Oh, that that is a <b>keep</b>, by the way.

<p>I'm not sure about this one... 915 GHits, and not all of them are for this one (there's also a Citibank regional director). However, the article claims he's been published in the "Journal of Analytical Psychology" and a few other major publivations. My main concern is that I can find no mention of the author himself from (relatively) mainstream independent sources. I see articles he has published, I see books he's trying to sell, I see short bios on the sites he uses to sell them, but no mention of the author himself from anything serious. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 10:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unless someone can actually provide a compelling case that this article is a hoax, of course (which is the primary reason for WP:V). Lack of desired content is not a criteria or valid rationale for AFD. There have been stub articles with far less "third party" info that have been around for years. Plus the site is notable enough that it qualifies as its own source.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> not sure I'd agree with it being as influential as Katmandu, but it's definitely a long-running paper comic and notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete:</b> I proded this article because, while some people might find this notable to their specific and small community it is not to the general populace. This is the definition of cruft.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not able to support <i>or</i> refute claims that this comic was influential, or even known. I'm unable to find any review of it online outside of forums posts. It was never offered in <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_Comic_Distributors_e0cb.html" title="Diamond Comic Distributors">Diamond Comic Distributors</a>'s <i>Previews</i>, virtually ensuring it had no national distribution to US comic stores (indeed, while experience is not a measure of verifiability here, I worked in the comics retail industry for almost a decade and no distributor we worked with ever offered this for shipment or sale). Even things like Rhudiprrt: Prince of Fur saw Diamond distribution. I have no doubts this series was important to some people; I have no doubts that it inspired later works. But my doubts or lack thereof <i>don't matter</i> -- verifiable references from reliable sources do, and ASB doesn't seem to ave those. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 05:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability is highly subjective. It wasn't a highly distributed comic, but that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't notable or was extremely obscure. Amazon has it listed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Associated-Student-Bodies-Lance-Rund/dp/0971988609" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Associated-Student-Bodies-Lance-Rund/dp/0971988609" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> with a rank about 130,000th, and even if there are many books around there, they're not as unique.<br />
Besides, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and if "each of the 100+ poker games can have its own page with rules, history, and strategy," and I only know three kinds, then I think something like this can have its own page. What it <i>does</i> need is some more research; perhaps the people at Wikifur can help. I think it gets its own page though. There is much much more less notable stuff floating around on Wikipedia, and while that statement itself does not make this any more "notable", I say we keep it. 65.43.85.113 20:28, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, because of the nature of the comic as furry pornography, it's very unlikely to have references beyond self-published web content. Again, I accept that it may go because it's not notable outside the fandom - although the same could be said of the vast majority of Pokemon, Star Wars, Star Trek and anime articles here. I would, however, be disappointed if it goes merely on the legal technicality that it hasn't been in "Previews". <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 03:54, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't have to be <i><b>Previews</b></i>. It just has to be independant, reliable coverage. I do understand that certain subjects (obviously including gay-themed adult furry fandom products) have a harder time garnering that coverage. But it is not an impossible hurdle, and there are other titles for which ample references exist.

<dd>I agree that the "usual" indicators of notability cannot be applied in every situation. In this case, with its notability being debated, I believe in a "When in doubt, don't delete" type of policy.

<dd>and do the works that were inspired by or make references to this comic give any evidence as to its notability? Can somebody look into works that reference, parody, or were inspired by ASB such as Circles and <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Incontinent_Student_Bodies" class="external text" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Incontinent_Student_Bodies" rel="nofollow">ISB</a>?

<dd>One non-notable comic being influenced by another doesn't do much for anybody.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the problem with this one is localized notability. There are a total of 11,000 ghits for this thing, 90% of them scattered across furry or gay themed websites, blogs, forums, and the like. (Ghit searching is science, young padawan.) There is VERY SLIGHT coverage in a couple of college newspapers but I can't find an online source to link to. Rabbit Valley, at the least, is not exactly self-publishing either. I'm really not sure where to draw the line on this one.

If I understand <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> correctly, it means that articles similar to ASB does not support notability; does that only apply to similar articles that have no connection, meaning that similar work that are related to it (derived, make references to, etc.) can have an effect on notability?

<dd>Well, to me it cuts both ways. Just because Article A got deleted doesn't mean Article B can be deleted out of hand because it's similar to Article A. OR, if Article X is non notable, and gets deleted, just because you don't think Article Y is non-notable and yet is still here isn't a good reason to keep Article X. In <i>this</i> case, Circles has a connection to ASB, but Circles is better documented. The user who compared a furry comic book to X Windows is making a connection in notability that doesn't exist. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 21:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Opportunes have been around only since 1980, according to the Wikipedia article. (2) Coverage by the campus paper is local and should be considered trivial as an indicator of notability. Local businesses are covered in local papers all the time. The Crimson articles you cite, anyway, don't have enough material that we can use to build an article (and don't verify the material that's in the article right now). (3) You don't address the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> concern: the group's website is the only place to go to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the material in the article.

<dd>Oldest coed acapella group. The Harvard Crimson is not considered as trivial as most local newspapers. It certainly is accepted as a reliable source; if you want new policy on that, take it to the pump. Thus the Crimson, if nowhere else - and there are others, including a Globe article from 1999 - that indicate that the thing exists, and give us enough information that we can check whether or not a reasonable amount of information is accurate. The Rashida Jones thing is confirmed in an issue of the new magazine 02138 that I saw the other day. The point being that if you claim that the Crimson is not RS, then you have to remove references in a ton of other articles. If you do, then you cannot claim that multiple mentions in the media are not relevant. Above all, the Crimson definitely reports an international tour; that meets wp:music all by itself.</dd>
<dd>You see my point? I have no objection to changing wp:music to remove a ton of little groups; but the problem is that wp:music, as it stands, will almost always allow a capella groups in major univs through the cracks. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:13, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(1) Much of your comment takes great care to rebut my claim that The Crimson is not a reliable source. Problem is, I never made such a claim. Please read my above comment again. What I said about The Crimson is that <i>it should be considered trivial as an indicator of notability because it's local</i>, not that it's trivial because it's unreliable, nor that it is unreliable. (The same is true of the 02138 magazine you mention, which bills itself as "geared toward alumni of Harvard University.") I also said that The Crimson articles don't verify the information that's in the article right now, nor could they be used to write a Wikipedia article anew -- this is because of their trivial <i>content</i>, not because of their reliability. (2) Ah yes, the "international tour". I meant to respond to that yesterday but forgot. In my view, the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a> is -- well -- <i>primary</i>. It's a derivative of the core policies WP:NOT, WP:V, and WP:NPOV, and it's in every one of our notability guidelines including WP:MUSIC. The ancillary provisions of WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, etc. exist because they are indications that the primary notability criterion is likely to be satisfied. For example, the "international tour" provision is at WP:MUSIC because a band that has gone on an international tour is more likely to garner press coverage. However, a college group travelling abroad to perform is at a fundamentally lower media-grade than a band with a signed label. In every case, ultimately, the primary notability criterion must be checked, and in this case, it's failed. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is some concern that this article should be deleted as per <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. Honestly, I am neurtal, but I removed the prod tag, since I think that deletion should be discussed. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 13:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 13:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically, here is my rationale for removing PROD, listing in AFD and my <b>neutral</b> stance:</p>
<p>Three points to consider with Crystal Ball:</p>
<p>1) Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place.</p>
<ul>
<li>I contend that the 2008-2009 NBA season is both notable and virtually certain to take place. Therefore, I disagree with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Similarly, individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names, preassigned to future events or discoveries, are not suitable article topics, if only generic information is known about the item</p>
<ul>
<li>I would agree that this is an arguable point to delete this article, but not without discussion. Therefore, I disagree with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. I would say that a small set of non-generic non-speculative information MAY be available for this season. I would rather err on the side of caution.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and therefore inappropriate....</p>
<ul>
<li>Not applicable in this case, IMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I can see reasons to delete this article, but I can also see reasons NOT to delete this article. For instance, there are a few cities that would be considered front-runners for the 2009 All-star game.</p>
<p>Although the location of the 2009 NBA All-star game is ofically undecided, by nature of precident of other similar future-scheduled sporting events that are expected to take place, such as the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_Winter_Olympics_bd0d.html" title="2018 Winter Olympics">2018 Winter Olympics</a>, I think it can be argued to keep the article. The NBA announced the 2008 All-Star game on May 22, 2006, which means that a decision would be forthcoming from the NBA within about 6 months. There is certainly specualtion considering what city may play host to this event... then again... its speculation.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> What's the point of deleting? There's no crystal-ball material in the article right now, and it's going to be filled up with actual details eventually. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:33, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No it doesnt. Did you check the links? They're simply making references to the site's information. The above you quoted says <i>"has been the subject"</i>. Allaahuakbar.net has not been <i>"the subject of multiple non-trivial published works"</i>. When I make a reference link to a website, that is trivial as compared to publishing work and having that website as a subject of that work. If you're going to bring two articles that make a link to a website and say its notable - that for example can apply to virtually any random XYZ Geocities website as well. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 05:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here is the content of the first: <i>"Orthodox Sunni Muslim organizations regard MSTA, NOI and FP as heretical cults. India's Ansar us- Sunnah Library and Research Center refers to NOI as the Nation of Kufr (unbelievers) for its emphasis on Black nationalism and identity and what it describes as a blend of false Muslim and Christian beliefs. The group's website places NOI alongside Shiites, which they describe as rafidah (rejectors), and other groups they consider heretics such as Sufis, Druze and Amhadis in a section warning Muslims to guard their faith (<a href="http://www.allaahuakbar.net" class="external free" title="http://www.allaahuakbar.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaahuakbar.net</a>)."</i>.

<dl>
<dd>Its not, I agree. But thats just one link. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says "Multiple" and in addition it also says "non-trivial". Going by what BhaiSaab said for Faithfreedom, I'll say that in this case this mention is <i>trivial</i>. If you see the policy, it defines what trivial is and this is true in this case in my opinion. There are more popular Islamic websites than this, dont worry. This one is definitely non-notable. What you could do is find which pro-Islam sites are notable and make articles on those. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 02:29, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't understand why this article should be deleted on the say-so of one person? I am not entirely sure how to even start defending the article with me being a beginner contributing to this site. First of all i tried to make the article as neutral sounding as possible by looking at the other language articles and following their style. Not only that, but this lanuage is maturing and will be fully released in a few weeks. This article was to pre-emp the research of the computer science community and general public regarding Aurora. Of course to you this must sound like marketing talk and one big advert but other users and i hold Aurora in extremely high regard within the OOP systems languages and is a potential successor to C++, which of course DOES make it notable. You show me another language other than Java or SmallTalk that rivals Aurora? This has created alot of dissapointment in the current Aurora community especially as the release date is so imminent. Does this mean that Aurora will never have it's own page until <i>you</i> say?</p>

<p>Frankly, for someone to start a delete thread who knows nothing about the langauge, its potential, and its roots, is absurd. The language is a solid compiler with tons of working examples, all it is lacking is a few documentation changes here and there. Do some research before you go and and try to hang something that you have no clue what it is or what it is about. If you bother to WIKI up XNA you will discover that there is a thread about it in here, and it is still technically in ALPHA, although they call it Beta 2 (or community technology preview 1), and its still under development. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of knowledge about many existing items. Aurora exists and is real and in use by tons of people.</p>

<dd>1) Since most people new to Wikipedia don't know about AfD, when a brand new user account's early postings are to an AfD discussion it raises the question of whether this might be an experienced Wikipedian posting under a new name, in order to give the appearance that a point of view is supported by more users than it really is. In AfD discussions, it is therefore customary to point out user names whose edits to an AfD discussion are among the first edits made under that account name.</dd>

This article was to pre-emp the research of the computer science community and general public regarding Aurora. Of course to you this must sound like marketing talk and one big advert but other users and i hold Aurora in extremely high regard within the OOP systems languages and is a potential successor to C++, which of course DOES make it notable. You show me another language other than The C's, Java or SmallTalk that rivals Aurora? This has created alot of dissapointment in the current Aurora community especially as the release date is so imminent.</p>
<p>Also using google results as an indicator of being worthy for inclusion into this site is unreliable at best. Searching for mentions of Aurora returns a few thousand results, but is this an indication of its importance to the computer science community? I don't personally think so.</p>
<p>Lets take an example of other articles that appear on this site, lets take for example <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a>. Who is <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a>? I don't know either, but his contributions must of been <i>notable</i> because he has had a shiny wikipage for a year now. And guess what, he returns between 3-4 results from google!</p>
<p>Marking this article for deletion is a matter of opinion by someone who doesn't know anything about the subject of computer science or programming languages in general. Aurora IS notable and will gain global acclaim once it is released (exactly like XNA as another contributer pointed out). This article was created to educate people quickly about Aurora's design, feature set and history. Which is exactly the point of an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I do however concede the point that the article may be construed as marketing and that i, as a partner developer on Aurora was the one that started this article. The reason for this was to get the information as accurate as possible, so what better author than somebody directly invloved? Maybe you are right (?) that the article could be worded a little more neutral, but you tell me how you can mention a language's feature-set and heritage without it sounding promotional?</p>

<dd>It is good that someone who knows the language wrote the article (it'd be shocking if it was any other way!) but i think it would have helped your arguments if you were not on the payroll and the conflict of interests question did not arise. As to the article itself, certain phrases read like marketing spiel, for instance "advanced compiler" (what is so advanced about it?), "Linux and Mac OS X are planned" (marketing...), "Affiliates" (sales...) but perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of notability. A lack of hits on Google combined with a lack of links to independent sites in the article can only lead to the notion of it being non-notable. Sure, the developers and the (currently 210) forum members will have heard of it and will come here chanting "it must be notable - *I'VE* heard of it!" but who else? Has it been reviewed in magazines? Has any notable software been written in it? I don't think your argument about <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a> is relevant. If you think he is non-notable then you should take that to his page, it is has nothing to do with the notability of this article. After all that, i think the article could stay if tidied up appropriately although the question of notability (at this point in time) remains 82.29.182.9 18:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI even though it has no bearing on this discussion but to the validity of my posts, I am new to wikipedia, but I am a seasoned poster on many other forums. There is no validity in "calling me out" and accusing me of "puppeteering". Also, I think the cursive font is nice so once again, trying to accuse me of being one of the other posters by stating&#160;:"The font type is a curious idiosyncrasy shared by the user or users of several accounts posting here.": is an obvious gesture that you are placing me in the same category of those individuals, which in and of itself is a predjadicial remark. (you are basically being prejadice to my posts and towards me directly which is not allowed in wikipedia rules), I would appreciate it if you back off of me and stop with your prejadicisms towards me at this time. I do not appreciate them or your continued attacks on me, prejadice has no place here so please take it elsewhere and stick to the discussion as to wether or not this should remain in Wikipedia.</li>

The numbers themselves mean nothing. If I could find two or more in-depth, independent reviews of the Aurora software in some magazine or newspaper, I would change my call to "keep" in a flash. Sadly, there appear to be none. I repeat: The numbers and ranks thrown up by search engines add nothing to the article we do not already know.

<li><b>Keep</b> Aurora is a NEW language, and because it is new, it shouldn't be evaluated for "notability" on the same criteria as long-established languages such as C++. I believe discussion about deletion of this article is premature. It won't do any harm to let it remain for a little while longer, and see whether the imminent production release really happens as claimed, and whether the language is reviewed in other publications as a result of its production release. --Rod Turnham 14:06 18 December 2006 (EST)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia grants no special privileges for "new" phenomena and does not evaluate them in a different way from other phenomena. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news medium. It's the other way around: there's no harm in deleting the article now. It can always be re-created without prejudice when enough has been published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to enable an article to be written that meets the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. I'd add that I believe a request to <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERFY_518d.html" title="WP:USERFY">"userfy"</a> the article, that is to move it to someone's personal user page on Wikipedia, would be honored. That would mean that the information would be available, indexed by Google, and make it easy to re-create the article at some future date. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Balancing the articles" usually means putting an opposing viewpoint within the article itself, either as a separate section or mixed within the same section, not by writing a separate, stand-alone "article"... and this is hardly an encyclopedia article as it is presented here today. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the people interested Kurdistan Workers Party/Timeline; It was created as a graphical time to the the articles <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurdistan_Workers_Party_8c3f.html" title="History of the Kurdistan Workers Party">History of the Kurdistan Workers Party</a> in helping the users understand (visually see the periods) the violent behaviors of the organization (organizational development) that spans more than 30 years. PKK is an organization that uses force and the threat of force against both civilian and military targets , and it's activity profile is comparable to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>.

To understand this tool; or to use the tool; one has to read <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurdistan_Workers_Party_8c3f.html" title="History of the Kurdistan Workers Party">History of the Kurdistan Workers Party</a>, or look previous versions PKK which (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdistan_Workers_Party&amp;oldid=43853119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdistan_Workers_Party&amp;oldid=43853119" rel="nofollow">timeline integrated into the article</a>) before the history become a separate article. In order to understand what this time line is telling about. If <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> wants to improve the article, I was just trying to be agreeable to <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a>. I can not see the validity of adding "opposing viewpoint" of an organization that has committed multiple acts of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> seems removing content more than adding to it. This time line stayed in the wiki sphere for nearly two years.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> or create a new article if its listing as a subpage violates guidelines. There are shorter articles about fictional Star Wars and Pokemon characters and planets, there is no reason that there shouldn't be an article about the timeline of PKK et al. NPOV issues can be dealt with, just put the appropriate tag. The whole article is sourced, it can be expanded, structured and English sources found.. What is the problem here? Hurriyet is the most prominent newspaper in Turkey. In 2004, Turkey ranked higher than Italy for the freedom of the press, so I think that its words carry enough weight. The article could be moved to a a new article, but there is no basis for deletion. Many timeline articles exist for every topic imaginable.

As for the article in question, I did not create it, I created a sub page because of the amount of code. I merely copied the timeline from tr.wiki since it felt sensible at the time. I was going o translate it but later felt that was rather pointless. A number of png/svg timelines would be better IMHO.<br />

I only became alerted to the deletion after some apparent fans e-mailed me questioning what had happened to her Wiki page.</p>

<dd>Sorry, colleague, you missed the target 100%. The first of your refs mentions "poor fellow in the red shirt" so what? Indeed it is an unnamed FIRS. Does it say that it is a stock character? No. Your refs 2,3 are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources fior wikipedia</a>. Finally, The movie is a parody of Star Trek. It is a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> in our context and certainly does not introduce the notion or literary criticism "the redshirt is a stock character".

<dd>Recognizing widespread usage demonstrates that this article is not creating a theory which is what OR is meant to avoid. The fact is, no matter how much you try to claim OR, the real problem is not that it's OR, as there's no theory or speculation involved that serves to advance any position. Sure, I agree that there should be better sources. That's a reason to clean-up, not to delete.

<li><b>Weak Keep/Major Cleanup/Move to Red shirt (Star Trek)</b> I'm willing to accept that this is a Star Trek reference that has gained some traction in broader pop culture. However, this article needs deep deep scrubbing for undue weight and excessive trivia (and the mass of original research that goes along with this) as well as at least an attempt at proper referencing. There doesn't seem to be much evidence for the "redshirt" term either (so suggest move). All the usages appear to be references to Star Trek, and the term appears to have no significance beyond this (i.e. not in general usage as a term for a disposable stock character for other programs).

<li><b>Comment</b> - wikipedia would seem to have a very heavy Star Trek leaning due to the overlap with geekdom, and geekdom interests.

The use of a "redshirt" to refer to non-Star Trek usages may be harder to source, that case just warrants rewriting the intro. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 17:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete for now</b> None of the links are from particularly reliable sources, and I can't find any verification that the sources mentioned as having published his work actually did publish (or talk about) it, though perhaps I'm missing something on Google because of his name (I, of course, tried more specific searches than just "Ravi Shankar"). No real notability is asserted otherwise, and the article is also somewhat POV.

Assuming that the available information is correct (I have no reason to question it), he appears to pass a "notability" test as a rising young poet who is getting published and noticed. Also, the disambiguation issue associated with his name increases the value of retaining an article about him. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 21:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> and <b>Rename</b>. While the article has some POV and other problems, none of those are a basis for deletion. However, it needs some serious clean-up and the title must be changed. The article opens with the unverified unsourced statement that "<i>The term Spanish Gibraltarians...<b>is most commonly used</b> to describe those inhabitants of Gibraltar who left (<b>voluntarily or forcibly</b>) the town of Gibraltar during the British conquest of this town from Spain</i>" (emphasis added herein). The highlighted portions of that sentence are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unsourced</a>. While the highlighted portion may have been the root of the dispute in past AfD/DRV discussions, this whole introductory sentence (or statements similar to it) may be why this article has attracted controversy. Furthermore, the title is simply too loaded or may be simply inaccurate. The inline sources in the article contradict the opening sentence (i.e. the term used in the links is "Spaniards in Gibraltar", not "Spanish Gibraltarians"). Something like "Spaniards of Gibraltarian origin" or "Spaniards from Gibraltar" may be a more suitable name. Alternatively, the first half of the article can be kept (with some rewriting) and renamed "Spanish exodus from Gibraltar" (or something better/more appropriate), while the second half about present-day Spaniards living in Gibraltar can be merged to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Gibraltar_f34c.html" title="Demographics of Gibraltar">Demographics of Gibraltar</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/merge</b>. Seems to be a valid fork of <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> Remaining POV issues can be edited away, but as I argued during the last AfD this article has a few clear references at the bottom (although references #4 and #5 can be happily dispensed with) and at least appears to have a limited mandate of explaining usage of the term. I'd like to see more line-by-line citation of course, but it's a simple and limited enough subject that I see no reason to delete it. Small historical ethnic groups deserve some attention, and this one at least asserts its own notability with a scholarly work and at least one newspaper analysis. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 23:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. This is a repetition of the article 'Originary inhabitants of Gibraltar' which was subject to a successful AfD.</dd>
<dd>2. The sole purpose of this article is to discredit the existance of the Gibraltarian people which the author simply dismisses as the present inhabitants of Gibraltar it is simple racism, promoting the often repeated Spanish POV that we simply do not exist as a distinct people.</dd>
<dd>3. The title is an oxymoron. The term 'Gibraltarian' is a modern one with a precise legal meaning, to qualify for being a Gibraltarian it is necessary to be a British Citizen. As Spain does not recognise dual nationality its rather difficult to be a 'Spanish Gibtraltarian'</dd>
<dd>4. The content of the article is rubbish, and it will result in an extended edit war the moment any Gibraltarian with a weak stomach reads it.</dd>
<dd>5. The paragraph <i>The term Spanish Gibraltarian is also informally used, in the UK, to refer to those modern-day Gibraltarians who are primarily of Spanish language and culture, as opposed to British ex-patriates living on the territory.</i> is a total fabrication according to the 2001 census there are 326 Spanish people resident in Gibraltar, the view promoted by the Spanish Government that the place is filled by 'British ex-pats' is untrue - the vast majority are British Gibraltarians, born in Gibraltar.</dd>
<dd>6. Its propaganda and racist rubbish, repeatedly trying to push 'being Spanish' down our throats is really offensive.</dd>
<dd>7. If it keeps coming back despite successful Afd votes to remove it, this puts the whole process of removing rubbish from Wikupedia in question.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pretty much repeating what I wrote in the previous AfD - There is a POV bent to it and I never like that. I always say that means the content should be changed, not the article deleted. I understand this is a passionate issue in Gibraltar (having been there, I've discussed it with locals), but this was a historic part of Gibraltar, even under British rule and that can't be ignored. This reminds me of the article <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zimbabwe_41d4.html" title="Whites in Zimbabwe">Whites in Zimbabwe</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> OK, I've taken some time to read up on the overturn and re-visited the previous 3 AfD discussions (yes 3). I still don't see why this needs it's own article. The subject is the very few Spanish inhabitants who did not leave after the British conquest of more than 300 years ago and the very few people who claim to be thier decendants (and thier non-notable organization, the Heirs of Gibraltar). There is a claim that the term Spanish Gibraltarian is a term used in the UK but then provides a reference from 106 years ago to support this. If this information is considered noatble, it should be in the main Gibraltar article or a related article (probably best in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Gibraltar_9245.html" title="History of Gibraltar">History of Gibraltar</a> article). The article presents a POV fork in the ongoing Gibraltar dispute and doesn't belong here at Wikipedia. This is over and above the basic poor quality of the article itself. Please delete the article, please advise me when User:Burgas00 applies to have the delete overturned AGAIN or salt this so I don't have to do this a fourth time. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 02:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> There are, of course, plenty of Gibraltarians of wholly and partly Spanish descent. There are plenty of Spaniards of Gibraltarian and British descent (there is, funnily enough, no attempt to create a class of "English Spaniards"). But this article is trying to create a class of person who simply never existed. A very few Spaniards lived on Gibraltar before it was ceded in perpetuity to Great Britain. They were not Gibraltarians, they were Spaniards. There was no such thing as a Gibraltarian until Gibraltar was created as a British Crown Colony. This is simply an attempt by those who believe that if you say something often enough it will gain a degree of credibility to try and undermine the status of the Gibraltarian people. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimbellina_ba81.html" title="User:Timbellina">Timbellina</a> 20:59, 14 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimbellina_ba81.html" title="User:Timbellina">Timbellina</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Timbellina_be40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Timbellina">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> How many times do we have to have the same arguments? This article was already deleted before. What is this, keep at it until it gets in? It was wrong then and it's wrong now. There should be a ban on this sort of pressure bullying! Of course there are Gibraltarians of Spanish descent, but there are very few such individuals compared to those we might name Genoese Gibraltarians, Maltese Gibraltarians, Jewish Gibraltarians etc etc. Gibraltar happily is a place where one's ancestry matters not a jot. To introduce this sort of ethnic compartmentalisation would be wholly counterproductive to a society which finds it easy to erase from the common mind an individual's origins, and concentrate only what and who they are now. Gibraltar is mostly populated by British Gibraltarians. There is no such thing as any other sort of Gibraltarian. In Gibraltar there are no ghettos, there are no no-go areas for any individuals, there are no gangs based on ancestry, no socially unacceptable marriage partners.

Still, I dont see why they would not deserve an article which documents their history. I, in any case, would support it and contribute to it. In any case, I agree with DGG, political arguments evoking the greatness of the Gibraltarian people are not called for. This article was undeleted because the deletion procedures were faulty and not based on consensus. Furthermore the arguments given for deletion (OR, racism etc...) have been debunked or are unsupported by evidence. I would also recommend editors to sign in or register before voting so as to avoid suspicions of possible sockpuppetry.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 01:02, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its not a question of 'evoking greatness' its the simple fact that the people of Gibraltar are called Gibraltarians TODAY. In 1704 they were simple Spaniards and they left. You just can't accept reality. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a></dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>:Gibnews, you should follow a principle in life: Respect the names people have chosen for themselves. If those "Spaniards" who lived in Gibraltar (understandebly) called themselves Gibraltarians aswell as Spanish, let them be so. Just as Kurds in Turkey can be called Kurds as well as Turkish, Armenians in Lebanon can be called Armenian as well as Lebanese and the Palestinian diaspora should be allowed to call itself Palestinian even though Palestine does not exist as a state.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 16:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>DELETE</b> Spanish Gibraltarians simply DO NOT EXIST. The people who lived in Gibraltar prior to 1704 were Gaditanos, i.e. from the province of Cadiz/Spain. The term Spanish Gibraltarian is an invention. The people of San Roque, where the main bulk of Spaniards who chose to leave the Rock after the conquest are Gaditanos and have always called themselves so. After the closure of the land frontier by the Spanish Dictator Franco during the sixties, most of the people of San Roque who worked in Gibraltar were dispersed to other places in Spain, therefore hardly, if any, original Spaniards who may have lived in Gibraltar prior to the conquest remain there. The town which was created next to Gibraltar on the other side of the frontier, La Linea (the line) was made up solely of Spaniards (or Gaditanos) from the surrounding areas, San Roque included which claims to house the real inhabitants of Gibraltar before it was ceded to Britain by Spain in perpetuity by the Treaty of Utrecht, who came to service the Garrison. Thus the same can be said of other little villages in the surrounding area. Galliano is not a Spaniard, neither is Hammond,they are both sons of Gibraltar of British Gibraltarian fathers and Spanish mothers. The fact that they have been described as Spanish is pure demagogy. In fact the offending contribution in Wikipedia can be construed as such, pure fabrication of a political nature. <small>— Goey (<a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoey_271e.html" title="User talk:Goey">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goey_4be4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goey">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>DELETE 11:25, 16 December 2006 (UTC)GoeygOEYAll I can say is one thing. If this article is an example of what Wikipedia has to offer, I will, in future never consult or advise anybody to consult Wikipedia on anything. This is a complete fabrication posted by someone with an axe to grind, and which, if taken as true by any student or person trying to find out facts about the Gibraltarians, would greatly distort their perception of who in fact are the People of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>As to your comment on Gaditanos...People from Yorkshire are called Geordies are they not? It does not matter from what city or village they are collectively called Geordies and they are all still in the UK. In the same way people who come from the province of Cadiz, which is where San Roque,La Linea, Los Barrios, Algeciras etc...come from are collectively called Gaditanos but they are still all Spanish. Gibraltar is not a province of anything, it is a British Colony so we are known and call ourselves British Gibraltarians. Spanish Gibraltarians are an invention of the author.Goey 11:20, 16 December 2006 (UTC)Goey 16th December 12.19 p.m.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geordie.html" title="Geordie">Geordie</a> refers to a person from the Tyneside region of England and the adjacent areas, or to the dialect spoken by these people. The correct description of Gibraltar is a <b>UK Overseas Territory</b> not a colony, a term which brings unfortunate historical baggage.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: I see you have blanked the page. Looking up the references you cited they do not actually support 'Spanish Gibraltarians' It may be more productive to let it go and move on to writing articles about something real. However if it has served as a means of getting more Gibraltarians interested in what is recorded about their history, then its been a valuable exercise. It certainly shows how little others know about the subject.</p>
<p>I understand you can get the publications of the transborder institute free by writing to them, as you have a genuine interest in the subject that would be interesting, although they do contain a lot of nonsense from both sides of the frontier/fence. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 09:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>/correction/ The page is still there, for some reason it did not show itself, probabaly ashamed of the content. There problem is there is <b>no evidence <i>that the word</i></b> <i>Gibraltarian'</i> was ever used in connection with Spanish nationals. You manufactured it. However this is not really the place to discuss this and I note you have reverted my attempts to make a honest account of things based on what YOUR references actually say. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> 10:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would also make mentions about the lack of NPOV in the section Good Shepherd Community Church Scarborough#Care House, but I feel that the significance and reading like an advertisement are the major reasons why I listed this for deletion. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 19:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are right. Every product does have some sort of advertising in it. It isn't that this article is blatant advertising; if that were the case, I would have nominated it for speedy deletion. The problem with this article is that the church is non-notable. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)</a>, in order for a church to be considered notable, there is three criteria to be met. 1) <i>Local churches are usually notable if the scope of activities is national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source.</i> While this church may attract members from immigrant communities (which is most likely true since half of the GTA is foreign born), it is not considered national or international scale. I doubt that more than a handful of people in Vancouver or Iqaluit are familiar with this church. 2) <i>Individual local churches in notable denominations are not inherently notable, and do not warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability for the local church itself is established through reliable and verifiable sources.</i> There is a link to the church website, which I will discuss in a moment. 3) <i>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</i> There is nothing listed that it did anything non local in scope. For example, I'm not noticing that it has any national press coverage, or even that there were any abroad missionary trips (although that wouldn't count for notability, either). You could say that the website is considered to be reliable and verifiable sources. However, under assertions to be rejected, <i>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article...[i]nternal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the church itself, or any denomination or other organisation it is part of.</i> Therefore, the church website doesn't count. Even if you listed the website for Congregational Christian Churches of Canada, that wouldn't count either. This church does not deserve to have a Wikipedia article. I understand that you are concerned about other articles being able to exist. I suggest and invite you to take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, where you can take a look at the criteria, and process of AdD, and invite you to even contribute by listing articles that do not meet qualifications, either. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 21:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The page does have value. It is a fact that new stories reported that Kati Kim said the Kims took the right road, encountered a rock, and then backed up and took the wrong road. Having this objective information is helpful in understanding what happened. But whether Kati Kim's memory is accurate and whether that is in fact what happened is less clear. The difference between fact and uncertainly is not so clear in this case. And I would not be so sure that everything posted on the main acticle is factually true. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a>, as far as I know, you aren't the owner of Wikipedia.

<dd>Yes, one purpose of the article is to assist research into what happened to James Kim. But it isn't true that "by definition" that makes the article itself original researc. The article is a timeline, i.e., a side entry to the entry about a newsworthy person who recently died. The side entry should stand on its own and should provide additional detail and information to those who are interested, for whatever purposes, beyond what is appropriate in the main article. Note that one standard definition of "encyclopedic" is "comprehensive in terms of information." But please consider the artcile on its own merits, and if there is POV or OR here, please indicate where. --Rob Zako 20:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep:</b> Alana Grace first came to notice in 2002, at the 2nd. Annual Nashville Grammy Showcase, when she was a finalist in a competition hosted by the Nashville Chapter of the Recording Academy, chosen by music industry professionals from a field of 500 entries. <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/200211/20021114a.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmi.com/news/200211/20021114a.asp" rel="nofollow">[51]</a></p>
<p>In 2005, she had a song, “Black Roses Red”, on the CD soundtrack for the movie, “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” (a movie which grossed over $40 M). This soundtrack included a number of well-known artists such as Chantal Kreviazuk and Natasha Bedingfield. Reviewers singled out Alana Grace’s song as one of the stronger tracks on the CD.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/B0009A3ZYY/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/102-4925114-1044129?ie=UTF8&amp;customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&amp;n=5174" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/B0009A3ZYY/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/102-4925114-1044129?ie=UTF8&amp;customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&amp;n=5174" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>Her song attracted widespread attention, to the point where she was invited to sing it on national television (on the “Today’s Rising Star” portion of the Today show on NBC): <a href="http://www.11alive.com/whatson/whatson_article.aspx?storyid=63686" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.11alive.com/whatson/whatson_article.aspx?storyid=63686" rel="nofollow">[53]</a></p>
<p>She is signed to Columbia records, and will be releasing her debut CD, “Break the Silence” in early 2007. Four of the songs that will be on that CD appear on her MySpace page, and have already been played over 400,000 times. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/alanagrace" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myspace.com/alanagrace" rel="nofollow">[54]</a></p>
<p>In the past year, she has given a number of concerts in California, <a href="http://www.avfair.com/PressRelease/ViewPressRelease.asp?PRelId=23" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avfair.com/PressRelease/ViewPressRelease.asp?PRelId=23" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and has done several charity concerts elsewhere, sharing the stage with artists such as Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.

<li><b>Comment</b> The competition in question was held by the Recording Academy, the same organization that runs the Grammy Awards. As noted on their web site: "The Academy has 12 regional chapters throughout the country. Members who join the Academy are placed in the chapter closest to their residence. Chapter offices represent the Academy on a local level by working within that region's music and recording communities and addressing its needs through education, advocacy, professional development and events. In addition, the Chapter serves as a conduit for other members to meet, network and address the concerns of the recording industry both nationally and locally." <a href="http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Chapters/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Chapters/" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> This competition was organized by the Nashville chapter of the Academy. Placement in the competition is determined by industry professionals, which can provide a major boost to the careers of the musicians. After being a finalist, Alana Grace secured a major label recording contract (Columbia) and placement on a major movie sound track. Her song was one of the emblematic songs in the movie and was also one of those featured in the publicity for the sound track. <a href="http://www.columbiarecords.com/sisterhood/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.columbiarecords.com/sisterhood/" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> Certainly, lots of people heard the song: the movie grossed $40 M at the box office, and $38 M in video rentals - not bad for a movie that was unabashedly a "chick flick" and which appealed mostly to a female audience. <a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_Fan_e564.html" title="User:JD Fan">User:JD_Fan</a> 15 December 2006</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> it doesn't have to mention that word, it is the same topic. You wouldn't expect academics to use slang. If you think it is an inappropriate title etc then suggest a renaming. The point is that this article is not about a silly word it is about the topic of "glogging" (god that's a lame name, Stephen Mann should be ashamed). You can't claim it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> with the shear amount of peer reviewed literature about the article. What this article could do more with would be an academic bibliography of glogging related articles but NONE of them have to mention the word glog or cyborglog. Side note did you check the academic literature? I did: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=glogging&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=glogging&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. There are mentions of glogging in academic literature (most from Stephen Mann) and these appeared in peer reviewed workshops. Thus there are multiple non-trivial real world mentions of <b>Glogging</b> thus it passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and since <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are satisfied so is criteria 1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 19:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added some specific papers to the external links sections which EXPLICITLY use the word Glogging! And one isn't written by Mann or has Mann as a co author. It is in a trustable trade journal, IEEE Multimedia and is a reliable secondary source. This combined with all the peer reviewed work makes this term both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 19:23, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So you admit that this particular word ("CyborgLog", the one we are discussing about, not "Clogging" or whatever) is just blogger's lingo and it does have no merit whatsoever on its own. - <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemmina_5bd1.html" title="User:Femmina">Femmina</a> 19:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> no I've looked at the articles and they specifically mention Cyblorglog; glog is a shortened term for it. You should go and look at the articles too. What I said before about the topic etc was before I went out and found the new references which specifically mention the name cyborglog and use the name. The article has changed, please evaluate the changes w.r.t. the policies. You still have yet to deal with the new references. Look if you want to carry out this <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemmina_5bd1.html" title="User:Femmina">war on blogs</a> you have to use <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> but in case where all three of these have been established you will be arguing outside of Wikipedia policy to delete materials. Unfortunately for you and your cause (which seems like reasonable cause since more blogging related pages are vanity anyways) you have chosen a topic with the academic backing of at least 1 tenured professor who's work has been written about in notable academic magazines, journals and conferences. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 20:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is inappropriate for this topic, this is a word and thus we should be discussing if it meets <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The topic is verifiable there are papers which both use the term and are about the term. These references are not studies about the word but about the topic using this word as the topic. So the debatable part here is if the last reference not written by S Mann is just using the term or is about the term. The term is verfiable but the widespread use of the term is questionable as most literature is associated with S Mann and the University of Toronto. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 20:22, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Dark Star Publications" seems like a rather obvious name, and I would be somewhat surprised if it turned out that the one you have found records of is the same one that published the Dark Zen-related books.

<dd>They did like to publish "dark" stuff, though. They might have made an exception. Since they emphasize the "dark" over and over, I don't think it's a stretch to say that "Dark Zen" could be published by this company; in light of the publisher's focus the collision of the two names doesn't appear to indicate anything "obvious" to me.

<p>Non-notable vapormobile. Back in July, a company called Barabus Supercars Limited brought an automobile to the 2006 <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_International_Motor_Show_80eb.html" title="British International Motor Show">British International Motor Show</a>. They claimed that the vehicle's twin-turbocharged V8 produced 1005 horsepower, making it the fastest car in the world, and would be available for less than half the price of the <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugatti_Veyron_c450.html" title="Bugatti Veyron">previous fastest car</a>. They announced that they were taking orders and then promptly disappeared off the face of the earth; their home page went down in mid-August and there has been no news about them or the car since. Interiot did some interesting research and posted about it on the talk page. The whole thing appears to be either a hoax or a failed business venture, and not a notable one. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's pretty simple. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> says "scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place". The car has never been certain to be released... it's a new unknown manufacturer, making unprecedented price and horsepower claims, and there's been no mainstream coverage of the car. What minimally reliable sources we have say that the car was scheduled to be released last month, yet in the the four months since that was written, the manufacturer's website has gone down and there's been no news since. If any reliable sources ever show up indicating the car is actually going to be released, then the article should be undeleted, but unless that happens, it's a guessing game. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 23:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree it's probably more likely than not that Barabus TKR will never be released. Nonetheless, we should still have an article on it—it appeared at a notable motor show with some press coverage and was never seen again. That makes it a notable hoax/failure—notable enough, at least, to have an article for people who might turn to Wikipedia and ask, "Whatever happened to the Barabus TKR?" <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 01:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you just said, we don't really know what happened to it. We may have a hunch, but there are no reliable sources that we can use to present any firm conclusions. (even saying "it was never heard from again" is just a little <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>, since no RS's have repeated that, and if an RS ever did publish it, at least they'd call the company first to confirm. It's remotely possible that Barabus is quietly negotiating with rich middle-eastern buyers, or an auto magazine could have recently published some information and the people maintaining this article haven't run across it yet.)</li>
<li>Also, the article has always had a dearth of reliable sources, so I'm not sure how much there is to keep. I think <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> supports trimming back some of the article. Would an acceptable alternative be to merge what's left to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_International_Motor_Show_80eb.html" title="British International Motor Show">British International Motor Show</a>? (the only clearly independently verified RS information pertains to the prototype's appearance at the motor show anyway, it's not clear whether any of the other information is verified, or whether it's just regurgitated information directly from Barabus) --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 02:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We could use Waybackmachine to source the website going offline. I wouldn't support a merge because this seems like a decently short article anyway. Even as is, it reflects the lack of evidence of anything pertaining to this car post-August. In short, Wikipedia is more informative, more useful, and just plain better with this article than it would be without. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 03:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> It's certainly conceivable, since somebody decided it was worth an article. He's definitely a bit player in American history, and if you think that people don't come to Wikipedia looking up bit players, you're mistaken. More to the point, your hypothetical doesn't work. Mentioning his father's name and occupation, which helps to indicate his social status, is a far, far cry from including a geneology. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 05:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most of the stuff in this article is real but it's so poorly written. They were a band from Newmarket, Ontario. They had a few singles, which got a lot of airplay in Canada around 1997 to 1999.

It is important to consider that some topics on wikipedia are bound to evolve backwards from more purely <i>interesting</i> points, finding their way to <i>important</i> collections, rather than from a typical root of <i>important</i> topic to <i>interesting</i> branches. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarBaCoN_6d30.html" title="User talk:WarBaCoN">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WarBaCoN_2028.html" title="Special:Contributions/WarBaCoN">contribs</a>) 06:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Trivial fancruft. The Simpsons are clearly one of the most notable cartoon shows ever, but that doesn't mean we need articles for every conceivable aspect of the show.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Simpsons is one of the most popular, long running television series in history; it has cultural value, so of course many aspects of the show will be examined. Silly for some?

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>The very reference</i> given repeatedly as reason for deletion makes no mention that this should be deleted (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>).. I can also quote from Wikipedia's own <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_22de.html" title="Help:Contents">Help Contents</a>, "Wikipedia has only a few limitations on what topics it covers. Recipes and how-to articles are generally not included, but just about everything else is. In which other encyclopedia do you find a list of sex positions, an article about nose picking or one about William Shatner's version of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds? As long as an article is verifiable, informative and neutral, it has a pretty good chance of being acceptable (see Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not for some other common rules). We strive to collect the sum of human knowledge, some of which may be trivial, but nevertheless is part of our cultures and our histories. Wiki is not paper - we need not worry about space constraints.".. As such, I must continue to protest against the argument for deletion. I implore anybody to argue on these basis, not simply their opinions on the relevance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarBaCoN_156b.html" title="User:WarBaCoN">WarBaCoN</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarBaCoN_6d30.html" title="User talk:WarBaCoN">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WarBaCoN_2028.html" title="Special:Contributions/WarBaCoN">contribs</a>) 21:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Capitalistroader raises a good point. Individual routes shift around to a limited extent, but the broad regions are static. From next year, Sydney will have 15 bus regions, each with a lead operator, at which time the bus route articles (excluding NightRide) can be retitled on the basis of region. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 08:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> When I put up the nomination, there was route information in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buses_in_Sydney_3ffd.html" title="Buses in Sydney">Buses in Sydney</a>. You can't delete it and say it's not duplicating. It is not fair to remove things there and then invalidates my reason for AfD here. I will, and only remove my nomination if you were to provide reasons and suggestions here, not editing nominated pages and invalidates some of my reasons. And how can other users keep track straight away if everyone has to trace back every edits you did whereas it'd be easier if you can put your suggestions here.</p>
<p>Anyway I've seen what you've done, and the article name has nothing whatsoever to do with infrastruture.

<dd>I get the sense that your problem is the presence of route numbers in the titles. I invite you to suggest alternatives, but I think the article names I've used are the best thing we have to divide the enormous network into manageable pieces. When the Unsworth reforms are complete, we can shift the articles into numbered MoT "metropolitan bus region" pages, and name them accordingly. In any case, a problem with the title is not grounds for deletion. One of our articles, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool-Parramatta_T-way_9bb7.html" title="Liverpool-Parramatta T-way">Liverpool-Parramatta T-way</a> could be accurately titled T80 bus route, Sydney, and that wouldn't fall foul of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.</dd>

<dd>Good this discussion is going somewhere positive. And for 300 series, as I pointed out, if the article is about "Buses in Eastern/South-eastern Sydney" there's nothing wrong with it. I know route numbers are based on regions, but to base on regions and to base on routes are different things which gives different ideas for other people (a page about routes vs a page about a certain region). I'm sure with an appropriate name for the pages (I'd suggest regions), then there's no need for deletion. <b>matt</b>-<i>(<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_ke_3624.html" title="User:Matt ke">my page</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt_ke_fffc.html" title="User talk:Matt ke">leave me a message</a>)</i> 17:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eastern Suburbs is an easy one. But Western Sydney is effectively half the city by population, and the South and South West, plus the Northern District centred on Ryde, lack proper common names. I'm more inclined to use consistent nomenclature. Next year, there will be scope to rename the pages after MoT regions. But these will probably take the form Metropolitan Bus Region 5, Sydney unless MoT comes up with names. Whether region numbers would be better than route numbers is debatable. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 18:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is trivia about three levels below acceptability in Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">since Wikipedia is not an indescriminate repository of information</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 17:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> I noticed this page yesterday, but didn't put it on my watch list because it had already been tagged and couldn't possibly last more than a few minutes. Imagine my surprise to see an AfD for it pop up on the recent changes list.

<dd>But that's the thing. How can you claim that this information is not beneficial to anybody, and still maintain the thought that a list of one-, two-, or three-letter English words is? How can you suggest that a list of musicians fitting into certain genres is more notable; that a list of video games beginning with the letter 'F' is more practical and useful than a list of bands containing the word "lemon"? I've already discovered many new bands because of this list; it's rather ignorant to state that nobody benefits from such lists. Now if you'd please quit making such empty claims and instead come up with actual support for your argument, perhaps a decision could finally be reached. And to the rest of you, quit shouting "sockpuppetry!" like mindless peons. It doesn't make you look intelligent or clever; just pretentious and clueless. Just because there are multiple people speaking out about an issue that YOU find to be "daft" doesn't mean that they're all the same person.

<dd>I don't believe I ever stated that a list of 3 letter English words is useful...although some boggle and/or scrabble players may disagree. If you honestly believe that a list by genre is the same as a list of bands that start with "lemon.", I really have no desire to try to reason with you. By the way, people wouldn't be crying sockpuppetry if there wasn't so much blatant sockpuppetry here. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 20:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In addition, I seriously doubt that the admin who will close this AfD would appreciate the personal attacks by AriasSerathe above. I'm also sure that the trolling for votes that is mentioned on the article's talk page will also be taken into consideration.

<dd>It didn't seem to me as though AriasSerathe (who had some very good points) was attacking anyone. Arias was merely stating that the continual calling of "sockpuppets!" was getting repetitive, as it had already been stated many times before.

<dd>Uh, "The Lemonheads" DOES start with the word Lemon. Words like "the" and "a" are removed from the beginning of a title when it comes to classifications. Let me guess, you look in the T section of an encyclopedia when looking for "The U.S. Civil War", or the T section of a rental store for "The Legend of Zelda"? 72.201.77.164 21:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Second nomination, malformed Afd, reason given by nominator when also prodding the article was "Violation of policy for biographies of living persons, previously deleted, not notable".

<dd>On reread, what I said was a bit confusing so to clarify: The orginal nominator <i>prod</i>-tagged the article and then transcluded a nomination onto the <i>Afd</i> page (I think s/he thought this would result in an Afd discussion). It should have resulted in a redlink, but since this article has been nominated before, instead it resulted in a repost of the <i>first</i> Afd discussion for this article, closed as a delete (?) back in March. I didn't want to delete the old nom without properly completing what I believe was the editor's original intention.

<li><b>Keep:</b> Leave this article please. Anyone who's run a major and historical organization such as Airspace, and run for office twice as a candidate for a major political party, has grounds for remaining on Wikipedia. Yes the article is not that well written, and some of it is pretty minor stuff in the greater scheme of things, but it's of interest to many. It could use more supportive links but not all history is out there on the Internet to link to. The Airspace and UBC issue is well known in the Vancouver media, getting at it unfortunatly means paid accounts. --RoxMorgan 06:41, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> With some of the other stuff I've seen on Wikipedia, I think one of the issues here is if Wikipedia will be a relevant and useful resource at the provincial and state level. Obviously, the action being taken by governments against tobacco companies, and the players in that issue are of value, as it is of value to note the thinkers and notables on urban transporation and other issues. It seems to me that this kind of approach is one of the key benefits of a web-based encyclopedia. Jaimie McEvoy, writer and historian. 205.250.151.188 00:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete:</b> (I am the original nominator) The non-notability of his political activities was established the last time this page was deleted. The non-notability of his activism is established by the fact that there is no independent information on him anywhere that I can find, only articles written by him and published (mainly) on his own page. The primary criterion for notability is <b>whether the subject of an article has been the subject of non-trivial published works by multiple separate sources that are independent of that subject</b> (user:uncle G/on notability). Under this test, Broughton clearly fails. Notability is not having a lot of friends, or being a part of an important cause. I appreciate that the above commentors value the subject's contribution to their lives and their cause, but this is not the criterion that determines whether or not this page should stay or go. I note en passant that it is also a clear violation of the policies on autobiography and on deleted pages. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwoods_70b8.html" title="User:Alexwoods">Alexwoods</a> 03:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is the second nomination, but virtually all keep opinions in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_unusual_deaths_0797.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of unusual deaths">original nomination</a> were backed by simple "<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a>" arguments. No matter how "interesting" this list is, it is theoretically <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> (not the fact that these people died, but that their deaths ought to be considered "unusual" and therefore worthy of inclusion).

<ul>
<li>Fortunately, I never said anything about the difficulty of its maintenance. Please consider <i>my</i> argument, which is that the list is <b>theoretically</b> unverifiable. This is a direct appeal to Wikipedia policy (unlike yet another "I like it" argument). <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 02:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Mortality statistics are available and from those I think you can determine whether a death is unusual. Granted the most unusual deaths are likely caused by rare diseases like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progeria.html" title="Progeria">progeria</a>, but still I think it's doable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what mortality rate is to be set for a particular circumstance of death? Is it 5% of all deaths (millions to add to the list)? 1% (still millions)? .01% (we might be getting to hundreds of thousands at this point...for each circumstance)? Even if there are such accessible figures, there is no way to set a non-arbitrary standard based on them.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, statistics exist on <i>cause of death</i>, not "circumstances concurrent with or immediately preceding the death." For example, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXI_6035.html" title="Pope John XXI">Pope John XXI</a>'s cause of death is getting crushed by debris (or maybe it was just asphyxiation). He shares this fate with millions. What is "unusual," I'm assuming, is that he's a pope and it happened in scientific laboratory. Ergo, he's on the list. But such conjunctions of circumstances can make anyone's death unusual: so and so's great grandfather was the only white, male, left-handed American citizen who died in the state of Texas on a Thursday afternoon by drowning in a body of water containing more than 38<a href="../../../p/p/b/Ppb.html" title="Ppb">ppb</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzene.html" title="Benzene">benzene</a>. Grandpa now has instant parity with the Pope.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if one might then say that only notable people should be included on the list, then this doesn't help much. Like with the pope and non-notable grandfather examples, it merely takes sufficiently bold research to include every dead, notable person by virtue of conjuncting enough circumstances roughly concurrent with his or her death to make it also unique. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 06:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree there's no way to set some objective standard where an algorithm decides what goes on this list; it will have subjectivity and concerns about POV.

<li><b>Delete</b> Unmaintainable; I feel the threshhold for an article like this is that it should be exhaustible and that it shouldn't be too long. This seems to fail that. Furthermore, its inherently POV and likely has OR problems as well. What is 'unusual' to one person may not seem so to another. One may try to counter this by defining unusual as being "not many people have died this way" but surely there are countless numbers of ways in which only one or two people in all of history have died. There is no real way to have concrete criteria that avoid POV and OR issues. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and The Way. Amusing and/or tragic as many of these deaths are, it's unencyclopedic to link them in such a way. A large number of these deaths only become "unusual" because they happen to have befallen a prominent person or because they occurred in an unexpected manner (there's an American President listed who died of indigestion, which was probably a common enough way to die at the time, but presumably his death is "unusual" because <i>he</i> died of it or because it's not something that <i>we</i> tend to die from or whatever), which opens up more cans of worms than can be gainfully dealt with. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Change name to List of notable deaths</b>. Agree with nominator that "unusual" implies this is inherently POV. However, this information is encyclopedic and should be kept. "Notable" leaves less room for POV as there are wikipedia policies defining what notable means, including requiring things like third party sources, which all entries on this list should have. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 10:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that that really helps either. People are notable - and many of the people in this list are patently so - but their deaths are not necessarily. As I read it, "notable deaths" would only cover the small sub-group of people on this list who are not notable for any reason but the fact that they died in a possibly unusual manner (the pizza deliveryman with the timebomb and so on). The majority of this list is more along the lines of "List of the manners of death of notable people", since the actual fact that Pope John XXI was crushed to death (for example) only becomes notable when it was <i>Pope John XXI</i> being crushed to death and not anyone else. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>None of them are. Or all of them are, depending on how conjunction-happy you want to get. Ray Chapman died of a crushed skull. Millions and millions have died of this. But wait, he died of a crushed skull–crushed by a baseball! We've narrowed it down to (say) hundreds, and he's, perhaps, the only notable person to die of a crushed skull, crushed by a baseball (though I'm going to go ahead and doubt this, too). <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>'s official cause of death is listed as both congestive heart failure <i>and</i> pulmonary edema. Either one of these will probably include dozens of notable people. But <i>both together</i> narrows it down to, as far as I know, just him. He's not on the list now, though, so what an exclusion this is! Again, there is absolutely no possible way to prevent everyone from getting on this list.

<dd>Yet again, these are <i>examples</i> of allegedly unusual deaths, not a method to determine whether one is. Not one person voting keep and no one editing the article has been able to provide a method. No one has even given an <i>arbitrary</i> standard, which would at least be a start. The reason for this is simple: there's no possible way. When people use the term, what they really mean is that they find a death and the circumstances surrounding it <i>interesting</i>. So, technically, the article title should be "List of interesting deaths."

<dd>It doesn't need to be "alleged." Some forms of death truly are rare and this can be statistically determined.

<dd>Why is a death caused by medical malpractice (to take one example) even "unusual" or "interesting"? The sad truth of the matter is that there are more deaths caused this way than I think anyone would want to contemplate. Indeed, not too far north of where I live, there's a particular doctor who's accused of causing a phenomenal number of deaths in this manner. The only "unusual" or "interesting" aspect of a President dying that way is that (much like our crushed Pope), it was a <i>President</i> who died that way and not some average Joe. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:03, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> - Explain how unusual is strictly POV. It can be used objectively, since unusual states these deaths do not normally occur. The list is maintainable, since unusual deaths, by nature of being unusual are not happening in such a large number (especially in terms of actually being notable) that it is impossible to keep up. Now to answer some concerns that anyone's death can be made unusual - that is just absurd. The circumstances you listed, drowning in a lake (we're assuming your great grandfather wasn't doing anything incredibly strange) is not unusual. Even with the modifiers you presented, it doesn't become unusual. The modifiers don't change the fact he died in a usual manner. Just because there isn't a strict set of standards doesn't make it POV, it just means any strict set of standards would fail the article. For instance, look at the listing for David Bailey. Is that not unusual. Could you, under any circumstances, claim that dying by having a rat urinating on someone not be unusual. Not hypothetically. In reality, can you claim that, and if you were, could you explain how that is usual. Many of these deaths are notable enough to be passed down through history or be reported by news, so clearly, the list has a lot of merit. --THollan 23:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In which case, the question becomes at which point we say that a given death is "unusual". In Bailey's case, I'm no medical specialist, but we'd need to see just how common an infection of leptospirosis is (let alone one which turns fatal). The article on that condition implies that vets have been known to get it, but actually digging up some statistics would be the key. Is an unusual cause of death something which only 5 people have been the victim of, or is the number more like 100 or more? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the specific cause of death may not be unusual, but the circumstances (i.e., the rat urinating on him being what caused his death), would be what makes it unusual. To me, the biggest problem with trying to come up with a set standard for what is a usual death and what is an unusual death is that it would be automatically fail the purposes of what it is trying to validate. It also ignores the fact that it is either the cause of death, or the circumstances leading to death that make it unusual. You can't say that many people are dying from nose bleeds. If that was the case, we'd be dropping like flies. --THollan 07:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> In some cases, there are standard brief reference sources, and one with an appropriately concise coverage can be chosen, &amp; an article can be limited to the ones in there--or to some selection thereof, or to at least all the ones in there plus what one can justify.

Just because an article survives AfD at one point doesn't mean that, some time later, it can't be renominated and even deleted. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - people forget that "unusual" is a workable criterion for matters such as dying. If more subjective than others, the list is not as subjective as to validate its deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 03:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Vehement keep</b> - I admit, I like it. It's entertaining. Furthermore, while of necessity not based on as strict criteria as other articles, the deaths listed here are generally sourced and generally unusual to the general reader. For me, that's a good enough reason to keep it. Plus, I might point out that the list has undergone extensive pruning in the past few weeks, so there are people who actively maintain it and prevent it from spinning out of control. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 05:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I've been trying to edit this list for a week or two now. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think we'll be able to iron down clear criteria for adding something to the list or not. It's too soft an idea that you can't really put a clear line on what belongs and what doesn't. If some of the people voting keep can go to the lists' talk page and help iron out criteria, I'd say keep. But with it's current status, I'll have to say delete. <a href="../../../d/s/t/User%7EDstanfor_ce2d.html" title="User:Dstanfor">Dstanfor</a> 15:52, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, what can you define as 'unusual'?

<dd>I'm glad you asked. Unusual is usually defined by frequency of occurance. It's pretty easy to set that objectively say, by using the 1/10,000 figure as a cutoff. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 20:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See the above discussion. Aside from the problem of arbitrarily choosing a cutoff point (note that 1/10,000 will include every lightning death in the history of the human species), there is the issue of what counts as a relevant circumstance to the death, which are chosen or not chosen depending on how interesting they make the description of a death sound. All of this is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and that, of course, can play no part in an article. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 22:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really understand how it is original research and not just making an editorial decision. From what I gather, original research is me publishing my own findings on Wikipedia, so let's just say - percentage of people who die when they suffer a nosebleed. Edit - Also, just because there is some subjectivity to the matter doesn't mean it is not suitable for Wikipedia. For instance, a debate on notability, you have are making a subjective opinion at the end of the day. The point is, the list isn't subjective. Unusual isn't the same as strange. We could safely say it would be unusual for my speakers to burst into flames while playing music at a low level. --THollan 02:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>depends on what you're doing for criteria for inclusion. if you use the statistical method suggested, to prevent original research, someone's going to have to find a source listing unusual death percentages. If they have to find many sources and combine them into one article, that's seems like original research to me.
<dl>
<dd>Then virtually all articles are OR as they may require "finding many sources and combining them in an article." Still possibly a different compromise could be done. In the media <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22unusual+death%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22unusual+death%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">"unusual death"</a> is a reported term. So I suppose we could say "List of deaths deemed unusual by the media" as our opinion of what's unusual would not be taken into account. (This seems unnecessary to me, but I'll put it out there)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is getting silly, IMHO. There's no algorithm that will determine what goes in and what doesn't in some "objective" manner; the consensus of people who work on this article is the best we can do.
