I would actually delete all <i>List of xxxan footballers</i> articles for the same reason. A listing scheme for internationally-capped players (e.g.<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sweden_international_footballers_aca8.html" title="List of Sweden international footballers">List of Sweden international footballers</a>) is a better way of doing things, as there is an objective and verifiable standard for inclusion. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 09:54, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I didn't attack you, I asked you (fairly politely, in fact) not to advance false arguments in an articles for deletion discussion. That's a pretty reasonable thing to request, I believe. You said <i>no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players</i> - which is a directly false statement. If you accidentally misevaluated the article, then I'll apologise about saying you did deliberately what you may have done in error. It didn't occur to me you might simply have what appeared to me to be a straightforward issue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is my comment "no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players" false? Can an opinion even be "true" or "false"? What does the list (in its present state) do, that the category doesn't? And calling someone a liar is not justified by saying it nicely. You could just have asked "could you please clarify what you mean by saying that the list has no use whatsoever?", and I would have gladly answered you. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 14:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Opinions can be true or false. I can say <i>My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative</i> - my opinion is then false. The statement <i>no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players</i> is false by the same virtue. If your claim is that you didn't mean what you wrote, I'll happily retract my earlier statement - for the time being, however, I can only respond to what you say, not what you mean. As for the usefulness of lists, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> - it articulates them better than I can. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, an opinion can't be false. If I say, "My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative", you can't say that my opinion is false, because I (in this example) really do believe that "x + y ≠ y + x". <i>An <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a> is not a fact, because opinions are either not falsifiable, or the opinion has not been proven or verified.</i> I stand by my first post. This list does not improve Wikipedia in any way that the category does not. That's what I mean. Now tell me why that's wrong, and plase do not answer with "read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>", as I have no idea what specific line or paragraph you refer to. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 18:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ironically, on the issue of whether opinions can be false, the opinion that they can't be is false. You can believe an opinion and it can still be false (in fact, I'd guess that every last person believes something that's factually inaccurate). One can certainly take an opinion on a question that's falsifiable. My experience tells me that if I merely copy &amp; paste <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> here I'll get slapped for being uncivil, but I'm not sure how else to explain the usefulness of lists. Lists serve as navigation aids, as growth structures and can organise a subject in a way categories can't - this is basically a stub-class list, but <i>stub</i> isn't a criterion for deletion (though I do see it used as such surprisingly often). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not an opinion that opinions can't be false, it is a fact. So, what you're basically saying is that all lists should be kept, as they "serve as navigation aids, as growth structures and can organise a subject in a way categories can't"? The category also serves as navigation aid, and regarding the growth structures and organisation of a subject, I see no difference whatsoever between List of Belgian footballers and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Category%7EBelgian_footballers_30da.html" title="Category:Belgian footballers">Category:Belgian footballers</a>. They both contain blue links only. They both contain the same names. They both list the names alphabetically. Now please tell me again what in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> applies to this case. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 20:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really - lists need to be of encyclopaedic value, be verifiable, et cetera. The same standards that apply to non-list articles apply to list articles. But it's unreasonable to hold articles to a <i>higher</i> standard just because they're lists. As for how much use you personally find an article to be - I don't see why that's an important consideration. There are tons of useless articles (to me) in Wikipedia - I certainly wouldn't vote to delete them all. As for whether opinions can be wrong, it certainly is a fact that they can. My commutativity of addition example demonstrates that. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your comparison fails. I did not say "this is not a useful list", I said "this list is useful, but we already have a category that does the exact same thing, and it makes this list superfluous". See the difference? On opinions, I entitle you to the opinion of believing that opinions can be true or false, but it is a fact that they can't. Citing <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a> once again: <i>An opinion is not a fact, because opinions are either not falsifiable, or the opinion has not been proven or verified.</i> Or <a href="http://www.worsleyschool.net/socialarts/factopinion/factopinion.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worsleyschool.net/socialarts/factopinion/factopinion.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>: <i>A statement of opinion expresses an attitude toward something – it makes a judgment, view, or conclusion, or gives an opinion that cannot be proven true or false.</i> Or <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0STR/is_6_108/ai_54169026" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0STR/is_6_108/ai_54169026" rel="nofollow">this page</a>: <i>A statement of opinion can be very well thought out but cannot be proved true or false - it is always open to debate.</i> You mix up the opinion with the possible inclusion of a statement of fact in the opinion. I can never be proven wrong when saying "My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative", because you can't prove a person's opinion wrong. The only thing you can do is prove that the statement of fact contained in the opinion is wrong or right, but that still does not prove the opinion wrong or right. Either way, I don't see the point of this discussion, and I still haven't seen any explanation for why you called me a liar. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 22:58, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, by that definition of opinion, <i>this list is useful,</i> <b>but we already have a category that does the exact same thing</b>, <i>and it makes this list superfluous</i> does not have an opinion in bold, but a factually incorrect basis for your opinion (since that statement is falsifiable and already shown to be false). You labelled a falsifiable statement that had already been falsified an opinion, I spoke with the same usage of the word - I'm not sure there's much motivation to muddy the issue now. As for the idea that <i>an opinion can be an easily falsifiable statement, but can't be proven right or wrong</i> - that is what comes out of the north end of a south facing bull. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
