<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>delete all</b>.</p>
<p>The questions here are still complex, but there seems to be a strong consensus for one thing: the bulk of the information in these articles constitutes a "game guide", which Wikipedia explicitly is not. A smaller article listing the maps with a brief description would be allowable under the consensus I'm seeing below; individual articles about each level would not be, even in the case of maps which may be more notable than others.</p>
<p>I read "transwiki" as including both the statements: (1) "these articles don't belong here" and (2) "these articles might be useful to this other wiki". Thus, in my view, the discussion below indicates that there is a strong consensus that the information doesn't belong here. I am definitely willing to temporarily undelete in order to help someone perform the transwiki.

<p>This discussion is about whether or not the individual counter-strike maps, <i>as a class</i>, should be wholly deleted. The individual merits or demerits of any single map is not relevant (that would require its own individual AfD). We are talking about the <i>principle</i> of having individual counter-strike maps... whether that principle is in violation of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy, and whether <i>any</i> individual counter-strike map could be considered notable.</p>
<p>These articles are being considered for deletion because of the following policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> says under subpoint 8 that some things that should be deleted are</li>

<dd><b>Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( <a href="../../../l/e/g/Wikipedia%7ELegal_disclaimer_595c.html" title="Wikipedia:Legal disclaimer">legal</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedical_disclaimer_7dd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer">medical</a>, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_draw_a_diagram_with_Dia_4471.html" title="Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia">Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia</a>.

<p><br />
Additionally there are two supporting reasons, but <b>not actual wikipedia policy</b> by themselves (as stated clearly on their respectable pages):</p>
<ul>
<li>These articles are <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a></li>
<li>These articles are <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Many of these articles also had a discussion in the following AfDs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_De_dust_2bda.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/De dust">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/De_dust</a> - May 19, 2006 (no consensus)</li>

</ul>
<p><br />
Please keep in mind that referring to debates that resulted in "no consensus" is not a sufficient reason for counting either a <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b> vote. Neither does it count to refer to essays that are not actual policy (like <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>). And in this peculiar instance, the nominator is actually opposed to deletion, so "per nom" votes would be ambiguous and also not countable. (You can find my reasoning next to my vote below.)</p>
<p>As nominator, I will be informing all users from the 3 aforementioned AfDs who participated with more than 2 edits, as they will likely be interested in this discussion.</p>
<p>Closing admin, if the result is to delete, take note that many of the articles have screenshots and images of the maps. Fair use may expire on these images. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 18:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as nominator. I am one of the main contributors to the articles in question and the reason I am putting up this AfD is because we have been bombarded by AfD requests that have all resulted in "no consensus". But each of those discussions didn't directly face what I consider to be the main issue: whether or not the principle of individual CS maps is in violation of the policy. Other things were grouped in (like surfing) which muddled the main issue. And as the closing admin stated in the latest AfD, a vote of "no consensus" doesn't mean anything. I feel we need a consensus before I continue working on these articles, because either (A) a <i>delete</i> will be delete them and then I can't work on them or (B) a <i>keep</i> will make them immune from the threat of a future AfD. Since the discussion is still fresh in many people's minds, we should try to settle this once and for all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So much for my reasons for nominating. Now for my reasons for keeping.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the "instruction manuals" violation, I maintain simply that these articles do not constitute an instruction manual. Take <a href="../../../c/s/_/Cs_italy.html" title="Cs italy">Cs italy</a> as an example. There is nothing in that article that explains how to play the map. In fact in the game Counter-Strike there never is any one "right" way to play a map. The game is exclusively multiplayer, and because either team can do an infinite number of things to which their opponents have to adjust, there is no possible "walkthrough", or "how-to" beat a map. What the article has is (A) a description/history of the map, (B) an overhead view of the map, (C) some screenshots, (D) professional criticism against the map being balanced for both sides, (E) listing of some trivia regarding the map, including the translation of an opera song that can be heard in one section. None of those five constitute an instruction manual for anything. They are a simple description, much like what we find in the article about the Roman <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colosseum.html" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a>... (A) description/history (B) blueprint (C) pictures (D) architectual criticism (E) trivia. The latter article is not an instruction manual, and neither is the former.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "not notable," I maintain that the article's notability can be plainly ascertained from a count of users daily playing on public servers (something like over 1 million), or the hits from a Google search (de_dust = over 1 million). In the last AfD an argument was presented that this sort of counting doesn't automatically justify an article as notable. He has an office by a street that probably sees more than a million cars a day, but that doesn't make an article on the street notable. My response is that yes an article about that street would be notable... if he put together something like the 5 sections I included in the last paragraph. If he merely described the road, then it might have AfD issues (although I haven't read any policy or guideline that would immediately sink it). But if in addition he researched the local newspaper archives and dug up a history of the road, described the points of its uniqueness, and uploaded a couple pics and map of its location, it would clearly be notable. "Not notable" violations are things like "shirts in David Bergan's closet"... not things that a large part of the public encounters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "cruft," I have 2 arguments. First, that cruft is a highly subjective term. Any specialist understands that things related to his specialty are more important to him than the average person. It doesn't matter if your specialty is fishing or quantum physics, there are a certain realm of topics that will be very interesting to you, that wouldn't be interesting to my mom. To accuse another's specialty topic as being mere cruft, shows little more than the obvious fact that you don't have an appreciation for that specialty. Counter-strike, being a world-wide professional sport now, has its realm of specialty, just as baseball or football. My second objection comes from a plain reading of the cruft page. That page defines cruft as "of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans," which in the interest of these maps is simply untrue. So many people play these maps that it is impossible to consider it a "small population."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And finally for those considering a <i>merge</i> vote, I respond that there is simply too much content for one article to cover it all. Discussing the uniqueness, history, and trivia of 22 maps (and hopefully screenshots, and overhead maps) would make a convoluted mess. I hope I have persuaded you to keep.

<dl>
<dd>We're voting on the concept of "individual counter-strike maps, <i>as a class</i>." Sure some of the articles may be riddled with original research, but I don't see how the concept itself can be considered original reseach. Thus, an original research argument could work for an AfD of a specific article or two (or even, hypothetically, for every single one of these maps), but we would have to consider each article separately to do that. It just doesn't seem possible that the class itself could be considered original research. But maybe I'm missing something.

<li><strike>Keep all</strike> per nom. In the previous AfD I said to transwiki them to Wikibooks, but I'm led to believe that Wikibooks will not accept this sort of article. They should then remain in WP. I would recommend an individual article for the major maps such as the dust maps, and a general article for less well known maps, but as far as notability goes I have a hard time believing that these are not notable or that they are game guides. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 19:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge into a single article or list</b>. While Counterstrike itself is quite notable, in all honesty, how much of that article information isn't just gameplay guide and padding?

<li><b>Keep</b> for all of them. I think David Bergan has made rational and reasonable arguments to keep the articles. Claims of original search, while inviting debate, are not valid. No new idea or assertion is being made by these articles, and it is common practice in video game articles (also articles for films, books, TV shows, etc.) to draw directly from the media to write the article. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There <i>is</i> a difference between taking text or speech directly from a source (such as a novel or TV interview) and the issues discussed here.

<li><s><b>Strong keep</b></s> There is an article about every episode of Season 5 of 24. Yet we are debating to delete pages that explain _the most played_ maps in computer FPS's. These maps are ones that <b>ALL</b> serious gamers know about/heard of. There is massive ammounts of culture, references, and history behind these maps. They make up the heart of CounterStrike, the most popular first person shooter out there. And you guys want to delete that, yet making a page for _every_ episode of 24 and Simpsons is okay? Just think about what you guys are talking about, this is a ridicoulous arguement, you might as well delete about a 3rd of Wikipedia if you delete these. You have to understand, de_dust is the most recognized computer map of all time. Any serious gamer who sees it can easily say "Counter-Strike". When they reach this kind of popularity, it _IS_ worth keeping. There are articles on wikipedia that are a lot worse and need a lot more attention than this. In no way should these be merged or deleted, it would violate the goal of wikipedia in many ways, because these maps truly do mark a serious spot in computer gaming. Individual maps definately DO have their own cultural impact, ask any serious gamer about dust or aztek. Everyone who here is saying that this is becoming a game guide I guess is not a CounterStrike gamer, because if they were, they would know that each of these maps adds their own bit of tactics, ideas, and culture to Counter Strike.

<p>Comment: All seriouse gamers? I don't know any Counter-Strike maps, but I am a very serious gamer and have been all my life. Maybe you should say all serious <i>Counter-Strike</i> fans know those maps. Having pages for indivdual maps is like having seperate pages for levels in a game or for different chapters in a book. Just put all those maps on one page with a short description of them, they are not notabel enought to be on thei own. Better yet, just delete them. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As someone who just went on Wikipedia to read this stuff. Counterstrike is one of the most popular online games, and these maps have been played by millions. I believe the popularity, the resourceful-and-thoroughness of many of them articles. To me, there's no doubt that de_dust, for example, is notable. Information about maps is not "a indiscriminate collection of information" (football grounds don't get deleted, as a contrast to a "real life" sport - <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> gets less Google hits than <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_dust.html" title="De dust">de_dust</a>2), and these articles don't contain walkthroughs. They contain information on something that is notable. I also don't believe transferring to an external Wiki is the answer either - that's just tantamount to deletion but without any conviction. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 21:05, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Number of google hits is not an actual answer to the question if its should be included in an encyclopedia. Google has also 331.000 recipies for piña cola, nevertheless a recipie should not be included to wikipedia.

<li><i>Comment</i> - I realise this (although I only count 19,000 hits for "pina cola" as a term - I believe that maybe if it received 331,000 hits about a craze, it honestly might be worth an article, like drinks such as a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan_%28cocktail%29.html" title="Cosmopolitan (cocktail)">Cosmopolitan</a> have an article but no recipe), but it proves that something /is/ notable, is widely known (and, as such, people may search out an article on it) and as such not as fancrufty (Millions of pages really don't imply "cruft" to me). I honestly don't believe this is anymore fancruft or non-notable than an article about a sports stadium, which everyone would agree abnout it's inclusion. Saying that information here is making another Wiki redundant isn't of importance to this debate in the least - it does not add anything to the debate IMO. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 21:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Google states that it is not not notable (they exist, they are varifiable and they appear widespread all over the internet). It helps show that these things exist, it's notable, and it's all over the internet. There's several pages about dust2. Maybe you should read it yourself? "<i>It is also used to ascertain whether a topic is of sufficiently broad interest to merit inclusion in the wiki</i>". IMO, it does ascertain this. I mean, I could do the Google groups test too and several of these maps appear hundreds of times (thousands in the case of dust2). These things /are/ talked about, well known and are not fly by nights, and as such /are/ notable topics, and as such do deserve a page.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Despite the fact that many people see no use for these articles, I don't believe that every article needs to appeal to everyone. These are not game-guides, these are descriptions of popular levels and what is controversial/complained about/unique about them. Sure these maps may provide very little use to people who have never played counterstrike (provoking a call of -cruft) but they provide just as much information as episode articles would to people who have never seen the show.

<li>Individual articles about episodes are just as bad&#160;;) To honor encycopedian style, one merged article would be far nicer. And as I like articles that are graphically beautified, I do think for these maps this has been overdone, 1 - max 2 screenshots per map should be enough!...

<li>I can't comment on the notability of these maps, since I am not a Counter-Strike player.

The history about the various versions and comparisons of the map moving from game to game in the CS series is keep-worthy, though it could use some more sources and cleaning up. So yes, in principle, a noteworthy map should be covered by Wikipedia, but as for the others, they should be individually AfD'd (and if notable enough, given a chance to be edited into proper articles, otherwise merged). --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 07:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd just like to point out one thing. If you don't like an article, you have the choice to not read it. It's not hurting anybody by existing, and if people are interested, it's there. If I'm not interested in reading an article, I <i>don't read it</i>. As for the arguments for moving it to a CS-specific wiki, I believe that having it in Wikipedia is a better idea. What I stated above, combined with the fact that Wikipedia is a central source of information. People will tend to come to Wikipedia for information before they go to a topic-specific site. This holds true especially if they're just looking for an overview. I stay away from the computer game wikis because I really don't want to read about strategies. These articles provide a decent general overview of the maps, as well as some little-known facts. --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarco_d844.html" title="User:Varco">Varco</a> 06:21, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>With the same argumentation, if you don't like it, don't read it, I could also make an article about my hairdresser around the next corner, an article about the child of my syster and so on, however all this contents are non-encyclopediac and would definitly be deleted. Wikipedia for people looking for an overview... aren't the 24 maps with 3-4 screen shots, map critism and recensions not much too detailied information?
