<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> There appears to be a lot of work going on in the area (e.g Googling Neanderthal+autism gives 15,000 hits). That suggests the topic has moved from original research into popular culture and merits an article. Testability is an issue but the article does list predictions. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 13:01, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and possibly rewrite</b> The article was original research in 2001, but this research is my own research. Since then it has spread to a large part of the autistic community, and have probably influenced radical sites like AspiesForFreedom. There is also a link from their <a href="http://aspiesforfreedom.com/wiki/index.php?title=Asperger%27s_Syndrome" class="external text" title="http://aspiesforfreedom.com/wiki/index.php?title=Asperger%27s_Syndrome" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>. Even if the theory is considered to be controlversial, I think it does merit an independent article. Originally a link to the theory was part of both the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> page and the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger.html" title="Asperger">Asperger</a> page but was deleted by people not liking the ideas. The theory have several thousand visits each month which means it is quite popular. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:47, 10 September 2005 (UTC

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Massively rewrite and rename</b> if the conjecture's creator can provide evidence that this is an actual defensible belief. If there is any actual scientific research, it's not apparent within the article. One cannot call this a "theory" as much as a conjecture, as it is a proposed answer unsupported, apparently, by any actual data other than hearsay and self-selected Web site surveys. I tried to remove the blatantly unsourced stuff... which doesn't leave much. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:30, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Original research. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_syndrome.html" title="Asperger's syndrome">Asperger's syndrome</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> are each diagnoses of combinations of a wide range of behaviors with different causes, and are criticised as being vague and overdiagnosed. Both are characteristic of developmental delay. Furthermore, PubMed (a scientific journal search service) lists 0 hits for "autism neanderthal". Therefore, this is almost certainly false.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Certainly controversial at best and quite likely false (or untestable and I'm an unreconstructed Popperian myself) but nevertheless I feel has achieved a degree of notability in popular culture that may justify an article. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 20:33, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> A problem is the testability. It is the large number of traits displayed by autistics that cannot be explained with any other consistent theory that is the best evidences. Somebody claimed above that autism has many causes, but this is not a supported theory at all. This follows more from a lack of a theory that could explain more than one trait at a time than from any supporting evidence. I've added a section with the best of the supportive evidences. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Many of those "hits" are either mirrors of Wikipedia, someone's personal Web site or pages that have absolutely nothing to do with any such theory and just happen to contain the two words somewhere. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 00:59, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, Travis, but that's just not true. The very first hit is titled "The Neanderthal theory of autism, Asperger and ADHD", the second is "Neanderthal Theory of Autistic Spectrum", the third is a blog copying the second, the fourth is a Wikipedia mirror, the fifth is several letters on the subject, etc. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 04:16, September 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Travis, you didn't look very well. The first and second pages are not on the same web-page and wasn't written by the same persons. The first is mine, the second is "entropy".--<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:16, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But <i><b>this article</b></i> is not original research. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 05:07, September 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes it is. The mere fact that someone posted it on a Web site does not constitute published scientific research. I can post something on a Geocities site that says Wikipedia is a tool of the Nazis. That doesn't mean I could go start a Wikipedia page saying "Wikipedia is a tool of the Nazis, because this Geocities site says so." <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 05:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just because it isn't listen in PublMed doesn't make it OR. Most of the references in the theory goes to secondary sources that are listed in PublMed.--<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:16, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Amongst several competing theories are the underconnectivity theory developed by cognitive scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, the Neanderthal theory, the extreme male brain theory by Simon Baron Cohen, the lack of theory of mind, and the Preoperational-autism theory, which states that autistic people are those who get neurologically stuck at the pre-operational stage of cognitive development, where much of information processing is at a wholistic-visual level and largely non verbal and musical.") The article desperately needs to be cleaned up to refer to proper sources, but that's not a reason to delete it. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:23, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Nandesuka - the reference you mention is a copy of a previous version of the autism page here.... <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 21:37, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Following up to myself, on closer inspection most of the references seem to be riffing off of the original "rdos" site, so this might just be particularly well-promoted original research. The reference in The Doctors' Lounge has me intrigued, though. I'm going to do a pubmed crawl. If I can't find anything at all, I'll probably change my vote to delete. If Pubmed refers to it, I'll stick with keep. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:30, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can't find any pubmed references to this; I've come around to the point of view that it is original research. That being said, it's clearly a theory that has gained traction in some quarters. Is it worth preserving an article on the subject not of a scientifically supported theory, but of the fact that it has become notable as a theory? Thoughts? Consider that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> has an article, and has a similar lack of scholarly credentialing. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 02:33, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> as 50 references. This has basically none. IMO, this present article, being OR is not useful to us and we should hope that someone will create a non-OR article in the future. We shouldn't leave OR lying around "just in case". -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 03:48, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Creationism also has several hits with PublMed, but like intelligent design, none of them gives any support for the ideas. Besides, there are many other things that are well-known in the autistic community that does not show up in PublMed. Try searching for autism+homosexuality or autism+culture. The first gives five hits, but none of them talks about a link between autusm and homosexuality. The second gives no support for autism as a culture. Yet there is an article on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_culture.html" title="Autistic culture">autistic culture</a> --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:31, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>All I've seen are papers etc. TRYING TO BACK YOUR THEORY, not any mention of the theory itself being accepted by anyone - such as a major medical journal, etc..

This also addresses the issue of the theory of mind where children at the pre-operational stage of cognitive development have not attained decentralisation from egocentrism.</i></dd>

<li>Rdos, the article as it stands reads like a paper arguing for the theory; at least, a paper in dire need of a copyedit. Regarding Travis' complaint, the original wording approximated to "do you know any non-white Aspies? No? Thought not," and although it has improved significantly since then, it's replaced silly wording with weasel wording. "X is widely-known amongst enclosed community Y" is not enough proof for an encyclopaedic article, nor should it be offered as "evidences" for a scientific theory. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 18:45, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ryan, you are confusing the *treatment* with the theory of SID. The journal articles you talk about are the treatment and not the theory. The theory is an after-construction to explain why the treament works which most likely is wrong.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a very misleading set of links: some of them are on Neanderthals in general, with no mention of autism or of this "theory"; some of them are on autism and have only a single link to the "theory", most of which are at... rdos.net . Hmph. If this is a "reference list", I am more convinced than ever that this is nonsense promoted by one or two people. Other editors, please take a look at some of these before voting. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:24, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Huh? None of these links are at rdos.net. The articles mentioned are written by various people in the autistic community, some which have come up with similar ideas on their own. The article with the psychology talk has not even visited rdos.net, but refers to the other site with a different perspective of this. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:32, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>. The page itself needs to summarize the theory at the beginning and then break it down into more detail. I find this theory very interesting and do not think it should be deleted. However, the page should be brought up to a higher standard that will help it appear more credible. Perhaps one day scientists who can test the theory will take an interest in it and do just that. It will be a shame if the people who are most familiar with this theory don't take the time to improve this page and it does get deleted.</li>
