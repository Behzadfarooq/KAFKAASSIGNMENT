<p>Rui Pina Cape Verdean Singer and songwriter The best Cape Verdean Singers of all time are remembered not only for their signature singing style, but also for their unique presence: a charisma and flair that is all in their own. Rui Pina sings music from the heart that allows him distinct singing personality to shine through, taking his revolutionary music into another realm. When you own a unique voice you make a statement, conveying your own singing style. Whether it‚Äôs a koladera, morna, funana, zouk-when Rui sings he is unique and fantastic. Rui Pina paved the way for CapeVerdean new-generation of music when he wrote ‚ÄúShiela‚Äù and ‚ÄúKola Funk‚Äù. A new CapeVerdean music style was born (Zuki). This new style of Cape Verdean music is influenced by the music of the Caribbean Islands, traced back to Haiti, but yet deep rooted fused with Koladera and Funana from Cape Verde Islands. Rui Pina had a strong interest in music in the very early stages of his live. He made his own drums out of tin cans and sing for the neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>At age fourteen Rui, together with his parents and sisters, emigrated to the United States of America. As a teenager he continued to practice music and took drumming and singing lessons at MadisonParkHigh School in Boston, Massachusetts. Following his graduation from Madison Park/HHORC High School, in Massachusetts, Emiliano Lima "Lolo", a former member of Koladera Group Os Tubaroes, heard Rui perform and invited him to join him in forming the Funana Group Tabanka Djazz.</p>
<p>In 1985 Rui gained tremendous popularity both as a drummer and a singer. Paulino Vieira encouraged Rui to dedicate more time to singing as the lead vocalist of Tabanka Djazz. Rui decided to do so and soon he began to achieve recognition as a singer. Rui persuaded the members of Tabanka Djazz to record an album and which they entitled Tchica. Soon after the release of Tchica, Tabanka Djazz broke up. The musicians who had the most influence on Rui were Phil Collins, Duia, Prince, Ildo Lobo and Zeca Nha Reinalda.</p>
<p>In 1988 he was invited to join and help form a new musical group called Ice. In 1990 released a cassette multi (his first solo) entitled Nase pa Vive. Although Nase pa Vive was recorded for promotion only and duplicated in limited numbers, there was tremendous public demand for it and thousands were sold. In 1992 Rui Pina released his first full album on CD entitled Irresistible. Both Nase pa Vive and Irresistible continue to be in high demand. In Mach 1998 Rui released his new solo album entitled Senpri na nha pensamentu. Sinplismenti Rui, was released in December 2000. Rui Pina is now signed with recording label Fenetre Musique. Under this label Rui released an album in July 23, 2004 entitled ‚ÄúBest of Rui Pina‚Äù. Today Rui Pina is one of the hottest CapeVerdean singer/songwriters and has an even brighter future ahead of him...</p>
<p>Rui Pina spends most of his free time writing and composing music in his newly built Soundesign digital recording studios. Rui is the founder of Kola music production. Branching out from Kola, he found Soundesign digital recording studios, Prodigy entertainment group, Mudernu graphics and printing, He was the publisher of the RhythmAfrica magazine in Boston, and he plans to open in Cape Verde Islands the Rui Pina School of Self-Development and music and soon in Brockton the Cape Verdean Center for the performing Arts. Rui Pina has begun to discover new talented young musicians and is promoting them as he has always dreamed of doing. Rui's is committed to the Community social concerns and music grows out of his experience in the job. During this time, he lives BrocktonMassachusetts. He acknowledges the consequences of teenagers' drugs and alcohols abuse, gangs and violence and inadequate resources to help. He also became active n protecting the Speaking Rights of Linguistic Minorities in Massachusetts. While working for the BPS, he spends working many volunteering hours in a community service agency.</p>

<p>The Action! was formed in the fall of 1998, in Syracuse, NY. Their music is a hard-to-classify blend of rock, ska, punk, and jazz.</p>
<p>The Action!, formerly known as Skatos, has recorded two full-length albums; Skatalogical (1999), and Waiting For Tuesday (2001). They have appeared on the internationally released ska compilation Still Standing (Jump/Megalith), as well as the ska/punk compilation How I Punked Out Of Skallege (Red Dragon). The band also recorded and independently released an e.p. of demos called the 16 Hour E.P. The Action! also wrote and recorded a song used in local Syracuse commercials for the popular television show The Simpsons.</p>
<p>The Action! has served as the opening act for such bands as Reel Big Fish, The Toasters, The Pietasters, Jimmies Chicken Shack, Gym Class Heroes, The Planet Smashers, and Sheila Devine. On stage, the band delivers a tight, adrenaline fueled performance that has remained unmatched by their musical peers.</p>
<p>In 2003 the members of The Action! took a break from the band as school, jobs, and other projects made it increasingly harder to perform or rehearse regularly. However, in April of 2006 it was announced that they would reunite and organize a benefit show for their friend and bandmate Brandon Hall who was diagnosed with leukemia. The show was a great success, leading the band to start writing more and playing out again. Come and see for yourself the new and improved, latest installment of ... The Action!</p>

<p>Shadows Author: Rhiannon Lassiter</p>
<p>Hexes look and act like any normal human being with the exception of being able to communicate and control technology. They are the results of a genetic experiment which came out in the dawn of the 21st century. It is now the 24th century and a young but powerful Hex by the of Raven attempted to expose a secret lab which experimented on Hexes instead of killing that has government backing. In the process the lab was destroyed and the documents hidden. Raven and crew escaped back into London but with her friends and siblings identities revealed and her name exposed (those who saw Raven never lived to tell) no where is longer safe.</p>

<p>MALLIKARJUNA REDDY.C Mallikarjuna Reddy from KOLAR GOLD FIELDS has entered the Guinness Book of World Records by creating a tiny chain with 28 links carved in a single toothpick. He achieved this feat not with magnifying lenses or microscopes but with his naked eyes. He did not use any specialised instruments, but simple needles. Reddy is a student of biotechnology at Reddy College in Bangalore. He has managed to displace the earlier record of 17-link chain in a toothpick set by Box Shamey of the USA in 1993. Reddy accomplished his feat after a six-hour painstaking demonstration of carving the 28 link-chain in a single toothpick on February 21 at the Kannada Bhavan. He received his certificate signed by Laura Hughes of the Records Research Services of the Guinness World Records recently. Reddy‚Äôs creations include a miniature Ganesha idol carved in a grain of rice.</p>

He has recorded the "Blinding EP" with his new band which consisted of the tracks, "The Blinding", "I Love You But You're Green" "I Wish", "Beg, Steal Or Borrow" and "Sedative". Before joining this outfit, Mick Withnall has plyed with a skinhead band and was the guitarist for Lisa Moorish's band Kill City.

<p>West Norwalk, also known as WENO because WE KNOW!, an amazing place to live. It is far better than the village of Rowayton. West Norwalk is of course, part of Norwalk, the city located in Connecticut. As long as History goes back it is known to have pummeled rowayton in any competition ever had. There is no 69 here. To be exact West Norwalk strives to become it's own town one day, to do this they must bring in back up like the Israeli Army perhaps maybe even Kim Jong Il of North Korea. So watch out Connecticut, and rowayton (no capitalization necessary considering it is not a town or city).</p>

<p><b>The Song of Hannah</b> is a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> by Eva Etzioni-Halevy, published in 2005 by Plume/<a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_Group_bbc9.html" title="Penguin Group">Penguin Group</a>. It tells the story of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah.html" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> and Pninah. Speaking in the two women's own voices, this work of biblical fiction weaves the whole into one tale of sorrow, revenge and redemption through feminine strength and love. The book's title refers to a poem interrupting the prose text of the Books of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel.html" title="Samuel">Samuel</a>. According to the surrounding narrative, the poem (1 Samuel 2:1-10) was a prayer delivered by Hannah, to give thanks to God for the birth of her son, Samuel.</p>

<p>Hannah and Pninah, once close childhood friends, become rivals for the attention of Elkanah, the man who has married them both. Pninah, passionate and independent, easily bears Elkanah many children, but bitter that he has taken her friend as a second wife, seeks fulfillment with her own secret lover. Hannah, the epitome of goodness and grace, remains completely devoted to her husband, but remains childless for many years, until a promise to God brings her the son she has yearned for. Despite their differences, these two women must learn to live together, protecting their own interests as well as each other's, while sharing not only the love of their husband, but that of Hannah's son Samuel, who is destined to become one of the greatest prophets of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>Raised in an Edina, Minnesota household that included three generations of Borenes, Andrew Borene learned important life lessons about perseverance and patriotism early from his grandfather who was a survivor of the great depression and a World War II veteran.</p>
<p>In 1998, Andrew earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Macalester College, where he was a varsity football captain. After graduation, he helped local governments as a public finance investment banker with Wells Fargo in Minneapolis and San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 2000, Borene earned a commission as a U.S. Marine officer. Borene graduated with honors from his basic officer training courses, ultimately becoming a military intelligence officer. Borene crossed into Iraq with the 1st Marine Division in 2003 as the coalition invasion began, participating in the major combat operations that resulted in the fall of Saddam Hussein‚Äôs regime.</p>
<p>After an honorable discharge, Borene returned home to Minnesota to raise a family and pursue a law degree at the University of Minnesota Law School, where he is president of the National Security and Law Society.</p>
<p>Borene says his political activism is a continuation of his commitment to serve his country. At the 2004 presidential and vice presidential debates, Borene brought a pragmatic perspective to the issues of national security, terrorism, and the Iraq War during the election season. Borene has since worked extensively with the media on these important issues by providing guidance and commentary. Additionally, he has written syndicated op-ed pieces for the New York Times, the Baltimore Sun, and other publications as an advisor to Operation Truth, a non-partisan advocacy organization for America‚Äôs troops and newest veterans.</p>

<p>After being in business for just over a year, Clickpop Records had already hit a home run with Strange We Should Meet Here, the debut album from the duo Idiot Pilot. Blending elements of twitchy electronica, dream pop guitar melodicism and the primal scream of post-hardcore vocal aggression, Strange We Should Meet Here was Clickpop‚Äôs inaugural release. Shortly after it came out, the disc was picked up by Warner Brothers/Reprise, which has re-released the album and signed Idiot Pilot to a multi-CD recording artist development deal, confirmation that Clickpop chiefs Dave Richards and Paul Turpin are two music industry vets possessed of a keen insight into the record-buying public‚Äôs hunger for adventurous new sounds in popular music.</p>
<p>Dave Richards had already launched the indie Rebel Alliance label when he landed in Bellingham in 2001 and opened the successful record shop Sonic Index, while simultaneously embarking on a career as a much-in-demand house and down-tempo DJ. Seeking out a facility to record, mix and master Rebel Alliance releases, Richards found producer/musician Paul Turpin, proprietor of Bellingham‚Äôs top commercial sound studio, Bayside Recording. Idiot Pilot was one of the acts that Turpin had been working with for some time, helping nurture teenage wunderkinder Michael Harris and Daniel Anderson through a variety of stylistic evolutions.</p>

<p>Kym Johnson is a notable celebrity and professional ballroom dancer and has appeared on TV shows including Celebrity Survivor, as well as more famously winning the AUS Dancing with the Stars and appearing on season 3 of the US Dancing with the Stars. A good number of the other professional dancers from the US DwtS wiki have their own links. There is enough information for a professional biography, and it's extremely confusing to have her name link to Celebrity Survivor.</p>

<p><br />
Numerous strategies for restoring the peace in Iraq have been proposed.</p>
<p>The main challenges are to</p>
<p>a) Restore a stable power structure in the country,</p>
<p>b) Ensure that all groups within and around Iraq are working towards the same cause, and</p>
<p>c) Enable normal political, economic and social activities to resume.</p>
<p><br />
Major scenarios considered so far [1] include</p>
<p>a) The 'go-big' option: increase troop numbers to try to quell the insurgency,</p>
<p>b) The 'go-long' option: continue to maintain current troop numbers, and</p>
<p>c) The 'go-home' option: withdraw troops and leave the country to be managed by Shiites and Sunnis. This option has been rejected by the US Government as being likely to degenerate into chaos.</p>
<p>Alternative options to the above have also been raised by various groups, including the idea that US Government and governments of other nations would finance Sunni and Shiite leaders and group members on the condition that they maintained political control over their respective populations, and if their populations worked with the US Government to ensure peace [2].</p>
