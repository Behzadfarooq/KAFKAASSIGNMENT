<dd>Obviously is a mathematician in a somewhat specialized sense, even if that is the closest word to describe him.I might choose "numerologist" The general idea behind the N rules for academics is more N than most of the others in the field, and this is not a field where the ordinary sort of publications and faculty positions seem to be applicable. The standards that apply are the ones in this special subject. It further is obviously afield with different groups, who consider their group N, and not the other guys, so selecting any one is inherently POV. This is not that uncommon in some non-science areas. I do not see how BLP is relevant--he meets BLP. Based on what is being said, <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> because there are obviously factions involved, and choosing between them would be POV. If someone is opposed by what seems to be a POV faction, that makes a <i>very</i> good argument for keeping it. <i>NPOV applies to choice of articles as well as to what is said in them.</i> <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid your argument is not making a whole lot of sense to me, DGG. Just because a non-notable researcher is part of a faction does not make him notable. Not having a bio for every non-notable researcher is not POV. Also, I don't see at all why the subject is "obviously afield" with groups that consider other groups non-notable. It seems to me even <i>obvious</i> that those with particular POVs are well aware of who the big players on the opposing sides are. Just as obviously, not everyone is going to be a big player. How is your argument (whatever it is) related to the notability of the subject? For example, how does the existence of factions change your earlier statement about requiring some reviews or significant mentions of his research for notability? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:37, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure whether Rotenberg's name "appears alongside Eliyahu Rips" because Rotenberg is such an influential figure himself, or whether there is a large dose of self-promotion here (by User: Iser.unl). I think any claims to notability because of reasons like "I know Rips" or "I worked with Rips" ought to be viewed skeptically. By the way, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_McKay_9bb2.html" title="Brendan McKay">Brendan McKay</a> edits Wikipedia (as <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">User: McKay</a>) and should have a good idea of who <i>is</i> a notable Bible codes researcher.

<li>I was asked for my <b>opinion</b>. I don't want to vote on this. Rotenberg is a small player in the Torah codes business. People familiar with the Israeli codes community know of him. Mostly he is known because of one example about the sons of Haman. He isn't mentioned in the books of Katz and Satinover that claim to trace the history of the codes. His book, which I have, shows "Lavi P. Enterprises" as a distributor not a publisher, so I guess it is true that the book is self-published. A large part of the article appears in that book or on its cover. I couldn't locate any mathematical publications of his in <i>Mathematical Reviews</i> unless he is the "A.R. Rotenberg" who published in Russian in the 1970s. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 02:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm curious what DGG means when he says "The general idea behind the N rules for academics is more N than most of the others in the field …" Doesn't this imply a sort of relativism that would <i>automatically</i> make a "notable" person out of the lone "researcher" in a "field" that nobody else in the world views as meaningful?

<dd>Why is he being referred to as an academic? Nothing in the article or in his book says that he is an academic. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 01:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you mean, why should he have been listed as such for deletion sorting purposes: Because the first thing the article says about him is that he's a mathematician, and someone whose primary identification is as a mathematician is generally a type of academic. And because even if he's that rare kind of mathematician who's not a really an academic, he still is reasonably likely to be of interest to the Wikipedians who watch that deletion sorting category. But if you mean, why should he be evaluated according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> rather than <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I don't know, because I'm not convinced he should be. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 05:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WP BIO should trump WP:PROF. As I see it, WP:PROF is intended to try to specify some objective criteria in an area that might otherwise be hard to judge.</dd>
<dd>Factions-. In any field,there's a certain tendency to consider the people who agree with us more important than the other guys, who by definition have a lesser understanding of the subject or else we'd be on their side. Thats why there's a bias that needs correction. I don't say it happens always, but a determined effort to judge a particularly idiosycratic scholar NN is at least capable of being based on COI. If he is a leading exponent of his position, he's N. And if he were the only exponent of his position, yes, he would be all the more N. And if he were the only worker on the subject, and the subject were encyclopedia-worthy for intrinsic or popular interest, he would be N. I accept DavidCBryant's logic. If he were the lone worker in it, he would be N. if the field is N. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Notability is not subjective. The Flat Earth Society, living on our generally spherical earth, are a bunch of nutty, delusion kooks spouting banana talk, but they are worthy of an article because they are written about in multiple, independent reliable sources, and not because they go against the flow of sanity. Likewise, the notability of one of a small group of exponents of flat earth belief is judged based on his own write up in multiple, independent... and not because the field of adherents of that belief is small.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 12:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
