He is not <b>just</b> a caller he is a notable caller on a notable program. Allegations of PoV are worthless here. The article only concerns Eric qua the Howard Stern Show and in so far as he is represented in that capacity this is as neutral as possible. Indeed, since he is <b>only</b> notable qua the Howard Stern Show neutrality need only concern itself with this aspect of him; it is not unneutral to fail to assess Eric from the point of view of his family, friends, or non-stern related figures because the point of view of these figures is not important in relation to the notable aspect of his existence.--<a href="../../../i/w/p/User%7EIwpoe_9a9b.html" title="User:Iwpoe">Matt</a> 09:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>STRONGLY KEEP- he already outlived what his doctors said he would and is growing in popularity,if you do not keep this you are just a bunch of little people haters (or just hate actors)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>STRONGLY KEEP</b> Eric has been a near-daily-appearing show character since 2002. From 2002 through 2005 the Howard Stern show, Monday through Friday, had over 10 million listeners per day. With the Sirius/XM merger the show could in the very near future attain those type of numbers once again. The Howard Stern Show is as mainstream a piece of American pop culture as one can get speaking in the most strict, capitalist terms. I've seen wiki of dozens of programs with literally a thousanth of the audience of the Stern show per week who have seperate profiles for characters or personalties of parallel profile to what Eric has had with Howard. It takes quite a lot of moxie to judge the impact of a character or what he has meant to a show when one hasn't been a listener/viewer to it, as many of those pro-delete zealots show a clear indication of. Or even the absurd notion that Howard Stern fans can't be the best arbiters, or arbiters at all, for keeping acuracy on Howard Stern centric profiles. Do you see we Stern fans trying to create seperate profiles for every Wack Packer? It would be helpful if the people in these arguments stated their basic opinion on the show they're making judgements about BTW, I have no problem removing the mystery and acknowledging biases. Also excuse me if I assume an Englishman,<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatestrowerever_c779.html" title="User:Greatestrowerever">Greatestrowerever</a>, wouldn't be the best barometer for the American radio atmosphere and who it registers with in the American culture.

<p>STRONGLY KEEP! Eric is a crucial part of The Howard Stern Show. He's done to much for one person to deleate one's page. He makes people smile and laugh each day.</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP!!! For the simple reason that he should not be censored from Wiki. If someone wants to learn about Eric, they should be able to find valid information about him.</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP! Eric is one of the most beloved members of the WackPack. His calls to the show are the stuff of legend and he has truly separated himself from average WackPackers. He is and always will be a lexicon of The Howard Stern Show and rightly deserves special recognition for his contributions and works. --Sir Brentallica-- Knights of the SFN</p>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP. Eric the Midget is a very big part of the Howard Stern Radio Show. If this post were to be deleted, you would also have to delete other members of his show. This Wiki should not be censored, or otherwise it loses validity and becomes biased.</p>

<li><b>strongly keep</b> ETM is arguably the most popular and influential little person in popular culture today. His influence is starting to extend beyond the realm of the Stern show and into the area of music, wrestling and organized crime. Sti571 02:31, 24 March 2007 (UTC)sti571</li>
</ul>
<p>STRONGLY KEEP! Eric is a member of the Howard Stern Wack pack. He contributes to the show frequently. He should have a page as other members of the Wack Pack have theirs. 67.149.130.107hp242</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. For the love of God, delete it. Why we need to have articles on people who only appear on nationally aired talk shows is a major mystery to me. It's different for someone like Stuttering John, who has notability outside of the show. But it's just ridiculous in this case. He isn't notable just for being on the show alot. It doesn't work that way. And to whomever closes this, good luck counting the votes. I wish non-Wikipedia users wouldn't flood AfDs like this. It's counter productive. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 10:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, he is notable enough for an article. I know of him, and I never even listen to Howard Stern. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">musicpvm</a> 17:21, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I came here specifically for knowledge about eric the midget. It's not like the internet is running out of disk space.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I have an issue with some of the comments made in this discussion, as I think <b>everyone deserves a BIO page</b>, regardless of what their claim to fame is, or even if they have none. Wikipedia is supposed to be the encyclopedia for everything that has ever been, and everyone has had some kind of impact on society and the way of the world. Eric is no exception to this. Eric is a real person, who has a life and has had an impact on society, just like everyone else who has a BIO. Having said that, I do admit that the article reads less like a BIO and more like an article about "Eric's antics on the Howard Stern show". Maybe a new article should be created for *that* topic, and those portions of the BIO can be moved out of the BIO page and onto that topic page. Then, people can argue about whether *that* page should be deleted. But the BIO page itself should remain, if for no other reason, than out of respect for Eric.
