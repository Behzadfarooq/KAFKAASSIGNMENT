<p>I wouldn't oppose having useful content in this article, but currently it has existed for nearly a year and it contains absolutely nothing that the official <a href="http://thisamericanlife.org/pages/archives/archivemain.html" class="external text" title="http://thisamericanlife.org/pages/archives/archivemain.html" rel="nofollow">Main Show Archive</a> does not. And, if that page ever goes down, so will all of the links in this article... Is there any reason to keep this? <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif"><sub>HELO</sub></a> 22:35, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment: This article is different from the Main Show Archive in one important aspect: it is a listing of <i>episodes</i> (organized by episode number), where as the Show Archive is a listing of <i>shows</i> (organized by date and including repeated episodes). For example, the Show Archive links to Episode 214 "Family Physics" three times because it aired three times, whereas our article lists the episode just once. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 06:54, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Update</b>: I've removed all external links except for one general link to the official archive page. I suggest that further discussion about which links, if any, to include take place on the article's talk page. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 02:43, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Fancruft perhaps, but not more so than in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_episodes_%282003_series%29_b9c4.html" title="List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles episodes (2003 series)">most</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Curb_Your_Enthusiasm_episodes_bb7e.html" title="List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes">other</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jeremiah_episodes_151c.html" title="List of Jeremiah episodes">cases</a>. If the official page ever moves, we can update all the links here with a simple AWK script (that's how the links were created in the first place). If the official page ever disappears, we will still have a list of episodes as a memento. Another thing: if you say that you "wouldn't oppose having useful content" here, that suggests to me that you think the topic <i>is</i> indeed encyclopedic, and should be expanded rather than deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 01:11, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Utterly pointless duplication of the program's own archive page. And if you could explain, without resorting to logic-chopping, what possible useful content that could be added here that wouldn't fit in <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> I'd be grateful. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 02:05, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Pointless duplication</i> was not a deletion criterion last time I checked. You might have a point that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a> could be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a>, but you could say the same about virtually every other article in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">Category:Lists of television series episodes</a> – it's almost always possible to make a case for why "list of FOO episodes" should be merged into "FOO". As for useful content, it would be helpful to cross-reference the episode list with contributor articles like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sedaris_4199.html" title="David Sedaris">David Sedaris</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Vowell_f542.html" title="Sarah Vowell">Sarah Vowell</a>, etc. The whole point is that this list can be properly wikified and expanded by us, whereas the official archive page cannot. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 03:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>You mean a stripped-down, automated, wholly unnecessary duplication of an existing website's content shouldn't be considered grounds for deletion? Hell, it borders on outright copyright violation.<br />
<i>You might have a point that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a> could be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a></i>. That was precisely NOT my point. I repeat, what "useful content" could be added to the episode list that would NOT belong in the main article (or that of the contributors)? Answer: none.<br />
Do you have a point you can make without distorting people's positions? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 05:31, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I'm not in the business of distorting anyone's position. Your prior point was that anything worth adding to this article could equally well be added to the <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> article. That suggests to me that you're thinking any content (current or future) worth preserving could be merged into the main article. Like I said before, if there is a point here, it would apply essentially unchanged to a lot of other <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">episode lists</a>. Second, it's hardly a copyright violation, as one cannot claim copyright on a mere list of facts, which includes lists such as this, phone directories, etc. Also, if you check the history of this page, you'll see that it was cleary not created as a pared down version of the official archive page. I agree that this article should be expanded, which would make it even less of a copyright violation, if it ever was one. Third, I maintain that useful content can indeed be added here: we can provide content summaries and link them with other articles. In fact, I've just done so for a few episodes I remember off the top of my head. Now when you go to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> and click on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Trail_of_Tears" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Trail_of_Tears" rel="nofollow">What links here</a>, you'll be directed to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">List of This American Life episodes</a> among other articles. This clearly cannot be done on the off-site official archive, and it could only be done in the main article <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a> if that included/transcluded the content from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_This_American_Life_episodes_cfe0.html" title="List of This American Life episodes">list of This American Life episodes</a>, hence my first point. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 06:49, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>First, I'm not in the business of distorting anyone's position</i> So you're an amateur, then?</li>
<li><i>That suggests to me...</i> Perhaps you should stick to what I wrote and not what you imagine I wrote.</li>
<li><i>Pointless duplication was not a deletion criterion last time I checked.</i> That suggests to me that you're not up on Wikipedia policy.

If you removed all those links, all that would be left would be a short blurb about some of the 2004 episodes. Articles that are essentially lists of links to other web-sites are against Wikipedia policy, and even if they weren't, this so-called article can and should be replaced by a single sentence in the "External references" section of <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_American_Life_d57b.html" title="This American Life">This American Life</a>, letting people know that they can find information about particular episodes on americanlife.org. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:21, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>At present, it is 95% a violation of Wikipedia policy (being a list of external links), and 5% a useless list of blurbs about some of the 2004 shows. Removing the external links would make it 100% a useless list of blurbs about the shows -- so it is difficult to call that an improvement. The solution is to <b>delete</b> the article, as I said before.
<ul>
<li>So why don't we remove all <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_television_series_episodes_357e.html" title="Category:Lists of television series episodes">episode lists</a>?
