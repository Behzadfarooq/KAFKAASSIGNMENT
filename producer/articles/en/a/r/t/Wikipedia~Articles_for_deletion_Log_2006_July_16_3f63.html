<p>NN/OR. Although the article has a couple of references, they're to dead pages. The word 'Gogan' googles very high, but not with this meaning (except this Wikipedia article itself). Googling 'gogan goth bogan' gets a fair number of hits but they seem to originate in Wikipedia in most cases. This article is a classic example of someone using Wikipedia to seed something NN in the internet. The concept is not even defined in the article in such a way to make it clear what differentiate a 'gogan' from 'goth' in general. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 07:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is indeed a neologism, about four years old, and (to my knowledge) in use within a "youth subculture" in a single, smallish Australian city. (I'd guess on the order of a few thousand people have ever heard the term.) Furthermore, its use seems to be in decline. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 04:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not only do we have the "trivia" pages as blatant as can be, we have "Minor characters in" lists that are basically trivia masquerading as lists, we have editors who insist that no matter how little distinguishes one school from another, they are all notable, we have articles on virtually every episode of fan-loved tv series, every pokemon monster, every voice on the Simpsons, etc. This encyclopedia not only embraces "trivia", I would venture to guess that without the trivia our article count would drop below a million. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem is that trivia is the very antithesis of what an encyclopaedia is supposed to contain. It's trifling details, when an encyclopaedia is supposed to give the most relevant and significant information.

<li>What would you rename it? List of facts about the Beatles?

I'm all for adding the facts to appropriate articles in which they can cleanly integrate, but a page specifically for uncorrelated facts about a topic should not exist in an encyclopaedia. It deters people from finding the appropriate way to integrate the information, so that it can be used to improve an existing article on the same topic, or determining that, in the end, the information does not add value to the topic. I know that the article about The Beatles is already long, but spinoffs like these just don't sit well with me. GassyGuy 09:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

There's also some bad stuff that I'd be happy to see disappear. <s>I'd oppose a delete after only five days, though, so in that limited sense I suppose my vote is <b>keep</b>.</s> I'd also approve of a covers article as a suitable merge target. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 12:40, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>*Big comment</b> I completely agree with LessHeard vanU. The discussion is not even over yet, and you guys are sharpening your knives, and have already started using them. I find that highly reprehensible and insulting to the process of Wikipedia discussion. Yes, it does need cutting, but can you PLEASE wait until the jury comes back in to deliver their verdict BEFORE you start erecting the scaffold for the hanging?

<dd><b>Comment</b> May I point out the part of the wording on the Afd tag is <i>"Feel free to edit the article, but the article must not be blanked, and this notice must not be removed, until the discussion is closed. For more information, particularly on merging or moving the article during the discussion,.."</i> My edits were in line with these and instructions and designed to save this article, and I point out again, quite clearly for those who haven't bothered to see read or understand my changes, I did not delete one piece of information from WP. Those sub-heading I deleted were the same as in the principal article, or augmented in a "see also" sub-heading. The article is too long, too unconnected, and no context between the bits of "trivia." Maybe it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 13:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Make my with half a spoonful of sugar! As you know you have copied some other WP articles and pasted them into this article, which really isn't necessary! Does say, Portmeiron require all the information repeated here just because the Beatles were interviewed there once? Ditto Mary Hopkin, the Tom Hanks film, The Rutles and other sub-sections I moved to "see also" On the other hand you have added more info about Norman Pilcher which really belongs in the Pilcher article with a link from here. Some of the parts deserve to stay in here. The one real deletion I did make was removing "and allowed its release" (re-With a Little Help), and as anybody who knows anything about the music business knows once a song has been released the author only retains moral rights and <b>not</b> the right to stop the playing of, or release of cover versions. So those words are a complete fabrication. As I keep pointing out the article is too long, so a little bit of judicious editing will go a long way to saving an article which <b>could</b> be important. I also note you have missed some relatively important items like the Dora Bryan song, or perhaps the Ballad of Hollis Brown/Working Class Hero "coincidence." ditto Norwegian Wood. Some of these items rightfully belong in the Beatles Influence articles too, which you have also worked on. Your decision, I'd rather see this article be deleted than get into an edit war. This is why I am replying rather heavily here - I am actually trying to save this article (although it will probably need to be renamed), although you wouldn't think so from the comments I am getting!!!--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 14:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I know that I am an incorrogible thief, but I only started it a month ago. (My... what a short life it had - laugh...)</p>
<p>My original idea was to have it as an index, so people would not have to trawl through whole pages of stuff to find one small reference about The Beatles. As that idea has (it seems so) well and truly had its genitalia skewered, I will sit back and think of something else to do. I still believe there should be a Beatles index - if only to connect the multitude of pages together. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 15:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Which is all I was trying to do, trim it back into a useful index, please see my last edit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles_trivia&amp;oldid=64275117" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles_trivia&amp;oldid=64275117" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] before it was all reverted. Not saying I finished, or that other editors couldn't do better. You will note I added a small amount of detail to the "see also" so the reader could decide if they wanted to look further in that direction. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 16:04, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well the policy is "<i>Wikipedia</i> is not an indiscriminate collection of information" not that Wikipedia <i>articles</i> shouldn't be ICIs. Some people interpret this as saying that Wikipedia shouldn't contain trivia or articles on non-notable subjects. But of course this is one of those rules that everyone interprets differently and I doubt everyone will come to an agreement on it here. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 13:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I have not tried it myself (as I have a life, I think, outside Wikipedia) but how long would it take to trawl through every page that mentions The Beatles?

<p>Hi. I work for Crowdstorm and just briefly wanted to put our viewpoint across before you go ahead with any deletion. We've been building this company up for some time now and trying to make a difference by letting the crowd find the best products and group together to get the best deals - which is a valuable service. A wikipedia entry is not purely a marketing tactic as we believe it is of interest to people to see more about the company, what it does, and useful links about the business. In fact, we didn't even create the entry ourselves but came across it a few days ago.</p>
<p>In the UK, it is a very notable company (see <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/05/15/kicking-up-a-crowdstorm/" class="external free" title="http://mashable.com/2006/05/15/kicking-up-a-crowdstorm/" rel="nofollow">http://mashable.com/2006/05/15/kicking-up-a-crowdstorm/</a>) and generated a lot of interest to-date which people are searching for across the net. I'm also not sure how this policy compares to allowing things like Last.Fm, Kaboodle, Yahoo up on wikipedia. How is the Crowdstorm entry different?</p>
<p>You guys do a great job of keeping wikipedia clean and we appreciate the work you do. We will abide by any decision you make and just wanted some way of getting our viewpoint across, understanding your reasoning, and seeing if there is anything we can change / do to help to make it more useful to wikipedia readers?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>L.G. has created KMBS FM, now with the same content I saw at KBIT FM (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KBIT_FM_357d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KBIT FM">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KBIT FM</a>), and at KWLD (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KWLD_0b44.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KWLD">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KWLD</a>). Those two articles were created with a different username, but have very much the same content; I think those other names are sock puppets with <a href="../../../l/2E/g/User%7EL.G._3d99.html" title="User:L.G.">User:L.G.</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.8.29.40.html" title="User:68.8.29.40">User:68.8.29.40</a>.</p>
<p>68.8.29.40 has made literally hundreds of edits to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_urban-format_radio_stations_in_the_United_States_f79f.html" title="List of urban-format radio stations in the United States">List of urban-format radio stations in the United States</a>. 68.101.241.195 might be inovlved in that, too. The edits were to add (or change, or rename, or otherwise diddle) with KWLD or KBIT FM or KBMS FM's listing in the San Diego market in that list topic.</p>
<p>Anyway: KBMS FM is now blank. Blank topics should be deleted. The previous versions of the topic show that we're talkinga bout the non-existant 92.3 FM radio station in the San Diego/TJ market again. The FCC says there's no such station <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=KMBS" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=KMBS" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> in FM; the station with the same call letters in AM is in Louisiana.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 03:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If this particular article were to be deleted, I would think many of the articles about teams in Category:United States soccer clubs (defunct) would need to be on the chopping block as well. This category, however, seems to be a rather important part of the history of soccer in the U.S. There were many professional teams that only played a couple of seasons because various leagues folded. In this sense, <i>any</i> professional soccer team in the U.S. asserts it's notability simply by having existed in the first place. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 09:55, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd agree with the consensus that it should probably be deleted as a not-yet-notable neologism, and lack of encyclopedic material in the article (it's just a slang dicdef), but manifestly the fact that an article is about "racist slang" does not mean that it should be deleted, if there is encyclopedic potential.

<li><b>Keep</b>; isn't the reason that there is nothing relevant on Google or other pages all the more of an indication that it is beneficial for such an article to exist? Many people use Wikipedia as well as Google for searching sources. It is particularly the fact that there was minimal information on the net that struck the idea that creating such a page might be helpful to people seeking information on the game. HOWEVER! If it is precisely the lack of information on the page that has led to the suggestion of deletion, please say so, and remedies can be made. If there are other reasons, please also say so; because, it is still quite confusing as to why submitting information on a game (not a detailed guide, but just one to introduce it) that doesn't have a lot of information on the rest of the net is a reason for deletion. If there exists an article on a subject that would be otherwise hard to find on Google, it might be better to keep it. Thank you. --FrostShaman 09:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>There are clear indications that this game is special in its own way. For one matter, as a Doujin game, it features not 1 on 1 combat, but 2 on 2, making it a more diverse form of multipler gameplay. Secondly, the terrain of the stages varies. In other words, there are raised platforms and whatnot, resembling those found in games such as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Brothers_b70b.html" title="Super Smash Brothers">SSB</a> series. Both of these factors are elements that many <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doujin.html" title="Doujin">Doujin</a> Fighting Games lack, making this one of the few that feature both. The definition of importance or the presence of reliable sources doesn't seem concrete, since, as mentioned, this game is in fact notable for bringing the elements of 4 players and a variant terrain into a Doujin game, and does the main site not count as a "reliable" site? Therefore, I still argue that this page should be kept. Thank you once again for your comments. --FrostShaman
<ul>
<li>The main site is a primary source. There are no secondary sources. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Under the page Verifiability, it is not mentioned that any second source are needed so long as there is a site from which information is drawn from. It just so happens that the site is in Japanese, and, in accordance with deletion policies, sites of foreign languages or sites with verifiability problems are not absolute reasons for deletion/deletion may not be needed. It is because the game has little publicity that there are few sites pertaining to the information, and the very source of this information is the main site. So, unless it is doubted whether the main site provides information that contradicts what is written in this page, there should be no reason to doubt this <u>verifiability</u>. If anything else, I think the page should be keep, and, at the least, modified to a stub. --Caskyl</li>

<li>I don't see it mentioned anywhere that Wikipedia <u>should</u> list out and talk about all Doujin games. It only seems to be hinted that this page is potentially helpful to those who seek information on the game, and, if I recall correctly, articles on Wikipedia should not be bound by restraints as long as it doesn't violate any rules or regulations. And here, it doesn't seem like any of the regulations are seriously violated. --Caskyl

<li>I wish it were not so, but notability guidelines are here to stay, and this game is definitelly not notable.

<li>Fair enough, however, one must take into account the bizarrely unique methodology that goes around in the world of doujinshi. It's a veritable phenomenon, which I assume stems from the fact that Japanese copyright laws either (A) allow for such things vs. more contemporary Western laws, or (B) nobody bothers to enforce them if they do. Just because we do not understand it, or do not think it is useful, doesn't mean it's worth chucking out a window. Furthermore, you have to admit, it's a well-written article; that in and of itself is with at least a small margin of error on the side of "keep" in the Wikipedia of today. 24.161.191.234 18:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Cleanup</b> Reasons per Ace of Sevens and SevereTireDamage. As it stands, the article is admittedly borderline junk but it looks like it may be salvageable. An article on the recurring themes of video games seems pretty important. The charge of original research is probably true, but irrelevant. "Original research" these days usually just means a user came up with an idea he thought was his own, except that other more important people already thought of it (in short, the "original research" probably has unintended references online, so in practice, it's not original research). I'll give the creators some time to sort it out.

Not only is this one of the most, if not the most, important malls in the Sacramento, it is also in the top 3 of the suburban malls in Westfield Group portfolio.

<li><b>Reply</b> Then you might as well go around a delete every webpage for every mall that is on wikipedia. There are probably hundreds of them. Also, there are a lot more starbucks than malls so maybe you should delete their page also. Plus, there aren't tons of malls over a million square feet in this country and there aren't many with sales of $600 a square feet and with a Tiffany &amp; Company coming. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.172.167.42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.172.167.42_91cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.172.167.42">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I would love to, actually, unless there is something notable about them. That is the standard we hold other subjects to - why not malls? The Starbucks argument is invalid, because there is a page for the entire corporation, not each individual location. I am fine with an article about a company that runs malls, like <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westcor.html" title="Westcor">Westcor</a>, but not articles for every mall.

<li><b>Delete, BUT...</b> while I don't think the list is encyclopaedic, I think that the creation of a category and a template would be acceptable to serve the same purposes.

<li>I was giving an alternative to achieve the same purposes that I would find more acceptable. Nobody has to make one if it's too much effort, but that doesn't exactly make me think any more highly of the list, if it's not even serving a purpose that would still be worthwhile if x amount of extra effort had to be put into achieving it.

<p>There is no such thing as "Nice guy syndrome." It isn't listed in the DSM-IVR. The article as it is is nothing but but one man's theories on certain men's dating woes and a compare and contrast with other questionable theories about dating. The talk page and the archived talk page for this article repeatedly call for deletion. Some people are pretty outraged that this kind of article is allowed to exist on Wikipedia. It has been nominated recently for deletion and it hasn't gotten any better. It's time to pull the plug on this one. Erik the Rude 07:35, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete,</b> per all the above. Sure, this phenomenon happens. So do plenty of other phenomena in the dating world, such as reluctance to date single parents, or anger at friends for setting up a bad blind date, or high school sweethearts reuniting after twenty years. All those things happen, and none of them warrants a Wikipedia article. Furthermore, as much as I'm sure - no, actually, I <i>know</i> - that sometimes a woman will turn down a man with some permutation of "You're a really nice guy and all, but...", there's no way of knowing whether or not that is really the reason for her rejection. Being turned down / turning someone down is a sensitive and emotionally charged situation, and what people say may not be the best indicator of how they actually feel. Isn't it quite possible that the woman in question is trying to be "nice" and feels more comfortable telling her suitor that he's "too nice," rather than, "I think you're immature," or "You're okay, I guess, but I hate all your friends" or "I just don't find you the least bit attractive"? Basically, you're left with a lot of speculation and anecdotal evidence, as <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> pointed out, and none of that adds up to much of an article. - <a href="../../../t/a/p/User%7ETapir_Terrific_4616.html" title="User:Tapir Terrific">Tapir Terrific</a> 21:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but disagree with nom per Vadder. A "nice guy" article should be written from scratch that describes the archetype of "nice guys" in popular culture.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article needs definite clean up, but should not be deleted. Where I live, Southern California, it is a common phrase used to describe nice, or love-shy males who can never find a relationship. The fact that this is not a clinically defined term is irrelevant as it is prevalent in popular culture.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Searching Google for "What the fuck", "recipe" and "spaghetti" gets about 15K hits, but after looking through the first hundred or so, I saw nothing that had anything to do with this stuff. Searching for "what the fuck recipe" gets zero hits. I was gonna go with that, but then I thought, "well, hell, those aren't terribly unusal words, I guess I might be missing some kind of a secret significant phenomenon here." So I added "pepper" to the first set of search words, what with "shitload pepper" being one of the key ingredients here, just to see if it'd show up at all. I got a little less than 700 hits. After quickly checking out the first hundred or so I still didn't have a hit. For an internet joke, that's downright pathetic. I'd say the primary problem with this article is not that it's an internet joke, it's that I can't even confirm that it exists in the first place. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 09:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Author claims that the page is under construction, and that they are the only person who should edit the page. They have put the page in a catagory that doesn't exist, along with adding a strange un-needed title. Google throws up two very low traffic web pages that are under construction, and link to one another. The page contains no information at all, and appears to be used experimentally, or as information about upcoming pages on Wikipedia, it is hard to understand. Whatever this thing is, it is non-notable. Didn't put this up for speedy simply because I have never seen a page like this before.

<li><b>Leave it!</b>This particular line of people maintained an interesting manor at Beachborough that draws a few tourists and played a role during WWII. It is interesting to some to note how the estate changed hands et cetera. From an objective/international point of view I am not sure how much of the titled aristocracy documented in Wikipedia has any more relevance than these particular gentry. You seem to be discriminating entirely based on the English system of aristocratic titles, or, do you advocate that all of the non-famous aristocracy holding titles be deleted from wikipedia including the Stuarts and other interesting lines?

<dd>I just reviewed the ISNOT page and there is no mention of "wikipedia is not a genealogical database". There is however an entry of "Wikipedia is not an experiment in rule-making".

<li><b>Leave it!</b>This particular line of people maintained an interesting manor at Beachborough that draws a few tourists and played a role during WWII. It is interesting to some to note how the estate changed hands et cetera. From an objective/international point of view I am not sure how much of the titled aristocracy documented in Wikipedia has any more relevance than these particular gentry. You seem to be discriminating entirely based on the English system of aristocratic titles, or, do you advocate that all of the non-famous aristocracy holding titles be deleted from wikipedia including the Stuarts and other interesting lines? This line is interesting to some people and the pages have gotten some visits and attention. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandwich_Eater_5626.html" title="User:Sandwich Eater">Sandwich Eater</a> 16:34, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, Tearlach it is a coincidence. I think it would be helpful if you could actually address the argument. Other commenters are willing to admit that titles of nobility confer notability, but landed gentry in the UK might be a bit too far. 66.30.202.173 01:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Landed gentry is too far, tho perhaps a single article on each landed estate might be acceptable. Peers in the UK were automatically notable becuase they were in Parliament. With the reforms of the House of Lords, I wouldn't say that is the case for 21st century peers tho. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caerwhine</small></a> 17:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry about the length of the nomination, but I felt it was necessary so that participants are not fooled by appearances. There are many problems with this article, which is about a person who claims to be able to heal and diagnose people through sound (a problem in itself). First, it was written by the subject's lawyer, AKA "The Vitamin Lawyer" and AKA "<a href="http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/Autographs%20of%20Religious%20Leaders%20FRB-FUM.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/Autographs%20of%20Religious%20Leaders%20FRB-FUM.htm" rel="nofollow">High Priest</a>, who pretended to be just a fan on the talk page. He has been <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/0/2001/2001-Ohio-1303.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/0/2001/2001-Ohio-1303.pdf" rel="nofollow">disciplined</a> (PDF) for practicing law without authorization in Ohio on her behalf. She has needed a lawyer on many occasions because she is frequently involved in lawsuits. Her bank seized all of her funds in 2004. She claimed that it was because someone took a loan out posing as her. However, I found nothing about it from a reliable source. She claimed that they asked her for the funds for seven years, but the bank refused to provide a copy of some documents (there is nothing about whether she used legal means to answer the charges or force them to give here a copy (if they truly didn't) until after they took the money). The method that they allegedly used to obtain the money sounds scummy, but the bank did win in court, which makes me think her claim of someone else using her identity might be false. Given the frequency of injustices in court systems, this is not certain, however.</p>
<p>Second, while she may have done some legitimate work, or at least some less insane work, she makes many outlandish claims. Here is a quote from an ad for a VHS tape of hers, "Sharry Edwards' uniquely healing voice is quantified at a University as a collection of frequencies with measurable qualities. Now science merges with ancient wisdom through the work of Sharry Edwards. Using her unusual capacities for hearing and toning, Sharry has pioneered an amazing technology that transfers her abilities to anyone who wants to work with sound and the healing arts." Note that the "University" is not given a name. Here is more stuff from a different advertisement, "Sharry created combinations of Frequency Equivalents that dissolve the protective coating around a pathogen so the white blood cells can destroy it." "She is researching to see if the right frequencies, played by select radio stations (even at inaudible levels) may be protective from the effects of biochemical warfare."</p>
<p>She did win the O. Spurgeon English Humanitarian Award. However, it seems to be an extremely obscure award and might even be a scam itself. "Spurgeon English Humanitarian Award" ("O" is omitted to increase the results) only gets <i>19 unique Google results</i>. Also, it is supposedly for humanitarian work, not bioacoustics, and I was unable to find any humanitarian work that she had performed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Forbes_Nash_360a.html" title="John Forbes Nash">John Forbes Nash</a> also received the award, but it is unclear what humanitarian work he has ever done, either. In addition, almost all of the other recipients are involved in new age and alternative medicine, not humanitarian work, including Oscar G. Rasmussen, who is mentioned on <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/healthprints.html" class="external text" title="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/healthprints.html" rel="nofollow">Quackwatch</a> for being involved in "Commercial hair analysis... a bogus test used for prescribing dietary supplements." Betty Ford might be the only one who qualifies as a humanitarian of any kind. I suspect that she and Nash may have been given the award to make it seem credible and/or important.</p>
<p>The article claims she was published by the <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustical_Society_of_America_ba2e.html" title="Acoustical Society of America">Acoustical Society of America</a>, but the <a href="http://asa.aip.org/web2/asa/abstracts/search.may05/asa106.html" class="external text" title="http://asa.aip.org/web2/asa/abstracts/search.may05/asa106.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> given as proof makes it seem like she was just presenting a paper at a meeting or conference. Also, who knows what requirements there were, if any? Finally, the abstract makes less crazy claims than her other work, although they are still improbable, "The emerging Mathematical Model being assembled through Human Bioacoustic research likely has the potential to allow Vocal Profiling to be used to predict and monitor health issues from the very first cries of a newborn through the frequency foundations of disease and aging." Some problems may be detectable by voice analysis in the future (throat cancer?), but there are many, many problems that would not affect the quality of a person's voice at all. Also, I would think that it would be especially hard when dealing with newborns, as claimed, since there would be no previous voice sample for comparison.</p>
<p>You might be saying, "Okay, she is involved in some questionable stuff, but maybe she's notable for it." In my opinion, she is not. Also, I think that people have to be exceptionally well known to qualify for an article for being frauds. Her name in quotes gets 710 search results on Google, but only about 240 of them are unique (this is pushing the limits of Google's unique search result reliability, but the ratio of total pages to unique is credible). Of the unique hits, some are the websites that she owns or that her lawyer and his wife own, and many others are directory and advertisement type pages for new age medicine. I did not get any results on Google News, but that happens with a lot of notable people as well as non-notable ones. For all of these reasons, I think that the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm at an impasse here. I'd tag this for speedy, but for the fact that they're supposed to star <b>as an extra</b> in a major motion picture. Now, what gets my goat is how one can 'star' as an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra_%28actor%29.html" title="Extra (actor)">extra</a>. To quote the wikipedia itself is that an extra is one "who has no role or purpose other than to appear in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene)." One cannot be a <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_star.html" title="Movie star">star</a> when their role is to appear in the background. If we take this out, we're left with little. I doubt we can verify they've been an extra anywhere, as extras are rarely credited. Take your pick, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the fact that wikipedia is not an indescriminant collection of information, and the lack of ability to verify their claims all pointing toward this article for deletion. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 11:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Half of the article is discussing issues with the canon, what to include, what not to include. The other half is dealing with very basic background plot facts, which are duplicated by necessity on the Buffy page. Smerge the top two sections into canon where they belong + the choice is to either wipe out the Supernatural section or expand it. I favor the former option, because it's already duplicated in the series pages + detailed pages listed at the bottom.-- [[User: Lesqual|Lesqual]] 14:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - I'm not quite sure on what grounds this has been nominated for deletion? Do people even look at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> anymore? Yes the information on <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_canon.html" title="Buffyverse canon">Buffyverse canon</a> is summarised in the article <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>. There is some overlap of information all over wikipeda, but we don't just say that makes information here and there redundant and start deleting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The articles <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_vampire_slayer.html" title="Buffy the vampire slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_%28TV_series%29_7f24.html" title="Angel (TV series)"><i>Angel</i></a> are about two TV series. This article, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>, is about a fictional universe which includes dozens of novels, hundreds of comics, as well as TV series, and potentially other films in the future. <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_vampire_slayer.html" title="Buffy the vampire slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_%28TV_series%29_7f24.html" title="Angel (TV series)"><i>Angel</i></a> the TV series are only a part of the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>. Therefore if anything the articles, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_vampire_slayer.html" title="Buffy the vampire slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_%28TV_series%29_7f24.html" title="Angel (TV series)"><i>Angel</i></a> are actually subpages to this page, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore Lesqual has failed to mention the whole section on terminology. How are people who know little about the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a> to know what the difference between 'Buffyverse' and 'Whedonverse' is for example; Including information on terminology revolving around this issue would really be inappropiate in any other article.</p>
<p>Finally I'd like to point out the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a> has it's own wikiproject: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Buffyverse_4640.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Buffyverse">Wikipedia:WikiProject Buffyverse</a> (there are over 50 members), and its own category. How can we have a wikiproject on a topic and delete the main topic of which that wikiproject revoles? IMO this is clearly an article that is needed. I'd agree with Lesqual that at present this article is not up to the standard it should be: for example he mentions that the Supernatural section does not have enough detail. But the whole point of Wikipedia is to gradually improve articles. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 16:08, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is an article about a career adult entertainer, not a vanity page on a teenaged girl who just figured out how to make money with her webcam.

It looks like a collection of ads and a place to republish popular columns from elsewhere, which makes me question its status as a genuine, notable publication.

<li><b>Keep</b> Both of the pages cited as proof this one is redundant only have a handful of species listed and nothing about that species country of origin, which is why I created this one in the first place.

<li><b>Keep</b>-Article has relevant information not included in the main <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a> article. This serves is a good starting point, in list format, for people who want to explore the Vampire myth in other cultures. Merging all this into the main article would be make that article too cumbersome. I also say give the editor more time with prodding tag.

<li><b>Comment</b> If this article were to be straightened up a bit, I would gladly withdraw this nomination. But at the moment I see a number of problems with it. First of all, it shouldn't be named "Vampire species", since there is no such thing as different "species" of vampires, such classifications and distinctions exists only in fiction. <i>Vampires</i> exists only in european folklore (or to be more specific, <i>east</i> european folklore), and nowhere else. Pontianaks, Succubus, Chupacabras or Ghouls, aren't vampires. They descend from different beliefs and legends than vampires. A Pontianak is a Pontianak, and a Succubus is a Succubus. Second, this article feels quite ambigious, since it is said to concern vampires in folklore, but at the same time is listed as a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_fiction.html" title="Horror fiction">horror</a>-related stub. And without boundaries between fiction and folklore, it is bound to become crufty with information gathered from fictional as well as folkloristic and mythological sources - There are many differences between vampires in folklore, and vampires in fiction. That is why there are two separate articles about vampires in those contexts. I don't see a problem with an article concerning fictional "vampire species", though, we can allow a lot more cruftiness (that is how fiction is created and evolves further) when dealing with fiction, than when writing about folklore and mythology. But in folklore, there is no such thing as different species of vampires. /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 19:52, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said on the talk page, I know the article needs work. For some reason you think the page should be canned simply because I choose a name for it that some one googling Vampire Species would be able to find. If I had titled it Blood Drinking Creatures of World Wide Folklore and Mythology, I highly doubt many people would be able to find it. I also have noticed that the main Vampire page is part of the WikiHorror project. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVilaWolf_febe.html" title="User:VilaWolf">Vila</a> 07:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have done some editing / rewrite to this article that will hopefully clear up some confusion as to the nature of this man's "claim to fame" if you will. It's not perfect, but I think it's better than the original. Sorry if I'm new to this whole process.. I am just started to become more active on Wikipedia and really want to be a good Wikipedian and contribute all that I can. I'm sorta new to editing.. but I understand the principles and ideas behind Wikipedia and I can see both sides of the argument here, but I really think that the accomplishments of Eversman are worthy enough of a small mention on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is the worlds first internet feature film. Name another film where all communications were done online, by people who were not qualified, had no experiance and had no budget. The experiance was gained not through college, not through University but through the internet. Its composers, special effects artists, editors, cameraman and even actors were all obtained online. Its production log was updated weekly with video, music, acting and editing, giving back to the people and the sites who helped create the film. Upon the films release it was hosted exclusively online and for free, once again giving back what had been taken. The film would not be possible if it were not for the internet. Cheap low-budge or not, a feature on this size (over 100 individuals and websites contributed to the 75 minute film) has never been completed before. If you can prove otherwise then I shall retract my claim. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBign2003_ed51.html" title="User:Bign2003">Joe</a> 17:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have just read an article and interview at the BBC website as well as a lot of other positive response online. The film is an internet first and many agree. The amateur use of Green Screen technology has no doubt influenced scores of other amateur film makers to put their ideas on to tape. This does not appear to be an advertisement or anything tricky.

So when she/he personally attacked me and my comment, I retaliated. I get the feeling that Crossmr takes pleasure in doing these deletions. I hope that you reprimand Crossmr as she/he is obviously a well experienced wikipedia person. I am just getting started. I was actually very shocked to have my comments rubbished by a bitter person like that. Next time I retaliate against a personal attack from someone such as Crossmr, I will try not to roast them as badly as I did in my comments.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've just looked this up as we were learning about it in my Film course at The University of Kent. We were actually encouraged to download it. I knew that it would be on Wikipedia, but to be deleted? I was weary about leaving a KEEP comment because if you look up, you will see that everytime someone leaves a KEEP comment there is a follow up that tries to trash the POSITIVE people. What is with that? Some very hateful, upset people on Wikipedia. It's hard to fathom. This is a great film. Everyone in my class is well aware of it. The film is not racist, political, hateful or mean, yet there are such mean comments and spiteful sentiments above. It's very odd. Bad vibes boys! cheer up! This article is a keeper! This film has sold more copies of Adobe Premiere than Adobe could ever hope to! Only notable independent film makers make it on to the BBC website. Good film. Good company. Seem like nice guys... and yes, they've made themselves famous! KEEP! A <i><b>fervent keep</b></i> or a <i><b>strenuos keep</b></i>! haha. P.S. If someone is going to follow up my comment with a snide remark, then I'm going to have to assume that this is not a genuine delete but probably someone with some score to settle against someone that had something to do with this film. The comments on this page are pretty rude.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Justin, you seem to be new here. So, first, please don't attack people personally here (trashing the positive people). It's one of the wikipedia policies. Second, please read the guidelines on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> to figure out what constitutes an article that can be kept on Wikipedia. Third, it could be the best film in the world, but if we can't verify it (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) then we can't keep it, as anybody could write the same thing about their film. That being said, the BBC source seems to have merit. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2006/03/21/joseph_tan_feature.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2006/03/21/joseph_tan_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> is the article, so I'm going to say <b>Keep</b> as well, with a note saying that it should be cleaned up (notably, "first internet movie" - that's a clearly false statement). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 20:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi COLOURBURST! Thanks for your constructive criticism. I honestly do not want to hurt anyones feelings are day anything nasty, but I had a read of the page before I left my comment and it is shocking how the NOs seem to love deleting! Yeh... the internet's first movie? Not so sure about that one either. There are some grammar problems in the article, but the movie is well known and that's pretty good considering it's been released this year. Perhaps it WAS the first FULL-LENGTH internet film... I have no idea. My <i><b>KEEP</b></i> was because I have personally learned/heard about the film in Uni and the BBC have picked it up and they seemed to wnat to further the film's success so good on em! Also, the film is FREE so I can't see this article being a SELLING tool... although drug dealers always give the first one free too! oops bad joke! Look... these guys did some breakthrough stuff and I felt that the comments on this page really were too far gone. Some spiteful people. That's all. I expected to see the words KEEP or DELETE and then the reason, but you get a bunch of bitter nonsense. Is Crossmr real admin? Seems like a kid.</li>

<dd>This user added a lot of information around this. Notably the director and the company involved (Which appears to be the director and a few individuals). The directors page was removed before and then recreated, I believe the companies as well (I know the directors for sure, I have a hard time remembering which stuff gets recreated on my watch list, and this was around a week ago). I believe this was the first time this one was created, it was put up for speedy but an admin decided to err on the side of caution since it made a vague claim to notability (which the author has yet to support even though he said he would). The piece was proded, prod was removed, and now we're here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:48, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't see any PERSONAL ATTACKS within my comments and believe that the warning has no merit or platform, but I will refrain from making any statements about Crossmr again. Obviously you cannot rebute a personal attack made by admin. seems unfair, but ok. I'll play along. Sorry to anyone offended.</p>
<p>Colourburst, this page has been deleted before? how can you see that? Is it the same nominator? can't wikipedia prevent repeats? deleted articles from coming back? 6 month block on a deleted article's title or anything?</p>
<p>This film is known amongst the film community everywhere. Kent Uni is not the only course using it as a reference.</p>
<p>You only have to type it into Google to see that there are more than 'a few' reviews, articles and references.</p>

<li>No I'm not an admin, I have no idea where you got that impression. Any user can leave appropriate warning templates on another users talk page. Articles are only protected from recreation in the case of frequent recreation. I.e. its deleted, and recreated shortly there after, deleted and recreated again. Usually after 2 quick recreates its protected from recreation for awhile. Regarding personal attacks, the general attitude of your first comment was uncivil and aggressive and clear on who it was directed at.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Question? On my page, yes I have many links on my own pages abou t myself, I re-wrote this as tastefully and truthfully as I could, can this be put up or edited without deletion please? I have not promoted, spammed, just kept it straight. There are certain things here THAT ARE NOT VERIFIABLE, for instance my playing giutar with Inner Circle for 2 years 1985-1987 I was never given credit That IS WHY i left the band&gt; most people however know I did, I could really care less since I wasn't treated fairly by the band, so I just mention it because it was a well known diversified band that I did play with and recorded on their albums. What needs changed please? AND IF you take a look at Bruce Hornsbys' site ( association on my site) you will see there are links and many artist put their linkjs, I am reluctant to do this seems everytime I may do something I am up for deletion, warm me please what I should do Thank you Billy Yeager <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mograbber (<a href="../../../m/o/g/User_talk%7EMograbber_c288.html" title="User talk:Mograbber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mograbber_b0ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mograbber">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete again</b>. As far as I can tell, this "master meme" hasn't spread particularly far. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">proposed Wikipedia requirements for Internet memes</a> require that the meme be "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the meme itself". This doesn't appear to be the case; a Google search turns up this very article in first place, a couple of the sites on which the "dialectic" is presented, a brief discussion of the subject on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Randi_0c19.html" title="James Randi">randi.org</a> forums, in which it is quickly dismissed as "meaningless blarney", two blog entries presenting it as a random link without comment, and a bunch of unrelated hits containing the words "OS 0 1 2" out of context. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 22:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>* It already won two OVERTURN and KEEPS last week on wiki in a special hearing on the matter. one from a computer scientist who is qualified to vote on such things. The actual entry is not 'master meme', or meme of any nature, so I dont see how the wiki policiy on notable memes even applies based on the articles content, 'master meme' is simply a term that is used on the homepage to creatively market the project, OS 012 is not just notable for it being a meme, it is notable because it addresses online communication into a formal system, recieving peer review from the appropiate communities that it was designed for (such as the P2P foundation). The entry is about a dialectic for online discussion, noting a very similar process to what wikipedia uses on the AfD, and this process is already used by thousands of people all over the world. Right now, a paper is underway to submit the formal logical and dialectical system of OS 012 to wikipedia to improve the AfD process. Secondly, try doing another google search, as well as blog search, as OS 012, as well as O 1 2, and you will see for yourself chatter on the internet about it in blogs and discussion forums. Also, try other search engines. Thirdly, your completely misrepresenting the Randi forum; i.e. you are mistreating the information. It wasn’t even a discussion about OS 012, it was an informal discussion regarding a physicist who is taking the randi challenge, and even if it was, read it and note that the only comment on it that it received was that it was 'interesting'. There has been a off-line publication from England that wrote a story about OS 012 a few years back, in addition to another journal who is publishing something on it in a few months, again from England. There are also a few mutations of the idea on the net as provided in the bottom section of the page. It is also listed on the P2P foundation wiki by invitation. This system of logic and dialectic may increasingly become more relevant as more and more internet users communicate or resolve disputes via email or online forums The community suporting it may be small for now, as is P2P culture in general, but since the idea is spreading over the internet, a third person POV on the matter is both informative and helpful. A few google searches a day turn up on the source page of people researching OS 012 on the internet, and these can be provided as proof if anyone wishes. <a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>* SJK, since this page has already been discussed and that issue addressed, as well as overturned, can you explain how you came to the conclusion that it is original research and not-notable? I ask that you address this point. I find many wiki editors assuming things a bit too quickly, having knee jerk reactions, and many are simply unfamiliar with Open Source concepts or P2P culture. Simply , your point is not valid, and if your decision to delete was based on that, I respectfully ask that you reconsider. Wikipedia is not a democracy, and knee jerk reactions to vote things off simply is not a justification for deleting a relevant entry.<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

I called for a fair hearing on this topic, and it PASSED. This second AfD process is faulted heavily in this regard. I shall resubmit this page in the future after the proper submission to wikipedia has been made to use OS 012 to assist in the AfD.

<li>I'm not accusing you of deception, just going about this the wrong way, like so many other authors of OR who try to promote it here. It's unfortunate that we have to occasionally hurt a determined editor's feelings to enforce policies, but that's life. "What relevancy"? In both cases, it's called independent sourcing. Referring me to forum posts by <a href="http://theabsolute.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=825&amp;start=0&amp;sid=516e66902d555b1035f5e7d9e9744031" class="external text" title="http://theabsolute.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=825&amp;start=0&amp;sid=516e66902d555b1035f5e7d9e9744031" rel="nofollow">Bubblefish, AKA TUmbleman</a> doesn't add anything to your own say-so.

<li>You have most certainly accused me of deception if I take the objective meaning of your words in this exchange. You dont respond to points made by myself ever, you dont retract false statements made by yourself after the fact. Secondly, when did I refer to you to that discussion forum? Never, that's a strawman. Going about this the wrong way? I requested a fair hearing on the topic already, a much stricter process than this, and this page won it's entry. Thirdly, I admit that I personally have done research on this project, but that personal research is not the source of the project, yet you continually reinforce that issue over and over.When I give examples of indepedent sourcing, they are ignored. My feelings are not hurt, I am simply frustrated by what I have determined to be an unfair hearing on the topic. What is the point of having a fair hearing and winning when the next day, those who disagree simply return it to the same place they pesonally wished the topic to be? If I am mistaken about you, Gazpacho, then you would retract many of your off comments here, and you havent. Same thing on the Human Union entry, i requested you change your vote to a re-write based on our argument, and you simply ignored my request even though your points were addressed/rebutted rationally and respectfully. Again, this process here is faulted. At least it becomes more apparent that Wikipedia use something like the framework of OS 012 to come to consensus. My point is that if people are searching for this on google, which I recieve about 10-15 unique hits a week from google searches on the topic, it makes sense to have a third party point of view on the topic, especially when the dialectic is accepted in communties that promote P2P culture. No one addresses that issue, they simply keep their blinders on and refuse rational discourse. The No Original Research policy is here to discourage quakery, and the applications inside of this dialectic, such as game theory and a formal system of logic, are not original research. <a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

<li>Aha. I didn't notice that it was split out because people felt the main article was too long (is that a fair assessment?). However it still is entirely without references to where this information comes from, either a) the fact that these animals do other things in real life (which could be verified by linking to their Wikipedia articles, I think), or b) that they do these inaccurate things in the game (for which you'll need some outside, reliable, published source). And if you do find that source, perhaps it would be better to link to that review/blog post from the main <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoo_Tycoon_34bb.html" title="Zoo Tycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a> article when you talk about criticisms/inaccuracies there?

<li>All the statements in the article are what real-life animals are supposed to do (or not do) instead of not doing (or doing). The main reason it was split from the main article was that some people thought that if we focus on inaccuracies in the main article, the object of the game would be lost, since people would focus on inaccuracies instead of gameplay. The solution was to make a separate article for the inaccuracies. Explanation complete.

<li>Actually, your 'basic' options on AfD are "Keep" or "Delete". Merge, redirect, or split are all sometimes options in special cases, but the end decision comes down to whether you keep the page, or delete it from view. Merge, in particular, is tricky because it can be taken as either a "keep" or "get rid of it" if you're not clear in your explanation. "Disagree" isn't really one of the options... -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 21:59, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>- I really don't have a strong opinion on this one, but I do want to point out a few things about <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cook_County%2C_Illinois_bf0c.html" title="Cook County, Illinois">Cook County</a> (the county into which Chicago falls). The county has 5.4 million people, which makes it more populous than 30 of the 50 states, it also has the 19th largest government (of any kind) in the country. The Cook County board controls a budget of $2.7 billion, and has the power to levy all sorts of taxes (which they do frequently). I could go on, but my point is that Cook County board members are arguably more influential (and notable) than the vast majority of state legislators; and there does seem to be consensus that state legislators are notable enough to merit an article. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 07:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - local (city/county/muncipality/shire/parish/whatnot) politicians are in general not notable. However, when the locality is sufficiently significant (e.g. has lots of people), I would say they are notable. In this case, I would say members of a 17-member county board governing a 5.4 million person county are notable. (Whereas, the board members of a county with 50,000 would probably not be notable.) --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 09:55, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> points well taken. As I have said, I will be more than happy to accept any consensus that emerges in this debate. The counter-point I would offer to the above is that the responsibilities of a county board (even one of such considerable size) are not the same as those of small-state legislatures because the latter have legislative power. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the creator of this article, I would like to respond to the rationale for deleting it. I have completely rewritten the article from a "shell/stub" into a "stub/start" to address your concerns; please read the new article. I propose to use this article (and others in backward succession) to provide a much-needed chronology of Native American and Polynesian peoples within the present political boundaries of the United States of America, including its territories. Because the 14th century apparently was one of decline due to rapid climate change and the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ice_Age_3232.html" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a>, I had difficulty finding "events" to include in this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia contains many articles--including several linked to the newly rewritten <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century_in_United_States_history_b704.html" title="14th century in United States history">14th century in United States history</a>--based largely upon the archaeological record and even discusses the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologic_time_scale.html" title="Geologic time scale">geologic time scale</a> quite extensively. Chronologies based on the geologic/evolutionary and archaeological record can reveal the course of development of Native American technologies. Archaeologists routinely conduct field expeditions and publish books and scientific journal articles, rendering their findings (while subject to interpretation) as verifiable as any speculative or evolution-based assertions found on Wikipedia. Because the Native Americans in the United States did create cities like <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahokia.html" title="Cahokia">Cahokia</a> in the Midwest and the various Pueblos in the Southwest, the article is neither "useless" nor necessarily "empty" nor inherently "nonsense." <a href="../../../d/u/f/User%7EDufekin_dc04.html" title="User:Dufekin">Dufekin</a> 06:19, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> History of article: First created in May last year, then prodded in May this year. Was re-created in slightly reworded form, so prod contested. The re-creation was then speedied on July 13 as nonsense - which I don't think was the most appropriate. Later, it was speedied as repost. Hence this probably should not be deleted as repost, despite the nomination; let's give it its day(s) at AfD. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 19:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The first article was the result of the work of some contributors (not only me) so I think that the term is needful.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Iceland is unique country. The history, environment, culture and location of this country causes that some reserchers want to group all the sciences about Iceland in the one term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Scientists create neologism every days. They call new stars, new chemical compounds, new plants and new animals. It is normal situation. So the term "icelandology" should be listed in Wikiepdia similar to a new plants names.</dd>
<dd>The term name is build in the same way as "sinology" or other country-sciences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Geography is the only part of the icelandology, because icelandology include also humanistic sciences. Geography is too narrow science to use in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because we are scientists and we study all problems about Iceland, we call ourselves "icelandologists". This simple name is enough good to describe what we are doing and what we are interested in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Icelandology seems to be a perfect term for such purposes and we use it from some years in Poland (Polish: islandologia).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Occurence in Google is not a proof that new scientific word should not be included in Wikipedia. New chemical compounds are very often described only in one article, but it is not a reason to forbid publication in Wikiepdia.</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep and move</b> to Icelandic studies. No reason to delete just because of the title. There are in fact plenty of area study disciplines like this one.

<dd>I would agree with the move idea, except that as it stands, the article would have little or no meaningful/distinct content once the Icelandology neologism/protologism is removed. The article could be "XXXX studies" of any country - an entirely generic description of the broadest possible research coverage in a country context, without any specifics. Of course there are many area/culure studies disciplines, but they have specifics. If it is moved, I would suggest <b>stubifying</b> the article, or <b>totally rewriting</b> the current content. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Creating any unnecessary term by connecting a word with -ology is senseless of course. But in the case when the term may be used instead of other many words, it is useful, advantageous and justified. The "icelandic study" refers to language study only.

If Thingbox's entry goes, I think these two sites' entries should also go. <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaydar.html" title="Gaydar">gaydar</a> is a purely commercial site, and <a href="../../../o/u/t/OUTeverywhere_baf9.html" title="OUTeverywhere">OUTeverywhere</a> has a form of restricted use unless one buys a subscription, Thingbox is, at the moment, free for anyone to use, and so seems to be more in the spirit of such sites like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 09:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thingbox has become a part of the culture of <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> online interaction, particularly in the UK, and as long as similar website communities are documented on Wikipedia, so must Thingbox. It is one of those strange cultural phenomena which resists clarity of description under Wikipedia's strict guidelines for articles. But if a website which constitutes such a disctinctive embodiment, and contibution to, the development of <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_communities.html" title="Online communities">online communities</a> (in technological <i>and</i> cultural terms) is absent from Wikipedia, then Wikipedia is not doing its job. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.27.65.111 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.27.65.111_cfac.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.27.65.111">contribs</a>) 07:25, July 17, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If it is reasonable to document other gay community websites I see no reason why Thingbox should be any different. It is distinguishable from other websites by its open, unmoderated format, and while it is a small website it is gaining in popularity. Deleting the article now will not prevent users from resubmitting it at a later date when the site is larger and more popular. Therefore I believe it makes more sense to keep it now, rather than postpone the inevitable. (ajwazzer) tablet_eraser 21:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't say there are a lot of sockpuppets per se, but many new Wikipedia accounts and several older ones who haven't edited in a while suddenly showing up to participate here. That suggests someone is campaigning on Thingbox itself for Thingbox members to press for retention. AfD campaigning of any kind is considered a no-no; see also the "Meatpuppet" discussion at <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. Closing admin should examine the contrib history of all participants and weight accordingly.

<dd>* PHR: you assert that 'many new ... accounts ... showing up to participate here'. This simply isn't true. I'm afraid that both you and "The Stig" have fallen into what Edward de Bono calls the "Must-Be" error. Because you have seen Puppetry before where unfamiliar accounts appear on an Articles for Deletion page, you think you see it here. That is understandable. It is not the case and can be shown not to be the case. To do as GWO has done and libel these people is also understandable, but it is vile and corrosive. That you, PHR, appear to have fallen in with this I can only account for by a moment of inattention ... and it is the vulnerability of the editing process to what amount to unintentional personal attacks such as GWO's that is so distressing.</dd>

<li>""Comment" The assertation in your analogy that this article is purely for the benefit of the subject of the article has little merit - any proper article benefits Wikipedia. That this article was created as a result of the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_on_rails.html" title="Ruby on rails">Ruby_on_rails</a> article should stand some way towards showing the deciding admin that this is not an act of spam or aggressive commercialism.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I've logged onto this website and found the forums urging people to vote in favour of keeping this article. There is probably sock puppetry going on too. As a result, this entry will probably get more keeps than deletes. The number of unregistered comments (and keep votes from people without day to day editing experience of wikipedia) suggest this is being portrayed as a vote. However, the AFD process is not a vote - its a balancing act. Clearly this article does not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If we were being very flexible and allowing Alexa to have a say in this, we can even see then that the website is not notable at all. Other LGBT websites such as gaydar and out are notable by their size, press commentry and, as such, meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Thingbox does not. One day it might. But for the moment, Thingbox is not encylopaedic at all. --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think you have elided away from the point, <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">User:alphachimp</a>, or at least as far as the events are significant to me.</p>
<p>The objector made a direct accusation without supplying any supporting evidence. As I know that several of the contributors to the AfD page are distinct carbon-based humanoids, he has libeled them all. Furthermore, he has brought the discussion to a halt by libelling any subsequent contributor who opposes deletion. I am not, by using a legal term, advising a legal remedy -- that way madness and bankruptcy lie! I am simply pointing out that there is a reason in law why it is wrongful to make false accusations and I would ask you to point me to the appropriate rememdy within Wikipedia for an unsupported accusation against fellow contributors.</p>
<p>A bun-fight on the AfD page is not a satisfactory remedy.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">User:GWO</a> must either present evidence to support his claim or retract it. How do I invoke this challenge?</p>
<p>The objector's posting was directly responsible for my NOT putting forward a new argument in favour of retention. What am I to do to prevent being subject to this 'prior restraint' which he has invoked?</p>
<p>FYI - the original posting:</p>
<pre>
   * Delete, nn website indulging in shocking sock puppetry. -- GWO
</pre>
<p>May I also clarify my motivations:</p>
<p>it is not 'offence' or 'indignation' at having been bullied out of an AfD. It is the fact that the actions of a contributor on an AfD page have been highly disruptive to the editing process. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.35.164.244 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.35.164.244_0f86.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.35.164.244">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi, you might read <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Accounts_created_by_brand_new_users_acting_together_.28.27meatpuppets.27.29" title="WP:SOCK">this section</a> of the page about sockpuppet policy to understand what GWO was referring to. Basically, AfD's are supposed to be discussions within the regular Wikipedia editing community; newcomers (especially those who show up specifically for some single discussion) are welcome to participate but their conclusions are traditionally given less weight (or none) when determining consensus. In this instance I think that should also apply to nonactive accounts that suddenly woke up for this discussion. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, what would you say was "nonactivity"? Remember, you probably have to be precise to avoid bringing about even more problems. For example, I made a few edits before, when I first joined, and then was away, abroad (in China) where access was difficult and eventually blocked for many months. In fact, whilst I was away I consciously used some of this time to gather more information which I hoped, and am intending, to use to expand a few entries concerning places in China (<a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhangjiajie.html" title="Zhangjiajie">Zhangjiajie</a> and Zhangjiajie City to name just two instances.) I think a whole new can of worms could be opened up if this idea of "nonactive" accounts is suddenly applied without prior warning. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 11:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikilawyering_fdcf.html" title="WP:Wikilawyering">WP:Wikilawyering</a> is not a good strategy. No, I don't need to be precise, there are no set rules, we are allowed to react to situations as they arise, and the closing admin will read over the different comments and then use their discretion and wisdom to do something sensible. The admins are not robots who are constrained to follow formulas; we delegate them the authority to handle these things as judgement calls when necessary, because we trust their judgement.
<p>It looks to me like you made an account, played with it a little, and abandoned it, a very common fate of Wikipedia accounts (something like 3/4 of them have never edited at all). Then someone brought this AfD to the attention of Thingbox members and you came over from there. Please do edit some of the China articles (and anything else that interests you) but until you actually do participate like that (rather than merely intending to), we have to think of you as a non-participant. Also, even if you had been editing regularly, the mere act of coming over because of an external campaign is itself reason to make adjustments (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">here</a>); it's just easier to infer what likely happened, given your contrib history. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, it is interesting to read the comments made about people perceived to be "newcomers" in the light of the following section: <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a>, in particular, this passage: "Do not call newcomers disparaging names, such as "meatpuppet". If a lot of newcomers show up on one side of a vote, you should make them feel welcome while explaining that their votes may be disregarded. No name-calling is necessary." Some have done this more than others. I do not count <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">user:Phr</a> as being one of them. Thanks for the explanation, Phr, but I can only reiterate that your inference is, in my case, inaccurate. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 16:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I saw the reception was a bit unfriendly, and that's why I supplied those links that explained the terminology and logic in ways that were hopefully less upsetting. We should have been more conscientious about welcoming newbies even in difficult circumstances; but I hope you can sympathize at least slightly to the reaction we have (especially since this happens quite often) to being jumped on like this. Imagine a few dozen Wikipedians suddenly showing up at Thingbox without knowing anything about Thingbox's culture, trying to get Thingbox to display some article about Wikipedia for Wikipedia's benefit, without regards to Thingbox's usual habits about that kind of article, and expecting to have the same amount of say in such decisions as regular Thingbox participants who had been there for a while. I think it wouldn't go over much better than this AfD has gone.
<p>I see that we agree now that Thingbox doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. See also <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#How not to be a spammer</a> (the "review your intentions" paragraph), understand that Wikipedia is in the 20 largest web sites on the whole internet, realize we're <i>constantly</i> bombarded by people trying to sell products or gain notoriety by putting stuff in front of our readers because they know the value of that much advertising, and understand that we know exactly what it is that they want. It's a perpetual battle to stick to our goal of being an encyclopedia and not an advertising service and we very frequently have to tell (e.g.) up-and-coming musicians claiming to be on the verge of "making it" to come back <i>after</i> they've made it, not before. This is pretty similar--if the article gets deleted, I advise waiting a few months and examining the guidelines before trying again (assuming you meet the guidelines by then, which you very well might), and don't organize a campaign, those (as you see) tend to go over badly. I hope that helps you understand the situation a little better. -- <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 18:08, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>hello - i don't quite know how to post this but - well the thing is - i find the idea of suppressing the existance of the thingbox site rather sinister - and very sad given that it is a community site that exists for gay and lesbian people to better be able to get in touch with each other. Given the extremeness of the slightness of some entries on Wiki - and given that nobody is being forced to the info on Thingbox - I can only conclude that the wish to have it removed is for political or vindictive reasons - and frankly the idea that that sort of behaviour should be successful would be a tragedy for the Wiki. Thanks for reading this. *</li>

<dd>Thingbox, like other social networking "sites" does not merit inclusion because of the notoriety of it's web-only content. It merits an article because of the social activity of human communities bound through on-line communication. Like geographically-bound communities, there is not the same threshold of notability -- Wikipedia would not delete an article about a village because it was not frequently mentioned in the press, or was not utterly unique. Thingbox merits inclusion as one of many LGBT social networking communities in just the same way as Saxmundham merits inclusion as one of a number of Suffolk geographic communities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should be sufficient to demonstrate that a sufficiently distinct activity took place, involving a significant number of people over a significant period of time for the activity to merit inclusion. This is not a static website and it is not the content per se which is notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What must be supplied, however, is satisfactory references i.e. the article should not be 'autobiography' or 'original research'.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm always surprised by how much ire this page draws. Really, what is a "Good Lord Delete"? How on earth can a <i>title</i> be unencyclopedic? For a topic which is supposedly "not notable", it is noteworthy to me for being the page I'm forced to defend the most against attacks which <i>don't reference problems with the content</i>. Yes, as Pboyd04 linked, there has already been a Delete flagging of this article. Since then, the content hasn't really changed since then except to <i>increase</i> the number of inline references. Can I say again:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This article is not "original research". It plainly lists 17 references which define the term both implicitly and explicitly and certainly detail <i>all</i> of the attributes listed in the article. Most can be clicked on and read. Go ahead, try it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just did an edit to integrate the references into the text. The number of references is down to 15 but given that most sentences now have a source attached, I think this argument is probably more true than it was before. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisgoo_6d27.html" title="User:Mattisgoo">Mattisgoo</a> 15:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Many of the <i>Delete</i> votes here claim the article is not "encylopedic" and yet want the page merged into Fan criticism of George Lucas which is currently labelled "this article or section may require cleanup" and is little more than a list of gripes.</li>
<li>Further against the merge: Fan criticism of George Lucas is <i>actually</i> "original research". It lists only 5 references, all copied from Lucas Bashing, and all are actually about Lucas Bashing.</li>
<li>Fan cruft is a valid argument although the determination remains difficult. That peer reviewed research papers define, examine and discuss the term (Elana Sheffrin, "Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and participatory fandom: mapping new congruencies between the internet and media entertainment culture", Critical Studies in Media and Communication, Pages 261 - 281, Volume 21, Number 3, September 2004) would indicate a penetration outside the fan community.</li>
<li>Bush Bashing was deleted for the reason "Contains no information beyond what is implicit in the title" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bush_bashing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bush_bashing" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. Lucas Bashing details attributes, nostalgia, flaming -- root causes, significance, ad hominem, etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Vandalism, POV disputes and Delete debates on this page which never do more than cry "not encyclopedic", "original research" and "inherently biased" make supporting controversial pages on Wikipedia extremely hard -- they are just names insulting the page rather than arguments about the content. Never do people say: this paragraph doesn't give a source. Never has anyone said: the core idea is supposed to be X but you drift off into Y. Never do I see: this source has been discredited. Actually, most people on the talk page seem convinced that this page gives no sources. The only assumption can be that people vote against the page because the title offends them or the whole concept offends them because I've never seen an argument over the content.</dd>
<dd>It's not the most significant topic on Wikipedia, nor does it need to be. It's not the best written article on Wikipedia, nor does it need to be. It is adequately referenced and yet gets nothing but grief from often irrational posters (read Talk:Lucas_bashing some time). I really think that deleting this page would be a win for censorship and motivated fans against the efforts of people trying to support topics with research and facts.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisgoo_6d27.html" title="User:Mattisgoo">Mattisgoo</a> 03:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These "original research" comments are puzzling in light of the journal papers and other resources cited (excluding fan forum links of course). Given the existance of these sources, discussion and analysis of this topic clearly exists outside Wikipedia. Please (re)read the article and supporting references before making a call for deletion or merging. If after (re)reading the article in detail there remains anything that is unreferenced, please make a note of it on the talk page. These blanket "original research" statements without highlighting specific areas does not help make Wikipedia a better encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>As has previously been mentioned on the first deletion discussion, the Fan criticism of George Lucas page was created to remove unreferenced material from the Lucas Bashing page. I doubt that anyone who suggests merging has actually had a good look at Lucas Bashing and Fan criticism of George Lucas; while the former is well researched and well written, the latter is just a collection of fans' complaints about the Lucas films and is unsupported and unreferenced.Zukeeper 12:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to voice a strong objection to the manner in which Delete votes are being cast (and it's not supposed to be a vote):
<dl>
<dd><i>No argument has been made against the content of the article yet</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>These are the assertions made (without reference to the article itself) against the article so far:
<ul>
<li>"This would parallel how Bush Bashing was handled"</li>
<li>"non-notable topic"/"fan cruft"</li>
<li>"not encyclopedic"</li>
<li>"Neologism"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Yet none of these points have attempted to support themselves with evidence. Here is why none of them actually work as arguments:
<ul>
<li>On Bush Bashing, juding only from the deletion votes (since the article is no longer accessible):</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Bush Bashing had no information beyond the title.</li>
<li>It had nothing to offer about the bashers or the individuals involved.</li>
<li>There is already an adequately written page on Bush criticism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>By contrast, this article:
<ul>
<li>Details the evolution of the community which has led to the schism</li>
<li>Point out why the schism is interesting (an ongoing divide between otherwise like-minded fans)</li>
<li>Only mentions the existence of criticism in 2 sentences and has no overlap with the totally unreferenced, questionably neutral, significantly unstructured, Fan criticism of George Lucas article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>On notability, I quote (from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>) "notability is not formal policy", and it is generally considered that anything "based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research" is notable enough. It's generally accepted that a number of references from different sources are required. This article has 1 research paper from a large journal (plus one on bashing more generally), 2 print newspapers, 4 large online news sources, plus some dozen sundries. The article has also never suffered from a lack of regular edits, changes, comments about content and reliability and POV discussions in its 8 month history; again supporting the argument that it is notable enough.</li>
<li><i>Not encyclopedic isn't an argument</i>, just a vote since it can't be determined what you mean by it as a statement. This is supposed to be an <i>effort to reach concensus</i>. Since almost all Deleters here so far have a history of participating in delete discussions, you would think that you should all know better by now. Giving you the benefit of the doubt that you mean every test in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is failed, let's look at them all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Not a paper encyclopedia" -- well the article isn't too long.</li>
<li>"Not a dictionary" -- the article does define the term but it goes into details that fit well outside a dictionary's scope.</li>
<li>"Not a puplisher of original thought". Again:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>1 journal paper which spends 3 paragraphs defining and analyzing the two camps of "Lucas bashers" and "Lucas gushers"</li>
<li>2 print newspapers, one which defines the term explicitly and looks at the community</li>
<li>4 online news sources, two of which explicitly define the term.</li>
<li>Almost a dozen other sources, explicitly defining the term, some of which go into great detail about "fan schisms", basher and gusher motivations, traits, etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Not a soapbox" -- this isn't an ad for anything. The assertion has been made that the article is trying to "invent" the term. Read the dates on the sources, the term plainly predates the creation of this article.</li>
<li>"Repository of links" -- no.</li>
<li>"Indiscriminate collection of information" -- no.</li>
<li>"Crystal ball" -- no.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, on "Neologism": "Lucas bashing" and "Lucas gushing" are fan community terms and they are not authoritative. "Lucas" is often omitted or replaced with "Star Wars" and this is mentioned in the article. The term are used in the journal paper and both newspaper sources which would satisfy <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">Articles on neologisms</a>. Even were this not the case, I would argue that the article is not about the term but the behaviour of the fan community and the rift that formed over changes and additions to it's base.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So finally, <i>make an argument</i> people! You're supposed to be writing an encyclopedia and few of you are forming complete sentences (I know that's a rude thing to say but the quality of the delete votes is seeming absurd to me and it's frustrating). Show a little good faith about trying to reach a concensus. By simply <i>voting</i> for deletion, or raising points so broad and unfounded that it amounts to a vote, you're violating <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> in a misguided attempt to uphold <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mattisgoo, consensus does not mean complete agreement; here, there is no need to "reach" a consensus, as it clearly exists already, namely that this page doesn't belong in Wikipedia. The main point that you seem to be missing is that Star Wars is basically not a big deal. Join the consensus, or don't join it, but please stop spamming refutations to arguments that have been made only in your imagination; the only effect is to make this page more difficult to read, which may irritate the the adjudicator but will not change their decision. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 02:04, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> With respect, I see no evidence for your assertion that "[consensus] exists already". As Mattisgoo has already stated, this is not a vote, so simply saying "Delete" or "Redirect" without supporting evidence, and without any indication that the voter has actually taken the time to read the article, does not indicate in any way shape or form that consensus has been reached. I have not read anything on this page that I would consider as reasonable justification for a deletion. As for your request that Mattisgoo "stop spamming refutations to arguments that have been made only in [his/her] imagination", I believe that he has quoted "Rehcsif" on "This would parallel how Bush Bashing was handled", yourself on "non-notable topic", "Nick Y" on "fan cruft", "Pboyd04" on "not encyclopedic" and "Trialsanderrors" on "Neologism". He has gone through each of the statements and refuted each argument with reference to various Wikipedia policies, presenting his arguments for why this article does not meet the criteria for deletion. May I suggest that if you wish to continue with your argument that this article should be deleted, you could go through the Wikipedia criteria for deletion and give examples from the Lucas bashing page that meet these criteria. Zukeeper 02:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree. I also feel that neither m nor Z really understands the concept of consensus.. they seem to feel that it means "persuading everybody", whereas the normal meaning is "overwhelming agreement" (as is the case here). As a tiny minority, the burden is certainly on you to demonstrate why "Lucas Bashing" should be in WP, but m's attitude has merely been to argue (at gargantuan length) that removing it would be unjust. Z's implication that voters who didn't leave a comment may not have read the article carefully enough to reach an opinion is nothing other than an imputation of bad faith, and it has been noted. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 07:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

IMHO, this is a corrolary of Wikipedia is not a how-to manual, meaning Wikipedia is not for game walkthroughs. This article isn't a walkthrough. Information of issues like design and gameplay is exactly what we should be covering in the computer and video games project.

<li>If you look on google and type "Angry Nintendo Nerd" you'll see there's considerable interest in him.

The reason I mention this is there are those who seem to be implying that he's orchestrating this for self promotion. If that's so how is he able to know all of these different languages? The problem with most people trying to see this as relevant is that he's reviewing old nintendo games. The reason I see this as supporting his staying on here is that I don't see how it hurts to associate him with the obscure games he's reviewing. The "google test" seems to show his popularity, it'll be more than a stub since his reviews keep expanding, he has a cult following, and there's no downside to having him on. Another "nerd" who is on wikipedia, and I believe rightfully so, is <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brecher_4fcc.html" title="Gary Brecher">Gary Brecher</a> also known as the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Nerd_82b0.html" title="War Nerd">War Nerd</a>. He pretty much does the same thing but he's an expert on wars rather than old nintendo games. Richard Cane 03:48, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Google test alone isn't sufficient to warrant inclusion, there must be some other claim to notability. To take the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Nerd_82b0.html" title="War Nerd">War Nerd</a> for instance, his article shows that he's writing a book and has been referenced on Fox News. A closer parallel is <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Man_Murray_3334.html" title="Old Man Murray">Old Man Murray</a>, but again he has a greater degree of notability (having been referenced by the founder of Valve, and though it's not mentioned in the article the team were also investigated by the Secret Service). You'll also notice that as far as the Google test goes both the War Nerd (173,000 unique hits for "War Nerd" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22War+Nerd%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22War+Nerd%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>) and Old Man Murray (103,000 unique hits for "Old Man Murray" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Old+Man+Murray%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Old+Man+Murray%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>) considerably outrank the Angry Nintendo Nerd (20,500 unique hits for "Angry Nintendo Nerd" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22Angry+Nintendo+Nerd%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22Angry+Nintendo+Nerd%22" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>). So the Google test is not convincing on its own, and I still don't see anything notable about this individual that warrants inclusion aside from the fact that his reviews are popular within a certain community. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 12:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That book hasn't surfaced after nearly two years after it was announced and the Fox News mention is extremely recent. His article's creation on Wikipedia even predated the controversy with Victor Hanson. Did the creator of that article somehow predict all of the notoriety he was to receive when it was made? It seems to me that person saw somebody who was gaining popularity and decided to post about him on here. And you're forgetting that the Angry Nintendo Nerd is writing about old nintendo games. It's not going to have widespread appeal based on the subject matter but that doesn't mean he's any less relevant in regard to what he's talking about. It's a niche audience but the point is he does have one and it's considerable enough to warrent mentioning him on here. Old Man Murray has been around since 1999 and Gary Brecher has been writing articles since 2002. The Angry Nintendo Nerd has been doing this for about three months according to the signup date for his character on his myspace page so comparing those numbers only proves my point that he's gaining widespread popularity in a short amount of time. --Richard Cane 06:38, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest re-creating the article when Mr Nerd becomes notable outside of a niche audience, then. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 06:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you want to talk numbers lets look at the Angry Nintendo Nerds YouTube count alone. 128,749 then add to that screw attacks versions of the ANN nerd videos 92524. That doesn't even include other sites he is featured on like gametrailers.com and others. Hey, but who's counting? Solarman 03:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since when has "number of videos uploaded to Youtube" been a good indication of how encyclopaedia worthy an individual is? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 18:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You were the one who started dropping numbers, not me. But I agree. The numbers aren't what's on trial here. Even though the angry nintendo nerd has more views than the War Nerd and Old Man Murray put together. Solarman 15:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I noticed you ignored every other point I made except where I mentioned that reviews for old nintendo games aren't widespread in today's national media. Why do you have such a high standard for a person who makes videos of reviews for old nintendo games? He's become the most notable person at what he's doing. People who are interested in what he's talking about have shown they are willing to watch what he has to say. Why even bother making pages for the old games he's reviewing? Do you really think there's a huge group of people currently playing <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit__%28NES%29_75d6.html" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (NES)">Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_%28video_game%29_edaa.html" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (video game)">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>? Nothing new or interesting has happened in regard to those two games except his recent reviews for them which have been viewed by thousands of people. --Richard Cane 07:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason for ignoring the other points was that I didn't want to get bogged down too much discussing the ins and outs of other articles. I know I did earlier, but I was wrong to do so. Simply put, the content of other articles is irrelevant as to whether this article should be deleted: the criteria are in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and precedent isn't one of them. Only if the other two have been through AfD (and there's no indication that they have) and were kept might there be something relevant to bring up. As things stand all that matters is whether the conditions of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are met, and apart from a relatively unimpressive Google test result I've still seen abdolutely nothing to suggest any of the criteria are met. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 18:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So there are whole new criteria for every different article on Wikipedia? Some articles are ok but some aren't because it's incovenient to discuss their acceptability by comparing them to other articles which have already been established? Sorry, I don't buy it. If you look on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> you'll see that that isn't an exclusionary list and the google test is more than enough for the subject matter involved. Not only that, but he has a cult status and his article is likely to expand beyond a stub which are arguably reasons enough for him to be on here. I'll put it this way, if somebody goes to the games he refers to the odds are they will want to see what he has to say about them. Linking to them does absolutely nothing to hurt the content of this site. But not only will the people who are interested in those games (which are already accepted content on this site) want to see what he has to say but he's shown that even more people are willing to view what he has to say about them even if they aren't interested in that specific topic. If those games can be put on this site his popular opinion regarding them deserve to be on here too. Unless there's some hierarchy that puts biographies above articles featuring old games in importance that I'm not aware of. --Richard Cane 01:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><small>(reindenting)</small>OK, this will be my last comment on the issue here since things seem to be getting dragged out. To answer your points, it's not a case of different standards because the articles in question (as far as I can tell) haven't been put forward to AfD. In other words, no standards whatsoever have been applied; there's no standards regarding what articles can be created, only what articles can pass AfD. I know <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not an exhaustive list, but there still needs to be some claim to wide notability and as things stand I'm just not seeing it. Finally, on the issue of links to his reviews of games, I personally wouldn't have a problem with providing external links at the bottom of the relevant articles; given that it's likely he's the only one to have reviewed them it would seem to fit within <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<li>Richard, I was responding to daduzis comment about the War Nerd and Old Man Murray. I am well aware that those old games are not too important anymore. Part of the joke to the ANN reviews is why would anyone even bother reviewing those old games. People that may go to wikipedia and look up the angry nintendo nerd may want to learn more about the games he reviews however. In which case it's good to have links to those games articles on the ann wiki page. Solarman 04:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Suppose i don't have any interest in say, electronic idm music, that doesn't mean i should vote the deletion of all artists page that sell about 500 copies of their album thru their own indie label. Yet they are probably all worthy of a wikipedia entry. i dont know why this guy, whose clips have been seen by hundreds of thousands of people should be deleted. 206.172.19.90 18:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yes, some of those articles would not survive an AFD. What does that have to do with anything? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 19:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The point was that even though something like idm music which he doesn't care about has an article, it's still there, because there are people that do have an interest in it. Like the angry nintendo nerd, though not every person on earth will have an interest in reading his article, there is a large enough following to warrent his wiki topic. Mike8bit 16:21, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, its there because no one has tried to delete it yet. Like I said, many wouldn't survive AFD. People create articles that don't fit Wikipedia standards all the time. That isn't a valid argument at all.

<li>That's not where his notablity is. It's on sites such as youtube and various gaming websites. This is the part where you'll say to me since when has number of videos uploaded to Youtube been a good indication being worthy of a wiki article?

<li>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde gets 16,600 using the google test <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Dr.+Jekyll+and+Mr.+Hyde%22+NES" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Dr.+Jekyll+and+Mr.+Hyde%22+NES" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? gets 25,200 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Who+Framed+Roger+Rabbit%3F%22+NES" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Who+Framed+Roger+Rabbit%3F%22+NES" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. The Angry Nintendo Nerd has 22,300 which is good enough for the subject matter involved. Again, if those two games can be on here so can the only person on earth doing a video review for them. As for your Alexa search, I chose Bruce Campbell as an example. His offical page <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bruce-campbell.com%2F&amp;url=bruce-campbell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bruce-campbell.com%2F&amp;url=bruce-campbell.com" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> ranks 471,684. The screwattack site is only known for the Angry Nintendo Nerd's rants and if he's able to pull in a third of what a cult star like Bruce Campbell can get on his page then I don't think he's that bad considering he only posts videos about old games. Also, I'd like to point out that their websites do not denote how popular each is at what they do. The Angry Nintendo Nerd's popularity, as Solarman pointed out, is derived mostly from very popular mediums like myspace and youtube. --Richard Cane 19:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do think that the term can contain an element of homophobia/misogyny -- I've certainly seen some people use it in such a manner. (That is not to say that all uses of this term involve homophobia or misogyny -- it all depends on context/intentions.) But in any case, I feel that the fact that people invented this term &amp; spread it is notable. The present article is less than impressive, but I still don't think it should go -- its more than just a dictionary entry. And besides, we have articles on heaps of other pejorative/derisive (or potentially pejorative/derisive) sexual or group terms... I think so long as we can talk about the terms origins, motivations, history, the ways in which it is used, etc., its more than a dicdef. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 09:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
