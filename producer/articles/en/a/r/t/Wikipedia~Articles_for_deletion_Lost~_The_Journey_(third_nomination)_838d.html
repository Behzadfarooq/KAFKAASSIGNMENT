<li><b>Keep</b> -- (<i>obligatory note per Deletion Policy, this article was rewritten by me.</i>) Notability/Significance is established by the episode 1) being the first linear presentation of the <i>Lost</i> story; 2) being the <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nielsen_Ratings_70fa.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">Nielsen Ratings</a> winner in all demographics; 3) having over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=%22lost+the+journey%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=%22lost+the+journey%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">27,000 Google entries for "Lost: The Journey"</a>.

<li>With regards to no. 1: I don't believe, personally, that's sufficient to make it notable.

<li>You're right, and I'll strike through that response. Nevertheless, I still don't think a clip show's notable. I wouldn't run a normal <i>Lost</i> episode article through AfD, or a character article (unless it was something like "Unnamed Extra #5 in Pilot"), but yeah, this at least merits community review. And the "Google test" is a little overused, in my opinion. But whatever. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 21:43, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Of course, that doesn't exactly answer the question that a Google search, irrespective of "unique hits," for "Lost: The Journey" and "ABC" yields 517 hits — and a high Google count isn't unsurprising given that "lost" and "journey" are commonplace English words. Any poem that has something like "Lost, the journey ended" or "Picard said, 'We're lost.' 'The journey's not yet over,' Troi replied." is going to yield one of the 27,000 hits your search produced. The ABC limiter yields a far more accurate representation of how many Google hits the program owns. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Also, with regards to the material quoted, I note the same page states, "More important than having many articles on TV episodes is having good articles on those TV episodes. Therefore, it may not be a good idea to create small articles on every episode of a television show." Furthermore, I see no header identifying whether the quoted material has the strength of an essay (no strength), guideline (medium strength), or policy (full strength). —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 21:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the article has been rewritten to be useful and is now a part of the series of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a> articles. The version that was considered by the previous AFD - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost:_The_Journey&amp;oldid=51191217" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost:_The_Journey&amp;oldid=51191217" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost:_The_Journey&amp;oldid=51191217</a> - was pretty much worthless.

<ul>
<li>How is it useful? And usefulness is <i>not</i> really a criteria for keeping an article, frankly. The AfD on <i>Enterprise'</i>s canonicity problems is a very useful article. But it's all original research, and as much as my personal <i>taste</i> would prefer to have it around, it doesn't meet Wikipedia's qualifications. It was rewritten and looks better — admittedly — but it still doesn't seem to be a notable subject. Again, it's a <i>clip show</i>, for Pete's sake. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 21:52, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Individually, a heckuva lot of what's on Wikipedia is not notable. Think <a href="../../../p/t/e/WP%7EPTEST_5af3.html" title="WP:PTEST">WP:PTEST</a>. Those little individual Pokemons that nobody has ever heard of would never survive on WP in isolation. But together, they are a part of a series of co-equal articles that would be incomplete if one were missing. It's the same thing here. This show is not notable in and of itself, but as a part of a series of articles on shows from that season, it belongs with the rest of them. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../p/t/e/WP%7EPTEST_5af3.html" title="WP:PTEST">WP:PTEST</a> essay doesn't seem to be making the point you're suggesting, <i>e.g.</i>, that non-notable articles when looked at in an aggregate sense can be considered notable. It instead seems to be noting that non-notable Pokemon articles are used to justify keeping other non-notable subjects — as the page itself says, "<i>Keep.</i> Clearly, [the article in question] is more notable than Nidorino [or any other random Pokémon], so if Nidorino gets its own page, why the heck can't [the article in question]?" —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm not nominating all the other articles, nor would I. I'm nominating a single <i>Lost</i> clip show that had no impact on the canon or storyline of the series, and so is not even notable within the context of the series let alone from a larger perspective. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kindly knock off the hyperbole, sir — you're an admin and you should know better. I've not commented on just about every comment.

<dd>What you view as <i>hyperbole</i> is what I view as calling attention to the fact that you're citing things out of context (for instance, citing one line from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> while skipping the very next line that completely undercuts your argument, for another instance, doing the same thing with the google test text) in what I view is a strenous effort to get this article deleted, no matter what the actual policy is, no matter what tactics you need to employ. I detest this article, I detest the entire Lost show, and I think it's silly to have individual television episodes carry articles except in very limited cases where they were culturally significant in a larger context, but the group that works on these articles has <b>arrived at a consensus</b> that clearly says individual episodes should not be deleted except in certain cases, which this episode (and if it's branded with the Lost episode badging, it's an <i>episode</i>, clip show or not) no longer, in my judgement, meets. Instead of fighting so hard this way, instead of doing out of process things (that second AfD you started WHILE the DRV was running, was way out of process, picking and choosing from guidelines as you have apparently done more than once here, is a bit out of process, policy wonking like you did in the DrV to try to get people's views discounted is out of process) to get this article to go away, why not work to get the guideline changed. I'd support that. But I find your contributions to this process not nearly as helpful or collegiate (you are quick to charge others are not assuming good faith while giving the appearance that you yourself are not assuming good faith, for example) as they could be, in my view. Your opinion may differ, of course. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And, by the way, hyperbole is "extravagant exaggeration," and exaggeration is "to enlarge beyond bounds or the truth" or "to enlarge or increase especially beyond the normal." Given that I'm <i>not</i> responding to every individual in here, yes, you were extravagantly enlarging beyond bounds or the truth. The underlying point of your argument may have been what you then proceeded to rant about directly above, and how much <i>that</i> underlying point was hyperbolically stated is another issue, but your originating hyperbolic statement was what I was taking issue with. Really, if you've now been charged with enforcing Wikipedia's policies, you should be trying to <i>embody</i> such basic pillars and as <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, not laugh them off. 17:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure that stating you respond "on just about every comment" is an egregious "hyperbole"-- I noted the same habit at a previous AfD you initiated, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Episodes_of_Lost_%28season_3%29_d5a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Episodes of Lost (season 3)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Episodes_of_Lost_(season_3)</a>, where I pointed out that the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> says, <i>"Please do not "spam" the discussion with the same comment multiple times. <b>Make your case clearly and let other users decide for themselves.</b>"</i> I'd further suggest that claiming others are making personal attacks against you, while you make statements such as those above isn't going to be looked upon too positively. In short, criticism is not a personal insult. --<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 17:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, but (1) never said it was egregious, just hyperbole, which is "extravagant" in and of itself by definition; (2) I'm not writing the same reply to each and every person, and the cited comment you ask can't in any way be construed to cover replying to individuals to challenge the reasoning of their queries; there is indeed a line between criticism and insult, but it depends much on the motive. Saying to someone that they smell of elderberries could either be a criticism of their scent or an outright insult, couldn't it? —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:34, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=egregious" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=egregious" rel="nofollow">Egregious</a>" is an adjective meaning "conspicuously bad or offensive" -- which is exactly what is being claimed about Lars' comments. Ironically, the notion of calling a criticism of one's AfD habits a "<a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>" equivalent to a personal attack is in itself an "egregious hyperbole." 2) Repeated asking those whose comments you disagree with to justify their position is akin to making "the same comment multiple times". 3) As this discussion has veered off from AfD norms, I might suggest that if wikistress is getting the better of you, as it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:WCityMike&amp;diff=59036682&amp;oldid=59015595" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:WCityMike&amp;diff=59036682&amp;oldid=59015595" rel="nofollow">appears to have done recently</a>, perhaps it's time to take a break.--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 18:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With regards to your point no. 1, I'm claiming he's exaggerating the extent of my responses. That's hyperbole. With regards to the latter half of your point regarding calling someone's comments hyperbolic itself being an act of hyperbole, you're essentially saying I'm exaggerating his exaggeration -- that really doesn't seem to parse out as understandable for me. With regards to no. 2, I'm bringing up individual problems I have with people's responses — what metric they're using, misunderstandings of policy. In each case the responses vary, and are thus not the same comment multiple times. The cited portion of the guide in question can hardly be construed as interpreting the mere act of challenging someone's viewpoint as "the same comment." With regards to no. 3, were you someone who I felt had an objective viewpoint on, or benevolently meant opinion of, my behavior and actions, I would value your comments about my personal reputation and thus take your comments under due consideration. I do not believe our past interactions support such an opinion, however, and thus do not. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 18:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your comments are giving the appearance, in my view anyway, of policy shopping, wikilawyering and attacking the messenger instead of paying attention to the message, I'm afraid. Your points have been made, though, and I suspect you've now pretty effectively undercut your own arguments for deletion when this one goes to close, but I could be wrong. You can have the last word here, I'm done, your words speak perfectly well for your approach without further comment being necessary.<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Lar, you're of course certainly entitled to your view of things. However, it's rather unkind of you to characterize a view you disagree with as "policy shopping, wikilawyering, and attacking the messenger." Ironically, such comments are in and of themselves attacks against the messenger and not the message, the very thing you suggest I have a problem with. As for your comments about my "approach," you may rest assured I do not exit from this process precisely enamored of your own approach, at least as demonstrated by the manner you have conducted yourself with this issue. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 21:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
