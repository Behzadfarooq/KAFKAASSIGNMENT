<p>In 2001, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore" rel="nofollow">metalcore</a> band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_through" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_through" rel="nofollow">Bleeding Through</a> released their debut album, Dust To Ashes. Although widely unrecognized, this album was the beginning of Bleeding Through's career. Nonetheless, this album was apparently extremely undersold, and thus is very rarely mentioned. In fact, their <a href="http://www.bleedingthrough.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bleedingthrough.com" rel="nofollow">own website</a>barely includes mention of the album. Many websites recognize Portrait of the Goddess (<a href="http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Bleeding_Through/Biography/" class="external text" title="http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Bleeding_Through/Biography/" rel="nofollow">Star Pulse</a>) as their debut album. The album still remains one of the best metalcore albums available.</p>

<p>There have been studies done by scientists that say that Aye-Aye are related to humans. Although the Aye-Aye do not look anything like primates, the are related to humans, chimpanzees and apes. Both humans and Aye-Aye have backbones, femurs, tibula and many other bones with the same function meaning that they are homologous (comming from the same ancestor). There have also been genetic tests using DNA that show that this lemur looking primate is very closely related to us, humans.</p>

<p>It all starts when the creator, Nicolas Granados, was 7 years old and wanted to put together a new kind of entertainment website where people would often go. When he turned 13 he had not forget about his dream of the website but he decided to put that a side and started thinking more of flight school for his future or a film making carrier. But during his 3rd marking period in 8th grade he met Mr. Louis Scanzillo his Computer Applications teacher. Sometimes during free time or work time but being sneaky he would see and try the available applications. He felt very inspired and amazed by the wonders of this device since he didn't have one at home. One day while looking the icons in the Windows desktop he saw this particular icon with an arrow pointing at the upper left had corner with a paper behind it, he opened up the application and at start up he saw the Office logo along with the name Microsoft Office FrontPage 2000. After looking at the features but completely lost he asked his teacher what was this program for, Mr. Scanzillo answered that it was used to make websites. He felt interested in this particular program and Mr. Scanzillo asked him if he would like to join to his computer club, that he was teaching that application in the club. He joined the club and was in it for 3 weeks, and then he dropped out of it since he was grounded. Later on he would ask his teacher how to do something in FrontPage and he learned. During free time he would put together a website that he had though out and when it was done he showed it to his teacher and he will never forget his words: "In all my years I been working here I never have seen a student do that." In the summer of that same year his parents bought him a computer. In that computer he learned other programs such as Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver. In the winter he made a better version of his website, and the 2nd Version of Nico Arts was born. During this time he met Miguel Molina, he became the 1st member of the Nico Arts Online Club and one of the domain name investors. The Creator often receive complains that the black background was a bad idea and was too dull, so he made Nico Arts V3. This project took him about 3 months to complete, but he had put so much stuff in it that it was too slow so the issue was now worst. A few months after this he made a more simple version that was still ADD supported by Yahoo! Geocities and he called it Nico Arts Ultimate. Finally in May 2006 he bough the domain name "nicoarts.com" by saving from the extra money he got from his parents every week. During this month he made the new Nico Arts with new more advanced tools, he used Visual Studio which consisted of C++ coding, and Macromedia Flash. So June 5th 2006 for his father's birthday he opened the doors to a new world, Nico Arts Apollo Teal and Nico Arts Apollo Sapphire were born.</p>

<p>The name Nico Arts was thought when the creator was 9 and wrote mini stories about F1 and super heroes, and on the cover he would always put a logo but NO NAME. He though of Pento Creations but he didn't really liked it, then Artes Peru, which means Peru Arts, but finally he thought that the name of his logo had to reflect him in someway; so since his name was Nicolas he though of Nico Arts. The minute though about it he liked the name and kept it.</p>

<p>Telemachos Kanthos (1910-1993) was born in Alona, a village in the highland Pitsillia area of Cyprus. He is regarded generally as a Father of modern Cypriot painting. His work is varied but his favorite subjects were the hills surrounding his village. Some of his most evocative work followed the Turkish military intervention in Cyprus in 1974, where he recorded some of the suffering of displaced persons and particularly those who had lost loved ones. He is the father of the Cypriot singer Eleni Kanthou.</p>

<p>Stage3-1 is an <a href="../../../n/e/s/NES_8d93.html" title="NES">NES</a> music cover band based in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Sudbury_74ce.html" title="Greater Sudbury">Greater Sudbury</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, with an internet-based following around the world. It was formed in 2003 by Weston Sagle (<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">Guitar</a>) and Kevin Beswick (<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">Bass</a>) (Of locally successful punk band The Unorthodox) after they discovered a taste for learning video game songs. Experimenting in recording class, the first song recorded was the Metal Man Theme, from <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_2_3136.html" title="Mega Man 2">Mega Man 2</a>, using synthesized drums. The drum sounds had been sampled from the successful video game band <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinae_Supremacy_71b3.html" title="Machinae Supremacy">Machinae Supremacy</a>. The band continued recording various covers, the most notable of which is the theme from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_8a32.html" title="The Legend of Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, which was the highest rated video game song on the popular website <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> for the majority of two years. The band is also well known for its self-titled song, which has been covered by the members in their various other projects with much approval by audiences.</p>
<p>In 2005, after the success of Stage3-1 on Newgrounds, the band added keyboardist Brian Mikkila. This marked a slight change in sound; instead of the consistent tone of one guitar, there were a multitude of keyboard based sounds. The most successful song from this period is the cover of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Zelda_II%7E_The_Adventures_of_Link_3520.html" title="Zelda II: The Adventures of Link">Zelda II: The Adventures of Link</a> Palace. Collectively, from Newgrounds, VGmusic.com, and the Stage3-1 <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> and website, the band's songs have been downloaded over 100,000 times. Currently on hiatus, Stage3-1 still has the intention of continuing to record in the near future, and to release their first album, Level Up!, which will contain most of the existing recordings as well as unreleased tracks.</p>

<p>Most will be very familiar with the steel having seen it used in Country Western bands. This is something completely different! If you've ever caught the spirit or because the spirit manifested thru the music and MADE you want to jump and shout, I can guarantee that YOU WILL enjoy this music.

<p>The Tri-Horned Dragon is a powerful card first to be released in the Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon series for the trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh! You can only get this card in the LOB series and it comes in Secret Rare editino only. Tri-Horned Dragon never appeared in the Yu-Gi-Oh! possibly because Blue-Eyes White Dragon could overpower it in brute force. This dragon does have substantial attack and defence power, but because it has no effect and is two sacrifices to summon onto the field it has been rejected by most Yu-Gi-Oh! duelists around the world.</p>

<p>Bazaar Royale, a rock star royale, imparts new meaning to the genres of hip-hop and rock and roll. His self defined "Aggressive Soul" is unique and original artistry. By melding the fierce, high-energy sounds of rock and hip hop with gritty vocals and soulful rhythms he's produced his own sound. He sings of freedom. Bazaar's feral war cry transports listeners into his world of pain and suffering illuminated by hope. Many artist profess that they will change the face of music; however, few are equipped with the ammunition to do so. Bazaar Royale is a composer and a lyricist that challenges the status quo. His sound "Aggressive Soul" is poised to knock the industry's paradigm of categorized music from its foundation, forcing minds to prescribe to a new way of thinking about what music is and what music can be. He taps into the well of his life experience delivering music that is rich in contradictions. In songs like, "Build a City" and "It's Gonna be Alright" he's a soldier for the disadvantaged- a messenger of hope who makes listeners believe in their innate goodness, and the ability to create an idyllic world order. Defiant and selfish in songs like "Lets Get Violent" and "Draw your Guns", he dares anyone to stand in his way. He's fearless as he mines his pain and his hope, much in the same way he mines the genres of hop-hop, rock and rhythm &amp; blues to create a new sound. He knows no limitation in his quest to create his musical destiny. Shuffled through the revolving doors of various institutions in his youth, Bazaar refused to be bound by the confines of our institutional systems. As a child he was hyperactive and fiercely creative. Improperly channeled, his creativity manifested itself in bad behavior. But Bazaar always knew his destiny was to fly. His musical redemption song is reflective of his personal torment, ancombines years of pain, rage, suffering and neglect into a battle cry respect and success, championing the irrepressibleness of the human spirit. Bazaar Royale is a Rock Star. Like James Brown is the "Godfather of Soul",mBazaar Royale is the "Prince of Ghetto Metal". His musical style is all his own, He is one of those gifted few that does what he does naturally. His raspy, bluesy yet soulful voice, combined with his "Aggressive soul/rock music", his intense energy, and his heartfelt lyrics, is something that is a rarity in artist today. He has amassed a following that has caused a movement. He is the Artist's Artist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-22_dec8.html" title="Edit section: Gaétan J. Paquette">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gaétan J. Paquette</span></h2>
<p>Gaétan Jacques Paquette was born in Drummondville, Quebec, on October 30, 1955, the last of a family of six. His father, Émile Hormidas Paquette, was a house painter and his mother, Rosianne Courona Lepage, was a home builder. When he was six, the family moved to St. Joseph of Sorel. The young Gaétan went to an English school because his parents were Protestants and religious beliefs, at the time, dictated the education orientation. He rapidly finds out that studying is his "cup of tea", that he's going to be a life-long student. He graduates from Dunton High School as the "Runner-up boy" and he enters the Collège régional Bourgchemin, Campus Sorel-Tracy. Two years later, he's accepted at the Institut biblique Bérée; this is where he studies to become a minister with The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada.</p>
<p>Gaétan marries Nicole Tassé in 1978, a young nineteen year old Montrealer. They will have two sons, Alexandre Gaétan Paquette (1980) and Jérémie Émile-Simon Paquette (1988). The young couple enters the ministry in 1979; while working as a pastor, Gaétan continues his studies. Among other scolastic achievements, he obtains a B.A. in History and a M.Ed. in Andragogy from The University of Montreal. He begins to write as he continues his education. He and Nicole start their own publishing company, Éditions Potentiel, who takes a while before being known. The success of this Canadian from Quebec can be measured by the considerable quantity of honorary doctoral degrees that he received from three continents throughout the years.</p>
<p>He touches a bit of everything: radio, television, journalism, drama, etc. The world of entertainment fascinates him; he agrees to officiate at the wedding of Marc Dupré and Anne-Marie Angélil (Céline Dion's stepdaughter) on August 25, 2000. He is also highly interested in politics: he accepts to run for the Canadian Alliance Party in the Chambly Riding in the 2000 Canadian Federal elections. The party leader, Stockwell Day, a former Pentecostal minister himself, agrees that Evangelicals have the right to participate in the public arena. In 2006, Gaétan J. Paquette founds the MCPC Leadership Instutute, a training centre for Cantonese Canadians situated in the Montreal Chinatown area.</p>
<p>In 2006, Gaétan J. Paquette is honored by becoming a distinguished member of Global Who's Who and Heritage Who's Who. Nicole T. Paquette 18:56, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lindsay Monroe is a ficitonal character in <i>CSI: NY</i>, the third spin off in the CSI series. She is portrayed by Anna Belknap. Lindsay Monroe was hired after Detective Aiden Burn (Vanessa Ferlito) was fired because of Mac Taylor's (Gary Sinse) uncertianty that he could trust her again after almost tampering with evidence. She was quickly doubed "Montana" (due to the fact that that is where she transferred from) by Danny Messer, who seems to grown a fondness of her, often asking if she would like to go out "to grab a bite to eat" with him. In <i>As Cold As Ice</i> Danny refers to a date they were suppose to go on but she stode him up. In the second season finale of <i>CSI: NY</i> Detective Don Flack and Mac Taylor were in a building when it exploded. Lindsay Monroe was standing outside the building trying to get the on going block party to get away from it after being warned about the bomb from Mac. Lindsay has a difficult time talking to mothers (Episode 3.04 Oedipus Hex), she told Danny that she could talk to fathers but could not talk to mothers, asking if Danny could tell the mom about her daughter's death. This is a hint that maybe Lindsay has some mother problems in her past. The reason she transferred from Montana to New York is still not been announced. It is due to <i>a deep dark secret</i> in Lindsay's past. Many people like to guess what this secret is in fanfictions.</p>

<p>Popface is a indie rock/pop band formed in Stavanger, Norway. Their debut album, named "Buck", was released in 1995, followed by "Almost Endless" in 1998 and "Michele, I Love You" in 2002. Their latest album "Eleven Pieces Of A Broken Heart", which it's safe to say has gained the most popularity in Norway, was released in February 2006 and contains the hit-single "Teardropper", which was recently included in the Norwegian television-show Svisj's playlist. The band has released records on a total of three different labels over the years, but have returned to the Norwegian "Checkpoint Charlie Audio Productions" for their latest album.</p>
<p>Their newest album has taken the band in a new direction. Their music still belongs somewhere in the indie-rock genre, but they're also exploring something more harmonic, sometimes classified as pop.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to be the source of many diseases, including cancer. Two-time Nobel Prize winner Otto Warbury demonstrated in the early twentieth century that cancer was a mitochondrial deficiency disease. Early detection of disease is believed to be helpful in devising therapies to mitigate or cure the disease. An examination exists which can identify the early onset of mitochondrial dysfunction. This examination is available in several locations in the USA, two of which are the Health Medical Institute (Lafayette, California) and The Nevada Center of Alternative and Aging Medicine (Carson City, Nevada). Measuring mitochondrial function is done by using the principles of pulmonary gas analysis and deriving O2-CO2 conversion rates. Once dysfunction is diagnosed, common therapies to improve mitochondrial function include: improving circulation and pulmonary function; improving biological methylation, detoxification, proper exercise; a diet high in fat, high protein, high fiber and low sugar/starch; chelation therapy and oxidation therapy.</p>

<p>Westside Christian High School is a non-denominational high school located in the suburban community of Lake Oswego, just twenty minutes south of downtown Portland.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-22_dec8.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Prior to 1981, the only choice for a private Christian high school education in Portland was the northeast Multnomah County campus of Portland Christian High School. This meant students of southwest Portland's West Hills Christian School, a Kindergarten through 8th Grade learning institution that drew students from the entire west side of the community, had to travel across town for a Christian high school education. In the late ‘70s, many parents began to discuss their desire to start a high school on the west side of town. In 1981, with only 10 students and 6 teachers, Westside Christian High School opened its doors.</p>
<p>The once vacant Collins View School building (now home to Riverdale School), located close to the intersection of SW Boones Ferry Road and Terwilliger Blvd. was Westside’s first home. It remained at this location as it grew to 151 students and 10 staff members, at which time the school began seeking a larger home. Through a collaborative effort with Lake Bible, a new combined church and high school structure was built on the corner of Kruse Way and Carman Drive in Lake Oswego. In September of 1992 classes began in the new joint building which has been Westside's home ever since. In 1997, a major addition was built doubling the school’s classrooms. The school has since reached it's capacity of nearly 300 students and a staff of 33.</p>

<p>Westside is a member of the West Valley League in OSAA's 3a division. It currently offers 11 Varsity sports including M&amp;W Cross Country, M&amp;W Soccer, W Volleyball, W Cheerleading, M&amp;W Basketball, M Golf, Baseball, Softball, W Tennis, and M&amp;W Track and Field.</p>
<p>The philosophy for athletics at Westside is as follows: "We have a three point focus for athletics at Westside. Expecting and supporting excellence, molding character, and modeling Christian Leadership. We play to win, but not at the expense of our Christian testimony. We are ambassadors for Christ and for our school to the people in the communities in which we play."</p>
<p><b>Cross Country</b></p>
<p>Cross Country at Westside is founded on the principles of participation and individual improvement. While they offer competitive varsity program for those who aspire to compete at the State level, they also encourage students at all levels of fitness and interest to consider joining the team. No one ever “sits on the bench” in Cross Country. Everyone runs at each meet. Due to the nature of distance running, younger students have an opportunity to compete at the varsity level even if they’ve never run before.</p>
<p>In 2005, both they boy’s and girl’s teams placed 3rd at the 2A/1A State Cross Country Meet. This is the best finish in the history of Westside Cross Country. In every year since 1996, the boy’s team has qualified to compete in the State Meet, placing as high as 4th in 2004 before their 3rd this past year. The boys have also won the West Valley district meet for the past 9 consecutive years.</p>
<p>The girl’s team has also had the opportunity to compete at the State Meet in all but one of the past 10 years, winning 5 league championships during that time. They placed 4th at State in 2002 and 6th in 2004. At the State level, many of our athletes have earned All-State honors over the past few years.</p>
<p><b>Girl's Soccer</b></p>
<p>In 2005, Westside girls were the only 2A school in their 3A league. That same year four of the eight teams in their league were ranked in the top ten in state. The girls finished with 9 wins, 3 losses, and a tie, placing them fourth in their league. Since joining the 3A league, this has been their best mark. Five players in the 2005 season were recognized as all league players.</p>
<p><b>Boy's Soccer</b></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-22_dec8.html" title="Edit section: Performing Arts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Performing Arts</span></h2>
<p>Westside offers classes and extra curricular activities in choral music, drama, and visual art. The Philosophy of Westside's performing arts is as follows: "The Performing &amp; Fine Arts programs at Westside exist to discover and develop the skills, talents and creative abilities God has lovingly distributed among His people, then offer them back to Him as an act of worship. All endeavors are to be executed with the goal of excellence. And most importantly, all is to be done for the glory of God, the creator and the giver of talents."</p>
<p><b>Art</b></p>
<p>Westside offers two levels of art discipline. Basic Design is an entry level art class. The focus for this class is on art fundamentals, color theory, and projects based on learning the Elements and Principles of Design. Advanced Art, utilizing knowledge gained in Basic Design, encourages artistic exploration through various techniques and mediums. The purpose in both basic and advanced classes is to glorify the Lord through developing excellence in visual expression.</p>
<p><b>Drama</b></p>
<p>Westside offers five theater courses to encourage the interests and skills of all levels of theater students: Drama I, Intermediate Acting, Stagecraft, Advanced Drama and Technical Theater. Each year the Drama I and Intermediate Acting students perform in a One-Act Festival. Each semester the Advanced Drama class performs a full length theater production.</p>
<p>Productions have included Cheaper by the Dozen, Arsenic &amp; Old Lace, Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Ten Little Indians, Don’t Drink the Water, and Curious Savage.</p>
<p>Westside's musical productions have included The Sound of Music, Cinderella, The Music Man, and My Fair Lady.</p>
<p><b>Choir</b></p>
<p>All students are welcome to participate in Westside’s choral music program by joining the Westside Chorus, which will provide training for future participation in the Concert Choir. Out of the Westside Chorus two of the select ensembles will be created: the ladies’ ensemble Les Filles de Dieu (God’s girls), and the male ensemble RMS (Real Men Sing). In spring, students can tryout for placement in the Concert Choir for the following school year. The Concert Choir will compete in the league and state choral competitions and participate in both fall and spring retreats. Students also have the opportunity at the end of the school year to tryout for the varsity mixed ensemble Soli Deo Gloria for the upcoming year. This varsity group, has an annual tour singing around Portland through the holiday season.</p>
<p>Westside Choir is in the West Valley League for the OSAA. Westside’s choir placed as the West Valley League Champion in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2005. The choir has qualified to compete in the OSAA State Choral Competition for the past eight years. Over the past six years, Westside’s choir has received four third place rankings and two first place state rankings.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2003, the choir was invited to participate in the National Festival of the States in Washington D.C. The choir performed at the National Cathedral, the Russell Senate Building, and many other venues. By invitation, in the spring of 2006, the Concert Choir will perform selections from Handel’s Messiah at Carnegie Hall in New York City.</p>
<p>Westside’s choral music students annually presents both Christmas and Spring concerts and serve as the chorus for multiple Westside musicals, including the recent productions of The Music Man and My Fair Lady.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2005 Westside began offering a worship class. In this class students discuss the role of worship in the life of the believer and develop skills that aid students in leading the body of Christ in corporate worship. These students serve the student body by providing musical leadership during the weekly chapels.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-22_dec8.html" title="Edit section: Spiritual Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spiritual Life</span></h2>
<p>Westside Christian High School was founded to provide a “secondary education from a Christian perspective on the Westside of Portland”. The basis for such an education is found in “the spiritual dimension of life proclaimed in the pages of Scripture.” Therefore, Westside sees it as a critical part of its identity and mission to support the growth of the student’s spiritual life.</p>
<p>Westside’s Campus Pastor is primarily responsible to oversee this area of the school’s function. However, each faculty member and student plays an integral role in providing a context in which we as a family and individuals can grow in our relationship with God. A Faculty Spiritual Life Committee and a Student Spiritual Life Committee assist the Chancellor in overseeing and assessing the spiritual needs of our school and in planning ways in which to address those needs in a relevant way. A male and female student are elected as Spiritual Life Directors on Student Council and are responsible for providing weekly student-run opportunities for worship and fellowship (like Thursday morning “Prayer and Praise” times) as well as, coordinating quarterly chapels that are planned by the Student Spiritual Life Committee.</p>
<p>Westside believes the greatest catalyst for growth is in the experience of “iron sharpening iron” relationships. Not all growth occurs through planned programs, but rather in the day to day interactions of God’s people in community, through the struggles and joys of life’s experiences. They believe the choice of our friends and their values becomes so critical to each persons growth.</p>
<p><b>Core Group</b></p>
<p>Upon enrolling at Westside, each student is placed in a small group of approximately twelve students of the same sex, with all grade levels represented. This group meets on a monthly basis during a chapel period for encouragement and accountability. The group is overseen by a faculty member who is assisted by a team of seniors. The student stays in this same group for their entire time at Westside.</p>
<p><b>Chapel</b></p>
<p>Once a week (usually Wednesday) the entire student body and staff join together for a time of worship, reflection, or exhortation in God’s Word. Chapels fit a variety of formats with a mixture of chapels being done by in-house groups, or invited guests and groups from outside of the school family. These opportunities allow the entire school family to corporately meet with God on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><b>Spiritual Emphasis Week</b></p>
<p>Once a semester (usually October and February) Westside invites an outside speaker to come for a week to challenge students spiritually. Usually the speaker speaks three times during the week and on the other two days provides application questions for Core Groups to discuss.</p>
