<p><b>I am quite puzzled by this extraordinary level of uptightness from what I USED to regard as an easy-going, well run online resource. This small page can hardly be doing any damage to the massive, global servers of the almighty Wikipedia. Since its inception, the page has generated a lot of interest from fans of Max Payne and is a useful source of publicity for the film, so I am genuinely disappointed that it has been "nominated for deletion" - I mean, how anally-retentive can a website be that they would deny a small, independent film (which will be available in the US!) the tremendous benefits of a mere page on this resource. So go ahead, you sad, petty, arrogant, self-righteous, stuck-up faggots - delete the page - prove to the world once again that you can 'stick it to the little guy', that there is no help out there for up-and-coming film makers, for independent films. Well done, you've won and I hope it feels great - now go home and boil some babies or something.</b> Oh, and seeing as you're supposed to be an encyclopaedia, you should appreciate the need for correct grammar - <i>"and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Max+Payne%3A+Payne+%26+Redemption%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Max+Payne%3A+Payne+%26+Redemption%22" rel="nofollow">131 Google results</a>, coupled with <a href="http://www.payneandredemption.com/blog/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060408-150255" class="external text" title="http://www.payneandredemption.com/blog/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060408-150255" rel="nofollow">being rejected 5 times from IMDb</a> don't really help the case"</i> - "doesn't really help the case.", thank you very much.</p>

<dd>Now, kids, this is what we who follow internet phenomena call an "YOU ALL SUCK KTHNXBYE" post. According to some historians - research is still ongoing - it was conjectured to be first used by some annoyed college student in 1980s in the Usenet and everyone just laughed at it then. It has since shown no increase in net effect, in fact, it <i>still</i> fails to register as any kind of criticism that would cause any real effect on Internet communities. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:58, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Comment on the page deletion by James Hampstine&#160;:</p>
<p>Personaly, as a Fan of the Max Payne universe I am exited at the prospect of it being brought to life in this indipendant movie. I think its a shame to delete the page. You talk about notability. Well this is the first serios independant film based in the Max Payne universe. And since Max Payne has quite a large following around the world I think that is a pretty notable thing. As well as having people who are working on the film who are already featured on the IMDB database like Justin R. Durban &amp; Michael Johns.I beleive the director was using a certain amount of sarcasm in his blog post on the P&amp;R site concirning the number of times the film was submitted to IMDB. Indeed the IMDB rules state that for an independant movie it has to be finished or for there to be good proof that it will be finished before they will allow it onto the database.</p>

<dd>Hey there, James! Note that I've got nothing against this movie (save for the fact that it won't be out in the States -_- ), but in order to keep Wikipedia from being overrun with descriptions of non-notable Star Wars and Star Trek fan films, Geocities sites or other things that haven't had a big impact on culture aren't really allowed here. What Saberwyn was talking about was that a reliable source would be the Chicago Sun or some other paper, or a seriously notable website like Aint It Cool News, and not someone's blog or a small-time (albeit useful) site like Paynereactor.com. This isn't in offense to you, and once the movie comes out and it has an IMDb page and all that good stuff, the article may be re-created. As an <a href="../../../s/y/s/WP%7ESYSOP_9bfc.html" title="WP:SYSOP">administrator</a>, I have the ability to view deleted pages, and would be more than willing to help you re-write this.

<p>Comment on this page deletion by Cap Lorien.</p>
<p>The producers of this movie have already done a lot of work and I'm convinced it's going to eventually be released. As such, it belongs here like other such movies. The whole point of this site is to provide information and this is valid information. Please don't delete it.</p>
<p><br />
Comment on this page deletion by Luke Morgan-Rowe, Executive Producer of Max Payne: Payne &amp; Redemption.</p>
<p>OK, I now have a compelling reason, as well as my well justified moral ones, why this site should not be removed. Two seperate French websites, discovered whilst scrolling through our mere 131 google results, confuse our independent film with being the official Max Payne one - a level to which we do not wish to be lowered. We need a page on a well exposed, well respected site (or even online information resource, such as an encyclopaedia), as well as our website, to provide the general public with information about our film, so as not to create irritation and potentially serious confusion, such as the one suffered by our Gallic friends. Now I wonder where we could put a page like that?...</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, Mr. Morgan-Rowe, a section of one of Wikipedia's main policies states that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host.2C_blog.2C_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a free webspace provider</a>.

If such information from such sources can be provided, now or at a point in the future, I will be more than happy to stand by its inclusion, but at this point in time, I'm going to have to disagree with its inclusion. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 02:28, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - yeah, yet another such note from a fan of Max Payne - per crystalballistic fanfilmatious existence. I won't step this up to strong delete for that "You All Suck" rant up there, now matter how tempted I am. This said, I don't mind seeing a <i>short</i> mention of the thing in an appropriate <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Payne_dc8c.html" title="Max Payne">Max Payne</a> article. After all, game articles (in my opinion) can have brief information on upcoming, as-of-yet unreleased mods that are far along their way, while (I think) making full articles on the aforementioned mods may be pretty ridiculous unless they're actually released. A fan movie is in this regard no different from a game mod. So I suggest condensing this thing to a mention in an article, and welcome back with a full article when the thing is actually released in any <i>viable</i> scale. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:58, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm with wwwwolf. I would also like to add that once the movie's actually out, it may very well become a phenomenon that justifies its inclusion in Wikipedia -- it <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops_%28fan_film%29.html" title="Troops (fan film)">wouldn't</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_Edit_7eac.html" title="The Phantom Edit">be</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lucas_in_Love_e779.html" title="George Lucas in Love">the</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wreck_2e2e.html" title="Star Wreck">first</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Star_Trek%7E_New_Voyages_25d2.html" title="Star Trek: New Voyages">one</a>. As it is, this is an article about a project that may or may not ever actually realize itself. Is the movie even going to be released? It may be, and I wish the best for the creators, but it's also possible that it never actually gets finished. We don't know, and we can't know, but we certainly know that if every single announced independent fan film project out there was actually made, there'd be a lot more fan films out there than there are right now. We are a not a crystal ball or an advertising platform. (Also, this is beside the point, but being called a sad, petty, arrogant, self-righteous, stuck-up faggot doesn't exactly make me full of sympathy. I only hope that the guy who wrote that rant isn't actually involved in the production of the movie itself. I like independent movies on principle, but I kind of have a problem with jackasses.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
