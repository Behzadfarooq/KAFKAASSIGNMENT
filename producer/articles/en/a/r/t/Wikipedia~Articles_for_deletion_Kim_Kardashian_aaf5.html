<li><b>Oh, good grief</b>. This is another of those celebutantes - on one hand, she has been mentioned and her clothing sense dissected very frequently (ie. every other week for the past year or two) in People, Star Magazine, E!

<li>I doubt anyone in those magazines could be considered notable; National Geographic can do a study of Ehsdfjgfsk Fshfdkjasfd who lives in deep, dark Peru, but that doesn't make that person notable. <i><a href="../../../y/u/s/User_talk%7EYuser31415_0c1d.html" title="User talk:Yuser31415">Yuser31415</a></i> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Yuser31415_%28two%29_dc3d.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Yuser31415 (two)">(Editor review two!)</a> 20:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But if 86 different magazines do a study of Ehsdfjgfsk etc. 35 times each over a one-year period, is he notable? Even if you don't like Ehsdfjgfsk? I also don't think it's at all accurate or in the spirit of Wikipedia's stance against systemic bias to imply that someone living in "deep, dark Peru" is somehow less notable <i>ab initio</i> than an American (forgive me if that's not what you mean).

<li><b>Delete unless better references provided</b> The only valid reference provided <i>within the article</i> is the People magazine bit (myspace pages unfortunately aren't considered reliable sources). As discussed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> the article should at a minimum have <i>multiple</i> non-trivial external references for verification. The above comments seem to indicate that the article could possibly be expanded with reasonable references and information, and if that happens I'll reconsider my recommendation. But as it currently stands, my suggestion is to delete as having insufficient references and information about the person. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the references confirm notability, and the fact that she was on a magazine cover really seals the deal. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Worthy of inclusion as a notable fake celebrity, especially with the pending sex tape later this month. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy hoy</a>)</small> 13:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per youngamerican. <a href="../../../q/w/m/User%7EQwm_b529.html" title="User:Qwm">qwm</a> 16:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. She is only notable because of the sex tape, (and her friendships) but after the furor dies down, that'll be that. I suggest that we merge her into the Paris Hilton article. -<a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuestionMark_e3a6.html" title="User:QuestionMark">QuestionMark</a> 16:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She is mentioned routinely on Hollywood Gosip magazines and websites. Now she will be a notorious pornstar. If Pornstars can have pages, a celebutard turned Pornstar should certainly have a page. You may not like that she is a celebrity, but the fact is she is. Vivid didn't pay $1M for her sex tape because she was a nobody.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like it or not, quasi-celebrities like this are an unfortunate hallmark of American culture today.Randomjohn 16:21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Page is plagued by original research" is an argument for improving the article and removing the OR, not for deleting the whole article. Kardashian is mentioned in many tabloid news sources and people will come to us to find out what the fuss is about; the article should be kept to make the encyclopedia more useful to our readers.<a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 17:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a wikipedia user, if I come to wikipedia to find information, I want it to be there regardless of whether or not the article is about a pathetic person or thing, the fact is that there is a place for knowledge here that we can't find elsewhere. I trust this encyclopedia a great deal for information that stands out above ordinary blogs and opinion rags, I appreciate the fact that when i read something in the news about someone whom i know nothing about, I can come here and learn something about them, even if they are useless people. Tinman8443 20:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I feel the same way about this article as Tinman8443. She might not be important or notable in the long-term, but Wikipedia serves as a good place to keep this kind of information available. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERageear_f18f.html" title="User:Rageear">Rageear</a> 21:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are individuals with even less significance than her, with articles on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/u/h/User%7EDuhon_c0b1.html" title="User:Duhon">Duhon</a> 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Association with Paris Hilton and her own sex tape are quite significant. Definite keep. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 23:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A socialite with the same basic background as a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>, She is mentioned in numerous celebrity gossip magazine and tv shows. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.242.11.247_d35a.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.242.11.247">71.242.11.247</a> (talk) 01:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is certainly not a space issue the page takes up a minimal amount of space. The issue of her notoriety is obviously resolved as per above. She is well known enough now that people will remember her and recognize her. Her notoriety is unlikely to fade with the impending release of her sex tape. With the tape itself being so high profile there can be no doubt that she will be well known for a while.<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiemunkiesdie_de8e.html" title="User:Diemunkiesdie">Diemunkiesdie</a> 03:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no problem with the article about her sister, <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kourtney_Kardashian_25b9.html" title="Kourtney Kardashian">Kourtney Kardashian</a>, isn't it? Which is still a stub! --<a href="../../../p/v/7/User%7EPv7721_5499.html" title="User:Pv7721">Vlad</a>|<a href="../../../p/v/7/User_talk%7EPv7721_d7c8.html" title="User talk:Pv7721">-&gt;</a> 12:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Just because you don't like a certain person, or resent them for being famous and talentless, doesn't mean they shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. Especially in light of the new <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_J_510c.html" title="Ray J">Ray J</a> sex tape, Kim is getting lots of tabloid play that should at least be mentioned in wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 16:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
