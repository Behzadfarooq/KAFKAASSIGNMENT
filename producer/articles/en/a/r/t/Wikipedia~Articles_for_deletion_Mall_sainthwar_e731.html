<li><b>Comment</b> I've just changed some of the formatting to make it easier to read. It does need rewriting and the sources need clarifying. But if what is there is true, it's a good piece of Inidian hstory that seems deserving of an article.--<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 08:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> In as much as I can make head or tail of it, it appears to be original research in support of an external agenda.

<li>I desperately want to say keep on this, because I'm just sure enough about this to think it's worthy, but I'm not sure regarding the source and don't know enough about it to make a clear decision. I'd suggest whoever chooses to close this see if they can get input from someone more familiar with the history and subject (or a similar subject) to get a clearer idea on this one. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless article undergoes a major rewrite and upgrade of sources. As noted above, the writing style is difficult to understand and suggests an author with limited English language skills. The <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">surname</a> of the primary source author matching the subject of the article also raises concerns about the objectivity of the cited sources. While this could be valuable material it appears just a likely that this article is an attempt to promote the importance of a family or clan using private family histories. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 13:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The responses to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mall_sainthwar_part_one_110e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mall sainthwar part one">first AFD</a> was by true citizens. They are different people and the term sock puppet does not apply to that. They have reacted in that way since they are new to the Wikipedia. Is there a policy in Wikipedia that gives more weightage to an user of Wikipedia who knows absolutely nothing about a topic, rather than experts from that area who are not Registered Users in Wikipedia. Does it mean that once you are a registered user you have every right to pronounce judgements about areas that you have idea or knowledge. This is a disturbing trend. The article is poorly written, but atleast there should be no doubt about the Notability and Verifiability. Can every one who has voted above tell me what all steps they took before telling this is Non Notable and Non-verifiable. AFD should involved active participation and not just "delete" even in areas where one has no knowledge <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 13:24, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no proof that they were 'true citizens' instead of one person with a legion of sockpuppets, although per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> let's assume they are a real group of different people. Nonetheless a group cannot ensure their article is on Wiki unless it is notable and verificable; which this article fails. The only sources to support it is one website and few offline non-English books whose existence cannot be verified: sorry, this is not enough; one could use such 'sources' to prove anything. I asked for Indian community to verify the books/facts, nobody has responded, and the poor quality of the article is just a final nail to the coffin.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 16:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What all things you want to verify. Tell me some 5 points and we will post the question to the over enthusiastic guys who are trying to defend the article. Many books have been cited. Just because the users in India don't have time to go to library and just because those books are not available online, it does not mean that the sources are false. If there is a doubt, you have to <b>keep</b>. Give them some time to scan and upload. What is the urgency in deletion <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 14:02, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>The only sources to support it is one website and few offline non-English books whose existence cannot be verified</i> The only sources for MOST of India related contents are non English books and 99 % of those are offline. If you are not respecting those, then I see a <big><b>BIG</b></big> <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> here. Such behaviour will ensure that there are no articles related to Indian History in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi, I need some more time to rewrite/edit this article. Yes... I admit that it seems to be poorly written and may not be easy for a non Indian to understand. I will provide you more sources of verification. Since these are the festivel days in India (like your christmas) So I am on holiday. Moreover I strongly object to the remraks <b>"sock-puppets"</b> as it is very <b>insulting</b> and not civilised in this case. Before making any such comment, you can verify that such people really exist or not. Almost everyone has provided his contact numbers, addresses and other such details.

<dd>I too second this. Irrespective of the fact whether the article is kept or deleted, the editors have to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a> and Maintain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Civility</a>.

Shouldn't the guys who decide to call genuine persons has SOCKS, cared to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verify</a> (by just calling those numbers) as to the persons were genuine or not. The numbers are from various regions in India and it is obvious that it cannot be one person. Why is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> only for the new users and those who are not accustomed with Wikipedia. <b>Why do the senior editors don't care to even type a simple Sorry for the Blatant Insults they heap on others without <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a></b>. You can say that it is not your duty to call every number. But then it is not your duty to insult others.

Senior editors should act with conscience. They should understand that the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which they are so fond of quoting applies to their action also. ANy one can do mistakes.

<dd>I have told that I am in no way related to those Rajputs. My concern is that Indian (as well as other regions where internet is not so popular) articles are immediately deleted when that does not turn up in Google. In many cases the editors search with the wrong spelling. In many cases the sources are not online. I am only opposing the stand "Few hits in Google, hence not notable, delete" taken by most American and European Editors who never VERIFY things <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 02:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>-(May not be provoked) Little Cleaning-up is needed to the article.I agreed!. But no need to delete. Cutting off the head is not a medicine of headache.I can't blindly comment that a community or a caste is non- notable.(Days of untouchability has gone) Union Cabinet recently approved inclusion and modification of certain castes and communities in the Central list of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Castes like Mall-Saindhavar,`Kurmi-Sainthwar' and `Kurmi-Mall' as sub-castes of Kurmi and Unai Sahu have also found place in the list.There were a number of news reports that I have read about their repeated pleas for inclusion in OBC list. Anyway Mall Sainthavar is a community of historical significance.A news report that I have found from The Hindu daily is furnishing herewith-<a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/07/stories/2006010706381200.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/07/stories/2006010706381200.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph">Nileena joseph</a> 16:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dera Nileena, thanks for the link. What should be noted here is that <i>Mall</i> and <i>Sainthwar</i> have been mentioned as sub-castes of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurmi.html" title="Kurmi">Kurmi</a>. But, the article says that Malls and Sainthwars are <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajputs</a> and gives a "historical" account of these castes as Rajputs without any reliable sources/citations. I'd happy to change my vote to keep, if some convincing sources are provided. My reason for voting delete is not that Malls and Sainthwars don't exist. The reason is the article only contains false information. The link provided by you only strengthens the view that the article is Original Research/Hoax/Attempt to rewrite history. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 03:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>++++ Respected Utcursch sir ji, if you are considering the OBC list to decide that Mall and sainthwars are subcaste of kurmi, then I think you are trusting on Indian politicians who are greedy about vote. Kurmis and mall-sainthwars don't have marriage relationship. This entire politics was started by one Congress Politician who said that sainthwar kshtriyas should be included in OBC list- just to gain vote. He alongwith some more politicians were successful in doing that but later on court order they were removed from OBC list. Again during 1994, few politicians started the move supported by some local sainthwars to include them in OBC list. That was the time when every caste wanted to be in OBC list to get the benefit of reservation. This time, there was no chance for inclusion in OBC list only by name - sainthwar. So a big game- where by this caste alongwith MALL will be declared as sub-caste of Kurmi and few sainthwars gave written affidavit that they have marital relationship with kurmis to avial benefit of reservation. This was enough for those politicians and by this, these two rajput clans became subcaste of kurmi on government record BUT NOT IN SOCIETY.</p>
<p>Being an Indian you must be knowing that how politicians are playing on the name of caste and religion. How they became nervous after supreme court judgement on creamy layer. What I want to say is that - Instead of wide gap between Mall-sainthwar and other rajputs, there are marriage relations but not a single relation with kurmis except love marriage. I would also like you to visit some villages like Pali, Bhusawul, Bharrohn, Dughra, Danaur.. and get the royal feel. Bharrohn village belongs to BHATI RAJPUT migrated from Jaislemer, Rajasthan. Sir, one can write anything to glorify his past, but what about existing Historical places which are named after Historical events.......

<li>Respected utcursch ji, Your are right if you go by govt. papers. There are two opananion about this too. But some historian has done a lots of research on this topic and most of them are non Sainthwar, they have tried to prove that Mall Sainthwars are rajputs. Actually this is a tiny community and limited mainly to eastern part of U.P. Some are still located in kashmir and Rajshthan. Many Sainthwars.. especially some Malls have a very systematic "vansh chart" (community pedigree chart) which prove their roots to old royal rajput families. If they are a subcaste to kurmi then some questions need to be answred. Why are they found in a limited place (mostly in eastern U.P.)? Why don't they have any relations with kurmis? Why "Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha" recognises them as Rajputs/kshatriya? Why the UP govt once put them out of OBC category? Dear, you know that how vote politics can defy and distort history to gain some personal advantage in India especially in north India, where caste based politics is given prime importance. So don't go by the politics.. <b>wait for complete revised article with many more citation for verification and then give your verdict.</b> Had it been your doubts only then it was most welcome but you have tried to put your thoughts so forcebly as if evrything is very well known to you. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalendrasingh_fb33.html" title="User:Shalendrasingh">Shalendrasingh</a> 07:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. (No systemic bias here, I'm an Indian). While I respect <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas">Doctor Bruno</a>'s efforts, this is completely cooked up "history". The few text sources are "VISHEN VANSH DARPAN" and "Aina -e - Awadh" are extremely non-notable and are probably published by "Mall Santhiwars" themselves. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 09:35, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Respected <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> sir , if you are an Indian then you should know the difference between <b>Aina -e -Awadh</b> and <b>Aine -e -Akbari</b>. “Aine Akbari” is famous book written Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar the great * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar</a> and the author of “Akbarnama” refer to link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Akbar.htm</a><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalendrasingh_fb33.html" title="User:Shalendrasingh">Shalendrasingh</a> 20:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dear Shailendra ji, I know the difference between <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak_aac0.html" title="Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak">Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak</a>'s <i>Ain-e-Akbari</i> and <i>Aina -e - Awadh</i>. <i>Ain-e-Akbari</i> mentions Rajputs, but not Mall sainthwars. According to the article, the book mentions Rajput clans, "who were later on known as Sainthwars". But they are not described as Sainthwars in <i>Ain-e-Akbari</i>. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 03:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>* * KEEP* * * This is regarding the mail by Utcursch where he strongly supported to 'delete' by saying that he is Indain and go on blaming that History is Cooked by Mall - Sainthwars Rajputs. Sir, if you are Indian then kindly visit North India, know diffirent clans of Rajputs and kindly read some books like books Vishen vansh vatika, Kshatriya kalpdrum, Kshatriya kalplata, Kshatriya Rajvansh, Gorakhpur janpad aur iski kshatriya jatiyon ka itihas etc., these books can not be found on internet but that doesn't mean that these books are wrong. Further kindly refer the 16th century battle between Noorjahan Begum and Mahawat khan in Kashmir near Jhelum river.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some places which are named after some historical events. Aine-e-Akbari is not written by Mall and sainthwar rajputs nor we need historical cooking to prove ourself. For some political benefits, one political partiy declared mall-sainthwars as 'sub-caste of kurmi', which I highly condemn. Regarding our existence, you can very well refer to 'Central OBC list' of India. Also I request to visit Rajasthan, place of Rajputs and look for Bhati rajputs in Jaislmer. You will find the link.
