<li><b>Comment</b> - I could possibly see a <b>Merge</b> with the main YouTube page or with a Well-Known Users of YouTube page but beyond that I personally believe it is possible Cruft and she is Non-Notable. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 13:51,</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is fully referenced to many notable newspapers/ magazines. She has recieved significant coverage as demonstrated in the article.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Once again, not a vanity page. I am neither related to, involved with, or associated with the subject in any form apart from seeing her video on YouTube, seeing the press coverage and thinking that gave her the required notability for inclusion. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am inclined to think that the Carson Daily contract, and all the media coverage would make her at least marginally notable already. And of course, once the Carson Daily stuff actually gets aired (assuming it does), I don't think her notability could be disputed. --<a href="../../../i/u/s/User%7EIustinus_acb0.html" title="User:Iustinus">Iustinus</a> 18:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Does this mean that anyone that is mentioned in a few articles automatically notable? Quite a few US soldiers have been named in various newspapers and shown on TV, especially when reporters are assigned to military units, but does that mean they are notable? --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 19:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If a soldier gets the amount of press coverage that Brooke has got due to their actions as a soldier (heroic, illegal, immoral) then I don't see why they shouldnt have an article on them. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I read an article about Brodack in the Boston Globe a few weeks ago. I do believe she is notable, not only for the sheer amount of press coverage she gets, but also because of the impact her popularity has had on YouTube. The Carson Daly deal isn't altogether that notable until something actually comes of it. But she is a notable figure; her name is a household one at this point. If this article is deleted, information about her should certainly be merged into the YouTube article. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(talk)</font></a> 20:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If others on YouTube have articles (see <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmalina.html" title="Emmalina">Emmalina</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Emmalina" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Emmalina" rel="nofollow">AfD vote for her</a>. The vote there resulted in a keep.) Then this should be kept as well. Ms. Brodack is more noteworthy too. Dave 23:16, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../q/w/m/User%7EQwm_b529.html" title="User:Qwm">qwm</a> 15:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> â€“ I finally decided to try YouTube a couple of weeks ago. I almost immediately came across Brookers and her videos; she's really funny. However, I only read articles about her in the media once I found her on YouTube, mainly because her fans kept linking to those articles in their comments. I'd argue she's not even an internet phenomenon, but simply a YouTube celebrity. Someone argued Emmalina from YouTube also has an article and intimated that to be precedent for inclusion for Brookers as well. Nobody knows these people besides users of YouTube. If computer programmers are very active in newsgroups, end up getting jobs because of their contributions to those communities, and then end up in tech site articles (for whatever reason), that doesn't automatically warrant the creation of an entry on wiki. Remember the Star Wars Kid? He was notable. Whether people were part of a particular community or not, they found out about him. Brooke Brodack isn't quite there just yet.--Contrinewb 23:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)contrinewb</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Seeing as she has been hired by someone in the industry, and she is the first to do so through YouTube, pretty much single-handidly, that makes her very notable. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.91.79.227 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.91.79.227_be97.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.91.79.227">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I highly agree with the above.--<a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguy101_985d.html" title="User:Jguy101">Joseph</a> 00:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
