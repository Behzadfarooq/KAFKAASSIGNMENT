<p><b>Delete</b>. Changed from a speedy candidate to a VfD nomination by the author's (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraiClinton_47cc.html" title="User:SamuraiClinton">User:SamuraiClinton</a>) request. Simply not needed â both <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">Fraud</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">Hoax</a> are adequately covered in their respective articles, and an article on Fraudulent hoaxes, whatever that might mean, would only dilute the content. Note that the author also added merge directives to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">Fraud</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">Hoax</a> without giving any real reason why such a merger would be appropriate.

<li>The article doesn't make any sense. "Fraudulent hoax" gets less than 100 distinct hits on Google; it simply isn't a term with enough currency in the real world to warrant its own separate article. It's more than sufficient for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a> to link to each other; there doesn't need to be a breakout article for when the two overlap. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:31, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I think it's a reasonable idea, frauds and hoaxes are similar enough to be merged. Unfortunately hoaxes are pretty much all fraudulent, so this wouldn't be the way to do it. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:21, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think they're pretty different concepts. Hoaxes are an attempt to spread misinformation (i.e. "Good Times" email virus warnings) while frauds are deceptive schemes run for profit (i.e. pyramid scams). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 02:23, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was voted for undeletion. Accordingly per procedure I am relisting on VfD. I currently have <b>no vote</b> on this article. If I decide otherwise I will enter an explicit vote below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article was originally entitled "How to Heal Traumas,"</li>
<li>The original reason given for deletion was "Barely coherent, New Age-ish, unreferenced essay with a special guest appearance by Medusa. In cleanup for more than 6 months. Completely idiosyncratic non-topic."</li>
<li>The original debate is at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Talk%7EWalking_the_Tiger_Archive%7EVotes_for_deletion%7EHow_to_heal_traumas_c653.html" title="Talk:Walking the Tiger/Archive:Votes for deletion:How to heal traumas">Talk:Walking_the_Tiger/Archive:Votes_for_deletion:How_to_heal_traumas</a>.</li>
<li>The article at the time of deletion is essentially the identical to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waking_the_Tiger&amp;oldid=11982895" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waking_the_Tiger&amp;oldid=11982895" rel="nofollow">the oldest revision of the current article</a>.</li>
<li>The second VfD debate is at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Waking_the_Tiger_085f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Waking the Tiger">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Waking_the_Tiger</a>; most of the delete votes argued that it was re-creation of previously deleted material, most of the keep votes argued that it was a new article about a reasonably notable book.</li>
<li>The VfU discussion centered on the issue of whether this is a re-creation of material voted for deletion, or completely new material. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:08, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm unsure of its notability, but I'll give a 2,183 Amazon sales rank the benefit of the doubt.

<li>The deletion of this article at the close of the last round of Vfd -- which reached no consensus -- is itself procedurally questionable. Be that as it may, IMO, we must make a decision about the article as it exists, not to enforce some procedural pet peeve. <b>Keep</b>, by the way. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 02:48, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote.</b> If it's a copyvio, it's not from the web-- it would have to be a text source.

<li>Actually there were plans for a 'light' version of Wikipedia, which seems to consist of a series of pages that link to 'highly encyclopedic' articles. What exactly qualifies as such is unknown to me, but likely would not include Yu Yu Hakusho. The idea was to get a comprehensive 'pedia with about 10000 articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> I already voted but I'd like to chime in again and state that I very much oppose just assuming something is a copyvio because it's long and in-depth. Accusing an editor of having unlawfully copied an article is one of the most serious accusations we can make here on WP, and in the spirit of <i>assuming good faith</i>, we shouldn't do it unless we have some sort of evidence. If an article is deleted, it should be based on something provable. Voting to delete because something <i>might</i> be a copyvio is silly (and a Google search verifies that this isn't copied from the web and doesn't look like a print source either). Deleting based on <i>looking</i> like a copyvio is every bit as silly as putting someone in prison because they <i>look</i> like a criminal type. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:29, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand that copyvio is a harsh accusation - I suggested it based not only on the length and depth, but also on the writing style, the format of the original posts (with large blocks of centered or indented text dropped in at a time) and the fact that it was initially posted by an anon (e.g. someone who may be unaware of copyvio policies). No offense meant to anyone, but it has enough signs to at least raise legitimate suspicions. Also, it turns out that there were a something like 112 episodes, and a few movies. As I said before, I'm not calling this unencyclopedic, just suggesting that, all things considered, we may be better starting from scratch with this one. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 06:21, 2005 Apr 18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Before being cut and pasted on to other lyrics pages, most of the rap lyrics on the internet were originally posted on this website.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Alexa is a perfectly legitimate ranking in this case. No evidence has been offered that large scale cut and pasting did occur and even if it did the ranking would in fact be lower, not higher, due to the number of users visiting each page to copy the information.

<li>Look up the lyrics to any rap song and see what you get. There will be dozens of lyrics pages with the exact same lyrics as OHHLA, which gets its lyrics from online contributors. It's easy to tell that these lyrics are the same because they almost always have mistakes. If you could find online lyrics to a rap song that aren't identical to the lyrics on OHHLA, I'd be impressed. <a href="../../../c/p/s/User%7ECPS_4612.html" title="User:CPS">CPS</a> 23:03, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>General comments</b> - The term "Rural Markets" have come into circulation for last 10-15 years in the context of Indian economy, particularly, after economic reforms and the green revolution which created a lot of purchasing power in the hands of rural folks of India. This segement of Indian market, particulary, consumer segment, has attracted the attention of big corporates and even of several multi national corporations operating in India. A re-write of the article is required to make it to conform to wikipedia standard and the points must be made clear. I am not sure, but I do have a feeling that the article has been made / written in a style to look like an original research, whereas the factual position is that most of the points are now well accepted reality of the Indian economy. I will try to do revision / give some inputs, so that a consensus may be made for keeping or deleting this article. Right now, I searched the Google - "Rural Markets" gave me 62,600 hits - naturally, the subject has been engaging the attention of people, and the article should find a place in wikipedia. Even, rural markets of China have been gaining prominence. If the consensus emerges, the spelling of the article should be like this: Rural Market --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 21:17, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have done a revision, which include removing a lot of extra materials. In view of the changes, a fresh stand may be taken - to keep or to delete. I am not participating in the voting process, as I have myself done the revision. However, to attract the attention of the 3 Users who have expressed their opinion, I am requesting them to have a relook at the article --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 07:41, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

<p>I am nominating this vanity page for deletion because I strongly suspect that it violates several Wikipedia policies, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>no original research</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</li>
</ul>
<p>A Google search for this so-called institute brings up only 501 hits.</p>
<p>The user who created this page has been attempting to link several pages (like <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_v._Arizona_0d43.html" title="Miranda v. Arizona">Miranda v. Arizona</a>) to this page when such links, if any, should link to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lilburne_f893.html" title="John Lilburne">John Lilburne</a>. Furthermore, as I have already argued at great length on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lilburne_6e19.html" title="Talk:John Lilburne">John Lilburne talk page</a>, Lilburne's impact on modern law may well be of historical importance, but in terms of how modern American criminal law is practiced at present, his impact is minimal when compared to giants like Blackstone, Story, and Ely.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> unless you can show me why an organization that essentially went into decline around 1992 should have a lot of hits on Google in 2005? By this reasoning only current organizations can be mentioned. Second, this organization obviously did attract attention back in the period from 1984 to 1992, as referenced by publications and broadcasts. For some reason <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> who describes himself/herself as a "law student" has decided that it is of no consequence that Chief Justice Warren linked Lilburne to Miranda in his opinion of the 1960s, because according to some strange logic here, only cases of the present age are of merit according to this "know-it-all" law student who does not cite books but only various Internet research tools. But not everything is already on the Internet. That's one reason for having Wikipedia! Consequently Leonard W. Levy who won a Pulitzer in 1969 for his work (Origins of the Fifth Amendment) that has Lilburne at its core, is of no avail according to <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>, who actually went pretty much to the limit by virtually calling Justice Black a senile old git who could not remember the day of the week for adopting Lilburne as his hero. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> dismissed Black's biography as being "what did she know, he was too old". I have not used the Heritage Foundation and many other sources for reference because the article is quite long already. However <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> is making a POV rant by his call for deletion to get rid of something that was news to him/her that did not fit in with something that he/she already knew because on this score <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> has gone to great lengths to explain his/her superior knowledge about all matters relating to law ... without having a clue as to who he/she is attacking. Anyway, its only a historical article, so whatever. However, if this article falls for this silly reason, then just imagine how many other articles totally unrelated to this subject would be immediately struck from Wikipedia using the same criteria used by <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>. The sad fact about many Internet junkies is that they declared war on traditional libraries and it is within the books of those libraries that the jewels of education are to be found. When the Internet swept in many libraries began dumping and sometimes selling huge quantities of books and anything else that was printed in order to make space for computer screens. Fortunately many collections were rescued, but not all. But what has been created is a world where books are dispised and the computer screen is thought to hold the keys to all truth. In 2005 it does not. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 02:02, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Although it may not be possible to do so using Google, Yahoo, etc, it should be easy to find the publisher's details, especially since we have a name and date for the founding of the magazine.

<li>This notion of NPOV is comical. Willmcw clearly has an agenda. When he couldnât get rid of Kinsellaâs article through his claim of copyright violation he nominated it for deletion.

<ul>
<li>Take a look at the articles started by Willmcw has started, there are certainly less notable people among them. As to Kinsella's status as being notable, he is certainly considered one of the top authors in his field. The fact is the voters have no knowledge of that particular area. They would probably think Walter Block is similarly non-notable. As to my vote, clearly it was somewhat in jest, and like Kinsella, I donât care if you delete the article. However, I wonât stand by and let you think there was some sort of legitimate process that took place in its selection for deletion. As to my not being registered, I don't intend to register.

<li>That's absolutely fine. Whatever the motivation for nomination, the vfd process is legitimate. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 22:47, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep your illusions</b>. This process has no legitimacy at all. You're trying to pass it as "democracy" because there's a "vote" involved. 3 or 4 persons voting in support of their friend when he asks for it is hardly democracy (I'm using "friend" in the sense of "fellow Wikipedian aristocrat"). Wllmcw is clearly calling this vote because he felt offended that his GNU propaganda wasn't shared by the article's subject. Wikipedia is about transmitting knowledge, not forcing everybody to accept the GNU licence. --Franz1984 (forgot my password)

Please see our press page for recent quotations in the mainstream press, including articles writeen by myself and other Shore analysts. I will trust the judgment of others on the value of this entry, but given the changing state of content aggregation I believe that it's an important part of an ongoing dialogue on the nature of content.
