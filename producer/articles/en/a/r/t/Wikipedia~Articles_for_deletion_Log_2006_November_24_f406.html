I have added some. Although I'm not sure exactly where the bar is set for "non-trivial," I assume it would include cases where discussions on the blog are discussed at length (as in the <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohmynews.html" title="Ohmynews">Ohmynews</a> article), or used as a sample of expat opinion, as by the <a href="../../../j/o/o/Joongang_Ilbo_560f.html" title="Joongang Ilbo">Joongang Ilbo</a>. The BBC ref is a little strange, since it appears on the surface to be a(n official) blog, but also seems to be reporting that Koehler was quoted <i>qua</i> blogger on <i><a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_Your_Say_d543.html" title="Have Your Say">Have Your Say</a></i>, which doesn't appear to have an online archive of its own. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 02:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It is considered one of the best blogs about Korean expatriate life, it is a judge on the Asia Blog Awards, (though I am not certain if it was a winner in the past). It places 4th on Google with the keywords: Korea+blogging, and it has a huge following in the thousands. The blog author is a staff writer for Seoul Selection Magazine.

<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons stated on the article talk page and repeated below</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1)The article is not a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>, and therefore already has a significant amount of information which can be added to- indeed, it is longer than many articles in [[Category:fictional battles.</dd>
<dd>2)The <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seafort_Saga_7822.html" title="Seafort Saga">Seafort Saga</a> is military sci-fi and therefore battles play a significant part in the plot, particularly since this is <b>the</b> major battle of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midshipman%27s_Hope_a017.html" title="Midshipman's Hope">Midshipman's Hope</a></dd>
<dd>3)The battle plays a vital role in several plot arcs, notably Seafort's belief in his own incompetence, his conflict with Pilot Haynes, and coming to terms with the execution of Tuak and Rogoff.</dd>
<dd>4)From an in-universe perspective, Seafort's acclamation as the "Hero of Miningcamp" plays an important role in Seafort being confirmed as Commander of <i>Challenger</i>- and therefore the continuation of the series.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to this, if there is eventually a consensus that this single battle does not deserve an article (though I believe it does) I suggest <b>moving</b> it to Minor battles of the Seafort Saga or similar, which can be expanded, following the precedent of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_battles_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_ce8c.html" title="Minor battles in The Lord of the Rings">Minor battles in The Lord of the Rings</a>. Many of which are far less important from an IU perspective than Miningcamp. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinMcCann_cc19.html" title="User:MartinMcCann">MartinMcCann</a> 10:21, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- if this is being considered for deletion on the grounds of being "cruft" then why are there so many individual articles on kings of Arnor?

<li><b>Delete</b> Fancruft; we really don't need articles on individual events/battles in fictional series. The book in this case doesn't even seem to be very notable, lack of third party sources also not a good thing.

<li><b>Merge</b> with the artivcle on the book, which presently has a plot summary copied from the blurb on the back of the book. I see no reason for such a detailed plot summary, sort of a Cliff's Notes to save someone having to read the book.

If neither Amazing Race page is accepted, then is the Survivor page not keep-worthy too? And while we're on that topic, I don't understand how pages like List of American Idol contestants, which is nothing but names, can be kept while Trivia pages, which actually provide information that many would find useful, say, if one were writing a book or needed statistics, are the constant subjects of deletion. While I understand that Wikipedia is not a collection of "indiscriminate information" (which, on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a> page, doesn't explicitly state collections of statistics and the like), that very same page also lists that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and being nitpicky over what is "important", which is one's own opinion, I believe violates that last link. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansTAR_ef6a.html" title="User:HansTAR">HansTAR</a> 18:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I believe that Wikipedia's policy on trivia is rather clear; it should, by and large, only be included within newer articles to provide information that can be later incorporated more properly into that article. This, by implication, would mean that any article consisting only of trivia should be deleted as there is not a proper article to incorporate that trivia into. If this information is encyclopedic, it should be in the Amazing Race article, otherwise its not needed on the Wikipedia. Furthermore, perhaps the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Survivor_statistics_and_trivia_bc5b.html" title="List of Survivor statistics and trivia">List of Survivor statistics and trivia</a> article should be nominated for an AfD as well? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:09, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>: The <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber-shot.html" title="Cyber-shot">Cyber-shot</a> article contains links (<s>mostly</s> many of which are red) to pages for a <i>lot</i> (maybe all) of the Cyber-shot models.

<ul>
<li><b>One answer</b>: individual articles on that many different models within a single range would be <i>very</i> cumbersome for readers to use. The range of cameras is certainly worth documenting, but in my opinion it would be more useful to have a single article that described the development of the range and its features in continuous prose, rather than trying to create individual articles on every single model with no real context for any of them. Therefore, I would say that the redlinks should be removed, the existing articles all merged into the parent article, and the article this produces should then be expanded and refactored to describe the entire range. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep the information in Wikipedia either by <b>keeping</b> or <b>merging</b> with an article on the series of cameras. The development of a line of cameras over time is certainly interesting, especially in the opening decade of digital photography. An article on a three-year-old digital camera is certainly not spam or advertising. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 04:52, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> per Fg2 and my "One answer" post above. The development of a line of cameras is indeed interesting, but it is best described in a single homogenous article, not split into potentially dozens of separate fragments on individual models.<br />
Consider the hypothetical case where an innovative new feature was introduced in three models released simultaneously. With a single article, this is straightforward to explain: the new feature is described in the appropriate section, and the models that introduced it are identified. With multiple articles, the new feature must be described redundantly in three separate places, creating a maintenance nightmare and a tangled web of articles that will confuse most readers. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, Calton, they are just one-of-a-kind non-notable local architecture, just like high schools, bridges, parks, radio towers, public libraries, regional airports, and other structures that typically occupy categories named after the cities in question.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Malls are notable in general because they (together with their tenants) are significant employers and significant parts of the economy. Moreover, crimes sometimes take place in or near malls; people are arrested at malls, perhaps for crimes committed elsewhere; mall owners enact curfews to keep teenagers out during certain hours; mall security personnel are sometimes accused of racism or other forms of misconduct; politicians and developers discuss the benefits and disadvantages associated with construction or expansion of malls. Some of the articles nominated here have been expanded since the initial nomination and may now have enough references to unambiguously demonstrate notability. Consider that a regional mall (together with its tenants) employs more people than live in a small town, and the encyclopedic nature of many malls becomes increasingly clear. Moreover, documentation of the history of a mall makes it easier to understand the forces that affected the downtown shopping areas of communities adjacent to a mall. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 05:34, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>are significant employers and significant parts of the economy</i> That's an assumption on your part, especially the use of the definite "are". <i>Moreover, crimes sometimes take place in or near malls</i>. As sometimes happens in parking garages, garbage dumps, single-family homes, farms, liquor stores, country clubs, schoolyards, vacant lots, and corporate boardrooms. That something important -- or, as in this case, not really important -- <i>might</i> take place is a very flimsy rationale for notability. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Taking these sources in order, they appear to establish that: 1) A developer who worked on this mall is now planning to work on another mall; 2) A store in the mall has expanded its space; 3) Shoppers go to this mall for holiday shopping; 4) There are occasionally new stores; 5) The mall hires temps for the holiday season; 6) Another developer is considering purchasing the mall; and 7a-7d) The mall actually exists. What exactly about these facts makes this mall different from any other active shopping mall? These sources all appear to be trivial for the purpose of establishing notability. None of this information seems encyclopedic. Shopping malls as a class are notable, but this particular shopping mall does not appear to be a notable shopping mall. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As I see it, there are two issues that could cause deletion here; 1. repost of deleted content, 2. conflict of interest. When I saw it on NP patrol I marked it as speedy for the reposting issue, but looking at the previous AFD (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Critical_Mass_%28rock_band%29_b661.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Critical Mass (rock band)">here</a>) it looked to me like it should have been re-listed to generate a larger consensus. After talking with the article's creator and actually <i>reading</i> the article I became convinced that this article does indeed meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. When the article's creator assured me that he could add reliable sources to the article I figured that, once that was done it would be enough to negate the repost issue, though the conflict of interest issue remains. Conflict of interest is a serious problem, but with <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Doug_Bell_105b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Doug Bell">a recently promoted admin who wrote an article about himself when he was new</a>, I figured it wasn't all <i>that</i> big of a deal. I see now that User:Criticalmassjohn, or someone, has indeed added some references to the article. They seem keen to know if the article will be deleted or not before they go and do more work on it. As far as the criteria for notability set out in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> go:
<ul>
<li>Criteria 3: Toured the US and Canada</li>
<li>Criteria 4: They have released 4 albums with CMC Distribution. CMC Distributon "is the world’s largest distributor of Christian music outside of the United States of America " <a href="http://www.cmcdistribution.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cmcdistribution.com/" rel="nofollow">CMC's website</a>. Here's a google search for CMC <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=CMC+Distribution" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=CMC+Distribution" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Criteria 5: Sources have been added</li>
<li>Criteria 8: They have won the Canadian equivalent of the <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dove_Awards_8cb7.html" title="Dove Awards">Dove Awards</a> (If you don't know what the dove awards are, go read the article I linked to. If you aren't into Christian music, but <i>are</i> into Country Music, the Dove awards are like the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_Music_Association_Awards_4c81.html" title="Country Music Association Awards">Country Music Association Awards</a>.).</li>
<li>Criteria 12: They have had documentaries made about them and shown throuought Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By my count that's 5 criteria they meet. For those of you who like google counts, a google search for ""Critical Mass" rock band Canada" gives 205,000 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Critical+Mass%22+rock+band+Canada" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Critical+Mass%22+rock+band+Canada" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> of course, not all of those hits are relevant (does anyone <i>ever</i> manage to get a google search that only gives relevant results?), but most are. Frankly, I don't see how they <i>aren't</i> notable. I think the last AFD did not have sufficent participation and should have been relisted. I trust that this article will, given a short time, change substatially from the one that was already deleted, and the only concern remaining is the conflict of interest. Like notability, <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> is a guideline, not policy. Considering the fact that, as was stated on the article's talk page the original, deleted article was not written by a band member, and considering the allowances that have been made in the past for COI violations, I don't see that as too much of a problem in this instance. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 05:31, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>From David Wang: I apologize for causing all this controversy over this site. As someone who is new to all this (I am not familiar with the procedures for wikipedia), I noticed an entry for our band about 2 years ago (not sure of the exact time) while doing a routine google search. At the time, the entry was very terse so I took the liberty of adding more info. I was not aware that this was a conflict of interest according to the guidelines. I have added some relevant citations and links to external websites. I have asked a few people who are knowledgable about Catholic music to consider coming in to change the site substantially so that I am not the primary contributor to this site. I believe that, even now, we have satisfied the essence of all the requests made of us to verify the content. I would appreciate it if we could stay on the site as we have made every effort to comply with all the wikipedia.org guidelines. At this point, I will refrain from making any more additions/changes to the entry. Thanks for all of your helpful comments and your patience.</p>
<p>AN ADDITIONAL NOTE: Okay.. I found the original version of the band listing... it was under CriticalMass (no spaces). This was the one that I saw originally. Being new to Wikipedia, I created a new entry as opposed to modifying that one.. as you will note, this has been around since Sept 2005...</p>
<p>I think since all the discussion is surrounding this entry, that entry should perhaps be deleted. Anyways, just want to verify what happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the article is greatly improved over the version that was previously deleted. I still have reservations about the award (being "equivalent to" a much bigger and more well-known award does not imply "the same as" the bigger award when it comes to notability--the San Francisco Bay Area "Bammie" awards are equivalent to the Grammies, but far from being the same when it comes to notability). And most minor indie labels hook up with big distributors (or they don't survive), so having a big distributor is <i>in no way</i> equivalent to being on a "major label or important indie" (which is what <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> asks for). But even with those and a couple of other more dubious claims to notability discounted, they do seem to meet the notability requirements. Barely, perhaps, but barely is all that's asked for. And, more importantly, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> seems to be established. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 00:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Only reason I did not suggest speedy deletion is that they came from there. Regardless, notability is relevent, even if not an official policy.

<li><b>comment</b> - It seems to me that the main problem is being a stub - musicmoz is a unique and potentially valuable 'open source' resource (I have no vested interest), but the stub currently has no useful info. Alexa ratings simply score usage by alexa-users; no wider value. I'm not a regular wiki writer, but it seems to me that stubs are better embellished than deleted, uless there's a REASON for deletion. The other sites, for example are three of 10,000 commercial directories. Unless there's a unique aspect to their function or usage, then why list those three - but I am not saying there is or is not a unique aspect in these cases, I do not know 86.31.98.158 11:27, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I know in the US (where WP's servers are located), truth is an <i>absolute</i> defense against libel-proof of a statement's truth means it can absolutely never be considered libel. If someone was indicted for a crime, it is entirely true to say that they were "indicted for" or "accused of" that crime (though, until they're convicted, one may not say that the person committed that crime, only that they are accused). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 21:09, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the US, at least, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indictment</a> is a very specific step from a grand jury. If one is indicted by the grand jury, it is factually and indisputably correct to state that they have been "indicted for the crime of (insert crime here)." It is not even the same as having been "charged", as indictment requires the participation of a grand jury, while charging is generally an administrative decision by a district attorney.

<dd>Yes, Australian Law has a similar function, a person is charged by the police, the case then travels to the courts where it goes through a committal phase, a Judge decides whether there is enough evidence, or whether the case has merit,the case then proceeds to a trial.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry if I'm doing this wrong, considering this is my first time posting on, uh, AfD page. But I'd like to ask a clarification... you mentioned Google hits but did you actually checked out Google News regarding new SimCity? I did a search there with filter set to the most recent option and sorting order set to latest on the top and it turns out to be a quite lot of results following that so-called announcement. I do not know if all of those articles are using Gamespot article as source. But even then, you'd think the press conference would've more than one press outlets taking notes there so I doubts Gamespot is the only source for such information. It's possible that this Wikipedia entry failed to receive those "missing" sources. I do not know if this is due to the fact it's still November, the month announcement were made according to GameSpot. So if it would satisfies the need for more than one sources, I would recommend someone find another source. Keep in mind that all other SimCities in the works, i.e. those being developed for DS and mobile platform were already long announced prior to this earnings conference. So what could possibly be other platforms that SimCity would be developed for? It is highly unlikely for them to be developed on any other platforms other than PC. Those seventh-generation video gaming consoles does not seems to be that much suitable for this SimCity, frankly. So, if I am getting this right, all this article needs to avoid qualifying to deletion is simply another source? Google News might provide one for that, with filter and sorting set, of course. Once again, I apologize if I am doing this wrong or something. I am not exactly experienced with AfD page.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia's mission is to be the encyclopaedia of everything. Yes it is true this is just speculation, but it is speculation based on a real announcement - not just a press release but official information to the share market. This is a much higher level of speculation than a potential film sequel that is 'rumoured'. This is not just rumoured, this is far more than that. Wikipedia should be a place to come to to get an encyclopedic understanding of a topic. If your topic of interest happens to be SimCity 5, then it is appropriate that the concrete information that is available is available on the SimCity 5 page, rather than on some other page where it would not belong. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonzo_6379.html" title="User:Tonzo">Tonzo</a> 23:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep this</b> If someone puts up a modest note on who they are and resources they have created, that would be available for the internet world free to look at, what is wrong with that? As someone who has established Winnipeg and Manitoba's largest on-line photo galleries and who has produced 6 hour long television documentaries on Winnipeg's history, and who has written 250 stories of Manitoba history, I would argue it is an asset to have this information and these links vailable to the general public. People can see and read 350 pages of information for free. They can look at 10,000 pictures for free. George Siamandas</p>

<p>This article is ostensibly about the Ngangangese language, which is supposed to be one of two languages spoken by the "Ching" people.

As for sources, keep in mind why others do not allow Wikipedia as a source is because of hoax articles and random nonsense often inserted into articles.

<p>"I assume that by this time tomorrow, this whole thing will be gone off Wikipedia. But for one brief, shining moment, the world knew the wonder and majesty of the Mandarin Emperor Dildo." "Edit as of 8:30 AM Saskatchewan time: Due to issues with having no sense of humour, Wikipedia does not feel that my article has a place in its collection of knowledge. They include articles on the Sybian and on Teledildonics, but not the Mandarin Emperor Style. Tragic. Anyway, as this site IS a repository of knowledge, I will include the picture at the bottom. And for being the first person to respond, Jenna wins a matching Mandarin Emperor/Empress double-girth set. Which I expect to be used in some sort of video, which will ultimately gratify me. The end."</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't matter whether the existence of these compounds can be verified individually, it's putting them together on this list that's the issue. As so many users have already stated, the big POV problem here is that these names are mostly "unusual" only from the perspective of an English-speaking schoolkid. This is supposed to be an encyclopaedia with an international scope, not a place to laugh at funny foreigners and their silly languages. What next? Do we create a "List of Thai place names with obscene overtones in English" (Phuket, Bangkok)? How encyclopaedic would that be?

As Sjakkalle says, the definition of <i>unusual names</i> is vague and subjective. <i>Non standard</i> names doesn't work either, how does one define "non-standard" in this context?

<p>Unusual may be a subjective judgment but so are many other descriptors in other articles. That these compounds do exist should not be in doubt, especially if there are separate articles.

<p>Unsourced speculative article about an album now due to be released next year.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We seem to be having a rash of these supposed artists at present.

<p>Article does not meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability criteria <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob.au_d411.html" title="User:Rob.au">Rob.au</a> 12:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From what I can see, the organisation is possibly a non-notable going concern as a mobile phone dealer or possibly a new startup yet to begin operations. From my research, I can make the following notes.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Organisation's website</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst the products said to provided by the organisation are an extensive range of Internet products - ranging from basic Internet Access, business-grade Internet Access, through to Hosting and other such services - you would expect the organisation's own <a href="http://www.callme.net.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.callme.net.au/" rel="nofollow">website</a> as linked in the article to at least have a basic overview of services. It remains nothing but a placeholder page saying "Under Construction". I'm not aware of any internet service provider that doesn't have at least a basic product listing on its website.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Other websites</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, you would expect at least a few hits on the greater World Wide Web. Known listing websites such as <a href="http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/" class="external text" title="http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/" rel="nofollow">Broadband Choice</a> allow ISPs to self-register and yet, at the time of writing, there is no listing for Callme Communications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22callme+communications%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22callme+communications%22" rel="nofollow">Searching Google for CallMe Communications</a> delivers 38 results. From this I can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia hits</li>
<li>Discussion board hits, all of which identify the posters as being staff or principals of CallMe Communications, ie. self-promotion. In all cases, these are for the mobile telephony products.</li>
<li>Indication that CallMe resells Think Mobile serivces, out of an address in <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heatherton%2C_Victoria_508a.html" title="Heatherton, Victoria">Heatherton</a>, a suburb of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne%2C_Victoria_c90f.html" title="Melbourne, Victoria">Melbourne</a>, not the CBD as claimed in the article.</li>
<li>Indication that CallMe participates in an Australian mobile-phone recycling scheme, again at Heatherton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Telephone Directory</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The organisation is not listed in the <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.yellowpages.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Yellow Pages</a>. The organisation <i>is</i> listed in the <a href="http://www.whitepages.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.whitepages.com.au/" rel="nofollow">White Pages</a>, at the suburban address.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Newspaper Archives</b></li>
</ul>

Searching the entire archive for <i>callme</i> gets only one result, an article that is over 18 years old.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Author's own admission</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The original article author (prior to the page being speedy-deleted twice as spam) noted at <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User_talk%7EW.marsh_dbde.html#Deletion_of_CallMe_Communications" title="User talk:W.marsh">User talk:W.marsh#Deletion of CallMe Communications</a> that their motivation for the article was to attract attention to the organisation. This author also identifies themself as a principal or employee of the organisation in the notes page of the organisation's logo image.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>More minor notes</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The article still contains many glaring items that appear to be either false or misleading. These have been slowly toned down over the last couple of days, but many remain. For example, the organisation is referred to as "CallMe Communications Pty. Ltd." implying it is an Australian company. If this was the case, it would be in the National Names Index on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Securities_and_Investment_Commission_3f9d.html" title="Australian Securities and Investment Commission">Australian Securities and Investment Commission</a> website. My searches there and on the <a href="http://www.abr.business.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.abr.business.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">Australian Business Register</a>] indicate that "CallMe Communications" (without the Pty. Ltd.) is a registered business name in Victoria and has an ABN, in the form of a Family Partnership.</p>
<p>The article also states the organisation is a telecommunications <i>carrier</i> and heavily implies it is actually a provider of infrastructure, not a reseller. In Australian telecommunications there is a distinction between a <i>carrier</i> and a <i>service provider</i>. The distinction is whether or not the organisation actually provides carriage service over physical infrastructure or radiofrequency spectrum of their own, or if they resell carriage service from others. <i>Carriers</i> must be licenced and will be listed on the <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.1507598:STANDARD::pc=PC_1625" class="external text" title="http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.1507598:STANDARD::pc=PC_1625" rel="nofollow">List of licenced carriers</a> on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority_4f12.html" title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a> website.</p>
<p>In my view, the article infringes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> policies, is unsalvagable and should be deleted.</p>

<dd>Hi Steven from CallMe Communications,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I fail to understand your urgency in keeping an article on your company in Wikipedia, other than for promotional reasons. Attempt to "establish notablity" for a particular article in 2 weeks is certainly not how anyone would contribute in Wikipedia. You either have it now (write about it), or you don't (delete it). And when you do have notability in the future, you will be surprised that others will start writing about your company even without your intervention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that you take the content of this article about to be deleted and stick it on where it is suppose to go; on your own corporate web page which is under construction at this very moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>May I also suggest you sign your comments on Wikipedia, this will faciliate discussions, thanks.</dd>
</dl>

<li>Dear Astrotrain, I have no wish to cause offence, and maybe my wicki-jargon is not up-to-speed. I certainly don't mean to suggest that you are 'spamming', just that in my opinion, unreferenced articles about commercial organisations that appear to be 'blatant advertising for a company, product, group or service that would require a substantial rewrite in order to become an encyclopedia article' per <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">Template:Db-spam</a> should be deleted.

That this article is largely OR is a symptom of the subjective nature of the topic. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's actually not a vald argument. All kinds of articles deal with "subjective" topics and fly through AfD or even reach featured article status. The important thing is that opinions and subjective evaluations be credited to a verifiable source - which does not occur here. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I beg to differ. I did not say that subjective topics are not encyclopedic. I stated that I believed that the reason why this particular article was made up of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> was because of the subjective nature of the topic. This is on top of the fatal POV problems. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:13, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I really can't buy that argument. Tons of apparently non-subjective issues end up with exactly the same OR issue. I'd guess almost every new user's first edit consists of OR (or at the very least, doesn't CITE) ~ my first edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpher-Bethe-Gamow_Paper/history1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24406993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpher-Bethe-Gamow_Paper/history1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24406993" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> to a namespace article essentially was - it was accurate, but it's simply the way most editors start. The POV problems aren't necessarily fatal (since by looking at the article, I have to imagine much of it <i>could</i> be sourced). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:28, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Churches are not inherently notable, and this particular church has no claims to notability. Also, Doc, the burden of proof is on those who want to keep the article. It is not the job of the nominator or the 'voters' to 'clean it up' in order to make it more likely to be kept. If you feel strongly about it then you should attempt to clean it and establish notability, as it stand now however such requirements don't seem to have been met. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Does not make a case for notability. I suspect that nothing would be lost if this was deleted and recreated if the church becomes notable.

Apparently there's also some people who use "BRICS" (to add South Africa rather than Mexico) according the UN link in the article. Why do either BRIMC or BRICS need a separate article?

<li><b>Comment</b> "Badly written" isn't a criterion for deletion, assuming the problem is not so bad it's beyond redemption. This article is about an historical error; the point is to decide whether it is a notable enough error for inclusion on WP, i.e. did this idea have a major impact on Polish history or culture in the way <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarmatism.html" title="Sarmatism">Sarmatism</a> did. If so, it's worth having an article on this subject, as long as it's made quite clear any connection between Poles and Vandals is probably non-existent. I know something about Polish history, but not enough to decide on this issue. As usual, it could easily be resolved one way or the other if somebody came up with the relevant reputable sources. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 19:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed." By this definition, any and all references to ANY website in particular should be removed, as there are VERY few published third-party works about existing webpages/websites. Any Wikipedia reference to a specific website would probably be written by users who frequent those websites themselves. The deletion of Ubersite alone because it isn't "Verifiable" is ludicrous. Also, the statement "No indication that anyone who isn't a user of this site gives a damn about it" is completely out of line, and should not be taken seriously to merit a deletion. I would seriously consider revoking the moderator status of the user "Recury" because of his childish and selfish comments on this discussion board, since his comment suggests a deletion solely because of personal biases against Ubersite.com ~ Matt Maiorano <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.52.174.234 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.52.174.234_53c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.52.174.234">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>Verifiability is a bit funny policy to use for deletion debates, which is exactly why, down below there, I claim the site is not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. But the thing is, fulfilling notability is also about fulfilling verifiability. Last I checked, websites <i>themselves</i> can be used to explain why they're notable (i.e., if they provide a count of users, we can believe that without outside verification). However, if the site itself says "hmm, we have this weak mention here and this weak mention there", it doesn't help with explaining the notability of the site. Notability is about cultural impact. Hope this site has it. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wouldn't say that one or two references on CollegeHumor in the hotlinks section counts as an external reference, per se.

How many people from that number aren't "alters" or users who signed up to rate and then leave forever? How many post on a weekly basis? 100? 200?

<li><b>Keep</b>.

Furthermore, just because a select few Wikipedia moderators don't like the website, it doesn't give you the right to delete it. If you're sick of the vandalism, block the page from being edited by anonymous users. For further unedited thoughts on this matter from the users at Ubersite, I would strongly recommend reading this: <a href="http://www.ubersite.com/m/95173" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ubersite.com/m/95173" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> ~ Matt Maiorano

On the other hand, I don't think the burden of providing references is on the administrators here, it is on the writers of this article to provide enough respectable secondary or tertiary sources that discuss whatever is in the article.

<li>My point is that the "Alexa Test" is discouraged by Wikipedia as a reason for deletion. Alexa is flawed, and if the moderators are unable to provide another source for measuring site traffic to back up Alexa, then a reason like "low traffic" cannot be used. I'm not asking the moderators to provide anything other than a better traffic measurement. There needs to be proof on both sides here, and right now, I have not seen any reason to delete the page apart from personal bias and a source that is discouraged by Wikipedia itself. As for notability, there may not be very many news articles that mention Ubersite, but it cannot be discounted that it has been mentioned by Maddox, linked to from Collegehumor.com, entensity.net, and a plethora of other websites that cites Ubersite.com as a source of entertainment. Granted, some may see Ubersite users as crude, crass, and childish, but that is completely subjective. So far, I have not seen one SOLID reason as to why it should be deleted. I'm not even sure what harm it's causing in letting it stay either, apart from certain aspects that people may not agree with on moral grounds. The morality of Ubersite, however, is not in question. I do believe that the page should be cleaned up. There is a lot of unnecessary information in there. The moderators who are hellbent on having this page deleted need to get off their high horse and realize that there are about 30,000 people who want it to stay. ~ Matt

<li>First of all, if you're going Wikilawyering, it would give a better impression if you'd sign your posts. =) Secondly, ultimately, we're <i>not</i> concerned with the content of the site. That's of secondary importance. We <i>do</i> have a reason why this site is being considered for deletion; specifically, we're questioning the worth of the external mentions of this site. Was the mention of Collegehumor.com remarkable? Or entensity.net? Did these mentions affect the lives of people? I have, however, read a sizable chunk of The Best Page in the Universe (which I assume you're referring to with Maddox) and, well darn it, I completely missed the mention of <i>this</i> site. In other words, do you have any <i>remarkable</i> references from sites that actually have authority? As for "30,000 people who want it to stay", can you cite a poll on your site, and explain the polling method since the article claims there are only 8200 verified unique accounts? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:03, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are so many blatant logical fallacies in EVERYTHING you say, that we will only be going around in circles. This whole discussion is moronic on so many levels, it's dizzying. All I'll say is that there has not been anything "remarkable" about an "authoritative" internet user like Maddox that has "affected the lives" of people outside of the internet. I'm done here, so please continue with your single-mindedness and backwards logic. ~ Matt Maiorano

<li>Maddox wastes book store shelf space, among other things. Anyway, since I'm obviously clueless and I'm usually the first one to admit it, I'd really love it if you'd enlighten me where, exactly, my logic fails, and in what way. It is my intention to comprehend; if you just resort to saying my logic sucks, I'm not really any wiser. That's why I'd really appreciate it if you'd tell me why, in your opinion, my arguments are not logical.

<li>Ok, I'll bite. You say that the content is "of secondary importance" when that is EXACTLY what is being called into question. You ask how the site is notable, when there is an entire portion about notable incidents involving the US Secret Service and several lawsuits brought against Ubersite (wouldn't you say that some poor law-office employee who had to file all that paperwork had their lives affected by Ubersite? I would.) You ask for something "remarkable" from a third-party source, knowing full well that there is NOTHING remarkable written about ANY website from a third-party source. Even if there was, it would be too easy to denounce it as "ALMOST remarkable". How are we supposed to voice our opinions about a matter that we care about, when you are asking for completely unreasonable information? As users, we don't have access to "polls", statistics, and the numerical information you're asking for. The only person who DOES have that information is Bart Cilfone himself, and I think he has more pressing matters to deal with than the existence of a Wikipedia page. If your logic ISN'T bad, then your rhetoric certainly is. Pick one. On a side note, I've just figured out how to sign my posts. 24.52.174.234 22:54, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The deletion nomination, last I checked, concerns notability of the <i>site,</i> not notability of site <i>users.</i> Notability of the <i>site</i> is all that matters in this debate. Has the <i>site</i> been subject to USSS raid, or just some unaffiliated user? Did the newspaper headlines say "Übersite user placed on no-fly list"? Did the headlines say "Übersite user pleads guilty in a rape case - site admin flabbergasted"? Also, I fail to see what's so illogical asking for more sources, even when, as you admit, there's none; I ask the same stuff about <i>all</i> articles. Hey, some other article subjects <i>gladly</i> provide that stuff, even when <i>I</i> didn't know that stuff existed! Believe me, if you provide such proof, I'm more than glad to change my opinion in this debate; such things has happened before and will undoubtedly happen in future. Imagine what would happen if I'd nominate, say, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article. Heck, he's completely unknown here. I don't know damn about him. I don't even know the guy exists. People would give me a bunch of really good sources in three seconds flat. A moment later, I'd be "Oops! My bad! Sorry!"... And why is it unreasonable, if many other article subjects are very easy to verify, anyway? Try to demolish <i>this</i> logical conclusion with your logical sledgehammer, now that you have it all polished: "Unremarkable information does not generate external sources. Lack of external sources means finding information is difficult and, to the searcher, frustrating. Site X claims finding information is unreasonable. Therefore, Site X suffers from lack of external sources. Therefore, Site X is unremarkable." --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe WWWwolf is being extremely judgmental as to the extent of remarkability. Who is to say what is important? If even one person could find something useful from the Ubersite article, would you not say it is important, and therefore remarkable, if only to that one person? Say, hypothetically, that a college student decided to do an art project based on the growing medium of MSPaint. Ubersite has been an integral part of the internet phenomenon, and depriving that person of any information they could use, well, it's just mean. As long as Wikipedia has the server space to maintain such a page, which they most certainly do, there's a purpose to having the Ubersite article, if only for a select few. And you can't argue that. You can't say that no person will ever want to find information on Ubersite.</li>
<li>And as far as your argument on notoriety, that the site is relevant, not its users...you obviously don't understand what Ubersite is. Ubersite is a forum where people convey their personal thoughts and stories. Without the site users, there is no site. Literally, Ubersite would not exist without the myriad personalities that freckle its many users. If I may use a simile, that's like saying George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson...all the great forefathers of America...that's like saying they don't matter, that the end result of America is all that counts. But America wouldn't <i>be</i> America without those voices. Same goes for Ubersite. CodeMalicious 11:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability is not subjective. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> says <i>a topic is notable if it has been been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself</i>.

<li>"... but I'd also like to see proof that world at large likes it too" We don't have to prove that the world likes it or respects it.

<li>You do; the prevailing opinion in Wikipedia just happens to be that if the site has no claims to fame - as in "the world at large likes it too" - then there should be no article.

<li>Do you mean to ask "What exactly is the point of keeping something that YOU know very little about and has had little impact to YOU personally?" Ubersite.com has users from America, the UK, Australia, and a number of other countries. How can you conceivably suggest that "very few people know about it" and it "has had little impact" on the world at large? Just because YOU and a handful of other people haven't heard about it is not a good enough reason to delete a website with nearly one-hundred-thousand written works by tens of thousands of people. Take an hour to yourself and look around on the internet for Forthewin's MS Paint masterpiece, Tom's P2P Networking article, and a number of other pieces that made their rounds across the internet and THEN try to tell me that they haven't made any impact on outside internet communities. In fact, there have been NUMEROUS cases where articles have been stolen and plagiarized from Ubersite.com and made their way to the most famous lists on Craigslist.com and Pointsincase.com, thus resulting in the existence of this website <a href="http://www.plagiarizers.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.plagiarizers.com" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> which happens to have been written by an Ubersite user. To even begin to suggest that everybody has to LIKE the topic being discussed is the stupidest thing I've ever read. ~ Matt Maiorano</li>

The Ubersite Alexa ranking is lower now than it was two years ago and a lot of that is intentional due to reasons I can't elaborate here. I don't really see how that's relevant though as it seems the primary goal of the Wikipedia would be to provide a repository to store historical information that is otherwise unavailable in the common culture. Anyone looking to see what Ubersite is now would go to <a href="http://www.ubersite.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ubersite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubersite.com</a>. People looking to see how Ubersite came to be could reference Wikipedia. At the same time, Ubersite does its own good job of maintaining a history, so I don't think the world will lose anything by not having an Ubersite article in Wikipedia. It seems to me that if Wikipedia is to survive in the future, it would need to have scores of articles like this or face irrelevancy brought about by a competitor with a deeper catalog.

<li><i>*claps*</i> now here's a good example of how to present a case in AfD. Now, we're getting somewhere. Anyway, allow me to clarify one more policy thing: Wikipedia doesn't want <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Wikipedia should <i>not</i> have original, never-before-seen information about the site history; if the deletion of the article means there's loss of information, there's something wrong with the article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Neither</a> is Wikipedia a web hosting service. So, I'd encourage the site user community to take whatever historical research information there is in the article and document the information elsewhere. I hope this is a fair warning, because this fact will stand whether or not the article is deleted. As for Wikipedia's irrelevancy, one must consider the stated mission of Wikipedia; Wikipedia is a general purpose encyclopaedia, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a web directory. (Wikipedia does coexist nicely with web directories, as well as more specific-purpose wikis. WikiMedia Foundation doesn't try to do <i>everything</i>, you know.) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:31, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Leave it to BartBart to come in and explain something a lot more rationally than I could ever hope to do. As for your comments, wwwwolf, I think that while Wikipedia may not be a web directory, there ARE unique websites out there that are worth knowing about. The layout of Ubersite is, at best, unremarkable. It is the community, however, that makes the site as noteworthy as it is (even if we cast ourselves in a negative light on a regular basis). The history of Ubersite can also be found on Ubersite itself, so no history would effectively be "lost", per say, if the article were to be deleted. The original intention of the Wikipedia article was to provide a compilation of Ubersite's history in one easy page, but the main focus still being the COMMUNITY and not the website itself. I suppose I failed in illustrating this idea originally because I was busy nitpicking at everything other people said, but that was the main issue I had with the idea of the article being deleted in the first place. If this is in violation of Wikipedia policy, then I suppose there really is no point in me arguing against it. Cheers. 24.52.174.234 00:32, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As much as I hate any article that causes conflict between people we can't delete articles for being POV. We have notability guidelines that we follow and if you can provide arguments why this isn't notable then we can talk about deleting it. I hate nazism/facism more than anything but I don't AfD related articles because of it. I'm not saying these articles are a good idea but really there is only so much AfD can do. If you want articles deleted for other reasons than our policies you have to go to ArbCom as far as I understand.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The major thrust of the article is POV and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as can be seen by the choice of examples (pls refer to this stubb's discussion page). It is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because it represents a minority trying to push a particular line through the use terms such as Croatisation as opposed to encyclopeadic terms such as <i>assimilation</i> and <i>integration</i>. I also believe the creation of a separate stubb as opposed to expanding discussion in existing stubbs such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Croatia_2b3c.html" title="Demographics of Croatia">Demographics of Croatia</a> or <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustasha.html" title="Ustasha">Ustasha</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a>, has the objective of agenda setting outside the oversight and scrutiny enjoyed by said articles. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 03:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the choice of examples is flawed, the solution would seem (to me) to be as simple as adding other examples. You've mentioned yourself the case of the Brazilian footballer who is now a Croatian player, and that would seem to be a perfectly legitimate addition to demonstrate a situation in which non-Croats becoming Croats can be done in a relatively benign manner. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:05, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is the term in the title (that is highly politically charged) and the use of a separate stubb that are the issues. The examples cited merely reinforce the agenda setting motive and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>
<dd>As I have stated on the discussion page, I am not objecting to the discussion of the term in the wider context or social integration and assimilation and said examples on the appropriate page such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Croatia_2b3c.html" title="Demographics of Croatia">Demographics of Croatia</a> or setting up a linked paged to the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> page titled History of Social Integration in Croatia. Certainly you would agree that it is a far more NPOV title that accurately reflects both benign and non-begign examples and would remove the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 04:33, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still disagree. The phenomenon itself is generally called "integration" or "assimilation", true. What this particular page is about, though, is integration/assimilation/whatever you want to call it as it applies to Croatia - or as it applies to non-Croats becoming Croats. I don't agree that renaming it would be more NPOV, since I'd argue that ~isation isn't POV to start with. The only reason that it appears to be POV is that there are some perhaps poorly-chosen examples and citations in this article as it currently stands and that issues of ethnic identity around the Balkans are always thorny issues. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:55, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I think te reference to the Balkans is a red herring. The issue I see it is twofold.
<ul>
<li>the use of ~isation term. I see it as POV because they are amorphous and poorly defined (see Anglicisation example in post below); and it is predominantly used as a politically charged term by fringe nationalists whereas the majority will use terms such as integration and assimilation;</li>
<li>the creation of a separate stubb instead of covering the issue in existing stubbs that are more appropriate, the use of a politically charged term in the title and unsubstantiated examples, makes it look more like just an extra vehicle for pushing a particular fringe view.

There's considerable room for expansion, as there is in most "-isation" articles in parts of Europe where the borders have been a bit fluid over the centuries, and as with any other article on Balkan politics this one should be watched very carefully, but there's no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:42, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The term ~isation is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and unencyclopeadic. The term &amp; it's POV nature can be discussed within a sub-article on Demographics of the country of interest or an article on Social integration or assimilation. Notions of fluid borders and consequences belong in an article of same name, as an example, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_history_of_Serbia_adc3.html" title="Border history of Serbia">Border history of Serbia</a>.

<dd>I disagree, although I can see where you're coming from. The term ~isation is largely value-neutral. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicisation.html" title="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a>, one of the other articles cited here as a comparison point, simply talks about the process of making that which is not English, English. It's a recognised phenomenon, as the article demonstrates. Likewise, any other ~isation is just about making something which is not already X into something which is X. The reason why I made the comment about countries with more fluid borders is that Croatia (or Ukraine or Hungary or wherever else we want to talk about) has historically expanded and contracted and as a result has been in a position where it <i>could</i> make non-Croats into Croats much more easily than, say, Papua New Guinea has had to make non-Papuans into Papuans. Additionally, because the borders have been relatively fluid even quite recently, we do run the risk of having POV information added more readily than we would if we were talking about making non-French people into French people. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:02, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Strongly disagree - the terms are politically charged. Take for example the term Anglisation - what does it mean? What does turning non-English to English person mean. <b>If</b> I was Asian; when am I considered Anglicised, by policy makers, general population and myself. Is it when I receive an English eductaion? Do I have to convert to Protestanism? Is it an English accent or acceptance of "English values" (whatever they are). Is it culinary i.e. I must be able to appreciate fish &amp; chips and a good curry? Or perhaps be a fan or black pudding?</dd>
<dd>This is why we use more broad terms such as assimilation or integration into the mainstream. It is because it is difficult to define precisely what ~isation is, that it is politically charged, a fact reinforced by looking at the groups that use the term.</dd>
<dd>I think the discussion of fluid borders is a red herring on this issue. Indeed, in Croatia's &amp; BiH's case at least, it has not been as fluid as presented &amp; indeed been relatively stable over the last couple hundred years since the treaty of Karlowiz in 1700's that defined the crescent shape that Croatia still has today. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 04:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If this is notable or not you really need to look at how many examples you would be able to find and of what importance those events are/were.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see the connection <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#BATTLEGROUND</a> has with this case. As explained above, the issue is two fold - 1. use of a politically charged term for the title - I would argue that any ~isation article should be deleted or merged into corresponding demographic section for given country subject; 2. the creation of a separate stubb (instead of covering in relevant existing stubbs), the choice of title and examples, leads me to believe that purpose of the stubb is to push a particular propaganda line - for this reason I see it as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I'ld appreciate it if you could explain why you don't see it as <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, and if my reasoning is flawed, point out where it is so. Also, what is the relevance of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Croatian_sentiment_532a.html" title="Anti-Croatian sentiment">Anti-Croatian_sentiment</a> stubb. If it contravenes wiki rules then it should be subject to the same criteria and resolution process. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 14:01, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You are reffering to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> when you mean <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#BATTLEGROUND</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is about not using the Wikipedia system such as policies and AfD to prove a point. That is disruptive when people do that (like keep taking the same article to AfD). What you are reffering to above is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#BATTLEGROUND</a> which I agree with. Articles should not be propaganda but you should also make sure that you apply that policy in all cases and not only when it is of benefit to youyr own views. Assuming good faith I know you would never do so and would view this fairly no matter what but it is a dangerous path for us to take because it allows a whole wave of possible AfD's on the same premise. I showed you the other article to show you how much it takes before an article is deleted. That article would most likely also make some people offended. If you want to merge the article then do so. You don't need to go to AfD to do so. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 15:07, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Assuming good faith on the FHM citation, it does have two non-trivial external references, so it passes that test. However there are a number of shortcomings with the references — the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Star_e785.html" title="Daily Star">Daily Star</a></i> article does not confirm most of the details asserted in the article (is the "SYSTEM" one year old, or two years?). Also the <i>Star</i> is not a very high-quality source — it's a tabloid newspaper which focuses on celebrities and gossip (note this part of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>: <i>"newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary."</i> — I believe the <i>Star</i> article violates the spirit if not the letter of that rule).

<li>Low traffic due to the fact the site has been running only for a few months and does not rely on a hig hit ratio due to the nature of the Seduction Community and the way we do business- REMEMBER I am not creating this Wiki as an advertising tool so hits on this article are not at the heart of my intentions and I don't see why it should matter if our website has many hits as to whether our Wiki deserves to stay and not be deleted. The SYSTEM has been developed over 2 years since it is the brain child of more than the 1 person cited in the Daily Star article, who have spent varying amounts of time in the Community putting it to work. The newspaper story credits a reporter by the name of Phil Boucher. Kidtonio 03:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Daily Star</i> article is one long quotation, from beginning to end, of a statement made by the founder of the company.

<p>I'd like to point out that I have not come onto this website to deliberately create a 'hoax' or cause any sort of trouble. I am simlpy creating an entry about a game which is, in fact, very popular among school children. I have just viewed the list of entries which concern playground games and I must say that there are many of them which I have never heard of. 'Relatively new' is not an inside joke; it refers to the fact that compared to other games (such as football or bulldog) it is fairly young. If people DO have a serious problem with this entry and require more proof of the game's existence, i am more than willing to discuss. Comments like 'probable bullshit' and 'dumb' appear to me to be very immature and show an incredible arrogance. Let's remember, just because you haven't heard of it before, it does not mean that it doesn't exist. --Soupy Dan <small>— <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoupy_Dan_ae5c.html" title="User:Soupy Dan">Soupy Dan</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoupy_Dan_9907.html" title="User talk:Soupy Dan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Soupy_Dan_6697.html" title="Special:Contributions/Soupy Dan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>I am incredibly suprised that anyone doesn't know Fosh. I was messing around on Wikipedia, avoiding homework, then I thought I'd look to see the oficail rules for Fosh as our Foshers gang had had a dispute earlier that day about a misjudged Mogmog. Now I find that people are disputing the exsistance! Shocking. I really didn’t think anyone could avoid it. It has dominated my life on the playground for a long as I can remember. I think I have photographs of the Fosh gang playing, would it help if I posted them? - Kitten Kid <small>— <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitten_Kid_the_Artist_de3f.html" title="User:Kitten Kid the Artist">Kitten Kid the Artist</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kitten_Kid_the_Artist_cc5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kitten Kid the Artist">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Kitten Kid, you do seem sincere and I am guessing this game may actually exist, however you don't seem to understand why this has been nominated for deletion. The fact that something exists does not necessarily mean it deserves an article on the Wikipedia. In order for a game of this sort to get an article, you must provide third party sources about the game meaning that you need to find either books, newspaper articles, or other such types of things that discuss the game and help to show that not only does the game exist, but that it is also well known to a sizable community. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that third party sources are vital to the way wikipedia is run, but it would be difficult to find newspaper articles or suchlike for any playground game. I know that we play fosh at our school; it would be interesting to see how far across the U.K it has spread. Soupy Dan, do you know what the record number of munties is? In the Leicester area, it is generally the opinion that Keyham Lodge school holds the local record with 43. Where do you play fosh? --User:D_Gray <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.64.164.55.html" title="User:84.64.164.55">84.64.164.55</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.164.55_c2e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.164.55">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.64.164.55.html" title="User:84.64.164.55">84.64.164.55</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.164.55_c2e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.164.55">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<p>I am amazed that some people are disputing the existance of Fosh as a widely played game amongst children (and sometimes just the young at heart) in playgrounds today. I do not know to what extent 'relatively new' implies, but I know that Fosh has been a prominant passtime in my family since I was a very small child. Admittedly, we probably play slightly different rules to the hardcore Fosh players out there, but it seems to work in our small garden. Not only this, however - but at our last family reunion we introduced the game to our entire family, from the youngest toddlers to the elderly grandparents. I defy anyone to not like Fosh. - Blondy Boy <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.69.97.111.html" title="User:84.69.97.111">84.69.97.111</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.69.97.111_ca9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.69.97.111">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.69.97.111.html" title="User:84.69.97.111">84.69.97.111</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.69.97.111_ca9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.69.97.111">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>I must say Fosh is one of the most excitable games I have ever played. Being a skilful Fosher myself, I find it hard to comprehend how some people just havnt heard of such a popular sport. It has coem to my attention that this intricate and demanding sport has originated in a small place called Milton Keynes and am not suprised how far it has spread. I live in Inverness and just taking a morning stroll to the local shops past the park it is amazing just how many youths of today are seen enjoying a casual game of Fosh or even the local teams who take things to the next level completely. I would recommend this sport to anyone as it not only is a fantastic form of excercise, but also stimulates the brain and gives the player endless hours of the same sort of adrelenine excitement as you would imagine a skydive to do. So if you wish to be in with the youth of today, simply play the remarkable game that is Fosh... --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMana_Superbean_f0dc.html" title="User:Mana Superbean">Mana Superbean</a> 00:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMana_Superbean_f0dc.html" title="User:Mana Superbean">Mana Superbean</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mana_Superbean_84aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mana Superbean">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Initially, I was leaning towards believing that this game was real, though still likely unsuitable for Wikipedia due to a total lack of notability. Now, after the above comments that appear to be suspiciously like sockpuppetry, I am guessing this is a hoax. It really, really seems similar to a number of other 'games' or 'sports' which were hoaxes, such as footbasket, that went up on AfD a couple of weeks ago... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:49, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>whether or not it is suitable for wikipedia is, i guess, up to whoever runs the site, but i can tell you it is not a hoax. it IS a real game that many people play, and it's great fun. i know loads of people who have played variations of fosh. i appreciate that sources are needed, but as soupy dan said, it is difficult to find newspaper articles and suchlike about playground games. how often do you see newspaper articles etc for games that are not played in leagues, like bulldog, or polo?

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Afding rather than prod'ing as this substantial article has been around since November 2004(!!) and has a fair bit of an edit history (it has been prodded in the past but this was contested though never taken to afd) . This is an article about a set of fan-created scenario maps for the video game <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> which are used to play a version of the boardgame <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy</a> using fan-customized rules. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22starcraft+diplomacy%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22starcraft+diplomacy%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">1,060 google hits</a> but almost all relevant hits are on amateur video game sites or forums plus there is a high level of spam/wikimirror sites. This is game fan-made scenario type (not really a mod) which fails <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> as well as being gamecrufty. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:38, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article doesn't assert notability apart from being "popular on the Battle.Net servers", but from the mod's website (hit counter reads 21,000, forum has 127 registered users) this does not seem to have the same level of popularity as notable game mods such as <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a>. <b>Delete</b> unless independent sources are added and notability is asserted. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 18:55, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's obscure (I had never heard about it, and there aren't much sources around), but at the same time it is real and has made in its circle quite a stir. I have found a reference to it in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comics_Journal_4e9b.html" title="The Comics Journal">the Comics Journal</a> <a href="http://www.tcj.com/234/r_hitlist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tcj.com/234/r_hitlist.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, so it's definitely more than fancruft (the comic, not the article about the comic though). Another article, partly about the banning of the comic in Britain, written by respected author Roger Sabin, can be seen on this (in itself perhaps not so trustworthy) site<a href="http://www.ugcomix.info/links/arcive/brit-hist.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ugcomix.info/links/arcive/brit-hist.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. It is also mentioned in this article from <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asimov%27s_Science_Fiction_49e5.html" title="Asimov's Science Fiction">Asimov's Science Fiction</a> <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0609/onbooks.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0609/onbooks.shtml" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, which also mentions that the latest compilation of these comics has a preface by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a>. So it seems that even though not many people know the comics, they are notorious (banned) and at the same time hihgly appreciated by respected experts in the field. The article could be improved a lot though, partially by these sources and probably even more by offline sources and by people who know the comic. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are correct. I created a large number of mythology articles and stubs based around EM, and other sources too. That was back before sourcing was considered important for Wikipedia. Anyway, the vast majority have been improved and (I think) cited since, but many of what remain are perhaps hoaxes, mistakes or whatever - I can't provide any additional documentation beyond the Encyclopedia Mythica, so if that's not an acceptable source, then this should be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> Probable hoax along with related article Adim. Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> anyway. Can't find reliable sources on Adim on Google (including links mentioned above - Thinkquest is "created by students from around the world as part of a competition"<a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/library/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thinkquest.org/library/" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>; Encyclopedia Mythica has low barriers to article submission and questionable factchecking (sources are asked for but are not cited in the article)<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/information/submit.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pantheon.org/information/submit.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>). Google books gives a lot of false positives, but nothing an Egyptian king named Adim from around the time of the Great Flood. Zero hits on Budasheer. Two google hits(?) on "Budashir" in a pay-locked journal (unable to assess) as cited above. Egyptian Mythology and kings (and Great Flood myths) are very well documented - should be easy to get a solid fix on this supposed king. "Cave Salt water distillation secret passed on by father's ghost" anecdote sounds like baloney too . <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:40, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced. I translated what I could find on JSTOR: "Another, not further researched development exists in the figure of HERMES BUDASHIR, named son of ARINAS or ARIS on page 53, or ABU DASHIR, son of ARAS on page 74, and is supposed to have written an epistel addressed to AMNUTHASIYA, named <i>Risalat al-sirr fi'l-kimiya</i>. The name BUDASHIR sounds similar to PETOSIRIS or BUSIR, AMNUTHASIYA is reminiscent of AUTHASIYA and other corruptions of THEOSEBEIA." The name pops up twice, once in 1936 (the quote), and once in 1983 (a footnote). I can't really be stressed to apply any notability guidelines if this is really sourceable, but an unsourced stub like this should not be allowed to exist for four years on Wikipedia, with numerous cleanup edits. A systemic failure.

<p>The source to which you refer is intended to give information about the context in which the legend developed: Grosse Pointe Park of the 1970's. Labeling an article about a character in an urban legend a "hoax" is a bit presumptuous. The article on "Bigfoot" is not labeled a hoax article, though the existence of Bigfoot itself has not been verified to the satisfaction of the scientific community. The article does not attest to the authenticity of the legend, just that such a legend exists about someone called Namtons.</p>
<p>The article was just posted yesterday. Why are you in such a hurry to have it deleted. The fact that you can construct anagrams from letters in a word is immaterial. For instance "Dog" is "God " spelled backwards, but what's your point? What is your criteria for legitimate folklore? Give me a chance to develop this a bit. Why not allow those familiar with this particular piece of Grosse Pointe Park folklore to make there own contributions? Why such Venom?</p>
<p>I am new to the Wikipedia community and offended at the reception I have received. Is there a way to defend oneself from other users who wish to gang up and delete something before giving it a chance? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Scotaboman (<a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScotaboman_d815.html" title="User talk:Scotaboman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scotaboman_63a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scotaboman">contribs</a>).</small>--Scotaboman 01:47, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, the anagram isn't necessarily material, but it's kind of a red flag. So is "Namtons" establishing a kingdom on a planet in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Ghost_addb.html" title="Space Ghost">Space Ghost</a> universe, "Namtons" best buddy being named "Suds" , and "Namtons" having come into being by dropping 'shrooms. So is a reference that's not really a reference and lack of Google hits or media mentions on a legend that's supposedly famous and over 30 years old. So does editing from a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> and having made no other contributions.</dd>
<dd>Yes, there is a surefire way to keep people from ganging up and deleting your article: Write about something that's <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">encyclopedically notable</a></i>, and provide <i><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">references</a></i> to show that it's not made up. Right under the edit panel, it says "<i>Encyclopedic content must be verifiable</i>" It's up to you to do that for things you put in WP. Rules for folklore are the same, you have to show the folklore exists and that it's notable.</dd>
<dd>No, it's not possible to leave it up until you find sources, etc. People with SPA's with put hoaxes and junk up <i>every day</i>, and editors get sick of having to wade through it. Find the proof <i>then</i> write the article. Simple enough. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 03:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why accuse me of a hoax. I posted this in good faith. I am trying to meet requirements but I am being slammed before given a chance. Imperfection and incompleteness does not a hoax make. If I knew there would be such a rush to delete it, I would have developed this more before posting it. No-one seems willing to direct me to the procedure by which I may do that. I am guilty of posting prematurely. Name calling is not appropriate. Saying the article is a hoax, is a slam on the author.</dd>

Why? <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">Croteam</a> has already provided a link on their web, and even in their games. Don't tell me <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">Croteam</a> is not famous enough. --165.21.155.17 02:47, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The site is the largest <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_aade.html" title="Serious Sam">Serious Sam</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Engine_033f.html" title="Serious Engine">Serious Engine</a> website on the net, and has been for approximately the past 6 years. The reasons it is notable are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Its message boards are the official <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">Croteam</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_aade.html" title="Serious Sam">Serious Sam</a> message boards.

<li>It is the official download site (not simply a mirror) for Croteam's official file releases. If you look on <a href="http://www.croteam.com" class="external text" title="http://www.croteam.com" rel="nofollow">Croteam.com</a> you can see that all of the links on the main page go directly to Seriously!

<li>They sell official merchandise for Croteam and the Serious Sam games. I don't think very many other gaming sites can make this claim (if any at all). In my opinion, this fact alone makes it notable enough.</li>
<li>The Serious Editor Workshops (again, details can be found on <a href="http://www.croteam.com" class="external text" title="http://www.croteam.com" rel="nofollow">Croteam.com</a>) are held on a regular basis and bring in members of Croteam to discuss the engine and the editor.</li>
<li>Numerous stories and downloads from Seriously! have made their way onto other sites dozens of times (e.g. Blue's News, Voodoo Extreme, ShackNews).

<p>All of these reasons should qualify the site as noteworthy under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> policies.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia should be a source of all information in the world. Adding content like this should be allowed, and not deleted. These contents are the ones which beat almost every search engine because they provide more useful infomation than the others. Deletion like this will probably attract less people here as people will not be able to find required info like this.</li>
<li><b>This article should not be deleted</b> 165.21.155.8 02:05, 25 November 2006 (UTC) (moved from the article's talk page)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia's policy regarding <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Notability</a> for Internet content is far too limited to be valid and should not be used as a reason for removing this article. Let me point out some reasons why as follows:
<dl>
<dd><i>Criteria #1, The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i></dd>
<dd>There are several problems with this criterion. First, when it comes to the Internet very few entities write articles about the content of another entity, in general they merely link to it and provide a brief description. Second, the mainstream sources that do publish articles on the content of an entity are usually biased and have content policies about catering to their target audience.</dd>
<dd>Essentially, mainstream sources generally do not write non-trivial articles on sites, or their content, that do not fit the material guidelines for their target audience. This is especially true of independent entities like Seriously! and therefore is not a valid criterion for notability.</dd>
<dd><i>Criteria #2, The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.</i></dd>
<dd>This is also an invalid criterion because awards, by nature, are biased and cannot be considered as reputable proof that the site, or its content, are noteworthy. In a contest for awards any and all of the contestants may be equally as noteworthy as the winner.</dd>
<dd><i>Criteria #3, The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i></dd>
<dd>Again, like with #1 this criterion fails in a very fundamental way. Mainstream sources will not publish or distribute content from an entity they do not feel is of interest to their target audience, and who they consider as not being noteworthy. Thus, Wikipedia's policies become subordinate to those of all outside sources, biases, and 3rd parties.</dd>
<dd>In defense of this article one person compared Seriously to TribalWar, which has also had its bouts with AfDs. In response a point was made by <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">Humblefool</a>, on the Seriously Talk page, "Tribalwar's had major news media coverage (G4TV), which makes it notable." Based on the issues I have mentioned with Wikipedia's policy, how is TribalWar any more notable than Seriously? Currently TribalWar is nothing more than a general news site, whereas Seriously hosts most of the content and services related to the games it has always supported. Based on present circumstances TribalWar cannot be considered more notable than Seriously.</dd>
<dd>Before I go on I want it to be clear that I am not advocating the removal of the TribalWar article from Wikipedia. I am merely pointing out that the current Wikipedia policy being used here is not based in reality. The Internet operates on a different system than the traditional literary and historical records do. The notability of anything is subject to the opinions, views, experience, and awareness of each person or entity. CNN may have never heard of TribalWar except for some silly meme that popped up there. G4TV may have never covered TribalWar's 2004 event except for the support of the developers of Tribes: Vengeance. Does this mean that TribalWar is now more notable than they were before they were noticed? Did they go from zero to hero by chance?</dd>
<dd>The point is that notability should be derived from the actions and accomplishments of a person or entity and not by who writes about them. Abraham Lincoln was notable for what he did, not because he was the President of the United States or that we have been writing about him ever since. This same principle is what must be applied when it comes to the Internet, because otherwise we might as well just have one page for Myspace and Google because people write books about them.</dd>
<dd>Seriously has made many accomplishments over its 6 year lifespan, but you will not find many, if any, articles recording them by 3rd parties. All it means is that this site has not been noticed by anyone. But let me ask you this, if it was not worthy of note then why have nearly 15,000 people registered on its forums? Why has it averaged 1,000s upon 1,000s of visitors per day? Why do the vast number of non-mainstream sites that report on or mention <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serious_Sam_aade.html" title="Serious Sam">Serious Sam</a> link to Seriously? The reason is because Seriously is the top level site in its subject area. It is like Microsoft.com for all Windows related subjects.</dd>
<dd>Seriously has had the full support of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croteam.html" title="Croteam">developers</a> of the game series the site is based on since day one. Seriously has run competitions, hosted lan parties, provided technical support, done live coverage and interviews at major media events like E3, and has even arranged and facilitated live workshops between the developers and their fans. Just because very little of this can be verified by outside sources should not be reason to remove this article. Notability policy is worthless if it is unfair. --<a href="http://www.seriouszone.com" class="external text" title="http://www.seriouszone.com" rel="nofollow">Louva-Deus</a> 21:55, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is true that notability is just a guideline, and a disputed and contentious one at that. On the other hand, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is <b>official policy</b>. If, as you say, <i>very little of this can be verified by outside sources</i>, that by itself is reason to delete the article. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 00:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That dosn't merit reasoning for the articles deletion, but rather for a extensive cleanup of the article with proper citations and added varifiable content. I tend to see the "Delete it now" reaction to certain articles here and there in Wikipedia and I feel it's not the proper, constructive way to deal with the problems presented in the article. Encouraging proper information presentation and article editing standards is a far better solution that remove information because not *everyone* finds it relevant and useful. AT worst the article can be merged into the Serious Sam article as a subsection. -- Daniel "BurnHavoc" Pawliw 02:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are missing my point. My argument applies both to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. Just because a site has not been noticed by anyone "important" does not mean that it is unworthy of being listed. The only thing the article needs is to be rewritten and properly cited. It is unreasonable to think that every site on the Internet that should be listed on Wikipedia must have been mentioned by some biased media source. There are billions of pages on the Internet, and it is impossible for these sources to cover them all just so they could be listed here, and as I have mentioned they never would do this anyway because of their content policies. If TribalWar can be listed for having accomplished the creation of a fad, then are you saying that Seriously should come up with their own meme and lobby CNN to publish them just to get listed on Wikipedia? In my humble opinion it would be unfair and discriminatory to have such a requirement. So I say again that the only thing this article needs is to be rewritten and properly cited. --<a href="http://www.seriouszone.com" class="external text" title="http://www.seriouszone.com" rel="nofollow">Louva-Deus</a> 03:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Can anyone help putting this article in its proper context? <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:58, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I can't put it into context, but his IMdB page is twice as long as some of the people with articles on Wikipedia. I'd say being composer on two films and a TV series of debatable quality is more notable than not. Producer of music on <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> (haven't seen it) is obviously a plus, but what does that mean anyway?

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I have played a good game of Max Cards many a time, although I was taught it under the name "Min cards" (obviously someone had a sense of humour!)I have never seen a rule book for Max Cards, but I am sure that, as demonstrated above, many people are aware of it's existence. I think it is time for Wikipedia to accept that concrete proof is not needed to confirm something that many people acknowledge exists, and is based on word of mouth. I would also like to make it clear that no card game I have ever played has equalled the skill and emotion involved in Max Cards. KEEP THIS ARTICLE!!! KEEP THE PAST ALIVE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS!!!

I understand that some evidence is necessary, but surely if all these contributors claim to have heard of this game then it must exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.66.17.51 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.66.17.51.html" title="User talk:84.66.17.51">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.66.17.51_6d52.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.66.17.51">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 84.66.17.51 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.66.17.51.html" title="User talk:84.66.17.51">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.66.17.51_6d52.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.66.17.51">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep Article</b> People have rightly said that this has no verifiable sources, and that a google search draws a blank - but that does not mean that it doesn't exist! I have seen this played at a friends house, at the suggestion of someone who had played it at uni. The article matches pretty well with what I remember, this is the first time I have actually seen a complete set of rules (I have found variations but these are closer to standard solitaire than Max Cards). I appreciate that this wouldn't get into the Encylopaedia Britannica, but since Wikipedia prides itself on being user-edited, there is no reason to delete an article about a 'cult' card game which is causing no harm - and has finally let me understand why my friend kept shouting Full Levens at me!

<li><b>keep article</b> I have played this game (but called quick draw) in the past, it was a minor craze in my form at one point, it definitely is a real game i can assure you. I think just because it doesnt have any sources doesnt mean it should get automatic deletion, surely? So it might not be played by many people, but it obviously does exist, I've played it myself!! Who knows, perhaps more people might start playing it if the rules, etc, are left on here for other people to see. It really is a brilliant game, much less monotonous than many other card games I have played.

<li><b>Comment</b> I should elaborate a little. This article is about an album that was due to be released in June 2006. It was originally to be called <i>Ms. Kelly.</i> The name was changed to <i>My Story</i> at some point, and a second article was created for that title. Someone recently redirected <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Story_73b7.html" title="My Story">My Story</a></i> to <i>Ms. Kelly</i>, but neither album has been issued, and Kelly Rowland is now planning an album, as yet unnamed, for release next year. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 14:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The album was orginally entitled <i>Kelly Rowland: My Story</i> and had recently been renamed to <i>Ms. Kelly</i>. I posted a link to an audio interview with this information on the site a few days ago. -- <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENoboyo_3726.html" title="User talk:Noboyo"><font color="navy">Noboyo</font></a></b> 16:30, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> clear-cut crystalballing. Even interviews with people that talk about planned albums is silly, unless it is a CLEARLY NOTABLE planned and failed project, like say the BEach Boys "Smile", or Dave Matthew's "The Lilliwhite Tapes". This meets no real notability threshold, and thus needs to be deleted. The fact that the name keeps changing points to the lack of encyclopedic nature of topic. When the album is finally released in its final form and name, we can recreate the article. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 04:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

He hasn't (yet?) played for his country, but he <i>has</i> played for Leinster. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines are that those who have played "in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports" might be considered notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm persuaded that this guy is notable. My main concern was the projection/prediction that he would be on the Ireland team. That made it seem like part of his fame rested on him making the team. Also, I'm a stupid American fairly ignorant of rugby rankings and generally a non-sports person as well.

<p>There does not appear to be anything in this article to indicate the notability of this person. Being a judge (of what appears to be a fairly low level of court) is not any more inherently notable than being a member of any other profession and, while forming a small part of the working population, there are an awful lot of judges out there. However, given the amount of information that is provided in the article, it is certainly not "speediable" and should have community consideration. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:45, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
