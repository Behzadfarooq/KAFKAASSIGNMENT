<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> the current form and make a <b>true redirect</b> to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. (There seems nothing to merge, as pointed out below). While the intention of spoiler prevention is a good one, this case really seems to be stretching things. It's quite common knowledge and hard to avoid at this point: anyone searching Google for <b>Tom Riddle</b> is going to see the WP article <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> as the first hit. Search for <b>Tom Marvolo Riddle</b> and it is the second hit. This soft redirect seems like far too much trouble for the very unlikely case that someone comes across the term "Tom Marvolo Riddle", and decides to jump to that page on Wikipedia, without consulting any other sources, without searching Wikipedia, and without looking at any other Harry Potter pages on Wikipedia. Once they do hit this page, all they find out is that Tom Riddle is a character in the book, one short sentence of content about him, and that he is important enough to warrant some sort of spoiler (which is a type of spoiler itself). If they follow the spoiler link, then the soft redirect was not needed. If they don't follow the link, it begs the question as to what they were hoping to find, if not information about the character that they might not know yet. Finally, arguments for a soft redirect might have more weight for a more recent spoiler, but the book revealing the connection was released in 1998. - <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 17:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm generally more of a deletionist, or at least a mergist, but my abhorrence toward undesired spoilers trumps those right now. It's an odd little article, but it has some value. I'm going to make this a weak keep, however, as I remember the dispute over whether or not certain characters should have a heading titled "Death" in their articles, lest the article's very table of contents contain a spoiler. I agreed in those cases that after a reasonable amount of time, certain information changes from "spoiler" into "common knowledge". In those cases a quirky soft redirect like this wouldn't be possible, so it's not a perfect comparison. So in consideration of these factors, I'm making this a weak keep vote. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 05:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>...Huh? What does that have to do with this? I still just don't see why a piece of the plot of a series should be arbitrarily taken out and put in a separate article like this. It would make for an impassible encyclopedia if we chopped up a plot into ten different articles to avoid spoilers, and this is clearly <i>not</i> the precedent...

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your question. What that has to do with this is that this article exists primarily as a way of avoiding the inherent spoiler that would come from redirecting it to Lord Voldemort.

<li><b>Comment</b> As this is a perfectly valid name for a major character, I think that even if the consensus is that this article has no place here, it should be turned into a redirect (or deleted and recreated as a redirect, if there's any reason do to so) to the main Lord Voldemort article rather than being totally deleted. If nothing else, this might serve to protect against re-creation by someone who discovered that there was no article of this name, but who did not know that there had once been. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 07:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b> as per aeropagitica. Seriously, nobody would ever bother to learn about Lord Voldemort on Wikipedia first before reading the books, and to purport otherwise is dumb.

<dd>To clarify - this should just be a straightforward (ie, not soft) redirect. This was tried with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> being a soft redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, but was eventually overturned and the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> just states what happens (following a spoiler warning). This is different, though, as this article is two lines, not a lengthy article, and it may as well just be a redirect. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 09:21, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I considered this very example when deciding how to vote, but decided that it's different because the Star Wars spoiler is over 20 years old at this point. I don't know where I'd draw the line, and made my vote weak because a case could be made for this spoiler being too old to be a real spoiler too, but for what it's worth, I thought I'd just mention the huge difference between a 20+ year old spoiler for a trilogy that was finished 20 years ago and a more recent spoiler for a series that isn't done yet. (Hm, maybe that's where I'd draw the line... Except for serieses that have no set ending point, of course.) --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 19:01, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> – Unlike Grandmasterka, I don't think this is a "plot detail". If you read <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> front to end you expect to encounter possible plot spoilers, but if you innocently just look for "Tom Riddle", it is potentially a major spoiler to be redirected to You-Know-Who. The article should be rewritten a bit, making it more like a typical article, and I think it is safe enough after a plot spoiler warning to say something like: "More about his identity is revealed in the article on <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>." --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I really don't understand some of the recommendations. "Merge"? There is nothing to be merged. Have those recommending this even looked at the situation? "Delete"? So do these users propose that the next user looking for "Tom Riddle" gets to stare at a page stating: "Wikipedia does not have a page with this exact name. *Start the Tom Riddle page or add a request for it."? I can assure you that such a page would be started in essentially zero time. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. I've never seen a "soft redirect" before, and it's a little fishy, but for someone as culturally big as Lord Voldemort I think this is a reasonable use. This should not be construed as an invitation to create soft redirects for every minor character in every fantasy series; I would reserve this sort of thing for only the biggest exceptions. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this soft redirect. The fact is to simply redirect Tom Riddle to Voldemort would reveal a spoiler to someone who is simply asking for information on Tom Riddle. Suppose someone hears the name from a friend or is in the middle of reading the Chamber of Secrets. They could possibly believe that Tom Riddle is a minor character and is not any more complicated then what they were reading at the time. It is simply safer to include the soft redirect, then not too. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 16:28, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This AfD is about the article <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle_06fa.html" title="Tom Marvolo Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>, specifically. I don't have the book in front of me, but I seem to recall that "Marvolo" is introduced as his middle name, like, three sentences before he's revealed to be Lord Voldemort, so the chances that anyone who knows enough to search for all three names wouldn't already know his true identity is extremely small. It might be more justifiable to <b>move</b> this soft redirect to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riddle_60ba.html" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>, and have <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle_06fa.html" title="Tom Marvolo Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a> go ahead and redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> (although personally I think that anyone who uses Wikipedia to look up stuff about an eight-year-old book <i>while reading it</i> deserves what they get). --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 22:37, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
