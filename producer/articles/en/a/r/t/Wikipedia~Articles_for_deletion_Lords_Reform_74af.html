<li><b>Note to closing admin</b> -- I would urge that you close this AFD as "void" per <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">User:Equendil</a>'s suggestion below. As this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lords_Reform&amp;diff=79820741&amp;oldid=78655562" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lords_Reform&amp;diff=79820741&amp;oldid=78655562" rel="nofollow">diff</a> should show, the primary author has put in a lot of effort to address criticisms posted here and, as a result, the article has changed significantly since it was nominated for deletion. Since most of the delete votes were made before October 2, it is very likely that the editors were voting on a radically different version article and might not have voted delete if they had read the current article instead. If the new article is worthy of deletion, it can be re-nominated and we can get a consensus to delete based upon the new article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also note that the original nominator has withdrawn his nomination of the article for deletion.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that the original page nominated for deletion was Lords Reform - what is more democratic , which was moved. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform</a> was not the article nominated. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 17:39, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ugh, and that's why articles should not be moved until after the AFD is finished. Too bad <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> didn't read the AFD header text and follow the rules.</li>

<dd>Same argument applies to the subpages that were added to the nomination. It's very possible that some of the subpages will need to be deleted but, since the whole framework has been reworked, it's better to leave them in place for a short while and then let us revisit each subpage once the dust has settled. The major issue here is that the main article <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform</a> is gettting long and hard to read. Some subpages will need to be created but it's not clear at the moment which ones should go.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The primary author is still learning the ways of Wikipedia and is being mentored by a few Wikipedians including myself. He admits that the initial article was "crap" but I think you will agree that the current article is worthy of retention and simply needs improvement. I think this could be developed into an FA candidate eventually.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> asserts that the subject of reforming the House of Lords is adequately covered by discussing the actual reforms. Perhaps the most telling argument against this is that xe neglects to even mention the 1911 reform, possibly the most important reform to the House to date, and the cause of a flurry of published works on this subject in the early 20th century. I've added a small selection of books and papers (this is by no means all of the literature on the subject) to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html#Further_reading" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform#Further_reading</a> to show that the discussion of proposed reforms to the House goes back a long way, from publications by the <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Society_8979.html" title="Fabian Society">Fabian Society</a> in 1954 to papers by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Russel_Wallace_2ef5.html" title="Alfred Russel Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> in 1894. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform</a> is a terrible article, in part because it has been mangled by an editor who is on a soapbox (contrast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lords_Reform&amp;oldid=64268260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lords_Reform&amp;oldid=64268260" rel="nofollow">this earlier version of that article</a> and see what <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> has written on xyr user page), and in part because it has been written from a recentist perspective. But the subject is valid, and the answer to the problems with the article is to remove the soapboxing and to clean the article up by basing it on actual sources, not deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:32, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am sick and tired of the hypocracy on Wikipedia. Of course an article about reform of the House of Lords is going to contain opinions and original research because the whole reform process consists of a series of debates about opinions. These pages have not been on a day and I was up to 3am yesterday working to get them into some sort of order before you vultures started picking at the carcass. Where is the tolerance that Wikipedia tells everyone about?</li>
</ul>
<p>Having set out a template, I was just about to start going through the 1000 different responses to the consultations. I have complained in the past that there is no means (as far as I am aware) to create a trial version and invite comments.</p>
<p>The issue of Lords reform is incredibly complex and given the huge number of views it simply is not possible to explain the issue in one page. I know even less about Wikipedia except its pretended policy of "welcoming everyone" which it does not.</p>
<p><i><b>How can some of you be serious. 1000 different people spent days, if not weeks putting together their consultation responses, hundreds of MPs over decades if not centuries have put in huge amounts of time, it is one of the highest profile issues in the UK, and all you can say is "delete it". I'd have some respect for what you said if one of you had actually offered to help make the article more acceptable.</b></i>Mike Haseler</p>

<p>The comment that "there are plenty of ways to trial it" is news to me.... but then my only other real experience of Wikipedia when when a bunch of thugs jumped on me last time when I started an article on "incrementalism". I ask myself, is it worth carrying on editing these pages or will they be deleted however informative I make them? At the moment I'm inclined to ignore some of the less informed comments and try to make something on it, but if I'm wrong then please email me now because I've got plenty of other things I could do with my time!</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, if you don't join the community, you can't expect to find out about these things. Being productive on the Wikipedia is about more than producing a lot of material - engaging with the other editors, particularly over controvertial articles, is incredibly important. Acting as though the Wikipedia "Edit This Page" button is a videogame and your goal is to get <i>your</i> version of the article in place is not effective.

<dd><b>Comment</b>.This is not a controversal article, as far as I'm aware there have only been three contributors and none of them have disagreed. You are making a controversy where there is none. And I take great exception to your comment: <b>using "Edit This Page" button is a videogame.</b> In fact I haven't a clue what you are talking about! I will restate my position. The Lords is one of the oldest institutions in the World. Reform of the Lords is one of the highest profile issues for the UK government. I apologise that I am not an expert at Wikipedia, indeed, I would love people more informed than me to add to the page, but if this subject can't be included in the encylopedia section of Wiki, then what is the point of it?

<dd><b>Comment</b> As an article which is providing informaton on the process of reform; a reform that is largely dictated by the opinions of those involved, it is inevitable that much of it will be reporting of opinions. I have had the dubious pleasure of reading many of the contributions and talking to quite a few MPs and Lords involved, I am will try to provide information on the range of opinions. I am trying to represent these as fairly and neutrally as possible (although regretably I've had to copy and paste some stuff to at least get a start) so for the meanwhilst, some of it is quite obviously my own opinion of the situation, but unless there is something there to edit, how can others make their contribution and so arrive at a mutually agreed consenus?</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <i>And I take great exception to your comment: <b>using "Edit This Page" button is a videogame.</b> In fact I haven't a clue what you are talking about!</i> That's surprising considering I elaborated upon the point in the following sentence. To reiterate: at this stage you aren't making an effort to react to our criticisms (it doesn't read like an encyclopedia article, for example) beyond the blanket statement that this is an important issue. It is important when facing a conflict of opinion on the Wikipedia that you sit down and discuss it thoroughly with the other editors. Judging from your previous comments (the sense of being "jumped on" when starting a new article, and the "me against he world" tone you've taken here), this is something you were unaware of.</dd>

<dd>We agree that it's an important issue, hence the concensus to keep the central article. However the issue is not presented in a thoroughly referenced, encyclopedic manner. It is written like a collection of sections from a textbook or perhaps primer on the subject. It reads like somebody's original research and commentary, in other words. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 18:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Topic worthy of an article As someone who worked on this article some time ago, I can only say that I tried to include a neutral summary of some of the history and the issues involved in reform. I certainly referred to the Parliament Act 1911. As I was providing background for an article which I take to be mostly about the attempts of the Blair government to reform the House of Lords, I did not go into a lot of detail anout the history but I tried to be reasonably comprehensive. I think that the constitutional crisis leading up to the Parliament Act 1911 is an important historical topic but not central to the contemporary issues.</p>
<p>When I looked at Haseler's work on the main Lords Reform article yesterday I was impressed by it. I did not see the problems described in the comments above.</p>
<p>In summary I think the issue of Lords reform is an important topic in current British politics. There ought to be an article about it, setting out enough history for the non specialist to grasp what is being argued about. The options for reform which have been proposed should be summarised.</p>
<p>I suggest rather than just sweeping away all that has been done before (good, bad or indifferent as it may be), it would be helpful if those who object point to the specific passages they consider to infringe the policies on Neutral POV, lack of sourcing and original research etc. These points can then be examined in detail and if the complaint is found justified the existing text can be corrected so it does comply with applicable policies. I am willing to assist with such an effort. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_J_5e89.html" title="User:Gary J">Gary J</a> 23:50, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see some of the historical information about pre-1977 reforms I inserted originally, has been moved from the main article since I saw it yesterday. It is fair to say that is not in itself a complete treatment of the history, nor is it sourced. It was designed to be a section of a larger whole not an independent article. I presume Haseler was going to get around to expanding it later, but perhaps it will assist the community if I do some work on it, to see if something can be produced which is acceptable. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_J_5e89.html" title="User:Gary J">Gary J</a> 00:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Some specific examples for Lords Reform - Democratic Appointments:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>"Democratically Appointed Lords is a proposal to Reform the UK House of Lords..." Proposed by whom? Is Wikipedia the only place this proposal has been put forth? If so, it's original research.</li>
<li>"With a jury of 15 and perhaps 10 permanent staff, the running costs would be around £2.5 million per year for the jury." Where did this number come from? Is it valid?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>For Lords Refrom - Allotment:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Again, where did the proposal come from? Who is doing the proposing?</li>
<li>"In democracy the people are supreme and the politicians are there to serve the people. By voting for politicians we pick the House of Commons on merit and by its nature this makes it literally undermocratic. An upper chamber does not need to have a mandate to govern, and therefore selection by lot is the best way to make it democratic." This is POV. The <i>best</i> way? If this is unambiguously the best way, why are other proposals being considered?</li>
<li>I also just noticed that there is a typo in the article title. "Refrom" instead of "Reform"</li>

<li>On the points about the varioius proposals. They are not single proposals but intended to be summaries of the range of proposal that have been verifyably put forward. All you need to do is read all the proposals on the department of constitution web site, read all the speaches made in parliament. The problem is that the average person doesn't know where to look. If they want to know what proposals have been put forward, they need a summary and that I expect to find in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 20:47, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Lords reform is a perfectly sensible topic to write about, and there is plenty of third party comment to use as sources without delving into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but this seems to be a rather ambitious programme! It may be easier to try to write one article at a time, and split off sections into subarticles when they get long enough. I think the current content in the sub-articles should be merged into the parent article, and perhaps <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_of_the_House_of_Lords_d83c.html" title="Reform of the House of Lords">Reform of the House of Lords</a> would be a better title.

<li><b>DELETE</b>. The lords reform article is a mess, it's not written in a wikipedia-like tone or manual of style or guide to layout or well, it's basically a whole jumble of mess that looks like someone vandalized. Also per IslaySolomon, Opabinia regalis, Sandstein and physicq210 It's DEFINITE DELETE!!! I found the article after stumbling onto three empty articles when stub sorting: Lords Reform - Proposals; Lords Reform - Aims; Lords Reform - Roles which was emptied by <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_12df.html" title="User:LordsReform">User:LordsReform</a>. I don't know if it constitutes as blanking or vandalism since it was (after digging around) I suppose was for a rewrite of the Lords reform series. But it is unwikipedia-like to leave articles like that with improper redirect. Which I think the three articles doesn't even worthy the redirect. (per redirect policy) Also, I would like to rais the issue of User talk:LordsReform's purpose of moving the article onto his/her userpage as it is an irregular wikipedia practice. Also, could someone cleanup this afd? Feureau 22:58, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is NOT irregular Wikipedia practice to move an article to User space. In fact, the action <b>Userfy</b> is a recommendation that shows up from time to time in AFD debates. In this case, the author <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> was advised to move articles that were "not ready for primetime" to User space. So, he created a separate user account <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_12df.html" title="User:LordsReform">User:LordsReform</a> and moved the articles there. The creation of a separate user account for this purpose is not ideal. It would have been better to move the articles to subpages of <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> but Haseler, being a new Wikipedian, misinterpreted the suggestion. He is working on a new article in <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_New_9bde.html" title="User:LordsReform/New">User:LordsReform/New</a> which he has created as a sandbox. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:52, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
