<p>Since this discussion is a bit much for an AfD intro, I moved it to this page --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 15:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I'd better correct some of the misleading statements above. This is actually the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Electric_Universe_model" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Electric_Universe_model" rel="nofollow"><b>third</b> attempt to delete the article</a>:
<ul>
<li>1. To suggest there is a conflict of interest, is to suggest the same when ScienceApologist, a proponent of mainstream theories, edits mainstream articles. This has nothing to do with the notability of the article, but another desperate attempt to smear certain editors.</li>
<li>2a. There are more than two people who publish articles on the Electric Universe. This is easy to show on the Thunderbolts Web site, which describes itself as "Exploring the Electric Universe"<a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/home.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/home.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and which includes a list of Web site contributors,<a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/team.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/team.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (8 people), plus other contributors such as C.J.

You state that test cases are used to learn about community opinion that can be used to frame criteria, not to influence the debate itself.

<p>(<i>de-indent</i>) You may want to read up on legal test cases. A good example is the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scopes_Trial_c943.html" title="Scopes Trial">Scopes Trial</a>. Being a test case means that someone is going to court precisely to see if the law involved can be upheld or must be thrown out. In this instance, the article is a test case for the new proposed policy. If it is succesful, the article would be deleted. If not, it shows the policy is not ready for full use yet and needs revised or abandoned. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 01:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your clarification, that makes better sense. As for edit conflict, I really can't say what happened, as I saw my comment there later in the night when I came back to look for replies. Regardless, it doesn't matter, and thanks for the clarification. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 04:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>p.s. except that, hmm, that makes it sound like if it is not successful, more changes would be made to the policy until it IS successful, hence making this look even more like a clear case of censorship above anything else. I'll consult a certain family member who teaches law, he will be able help clear up what this means for me. Thanks for the response still. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 04:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not really censorship. Your family member can probably explain, sometimes laws get written, tested, thrown out, rewritten, etc. several times before either A) a version that's good stands up and becomes the standard law, or B) people get tired of trying, give up and leave the status quo. That may be the same in this case: if it fails, gets rewritten, tried again, fails, eventually folks may just decide it's a bad idea and stop. That's why there are test cases, to see if it's worth pursuing further or letting it drop. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 06:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Something very interesting appears to have happened, I replied to the comment left by Trialsanderrors last night, yet the reply is no longer here, and in fact no longer shows up in the page history OR my contribution history. How is that possible? I KNOW I hit the Save Page button, as I later in the night went back to see if another reply had been made to my statement and what I submitted was definitely still there. Something appears very fishy here, and this is not the first time I've seen some of my contributions simply disappear from wikipedia with no sign of history. Oh well, as usual, there is nothing I can do to even prove that I left a message, since the history appears to have been altered and removed from the database. Since it is pointless to point fingers and complain, I simply will paraphrase what I had typed: "Since this is a test case, then the article will not really be deleted? You state that test cases are used to learn about community opinion that can be used to frame criteria, not to influence the debate itself. Hence this is simply a blind test case, there is no intention to actually delete the article, data is simply being conducted by leading us to assume this is a real vote?" That is pretty much the gist of what I had typed, and I will now add it beneath the comment that I was replying to, just above. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 01:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's possible you hit the Preview button rather than the Save button, or that there was an Edit Conflict which didn't get resolved. However, it's extremely unlikely that any such comment was removed. I've read several of the admin boards for a few weeks now and it's apparently quite difficult to remove data from the wiki entirely [i]because[/i] the History keeps track of every edit, move and revision. Such a change requires very precise editing of the database that is only performed when an individual requests all their User information be removed from the database for privacy concerns. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 01:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
