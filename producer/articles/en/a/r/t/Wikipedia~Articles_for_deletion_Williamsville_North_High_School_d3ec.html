<p>Prodded, prod deleted with no reason other than "sufficient notability" in the edit summary. The school is not notable. It is just another high school. The article has been around for a little while, so I imagine that if there were notability, someone would have written it by now. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 20:58, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a>. The bomb-threat info may need to be trimmed out as it doesn't appear to be substantiated by the listed sources. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 21:35, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a list of arguments for and against including schools. Which arguments are you using? Keep in mind also that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is not a guideline, policy, or anything like that. It was in fact rejected. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 21:52, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm generally invoking all the arguments in the section I linked to (i.e. the keep section). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 21:58, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It was rejected because there was nothing left in it for deletionists to cling on to. The keep criteria had been reduced to a level which all nonimated school articles are raised to during the process and it therefore served no possible purpose. In other words it was a default "keep all". Can you not show the good grace to accept that, move on and stop wasting time on this issue? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 02:08, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that the arguments to keep every school article are not unique to schools. They're the same arguments that could be used to keep any article (in other words, there's no such thing as notability). Pretty much, verifiability = notability. I disagree with that. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 02:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> and here I was going to say we should slap the people who try to stifle any dissent by trying to intimidate wikiusers into <i>not</i> nominating school articles for AfD or try and use unjustified "precedent" as a reason to keep a school article... or even cite non-accepted guidelines like <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>... but that would violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, so of course I won't do that.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:54, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Actually, most of the information in the article is <i>not</i> verifiable. Of the three links given as "references," only one works. I eventually found the school's website (<a href="http://www.williamsvillek12.org/north_high.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.williamsvillek12.org/north_high.cfm" rel="nofollow">1</a>) and I can find very little if any of the information that is in the article. The third link, Regents information, gives a lot of information, but surprisingly, none of it was used in the article. In order to make this article verifiable, someone would need to find references for all of that information, so it's in line with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 03:01, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please feel free to edit and improve it. For great justice. 05:23, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd rather delete all the unverifiable information (which would lead to almost nothing). Also, I just realized that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html#Structure" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH#Structure</a> dictates that the school's own sources cannot be used. So, for this article, I'd have to delete everything that wasn't found on the Regents report. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 12:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, which people often cite as voting criteria used to point to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>. It was a proposed guideline, which ultimately, was not approved. Recently, it was changed to point to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a>, which was never even proposed as a guideline, but a just a wiki project, inhabited by school editors, and rarely by the rest of the community. Nothing there is any kind obligating rule. In fact, I personally (while logged out) wrote the "References" piece which you refer to. I did that, to encourage higher standards. However, I did it entirely on my own, and had no authority to impose any rule on anybody. That's why the page says "<i>Note that these are only recommendations, and editors are not obligated to follow them.</i>". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I used <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> mostly because someone used it before me. Even if you use the school's own website as a source (which is discouraged even without <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>), the vast majority of the information in the article is not on the school's website. All I'm saying is that if inclusion of an article ought to be based on the article's verifiability, this article should be deleted, due to lack of sources. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 04:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
