<p>A rather spurious policy proposal intended to prevent admins from voting on 'requests for adminship'.

<li>What are the "ways and means" you mention for a new user to propose policy? Where is the policy/guideline? Village pump? Some of the discussions there develop into policy proposals, but many of the items there are simply announcements for <i>already proposed</i> policies.

<ul>
<li>The issue is the name this article was created under is misleading and not helpful. The proposed policy is not being able to vote on adminship, while the title is the inflamatory not being able to vote at all. After all that, the proper place for the discussion about whether admins can vote for nominated admins is not a policy page in the Wikipedia space, but the Requests for adminship talk page. Bottom line is, sure we can have a discussion on whether admins can vote on requests for adminship. This just isn't the place. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:25, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So the proposal was titled poorly. We all understood what it was meant to be by reading it, and could have moved it in an instant, right? Why on earth would someone bury a <i>policy proposal</i> in the "Requests for Adminship Talk Page"? This was posted in exactly the right place. I respect yet disagree with those who voted delete because they think this is nothing but a troll, but "wrong place to post a proposed policy" is contrary to the posted guideline on how to create policy. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 01:02, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, it was titled in an inflammatory manner and written in an inflammatory, and poorly formatted way by an editor with a large number of disruptive edits. What about that would lead anyone to believe it was created in good faith? Hmm bury a policy proposal on the talk page of a very highly watched page that is specifically about voting on new administrators? Sticking it at a page in the Wikipedia namespace with almost no links to it is burying it more. Besides <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a> even tells you that of 70 proposed policies, only 4 have been accepted. That would tell anyone thinking about it that there is a better way to get what you want accomplished. Finally it's not really even a new policy, <i>it's just a change to the voting policy at requests for adminship</i>. Requests for changes to that policy should go on its talk page. The fact that there is such strong consensus to delete this page, and as of yet, no one has brought that discussion up there is further evidence this page was created in bad faith. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:23, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Beyond the simple disruption issues - heaven forbid a large group of people on WP who have made enough consistent edits to be elected by a consensus of editors (admin or not) to admin status should actually have an opinion on what it is that they do! If the original author wants it published and available for comment, besides the comments of this VfD forum, there is always their user page. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 04:08, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant <b>Keep</b>. Simply deleting this is contrary to "Assume Good Faith". In addition, ideas don't care who has them. This one is worthy of discussion; it would certainly help prevent the formation of administrator cliques, which is a present and growing problem here on Wikipedia, in my perception. Although I expect this to fail spectacularly, I think it is worth of a discussion. &lt;sarcasm&gt;<i>Heaven forbid we actually allow a new user to open a discussion here!</i>&lt;/sarcasm&gt; It seems I'm voting with the anons, new users, and possible socks, but there's a principle here. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 19:57, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The corollary to "assume good faith" is "don't be a sucker". A user attempting to create a policy such as this on the third day of their account's existence sends up so many red flags that it feels like <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_7efe.html" title="Flag of the People's Republic of China">flag day in the PRC</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">âœŽ</a> 03:16, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what about letting a discussion proceed is "being a sucker"? I feel that the idea itself is worthy of discussion, and even if you don't agree, what is the harm in allowing it to continue? If I had an idea, I would have posted a proposal on my first day. I waited nearly six months to register an account, so I had an idea of how things work, and I know I'm not the only one who registers with some experience. It's a discussion, not a hand grenade. "Red flags" are a warning to take a closer look, but when I look, I find no danger here, except what I suspect is a whole new use for VfD. Are we going to VfD the RfCs we don't like next? --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 13:11, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Letting oneself waste time on a fairly obvious troll is being a sucker.

<li>A primary rule of the prevailing wiki-thought is that if someone suggests an idea you don't like, it's trolling. It's nauseating. Good faith is dead. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:34, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your zeal would have been better spent on drafting a new formulation of the proposal that is a lot less clumsy and inflammatory. That, in turn, seems to be more productive than lamenting the lack of good faith in others. Is suggesting that people are calling this trolling because they "don't like the idea" supposed to be good faith, then? It's quite obvious why people assume this is a troll, and it has not so much to do with the concept as with the way it's expressed. A proposal that outright states that admins often further "their own petty interests", true or not, relevant or not, is not the best way to encourage constructive discussion. As an aside: meta-squabbles over who can call whose evaluation of the situation bad faith, now <i>that</i> we might truly call "prevailing wiki-thought". And that's not really helping either. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 13:51, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't favor the proposal so I have zero interest in helping develop it. Also I think I can say with near certainty that almost all users, with a handful of exceptions, would be subject to accusations of trolling if they put forward a proposal like this, so I think the way it's expressed is not fundamental to the opposition. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:01, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't really matter how many of them are admins... admins vote on VfD's fairly often and keep the VfD's clean of votes by sockpuppets and vandalism such as a user changing another user's vote.
