<li>This article should stay. It is an inevitably requisite article for the new and emerging busienss people of today and is becoming more and more relevant the more Mr Burkutally is appearing on UK television screens.

<li>Is there no possibility that there is more than one person with the same name? I have highlighted the results that correspond with this name but apart from that it is not my problem that other Mauritian born individuals share the common family name of Burkutally. I am not him, so do not ask me to come back when I am famous as that will never happen, however I am a private banker that used to work wwith him following the advice of the banking consortium to help publicise the indivudal as we believe he is worthy or more recognisable attention. He is a true character and anything you wish to flag up as a concern, feel free to. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.36.210.14 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.36.210.14.html" title="User talk:82.36.210.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.36.210.14_fbbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.36.210.14">contribs</a>) 00:18, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>Again may I emphasise this isnt to generate publicity, from what I know Adam has no real gain from Internet publicity as the majority of busienss conducted is in the real world away from the Internet, and only after his new conglomerate incorporation will he be joining the Internet "world" in terms of selective acquisitions in line, such as investopedia. So as I said, this is not publicity, this is an article to educate the people who read the wiki of Adam and also how to learn from thigns he has done. I intend on adding alognside my team, more of a biography on this article and get some of the journalists whoo have written about him to join up with links to their journals however that all takes time but it is goign to happen as Adam recently joined Panorama in the UK for an interview and is subject ot be broadcast later on this year. Panorama, as wikipedia, seek to educate, not publicise so heed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.36.210.14 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.36.210.14.html" title="User talk:82.36.210.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.36.210.14_fbbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.36.210.14">contribs</a>) 00:28, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I edited the article down to statements that <i>assert</i> simple facts, removing point of view, promotional language, etc. A prior version of the article is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Burkutally&amp;oldid=19953386" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Burkutally&amp;oldid=19953386" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Vanity. No verifiable sources made for various grandiose claims. It does not give a source for the "rumors" that Burkutally knows luminaries such as Tony Blair, Sir Richard Branson, etc. The only two cited sources are a website which consists of a single web page, <a href="http://www.namoka.com" class="external free" title="http://www.namoka.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.namoka.com</a>, saying merely "Corporate site coming soon," and a listing of Burkutally's name as the 12047th person to sign an online petition opposing Verisign's Sitefinder. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:37, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> When an article includes future tense, i.e. "will become", it is painfully obvious that it is vanity. Oh,BTW, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. "Claims important connections with famous people" makes the subject sound like a name-dropper.

<p>Then delete it already. (Unsigned comment by 82.36.210.14)</p>

<dd>Normal procedure is for it to be considered for five days. This allows time for people to find out about the VfD, research the topic, improve the article, and so forth. This is very beneficial to some articles and many end up being kept as a result. It's often embarrassing to the contributors of obvious vanity articles. The outcome of this VfD seems clear. If you are Adam Burkutally and you find this embarrassing, just try to stay away from the article and the VfD as much as you can. Shrug it off.</dd>
<dd>Articles of this kind are contributed all the time and get deleted all the time. Every time you create a new page it warns you "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business (see what Wikipedia is not)," but creating this kind of article is a very common newcomer's mistake. Regular Wikipedians see it all the time. We don't even mind it very much as long as the article creator doesn't make <i>too</i> much of a pest of himself.</dd>
<dd>If you're interested in contributing to Wikipedia, I suggest you create an account. It makes it easier to communicate. You get a User Page on which it is considered all right to put information about yourself and you get to create any user name you like. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:17, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
