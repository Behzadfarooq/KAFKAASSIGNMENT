<li><b>Comment</b> given that the concept is a relatively recent development (earliest comment <i>permitting</i> the idea appeared in 2001—5 years ago at most), and by comparison to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist Judaism</a> a "branch of Judaism" which apparently consists of a marginally more notable approximately 110 congregations<a href="http://www2.jrf.org/cong/directory-all.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.jrf.org/cong/directory-all.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (began as a concept as far back as the 1920s, split formally from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> in 1968—38 years ago), I think a bit of leniency is in order. That said, this long article doesn't belong (at least not at that length) in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a>, nor am I convinced that the sum total of the content belongs <i>anywhere</i> on WP just yet, not because the phenomenon of women's participation in orthodox prayer services is unnoteworthy, but because the name for the article amounts to an endorsement by WP of a specific expression thereof. The number of groups actually following the philosophy addressed by the article is much higher than 20 (and the assertion that it's fewer is spurious at best), but unlike the one relevant hit in JFW's google search, they are not organized to the level where they're all out publishing websites. A cursory glance through <a href="http://www.jofa.org/social.php/orthodoxy" class="external text" title="http://www.jofa.org/social.php/orthodoxy" rel="nofollow">this page</a> indicates that the concept extends far beyond a simple one-hit result on Google. That the article (previously a section of the minyan article) is given the name of a particular group practicing what the article describes is a different issue, which should be addressed at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. The article has merit, it just needs to be renamed and have a <i>lot</i> of work put into encyclopædizing it. As for where it goes, like I said earlier, it doesn't belong, especially with such undue weight, in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a>, being more appropriate in <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:07, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's almost all <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> original research meant to turn the left-wing segment of Orthodox Judaism into just another "branch" of Conservative Judaism -- which is just plain dumb and dishonest, like the Conservative's pretending to go by Halakha when in fact they just want to dump as much of it as they can. If this article has anything of value let it be put into either <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism_5da7.html" title="Modern Orthodox Judaism">Modern Orthodox Judaism</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>. Anyhow, how can anyone justify such a long rambling basically <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> of a name, in Hebrew yet, to posture as something significant? It ain't happenin' babe, a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> is a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> and will always be a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> ... of Jewish <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">MEN</a>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I acknowledge Tomer has a point. While the phenomenon is indeed significantly broader than its web presence suggests, because of its novelty and relative informality, there is indeed not necessarily universal agreement on what to call it, so for WP to pick what may at this point be a mere candidate name may indeed be leading rather than following what it is trying to describe. Although others will need to judge the underlying merits. I acknowledge that the subject-matter is controversial. I would only hope that any disagreement regarding its merits, as a matter of personal religious philosophy, would not be confused with the issue of the phenomenom's notability, or interest to researchers and to the public, for purposes of making an editorial decision. It might be useful to do a Google search under "Shira Hadasha". Indeed, Shira Hadasha may well be sufficiently noteworthy on the web at this point to deserve its own article based on such a Google search alone, if so perhaps the content could be put there with a sentence or two and a link in articles like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>, etc. --Anystat 15:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are new here, so let me point out a few things that you hopefully won't take as condescension. First, this is an encyclopedia, not an indescriminate collection of information. Please review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Second, wikipedia has a policy prohibiting <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (read the guideline, it probably means something other than what you perceive). Third, WP has a policy requiring that information be presented from a neutral perspective. Much of the information in the article is presented as unabashèd advocacy. Any advocacy is fine, as long as the [substantial] opposition is also presented. Please review <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Finally, in either <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>, the information presented in the edits you propose give undue weight to what is, at least at this early stage, a new and [relatively, in the grand scheme things, at least presently] insignificant phenomenon. Including information in the depth this addition attempts to gives undue weight to what thus far is not proven to be anything more than a bit of fuzz on a radar screen. Copy this stuff to User:Anystat/Minyan Shivyoni Hilchati if you like and if it becomes more relevant to the Jewish world as a whole in the next 2-5 years, bring it back (to <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a> tho, not to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a>). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 17:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Three points. First, there is evidence of an actual, reasonably coherent phenomenon here. The sources verify that services, when described, are conducted in a similar manner, with women being allowed to do similar things and not allowed to do other similar things, and similar reasons being cited for why and why not. This consistency simply wouldn't happen in some general effort to synthesize Orthodoxy and Feminism or to explore women's roles in Judaism. It indicates a coherent, clarified phenomenon that can legitimately be treated as a distinct subject. Second, the phenomenon, while novel and hardly major, is not of merely isolated interest. Third, the neutrality of the article has been enhanced since it was first introduced. --Anystat 04:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Keep - because people looking for the newly coined term need an encyclopedia article telling them the meaning of the term. Wikipedia, as a comprehensive encyclopedia, has articles on extreme left and right topics as long as the entry is written from a neutral POV. This is a notable phenomena even if one disagrress with it. The article needs to be fleshed out and not just a list of places.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: Given that the demographic center of Judaism is roughly the left wing of Conservativism, this viewpoint is merely a little to the right of center. What's all this about it being 'extreme'? On the other hand, seems to me that statements like "the Conservative's pretending to go by Halakha when in fact they just want to dump as much of it as they can.", or "It ain't happenin' babe, a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> is a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> and will always be a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> ... of Jewish <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">MEN</a>" are pretty durn good examples of what WP DOESN'T want in its editorial judgments.
