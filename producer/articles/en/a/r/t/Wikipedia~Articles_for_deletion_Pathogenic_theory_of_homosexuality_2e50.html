<p>One person's untested speculation does not constitute a scientific theory and does not warrant an article in an encyclopedia.

As much as people may not want this theory to exist it does and is not Wikipedia's job to censor ideas which appear mainstream enough to be in the economist, in books like the one above.</li>
<li>The 'reliable sources' you cite are a blog and a personal web page. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> is a physicist. Caleb Crain is a writer (not a professor, not affiliate with Harvard) with a degree in English who says of his blog at harvard.edu: <i>I started this blog mostly because it was free. Harvard Law School, which I didn't attend, was offering to host blogs by anyone with a harvard.edu address</i>.

If the article was in Out magazine that means it is 'main stream', main stream enough that it isn't the sole ravings of one unknown scientist, but a well respected scientist - and the theory has been around since at least 1999. Let's do some research and put it into the article instead of deleting it 30 minutes after it was created. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 17:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, all that article has to say about this topic is once sentence that says, <i>And more controversially still, he has suggested that homosexuality is caused by an infection.</i> At most, that belongs in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> article. <i>Out</i> magazine recently reported that Elizabeth Taylor's dog Sugar recently passed on -- appearing in <i>Out</i> magazine does not inherently make something worth documenting on Wikipedia. Even the primary source you cite (article from <i>Out</i> says): <i>It is worth repeating that there is no evidence for a gay germ yet.</i> and <i>At this point, there is only speculation pitted against speculation.</i> Wikipedia is not the place for putting forward rampant speculation as legitimate scientific theory (which requires that a conjecture be tested and shown to hold true to the empirical evidence, among other things). --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 17:30, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then say in the article it is 'rampant speculation', if indeed you can find such a quote. So far there are a number (3?) of mainstream sources I've quoted that talk about this issue, be it a theory or conjecture or however you wish to classify this concept. How many sources do you want from your statement "citation of reliable sources are necessary for an alleged 'scientific theory'", there are a variety of theories that are wrong, and controversial yet if they are in magazines and come from known scientists then it seems to me it has a place on Wikipedia. Raise objections with the article in the article itself. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 17:46, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Since you say "One person's untested speculation" and it is at least two, and "Citation of reliable sources are necessary for an alleged 'scientific theory', and I've given 3 citations perhaps you were a bit hasty in putting this up for vfd since it seems both reasons you gave for doing so are wrong. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 18:29, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly, I think that what this Gregory Cochran has been promulgating is utter rubbish. But that is irrelevant. If this theory is, as Tabor has said, the unverifiable ramblings of a small group of men, it has no place on Wikipedia, so then my vote would be <b>delete</b>. But if it is a more less established scientific theory, I would vote <b>keep and send to cleanup</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Like everything else it has to be NPOV but I don't think that the solution is to keep anyone from explaining the theories, however offbeat they may seem to the average reader, if there is some support for the theory.

<li>The fact that this has been put up on VfD doesn't mean that no research or no edits are possible, Shaun. It's what happened to <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton%2C_Warwickshire_bde9.html" title="Upton, Warwickshire">Upton, Warwickshire</a>, and those edits turned the article from a certain delete into a certain keep.

<li>Ewald is evidently quite careful about what he says on the topic; I don't know that "support" would be quite the word. From your own source: <i>In a carefully worded e-mail, Ewald, for his part, asserts only that "the argument about infectious causation of homosexuality is a feasible hypothesis and should be treated as suchâ€”no more and no less."</i> Untested hypotheses are not Wikipedia material unless they are newsworthy in their own right, such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>. If other editors believe that a single sentence in the Economist reporting what someone has "suggested" and an article in <i>Out</i> magazine constitute sufficient newsworthiness to overcome the lack of any peer-reviewed scientific publications, so be it. I personally have no objection to a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> article, and think that where this belongs. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 19:02, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>While I would be the first to agree that the germ theory has about as much scientitic credentials as GWB, this is parable to the Intelligent Design theory.

<li>One problem is that if an eccentric notion is not widely publicised and not widely believed, as well as being far outside what is established in mainstream science, no scientist is going to bother criticizing or rejecting it; no one is going to give it a second thought, because no credible scientific source is going to publish it. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 22:44, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

As much as people may not want this theory to exist it does and is not Wikipedia's job to censor ideas which appear mainstream enough to be in the economist, in books like the one above. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 08:40, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Noone in here is saying that it should be deleted because it's not politically correct. The issue is whether or not this topic is notable enough to be on Wikipedia. We can't just include every brainfart simply because it exists. And I'm still not sure whether this is notable enough. But then again, YMMV. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 10:56, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a web page about the book that cites Gregory Cochran for further reading. Someone's <i>web page about the book, not the book</i>. In fact the <i>same</i> personal web site you have already cited. As with the blogger you mistook for a Harvard professor, please try to examine sources carefully and not distort the origin of the information. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 02:14, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you say so, although I'm not sure what quality of research you expect when you put up articles for deletion 5 minutes after the topic was started. If you want more information than research it *before* putting it up for deletion, thanks. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 23:55, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>You could also have researched the theory further and for instance have written the article in Word before posting it here. Noone is forced to come up with an article out of the blue. The quality of your research is not determined by the time between the start of the topic and the nomination for deletion. To paraphrase you: if you want us to know more about the topic, then research it *before* creating the article. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 13:19, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps a broader article about Cochran's idea that conditions that the layperson would expect to be "bred out" might all be caused by microbes would be a better idea. The hypothesis he's putting forward is not unscientific -- and nothing like as offensive as some are trying to make out -- but it's not a widely pursued line of thought. Does that make it not worth coverage? Well, he's got a bit of press -- on the gay germ angle -- so it's been noted. We shouldn't be judging the notability of scientific, or quasiscientific, ideas on our own account but merely considering whether they are part of the general discourse on science and things scientific. This seems to be to me, but I don't much like this particular article. So no vote from me but I'd like to see this merged into a less contentiously titled article (avoiding the word "theory").<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:46, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia <i>does</i> have standards for scientific and medical topics ... see: <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Science_and_Medicine" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Science_and_Medicine</a>. This comes nowhere close. Not only is it unpublished and without peer review, there is not even the slightest attempt at empirical validation. It is nowhere in the neighborhood. Not even close. Sorry ... guess I am venting here. Sometimes it seems that Wikipedia is willing to drop all standards of reliable information in an inflated interpretation of NPOV and the lowest possible barriers of "notability".&#160;:-S <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 02:24, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
