<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be ridiculous to delete this article about a surgeon of worldwide acclaim. Shame on anyone who deletes this article. He is even refered to in several other Wikipedia articles. One of the ironies of Wikipedia is that few people do this to puny minor Hollywood psuedo celebrities of little cultural significance. Meanwhile, somebody like Dr. Meltzer, a pioneering surgeon, known worldwide by people who ought to know about him, who spent decades in medical school and perfecting his craft, of important historical significance, gets put on this list by ignorant people without a clue. People need to STAND DOWN from this kind of Wiki behavior unless they can demonstrate some reliable reason for doing so. There is none in this case. Removing this article would violate written Wikipedia policy. Nobody commenting has shown good basis for removing it. I VOTE NO, regarding its removal. What kind of luddites are making these decisions? Who created this nomination, based on what research or criteria.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Dr. Meltzer is an immensely notable doctor in the transcommunity, much like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marci_Bowers_8156.html" title="Marci Bowers">Marci Bowers</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Biber_6a15.html" title="Stanley Biber">Stanley Biber</a>. I am working with the article's editors to input reliable sources to back up some of the "pioneering technique" claims (So far all I've found where blogs, self-published sites and medical journals that you have to pay to access and verify). Some of the resources that I did find and add into the article gives ardent claim for notability-like performing 400-500 SRS surgeries a year. The source I added goes on to note that on average only 800-1100 are done in the US in a year. He also has numerous peer reviewed contibutions to notable medical journals. (See article's talk page and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=G&amp;oi=qs&amp;q=%22toby+meltzer%22+author:t-meltzer" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=G&amp;oi=qs&amp;q=%22toby+meltzer%22+author:t-meltzer" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a>.

His academic work &amp; writing are relatively modest and I'd submit he clearly falls short of professional noteriety to really merit an individual entry.

<dd>(after edit conflict) <b>Comment</b> Actually, Dr. Oliver's comment enhances Dr. Meltzer's encyclopedic worth by virtue of being an expert in (as you note) a <i>very specialized area</i>. In an area that is under-represented in Wikipedia (relevant to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systematic bias</a>), after the late <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Biber_6a15.html" title="Stanley Biber">Stanley Biber</a>, Dr. Meltzer is probably <i>the</i> most notable SRS surgeon. He is certainly the most prolific in the US. In deleting this article, we sharply decrease Wikipedia's value in being a comprehensive source of knowledge in this area. Unless, of course, the area of <a href="../../../g/l/b/GLBT_c305.html" title="GLBT">GLBT</a> related articles (and in particular transgender-related articles) is, in itself, not worthy of encyclopedic inclusion. Please don't interpret that as a Strawman because I'm not contending that anyone here is arguing that. Rather, I want to emphasize how relevant the Dr. Meltzer article is to Wikipedia's desire to overcome systematic bias and be a free source of knowledge to all--in <b>all</b> areas of encyclopedic merit. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would disagree with your rationale somewhat. If we're to catalog contemporary or historic physicians, I think there must be some threshold as to someone's notability. In medicine you've got to assess their historic signifigance in the field, academic achievment (did they publish extensively or produce influential sentinal papers), professional status (were they leaders in their field) , and consider other ways for which they've gained noteriety. Dr. Meltzer is clearly not going to meet at least the first three of those milestones if you poll other surgeons I'd argue. A "comprehensive" source would certainly contain entries on transgender issues, but featuring a successful surgeon who performs the operation but is otherwise lacking in historic/professional stature is diluting things too much I submit. Again, it pains me to argue against inclusion of a physician someone has felt enough about to profile and this isn't a slight against Dr. Meltzer. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 01:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You missed my point entirely, sir. The problem with your rationale above centres around the "otherwise lacking" and "if you poll other surgeons". This is not peer-reviewed, firstly. Secondly, Dr. Meltzer is at the top of his <i>specialised</i> field and is thus notable. Thirdly, when I started the article, it was not that I "felt enough about" the subject, rather that WP was incomplete without mention of Dr. Meltzer for all the reasons I have previously stated. - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Alison</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 03:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would concur with Ali. His stature among his peers is only relevant in the regard (in respects to notability) of whether or not he is viewed as an expert in his field. I would think a Biologist specializing in elements of Creationism is not highly noted for "historic/professional stature" among other biologists, however if those biologist concede that he is the "expert creationist" in their field then he has notability in his field for the benefit of a wikipedia. Remember, wikipedia is geared towards the reader and those who will be moved to want to research and look up such information in an encyclopedia. There are far more people interested in who is the expert of SRS surgery then in "who do the plastic surgeons regard highly among their peers". <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 04:23, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" -wikipedia gets 30,200. In Google news, "pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" gets 0 hits. "Sexual reassignment" gets 58.

<dd>First, I will note that my search was done in "quotes" which meant the results were specific to the type of surgery looking for--not just random sex stuff. Secondly, take a step back for a moment and think what is more likely to be searched for on Wikipedia. An article on SRS or Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy? Conversely, would an article on the most notable SRS surgeon or most notable Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy surgeon get the most interest by readers and editors? <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 04:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that SRS is a rare bird and that a Google search is not necessarily a good representation. Any case, I see the cruft (<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>) will likely stay-- it seems WP has critical mass of SRS enthusiasts. It's just like how the inventor of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuticles.html" title="Neuticles">Neuticles</a> got their own article. I suppose it could be said that one person's cruft is another person's gemstone... and admitedly I've probably written more than my share of medicinecruft articles... so I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> <small><a href="../../../n/e/p/User_talk%7ENephron_679d.html" title="User talk:Nephron">&#160;T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nephron_3dab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nephron">C</a></small> 07:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Folks, that's "sex reassignment" (<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual.html" title="Sexual">sexual</a> means something quite different to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>). Google responds with 230,000 hits for that, and goognews gets 130, which is far more representative. - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Alison</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 04:36, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. In my opinion, the only medical procedure more controversial than sex reassignment is abortion. With how much various groups that are a part of the religious right get riled up by the concept of SRS, the surgery is, in my mind more notable than a "Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" or most other procedures. Given the controversial nature of the operation, I feel that the surgeon that appears responsible for around 50% of the surgeries is notable enough for inclusion. --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 05:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
