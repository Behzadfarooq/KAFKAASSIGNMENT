<p>Yes, he has local notability. Isn't that what is required to establish notability? He is listed as "notable" in his city's website. He has a POW story PLUS he was president of a POW organization as well as a veteran educator. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Hathorn_ca3c.html" title="User:Billy Hathorn">Billy Hathorn</a> 15:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. Here (Wikipedia), notable is defined as follows&#160;: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other." (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). See my recommendation below for further discussion on how <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> defines notability for people. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 17:44, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Guy - Out of the four references listed in the article, two are links to obituaries (with the same text, as that), and the other two don't even mention the subject in the referenced pages. Doesn't make it through <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria as he wasn't the "primary subject of multiple published works" and seems unnotable otherwise as being a WWII veteran and former POW is not a unique condition. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 17:44, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - He was the past president of a national organization of former POWs, whose members include <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>. That makes him notable IMHO. There may be a little too much detail, but that's a content decision rather than a "keep or delete" decision. This man is far more notable than some hip-hop performer who plays in bars and has self-published his first CD, or an obscure cartoon character, or any one of a series of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">Walled Garden</a> video game articles, but somehow we find space for all of those. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 17:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>McCain's article has almost 100 references; Mr. Wimberly has four, two of which don't even mention him. It might be that the other two mentioned him at some point but the content was updated or replaced; that he didn't merit keeping an archived copy of that material is further evidence of his non-notability <b>for wikipedia purposes</b>. As for the biographical detail, most of that content is anecdotal, unsourced and unverifiable, save for what's taken from the obituary; it could be argued that given enough familiarity with any subject, you could produce a biography as detailed as this one, or even more so. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 18:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guy, I don't think you are correct. This website <a href="http://www.springhillla.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.springhillla.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springhillla.com/</a> links directly to Mr. Wimberly. He is not mentioned in the website <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Ex-Prisoners_of_War_a87c.html" title="American Ex-Prisoners of War">American Ex-Prisoners of War</a>, but he was president of the group in 1974 and held other offices for the organization. Did you check other POWs to see if there is consistency in your decision? I did not realize that I had used obits from two sources. One can be struck.</p>

<dd>Hi!

<p>NOTICE:Rowan Tink From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Rowan Tink is a former Australian Special Air Service officer whose identity was widely publicised after he was awarded the United States Bronze Star Medal for his role commanding 150 SAS troopers in Afghanistan, notably during Operation Anaconda. The medal was presented to Lieutenant-Colonel Tink by Major General Frank Hagenbeck at a farewell ceremony at Bagram on 24 July 2002.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>According to the above article on Mr. Tink, having a Bronze Star is sufficient to qualify for Wikipedia.org. Therefore, Mr. Wimberly more than qualifies, right?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Billy as I said in my tag; "Mr. Wimberly" sounds like a very nice man. However, I know several individuals who were POW's. Some in WWII and a few in 'Nam. A few have the same creditanls, some even better, as Mr. Wimberly. Praise worthy a big YES Encylopedia note worthy sorry to say no. Good Luck either way. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoessss_80c5.html" title="User:Shoessss">Shoessss</a> 15:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Shoessss, what about the Bronze Star? Look over the Bronze Star lists on Wikipedia, such as that of Rowan Tink. See if Mr. Wimberly is not in the same category. Most of these war heroes are unknown to the general public outside their hometowns. If you have other POWs who should be written up, then write them up. Don't go after a WWII POW because he lacks "notability."</p>
<p>Also, consider some of the "popular culture" people on Wikipedia. If there is room for some of those, there is room for Mr. Wimberly.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> does not instantly make a person notable, but being a <i>past national commander</i> of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Ex-Prisoners_of_War_a87c.html" title="American Ex-Prisoners of War">American Ex-Prisoners of War</a> is definitely enough to make this person fit our guidelines.
