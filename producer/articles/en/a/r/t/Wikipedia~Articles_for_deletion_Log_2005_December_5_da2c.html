<p>Completely unremarkable adult model from the 70s. Article contains nothing more than the fact that she was on the cover of Penthouse magazine in late 1970, and Google appears to have nothing (<b>"Heidi Mann"</b> as this article details is lost in the background noise, <b>"Heidi Mann" + penthouse</b> gives 9 sites, each of which can be summed up as "This is the October 1970 issue of Penthouse. Heidi Mann is on the cover.") <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - whilst I might consider "Pet of the Year" as possibly a claim to notoriety, "Pet of the Month" is not. They usually have all of what 3 models per month, and so it just means that she beat the other 2. Its not a contest that she's won, and is really just a way of advertising for the magazine.

<li>If you mean in Google, I get 173 total results for <b>"Heide Mann</b>, of which 52 are unique. Skimming through the first page, I find it is dominated by the genealogy of a French surname, authors of computing/programming works and theories, and several different people whose surname is either 'Heide-Mann' or 'Heidemann'. I also get one hit for Wikipedia where the name is mentioned on a list of Penthouse Pets. Nothing beyond 'she was on the cover of an issue of Penthouse' for this girl. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:45, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., "He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."). <b>Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion. Google may help in determining context, though, and allow for the article's expansion.</b> (emphasis mine) There is enough context to allow expansion...</li>
<li>Unremarkable people. An article about a real person that does not assert their importance or significance. <b>If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead.</b> (emphasis mine) as we seem to dispute whether or not she's notable it belongs on AFD.</li>

If the subject meets our inclusion policies and guidelines, as it appears she does, then she needs to be included - but it does <i>not</i> follow that she needs an article of her own, if there is really no scope to expand it at this time. Since there is an appropriate article that already says all there is to say about her, I don't see that anyone loses anything by redirecting this; the redirect means people looking for her will find her, and the main article means people who find her will find her in context.

<li>Delete and unlink: Look, I'm old enough to have been through puberty when she was there, and I remember her fondly. She was quite famous for quite a brief period of time. Since she never managed to develop a public career beyond that, there is nothing really to say beyond the context of that shoot. Therefore, there is no way to write an article about her, nor justification for a separate discussion. This is, by the way, exactly the rationale I use for contemporary porn queens and "glamour models" and the like. It isn't that they're not pretty or famous, but rather that they're ephemera.

<li><s><b>Do Not Delete</b></s>, Was not trying to spam. Just made some links in areas that are relevant. Did not know that was not allowed. Sorry if I violated the wikipedia TOS. Sunrise Paper is not a public company and do not intend to go public at this time. Is this category only for public companies? What kind of 'indpendent verification' is required here? This seems all quite a bit over the top here. They are listed in DMOZ, paperfiber.com, and are a serious company. They export more than 20,000 Metric Tons per month. (If anyone here is in the paper business they will know what that means.) BTW-This same 'not-notable' objection is coming up for the Its Yoga posting that I put up. They are one of the oldest yoga studios in the USA, and have many itsyoga branded/owned studios around the world, are listed in both DMOZ and yahoo, and have the largest yoga studio in San Francisco. Their guru Larry Schultz is one of the most renowned yoga guru's in the USA. What is the measure of 'notable' for wikipedia? There are many single location yoga studios listed in wikipedia and I even recognize some of them their teachers were certified by Guru Larry. <a href="../../../j/t/b/User%7EJtbobwaysf_eff5.html" title="User:Jtbobwaysf">jtbobwaysf</a> 17:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete: The fruit and person are both, IMO, unremarkable (literally). Redirecting is an unlikely help in this case, as there's as much chance of a desire for the cartoon as for the video game as the person, and I think that chance is nearly zero in all three cases. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Merge: The information on the fruit (related to paper) could be merged. As the person did, someone could use the fruit's name in public and spread it; that could lead people into looking up the meaning of "wumpa", and Wikipedia would be a likely choice: thus, merging would be useful for those people. The info about the person is useless, and it's not such a relevant person, so it can stay deleted.

<li>Um.... then why do other forums have article entries (i.e. the GameFAQs and IGN forums)? Other websites have articles too. I'm not sure I understand why this one is being targeted. 67.84.213.209 23:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your confusion. The reason is that we <i>do</i> allow articles on the most massive, most important of websites, but it isn't a question of numbers. Although some voters will refer to Alexa rank or number of participants, what's at stake, really, is leadership position and effect upon the world. Thus, some site, like GameFAQs, are just plain massive. Others, like IGN, are referred to consistently in magazines and TV shows (TechTV in the US and Canada, e.g.). When a site is referred to in other media, people will have "heard" of it and need an encyclopedia to explain what it is. Thus, Wikipedia does not guide people in general about web contents, but it takes into account those sites that are cultural forces. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:33, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Something that is remarkable for being unknown is only acceptable here if we can cite a <i>reliable</i> source outside of Wikipedia remarking upon the fact that it is unknown. In other words, the fact that it is unknown must itself be known, and must be <i>already</i> known <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia, and demonstrably so. If there's a reliable source that documents the fact that the woman pictured is unknown, and documents speculation as to her identity, or research into her identity, then we can use that source. But going and researching <i>Playboy</i> ourselves, concluding from our research that this woman is unknown, and then documenting that novel conclusion, is original research.
<p>And, of course, there's the fact that such a novel conclusion is almost certainly wrong, as several editors have already pointed out. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:19, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, for the reasoning above. She had no career beyond this. However, I was making a point about "cruft": When an item, service, artifact, or person is only known by die hard fans of a subject, then that subject does not transcend its most narrow context and is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. (That's my definition of "cruft.") The presence of the acronym shows that the motive and expected audience for the article is fans of particular runs of a particular magazine: cruft. Therefore, it is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:37, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appears to be an obscure neologism. Our article gives no citation of notable use (or of anything else). A term in contemporary American politics that only gets 138 Google hits is probably not ready for prime time, and a quick survey of several of those links does not suggest to me that they all use it to mean the same thing. It is (barely) possible that there should be an article here, and I might be convinced by some good citations; I suspect, though, that if someone does the research they will find that the particular meaning the article claims for the term is not borne out even by the bulk of the meagre collection of known uses. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:46, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: I have heard this older neologism used in dialogue more than once, but very recently (two weeks ago). I find it interesting that its resurgence may be a way to anger neoconservatives by describing them with a term containg 'liberal', as that seemed to be the context in which I heard paleoliberalism. 42Moxies 10:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I am the person that created the article and of course object to it being deleted. The accusation that I made the term up is ridiculous. I've read it in various articles and webpages. That's where I got the name and from those articles and webpages I was able to put together the description of Paleoliberalism. As others have commented, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and as Wikipedia describes it an encyclopedia is "a written compendium of knowledge". And knowledge is exactly why the article should stay. I created the article as a public service of sorts, for those who my not know the term, but may know the concept. If the article is deleted it will do a great disservice to this website. Therefore I humbly request all of you who have voted for deletion to reconsider your votes and instead vote to Keep out of the spirit of what Wikipedia is supposed to be. -- <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleoLib_e0ff.html" title="User:PaleoLib">PaleoLib</a> 17:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, possibly Merge with Classical Liberalism.</b> The principles espoused in this article are fairly in line with most Libertarian positions, and in fact I can see very little in it that really differs with common notions of Classical Liberalism. On general principle though, I feel Wikipedia is not a resource of finite bandwidth, or pagespace, as the guideline stated. Hence, I think it should be kept, but possibly narrowed to tailor itself to focus towards the specific minutiae that separate it from other forms of Libertarian/Individual Rights political ideology. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKade_4d23.html" title="User:Kade">Kade</a> 01:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>How would that give it sources? This is a personal essay by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleoLib_e0ff.html" title="User:PaleoLib">user:PaleoLib</a>. If we merge it then it's worse because we wouldn't realize how unsourced it is. (It's like asking a vegetarian "Well, could you eat the meat if we cut it up finely and hid it in a sauce?") The fact is that the word is a slightly-used neologism, and if we wanted to we could accumulate all of the different meanings of the word. But that's dictionary-making. There doesn't seem to be "paleoliberal" movement that uses the word. If there is, we should find sources that atalk about it.

<dd>There are no academic sources, that I can find, that refer to this particular political idea. There are however blog and political publication sources which use it in reference to current events.

<p>I've already voted above, but I want to reiterate: if someone can come up with more than a handful of citations that this word is used with some consistency of meaning, fine, but, otherwise, original research shouldn't be here, adn making it redirect somewhere is likely to be actively misleading, because we've already found multiple uses among the few that exist. If someone comes across a reference to paleoliberal meaning a Nixon-era neoconservative and looks up the word, it's not use to them at all to get a redirect to something else entirely. If we are going to have this in Wikipedia at all, what we need is a decently cited article on how the word has actually been used, linking to the articles that then explain the (diverse) ideologies for which this is an (uncommon) name. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:48, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, no. See, that's the point, we don't want you to waste your work if the comic is deemed non-notable and the article is deleted. On the other hand, if you create an article on the <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia Wiki</a> it's almost certainly not going to be deleted there. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 03:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact it has served as an inspiration at least one notable web comic (Tsunami Channel) is certainly evidence supporting a claim of "setting a trend" (see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>).

<li>Comment: Having read "Wiki is Not" closer, I say this successfully passes the test for inclusion on all grounds. The article is NOT: defining jargon, publishing original material, propaganda (in need of NPOV, maybe, but not promotion, certainly), a repository of links, personal home page, indiscriminate list of info (as per the examples given there), or crystal ball. Therefore, by the official Wiki standards, this article merits inclusion. QED. ^_^ <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 05:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And one more comment to really nail the coffin of this AfD: Wiki is not a bureaucracy. Fiercely applying Alexa violates the spirit of the law (and its letter, as I just showed). So, I argue that the spirit of Wiki's rules (as well as the proto-spirit of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) supports this articles presence. And now I'm going to be insufferable with future web comic AfDs. I just know it. ^_^ <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 05:35, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's worth noting that that section about "setting a trend" was added to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> by you, attempted to be used by you to support an argument of yours at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> (since archived), removed several times, discussed on the talk page and found wanting, removed several times again, and recently added back in. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 06:22, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The edit history of that policy page is simply a function of the tumultuous nature of working by concensus (note that it was not added back by me, but by someone else who agreed). And even without the setting a trend argument, the spirit of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> still supports the inclusion of this article. So your comment has little relevance to the matter at hand. Please avoid ad hominem personal attacks; this does not reflect well on someone up for arbitration. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 06:26, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

And thanks for reminding me that I' currently having a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Struggle_session.html" title="Struggle session">struggle session</a> held over my opinion that webcomics should meet the same encyclopedic standard as everything else.

<li>I claim no privileged knowledge of the law's spirit, only knowledge of how I view it. If you have a different view, then state it as it applies to this AfD. Trying to discredit my views with irrelevant edit histories has no place here. It's hard to "silence a dissenting opinion" when you have yet to voice any opinion on the topic, let alone a dissenting one. As for the merits of the arbitration, I won't comment here since it's not relevant and I don't want to assist in your derailing of the AfD discussion beyond personal defense. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 07:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmmm, webcomics really aren't my thing, but this one does seem to exist and the article gives a decent write-up and there are pretty pictures (it's creative commons). I'd suggest <s>keep</s> or, if there really is a consensus for deletion, that the article be <b>held</b> until someone from comixpedia has been asked if they want to take a copy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of the various notability guidelines is to remove material that is unencyclopedicâthat is, material that does not (and cannot) constitute a proper article in an encyclopedia. A good article being written, as has been done here, on a subject that may be considered "non-notable" suggests that the spirit, if not the letter, of the guidelines has been satisfied. â<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:29, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note that I said "good article" rather than "well-written article". I think the bar for inclusion is more easily passed by an article about an artistic work (even a little-known or unimportant one) than by an article about a mass-manufactured household item; but yes, if you were able to write such an article, I see no reason why it could not be included. It would be harder than it seems, I suspect, simply because there's very little to say about the average doorknob that is both verifiable and meaningful; but there likely are particular doorknobs (with enough history or distinguishing features) for which legitimate articles could be writtenâthe doorknobs in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> building, for instance <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ABOUT_building_doors" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ABOUT_building_doors" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. â<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>See, this is where I totally disagree. In my time at wikipedia, I have nominated some "good" informative articles on absolutely non notable subjects, and will continue to do so. I'm surprised at the amount of support this one has obtained and the amount of attention it seems to have garnered though, but I do not think that the bar of inclusion should be lowered or raised depending on the perceived quality of an article. I would vote to keep a substub on something notable as I did for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantic_Dream&amp;oldid=21066217" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantic_Dream&amp;oldid=21066217" rel="nofollow">Quantic Dream</a> article, yet would vote to delete an article aproaching featured quality on someone's house. I don't care how much it's worth, who built it, who it's former residents were and how bad the kitchen fire of 2003 was. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:08, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think article quality and "notability" tend to intersect rather neatly (as I noted, perhaps less clearly than I could, above). In other words, if we are able to write a near-featured-quality article (with all of the details of referencing and so forth that the status entails) about a house, it serves as an indication that the house <i>is</i> notable; conversely, a truly non-notable house will make for a lack of references (as well as a lack of verifiable content for the article). So the quality of an article, while not the only factor, is certainly an indication of the subject's potential. â<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:00, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it's worth noting that there's a lot of good information that can be written on any given work of fiction (See: <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> amongst others).

<li>Hahnchen: your example would fall under the "indiscriminate information" part of "Wiki is Not." There is a large difference between a web comic that has influenced three other notable comics and someone's house. As I showed above, "Wiki is Not" clearly seems to indicate that this article is fine for inclusion. Please pick a better example to avoid the paper tiger fallacy. Also, I think a reason this has drawn attention is the fact the community thinks this article is notable. Also, there's been a much closer eye brought to the status of web comic articles on Wiki over the past few weeks in large part due to all the deletions that have happened. In essence, your own past actions (and those of others) have motivated other editors to react and respond to help make Wiki better by blocking what they think of as bad AfDs. An interesting example of a social feedback loop in action. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 02:49, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please note that you are the only user who has made this declaration. It's easy to project our own motivations onto others, in particular when they agree to a course of action. I'd urge you to speak as much as possible for your <i>own</i> motivations. If other editors make explicit reference to blocking "bad AfDs" then you may reasonable mentions it.

<li>Actually I think I agree with Xuanwu on this. I've seen a similar reaction in response to Neutrality's campaign to delete school articles in <s>April</s> May--as a result of that reaction, it's now all but impossible for anyone to delete an article about a school provided the school actually exists and is not a pre-school. The unfortunately deletion listing of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkerboard_Nightmare_aedb.html" title="Checkerboard Nightmare">Checkerboard Nightmare</a> had ramifications beyond Wikipedia, and ultimately led to internal side-effects that , through the arbitration case, drew this campaign of webcomic deletions to my attention. So on a wiki, it's true that every action has an opposite reaction. History has shown that the reaction is seldom equal; deletion campaigns, where they are seen to pick the wrong target, tend to backfire because the reaction has a somewhat greater effect. Engaging in what looks like attempts to marginalise dissent, and to bully those who disagree with you, well it makes things worse. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:19, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Aaron, I warn you that your wording above is on the absolute edge of good faith. I'll leave my words to stand, for the current situation readily illustrates the unwisdom of deletion campaigns and the last thing this debate needs is more nitpicking.</li>
<li>And again I remind you that nobody ever needs to provide a rationale to <i>keep</i> an article. Unless a consensus can be raised to <i>delete</i> it, it will not be deleted. The article should be kept in my opinion because it's a perfectly lovely article about a rather pretty webcomic that influenced two others. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:37, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The AfD for Checkboard Nightmare was unfortunate, because it pissed a lot of people off. It was seen to pick the wrong target by many webcomics fans.

<li>Webcomics are already taking the flavour of schools, theres been a webcomic afd watch page for quite a while now. If wikipedia is going to say, "yes, let's allow articles for all webcomics", then we better start removing the wiki is not a web directory because it obviously would be. No, the comparison to the house is not fallacious, no matter what you claim. It's just that you see the house on the wrong side of indiscriminate information, whereas I see them both to be on the wrong side. So a webcomic is notable if it influences another webcomic. Right, OK, what about the webcomics which influenced this one? And then? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 10:41, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Aaron: I think the recent efforts to "clean up" web comics on Wiki can be deemed a "deletion campaign," since deletion was the primary tool used for this clean up. Also, ym statement about a reaction to it was not judging the worthiness of the attempted clean up (it had both good and bad points about it); I am saying that people are reacting to how they preceive it. And, like it or not, many seem to view it as "bad," because articles that appear well written wound up deleted alongside those that were obvious poor entries (like some "My web comic is teh awesome~!!!111!!one!"). I'll point to this AfD as anecdotal evidence: I think a few months ago this article would have been deleted with little ceremony. Now enough people have become aware of past deletions that you're starting to see some actual debate on the topic. In some ways it's good because now the concensus is more representative of what the people want, in other ways it can be negative since it will mean having to present much stronger arguments for deletion than simply "Fails Alexa, not notable, delete" (which was the general gist of many previous AfDs). So now the people who want to see something deleted have to work harder to make it so. Not entirely bad.</li>
<li>Hahnchen: No, the house is still flawed because it is a poor example that lacks similarity to the issue at hand (again, a paper tiger you've constructed because it's easier to tackle than the matter at hand). A web comic is like a science article or a literary work. And their electronic format means they can affect thousands across the globe. When a scientific article is published, part of what makes it important is not just the results it finds, but how much it is cited (you can look online to see how this is measured). An article is important not just because of its content or how many read it, but by who cites it. If an obscure study is cited in an article that itself becomes famous, then the article cited itself is notable for the role it played in shaping that person's research. Similarly, when an artist paints, they usually study the works of others. If they become famous, then those who inspired them likewise become famous for the role they played in shaping the work. Another example, when Wen Wang became the first Emperor of the Zhou Dynasty in China, his father, Wu Wang, also became notable because of his role in setting the foundation for his son (I may be switching the roles of Wen and Wu, but you get the idea). What we have here is a webcomic that has served as a literary and artistic inspiration for at least three notable webcomics and possibly more. Therefore, it is notable in the same vein as the examples I just cited. And because the article itself passes the check of "Wiki is Not," there is no grounds for deletion. A house does not have this property of becoming notable through citation; so, again, your example is logically unsound. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 22:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I know that people here aren't probably going to delete it nor is this going to change peoples views. But this is just to counterpoint some of Lar's claims. I can't see any of those being "artisically significant". If that were so, then every webcomic ever in existance would probable be notable enough for Lar. Simultaneous story threads? Writer anonymity? How is this of artistic significance, it's the internet, lots of things are posted anonymously or through stupid pseduonyms such as Anne Nonymous, and a webcomic to have multiple story threads is just any webcomic which isn't of "gag a day" style. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:24, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am not sure that I agree that "people here aren't probably going to delete it nor is this going to change peoples views" as my nose counting shows this a close run thing, it depends on how the admin evaluates the consensus here. Further this discussion may well change the views or influence the views of those yet to express themselves. I know I read what is written before I add my thoughts. So it's good that you are making yourself heard even if I think you're incorrect. (and I tweaked a bit of formatting above, please feel free to untweak it if you did not like what I did)</li>
<li>The deletion nomination and several other delete comments refer to the webcomic being on hiatus, or having finished its run. That, in and of itself is not evidence of non-notability. Nor is something currently being published evidence of notability. THAT is the point I was trying to make with the Poor Richard reference, that things that happened in the past can still be notable in an encyclopedia (since wikipedia is not an almanac... THAT must be why my subconscious dredged up the Poor Richard example!). So I think, just as with CxN, just as with so many other AfD nominations I've seen lately (yes, I've been lurking about a bit, you've got my attention now, and you may hear from me again) that using "it just ended" or "it's on hiatus" is a bogus reason for deletion. Argue that it wasn't significant when it was active or that it hasn't had an effect since, but not *merely* that it's in the past. Encyclopedias cover the past as well as the present. If something was significant in the past, that it is over is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Simultaneous story threads... Yes, I am aware that many story comics have different threads, sorry for not being clearer. I refer to the fact that several of the "elements" (story chapters) were being worked on at the same time but kept separate, near as I could tell. THAT's the significance I see there, not just interweaved threads in the same story. That's a lot less common in webcomics than just having threads.</li>
<li>Guest writers are themeselves noteworthy... see <a href="http://greeneyes.metalbat.com/bio.html" class="external text" title="http://greeneyes.metalbat.com/bio.html" rel="nofollow">bio</a>. I found them noteworthy. You may not. If you ask me why and I cite their work or the fact that they have different styles, or come from different places, or chose pseudonyms that are interesting, or cite their articles here in support of their noteworthyness, we're in a regress.</li>
<li>As pointed out elsewhere, the problem of noteworthiness (er, is it I or Y?) and how to establish it is hard. Webcomics are somewhat loosely linked to highly verifiable sources, it takes a few links from source to source to get to the NYT or Brittania. But Wikipedia is not paper. I am inclusionist. While I would not include every single webcomic that ever had 2 strips published, I would include this one. In fact, I would include most of the ones that have been coming up on AfDs lately. I think the efforts to purge Wikipedia of most webcomics are misguided. Wikipedia is not paper. I am inclusionist.</li>
<li>I'll reiterate, I am satisfied with the notability and verifiability that others above me provided as well. You may not agree, which is fine. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 03:43, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Absolutely no disadvantages to having this information. The current version of the article is pretty good, and establishes notability and verifiability. Because of that, I assume that this nomination was based on a substantially different earlier version.

<li>The band has not released any albums or singles, been signed by anyone, or even had any gigs apart from performing in school. Furthermore, not only does the article explicitly state that they play in the garage of one of the member's parents, the article even has photographs of all of the band members in said garage.

<p>A "<a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>" community of questionable notability. The assertions of notability made in the article (50 users at once) are fairly weak in and of themselves; we wouldn't let a niche IRC network of 50 users create an article on Wikipedia without <i>exceptional</i> additional circumastances, and I see this as being no different. A positive: the addition of the article seems to have brought several enthusiastic new editors to Wikipedia. The negative: these new editors brought some of the "politics" of the talker with them, and an edit war largely consiting of inneundo and arguing over minutae has commenced. (There's a request for protection in process, amazingly.) So, in short--not notable and somewhat toxic to the community. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 03:25, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I offer the following addenda to my initial nomination. It would appear that I wasn't sufficiently clear with my reasoning:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1.) The nomination is made as a litmus test regarding the possible scaling back of the unusually <i>large</i> amount of information we have about talkers. The combined material from these articles approaches the size of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>-- a fact that I find strange.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2.) The size of each individual community suggests to me that, while talkers as a phenomenon are certainly worthy of appropriately thorough documentation, different articles containing exhaustive and complete details these communities is probably not valuable. That is not to say that I don't value completeness--I simply don't believe that the factual material would be appropriately encyclopedic. Continuing...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3.) Much of the factual material seems to consist of the discussion of the internal politics of the talker. The interpersonal machinations of small, little-heard of groups are, as far as I can tell, neither notable nor encyclopedic. If we aren't accepting biographies of local political candidates in jurisdictions many times larger than the entirety of the talker universe, then I can't justify the inclusion of details of the talkers' politics.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4.) Many of the factual claims made in the articles--not just the politics but also some of the statistical information--are almost inherently unverifiable. The politics are without substantive, neutral documentation or significant public record. I suspect that may be additional support for my belief that the material itself is neither substantive nor significant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5.) A point of policy: the behavior and motivations of the involved editors can, in fact, be used in consideration of whether or not an article should be deleted. I refer you to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and other materials relating to "bad faith" edits and bad faith actions. It's one of the Golden Rules of Wikipedia to assume good faith! I always try to assume good faith. But it is extremely difficult to assume good faith when the first actions of a new editor or new editors is to angrily declare expertise and an inalienable right to have the final word on an article based on that declaration. The concept is further strained when that editor quickly defaults to a last-resort administrative procedure--a request for protection--to achieve that final word. It's borderline "gaming the system," which is almost the exact opposite of displaying newcomer traits and casts a pallor of bad faith over the entire affair.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6.) The policies are important, but the golden rule for inclusion is this: "Would this same type of material normally be found in a print encyclopedia?" The answer is no, not unless we were discussing the most esoteric single-subject encyclopedia in existence--"The Encyclopedia of Internet Chat Mechanisms," or something.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I originally created the article as part of my series on the history of talkers, with the asserted notoriety in relation to the conversial elements of this talker. However, in retrospect, having an individual article purely to document controversies is something that I think is probably not a good idea. I have been considering merging the controversies in to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planes_of_Existence_%28talker%29_ec56.html" title="Planes of Existence (talker)">Planes of Existence (talker)</a> for some time, as was suggested by a number of users (indeed, some suggested merely documenting important events of talkers in to one article, which has merit). I did try to redirect this article and merge it so as to avoid an edit war, but this did not work and have stopped editing due to the 3RR rule. It seems understandably that the owner of this particular talker does not want to have an article created about them for what they perceive to be an attack page, and there have been irreconcilable issues with regards to resolving its <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. The talker itself asserts no claims to notoriety. Its main page has an alexa rank of over 5 million, it was never the most popular talker in history (indeed, never in the top 10), was not the first to do anything and is not unique in any way. Whilst there are assertions that it was the first to combine talker and muds, this is not true. <a href="../../../t/i/n/TinyMUD_dfff.html" title="TinyMUD">TinyMUD</a> was in fact the first to do this, in 1989, 7 years before this talker was created, when they created <a href="../../../m/u/s/MUSH_a560.html" title="MUSH">MUSH</a>. Other than the many controversies surrounding this particular talker, it has no assertions to notoriety. I do feel rather sheepish for nominating an article that I created for deletion, but I also feel that this is a good way to resolve disputes and hopefully stop the plague of vandalism that has hit this and related pages in the past few days. I would have suggested merge, but as all of the notable things about this talker are listed elsewhere, there is no longer any point to it. Hence I would like to suggest an outright delete. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 03:30, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: the creator of this entry created the entry in bad faith. He admitedly never visited the talker, posted very negative POV information (check the very early history of edits, for example!), and he created this without knowledge and permission the owner of the chat. Once the entry was discovered, though, the community has made great strides towards making the page better!<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcat55_68cb.html" title="User:Blackcat55">Blackcat55</a> 00:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Response: There was nothing bad faith about it. It was the 6th talker article that I created, and I included it as a link to the others. Yes, *EARLY* versions were somewhat non-neutral, as I had limited sources. If Crystal Palace had an actual usable website that had information on it, then I would have been able to have done a better job of it. That's not my fault. You must always <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> with everything. If I had created this, as you claim, as an "attack page" then why did nobody notice it before? Why is it that those early edits, which I had 50 people look at, weren't noticed as there being anything wrong with them? And why is it that I went to such lengths to make things as accurate as possible, and to preserve arguments for both sides, if I was trying to make it out as an attack? The reality is that before all of the anon editors came out, it WAS a neutral page. It wasn't a complete page, but it was a neutral page. The reality is that by removing the sourced POV side, they actually made it both <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> original research as well as failing to conform to the <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> neutral point of view. This is the problem here. You can't just get it in to a case of "he said she said" kind of nonsense. You have to have actual sources. This is the problem that these new editors don't seem to understand. The article WAS neutral. Now it is nothing but an advertisement and is totally biased. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:18, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The other talker pages I referenced before have been merged or deleted (or in the process of such). Therefore, my stance that all these pages should be treated equally requires me to change my vote to 'merge'. For historical purposes, those articles were:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothills_%28talker%29.html" title="Foothills (talker)">Foothills (talker)</a> - which is 1 paragraph long and claims it averages 10-15 users at a time (and is somehow "the 4th most popular in the world" at the same time? How can that be if CP at 50 isn't in the top 10?)</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort_%28talker%29.html" title="Resort (talker)">Resort (talker)</a> - 1 paragraph and claims "20-40 users online" at any time.</li>
<li>Crossroads (chat site) - not especially notable and closed 8 years ago.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/n/Lintilla_%28talker%29.html" title="Lintilla (talker)">Lintilla (talker)</a> - much longer article, but only reached "40 users at any one time". Somehow, this claims to be the most popular adult talker of all time, even though Crystal Palace is much more popular today.</li>
<li>Ncohafmuta - not especially notable for much of anything at all.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/l/a/Planes_of_Existence_%28talker%29_ec56.html" title="Planes of Existence (talker)">Planes of Existence (talker)</a> - although once very popular, for most of its existence had only a handfull of users.</li>

<li>Whoa, talk about completely misreading numbers. O_o Point taken.

<li>Comment: Okay 1) <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a> is the most popular talker right now, and is the most popular talker of all time, with a peak of over 500 users on at a time (not 50, 500), which is a confirmed fact. 2) <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lintilla_%28talker%29.html" title="Lintilla (talker)">Lintilla (talker)</a> had 40 users per talker - 7 talkers means 280 users total, and it also had a large number of spin offs, hence making the community much bigger than one which was just 50. It also had a great influence on other talkers and generally. I just thought that I'd point ou these factually inaccurate assertions that were being made there. Besides which, based on user numbers, lintilla isn't sufficiently notable to warrant its own article. Its notability is with its influence. There is a great consistency with what I did. I merged sleepy's in to lintilla in spite of sleepy's being more popular, because lintilla's claims to notoriety are larger. However, as I said elsewhere, I am more than happy to merge the lot in to one article. Just as long as issues of historical importance aren't wiped. Do you want me to pretend that Surfers didn't steal Foothills code, and that that action created ew-too? Want me to pretend that things like that didn't happen just because you think that it makes things seem nicer? Want me to pretend that these holes didn't exist in the codes? Want me to pretend that nobody noticed them and that the rapid decline of both talkers and user numbers didn't happen, or wasn't based on that? Perhaps you want me to edit the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> article and get rid of all of the claims about child molestation too? After all, he was found not guilty, wasn't he? Why should we list it in an encyclopaedia? The answer is very simple - because it made a difference. And because whether you think that Michael Jackson molested those kids or not, the reality is that he really was accused of it, and that it really did influence a lot of things. And, wait, do you want me to go around and say that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> wasn't believed to be responsible for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a>?

<li>Comment: Surfers does not have over 500 users <b>today</b>. By comparison, 'Crystal Palace' is just as popular, and often more so. For proof, simply visit <a href="http://list.ewtoo.org/usergraph.cgi?abbr=Surfers&amp;id=1133788619" class="external text" title="http://list.ewtoo.org/usergraph.cgi?abbr=Surfers&amp;id=1133788619" rel="nofollow">| Surfer user count</a> and <a href="http://list.ewtoo.org/usergraph.cgi?abbr=cp&amp;id=1133788830" class="external text" title="http://list.ewtoo.org/usergraph.cgi?abbr=cp&amp;id=1133788830" rel="nofollow">| Crystal Palace user count</a>. You will notice that Surfer's peak is barely over half that of Crystal Palace's peak! In fact, on December 5th, 2005, the lowest user count on Crystal Palace is just under half the peak of Surfer's! Looking at the extemely low standard deviation of Surfer's user count (4.3), one could easily suggest that a core group of 20 users connect and remain online throughout the day. By comparison, Crystal Palace's standard deviation of user count (12.4, three times that of Surfer's!) is evident to the fact that users come and go throughout the day and are typically engaged in active conversation. 68.83.85.175 13:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge ALL</b> of these petty talker entries. There's no denying that Crystal Palace is one of the more popular talkers out there (it seems to be the most popular today compared to the other telnet-based talkers 'Zordrac' has written about based on user count statistics gleaned from neutral third parties). Crystal Palace has made an impact on the talker community -- debatable if it's good or bad -- and warrants at least mentioning. If it is to be deleted, it should at least be highlighted somewhere as one of the most popular talkers. Obviously, the more popular the talker, the more vulnerable it is to intertalker politics, baseless allegations, and etc., as is witnissed even here with this talker being absurdly recommended for deletion while many other far less popular talkers have gotten relatively little attention from the community.216.158.57.50 14:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I think that what people fail to recognise here is that a merge means that we are either biased in favour of CP, purely because they advertised people to come here and vote, which isn't the way that Wikipedia's voting process is supposed to work. This is supposed to be votes by neutral people who are not involved in it. The term "meat puppets" is used for this strategy, and ordinarily admins ignore votes made in this manner.</p>
<p>One big reason why not to merge is because CP is equally notable to an awful lot of places. I don't know every talker, but my understanding is that its in the order of 100 which are roughly equally as notable. Why pick one ahead of any other? I could just pluck Ancient Realms out for an example (one that I don't think deserves its own article). Ancient Realms was about from 1992 to 1996, started on ew-too but converted to nuts, and was seen as an ambassador to talkers. It was one of the first talker hosts, predating talker.com by 4 years, but it didn't charge anyone to use its space. It was run on an education server, and worked to educate students, using talkers as a medium. It influenced most of the big talkers that came out afterwards, including Oceanhome, Crossroads and Ncohafmuta. But it was never popular, never having more than 30 or 40 users on at a time. And it closed after just 4 years. The server stayed open until 1998 but without the talker on there (just other people's talkers). In a very technical sense, it was the first ever multiple worlds talker - in the sense that it called all of the talkers on its network "realms". It also used NUTS 3's linking code to link all of the talkers together. Ancient Realms still exists today, in a sense, although the original talker is long gone. It has a MUD, a MUSH and 3 educational talkers, catering for primary school aged kids.</p>
<p>Now that is a talker of equal notoriety to CP. Not notable enough for its own article though.</p>
<p>If we vote "keep" on this, then we have 100 talkers listed. If we vote "merge" then we have the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> page looking longer than anything ever imagined.</p>
<p>Indeed, I don't see how anyone can possibly suggest that CP is more notable than Iron Rose, the forefather of BDSM talkers.</p>
<p>Do we keep going on forever? Or do we appease people just because they happened to come here to vote, and just because they wrote on their message boards to come to wikipedia to vandalise pages and vote to keep this and delete poe. Is that how the process works? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:33, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zordrac -- To my knowledge, there have been no, none, zero, zip messages on any message board to either vandalize the pages here or vote one way or the other. There was a single message announcing the page's existence and the thoughts of CP's owner about its veracity (which did NOT include a plea to vandalize the page). There was a followup message by me specifically asking people to NOT vandalize the page. There have absolutely NO OTHER messages regarding this page whatsoever, yet you continue to make these accusations all over Wikipedia. A far more likely scenario is this: People have been getting the old announcements as they log in. Its probable that these people didn't see the original announcement until days after it was made since a lot of people don't come online every day. They go to the web address in the announcement (the link to the article's main page). At the TOP of that page, in bold letters is the mention of the AFD and a link to THIS page. It doesn't take much to see that those people are simply clicking on the provided link and voting. This does NOT, repeat NOT, mean there's any orchestrated effort to get anyone to vote one way or the other. Unless you have some actual proof (like the text of such an announcement and where it can be found), I must request that you immediately cease these bad faith accusations. I'm NOT saying that these people who came here only to vote should be given equal treatment. They, of course, should not. I'm only saying that, to my knowledge, they are not coming here because they were told to vote. -- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">Shinmawa</a> 19:39, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So you actually deny it now? There were quite a few users who admitted it in messages on Wikipedia. This is ridiculous that you deny something that is admitted. Besides which, even if what you claim is true, advertising for this AFD on the talker itself says very clearly the intention. It is an orchestrated attack, of the kind that often happens in talkers.

<p>I thought that I'd point that out so that it is *CRYSTAL CLEAR* to all voters that the article, prior to changes made by anons, was neutral. It was incomplete, and some things were not 100% factual. Whilst I appreciate the improvements with that regards, it has changed from something that was neutral to something that is a blatant advertisement. They also got rid of all claims to notoriety. Whilst the article as I wrote it did have claims to notoriety, the article as it stands now does not. That is it quite simply. Their user levels are insufficient to claim notoriety per Wikipedia standards. The controversies are sufficiently notable. If they want us to pretend that the controversies didn't happen, then that's fine, but then the article can't exist. Simple as that. There's no debate about this. No current talkers are sufficiently notable for their own article. And ridiculous notions such as CP being "the most popular talker of all time" are just stupid. Unless they had 1,000 users on at once for 4 years, they are no competition to the top 3. Its very biased POV editing with no concept of fact or reality. A lot of talkers have been written about in the media. A lot have been the subject of newspaper articles and PC Gamer magazine and the like. But CP has not. Lintilla has, Surfers has, Resort has, Foothills has. CP has not. It can't get much simpler than that really. And this whole thing has turned in to a whole "my talker is better than yours" incident which is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>The very definition of meat puppets is what has happened here. There was one initial editor, who was genuine, and he then got a bunch of others to come along to help out. Ergo, they cannot be considered to be neutral, and they should be considered to all be one voice, per the standards in meat puppets and sock puppets guidelines. Now, if neutral people honestly feel that this needs to be kept, then that is another matter entirely. When I wrote it I thought that it might not be suitably notable, and it turns out I was right. Not to mention that the guy who owns the talker doesn't even have a real web page, and doesn't want anyone to write anything about him at all (The entire point to this bunch of attacks on me and this article). Other than how this talker has affected others, which is solely in relation to the controversies, there is absolutely zero influence on anything. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 04:28, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I don't really understand that argument, either. The organization itself is certainly notable (or at least I'm not questioning it now).

(They'd also qualify if someone else had written a book, published a paper in a journal, or produced a mainstream television documentary about them. But those are far less likely.) So the question to answer is: Is that the case for any of these people? Those for whom it is, should be kept.

<dd>Yes, that was exactly my point. I have read each article in this series, and they're each non-notable. They're all basically of the form, "So and so headed this club, then this club, and went to such and such university after graduation." No mention of any "political waves".

<li>Valiant attempt. The main contributor to the page has been User:70.69.206.159 who is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12490051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12490051" rel="nofollow">Keillor himself.</a> From what I see there is nothing partcularly notable about him outside the political party thing (the books at best put me into the neutral column). Since the political party seems to be based around his views and opinions much of his bio should be in the party's article. I still feel it is best to concentrate on the party's article than this one. Also, I'd like to point you to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_Articles_to_improve_e18f.html#Articles_to_clean-up" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board/Articles to improve">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board/Articles to improve#Articles to clean-up</a> for a whole list that you can put those clean-up skills to work on. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 06:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response:</b> He appears to meet the following criterion for inclusion: "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more." While we don't know that his books have sold that many, nor do we know that they have not. The fact that he has published three books that are included in the National Library of Canada, and that he has a profile on BC Bookworld as noted above, suggests to me that he meets the criterion. The fact that the article has been subject to vandalism is not, to me, a valid criterion for deletion. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> article is vandalized frequently, too. Vandalism can be addressed through page protection if necessary. I note also that his recent edits have not been vandalism. I think, and I may be wrong, that he is starting to get what this is about. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In terms of resource use this entry is just a bit of ascii, no pictures and its not like thereâs much else with the same name.</li>
<li>Having read the wikipedia rules on entries and commented on the odd deletion myself, the only basis for removing this would be under ânotabilityâ. If 4 - 5000 people are active in this - thatâs the size of a small townâ¦</li>
<li>Inactive players are deleted periodically, therfore 9000 represents many more.</li>
<li>Many external sites use wiki as a source and will use this entry, many people who have heard of the game may wish to view it to find out more,</li>
<li>is there any way of seeing how many âhitsâ is had?</li>
<li>other evidence are the ebay auctions for items in the game and a site site devoted entirely to in game news, which i shall add to the entry.</li>
<li>in conclusion: why on earth would you want to delete this?</li>

<li>210,890 alexa ranking is not considered notable.</li>
<li>If those pages are non-notable, they should be deleted as well. Not an excuse for this to remain.</li>
<li>The amount of resources this page takes does not matter; it being non-notable does.</li>
<li>It's considered very non-notable for a forum/online game.</li>
<li>Unverifiable.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not an outlet for advertising.</li>

<li>The point was not to advertise the game but to inform and comment on a community and another one of those strange ways that humans entertain themselves.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Im not sure how alexa works but if its the 210,000th most popular site out of however many millions then ...? The co.uk site is only a portal to the .de servers. The guidelines on notability say for those outside the top 100,000 "The intermediate area is a grey area where opinions differ", and this is'nt just about a website - you cant base its notability solely on number of hits.</li>
<li>That is *my main concern*; the precedent this makes, if this is'nt notable than quite alot of other things i've seen are'nt either. That is the beauty of wiki, its not a printed encyclopaedia its a fantastic resource with where people can find out often *very* niche things. 5000 is about 15% of the population of Lichtenstein and bigger than a lot of places Iâve lived, which have entries btw.</li>
<li>Aboveâ¦ really I cant stress this more, this isnât a book itâs a ever changing organic collection of information that anyone can add too, within the context of wiki it clearly IS notable</li>
<li>in your opinion - I will research some similar cases if I find the time</li>
<li>not at all, do the maths - if there is a constant level of 9000 (verifiable) with some leaving or inactive, and therefore being deleted about once a month and those representing about 4000 players in any given month (verifiable) with the game having started about 12 months ago (verifiable) thatâs between a conservative 29,000 and an optimistic 53,000 (based on frequency of deletions)</li>
<li>Yes - well aware of that. Maybe my point was not made very clearly, check out ukremovals.co.uk, or dictionaryofeverything.com or absoluteastronomy.com, all of these sites use parts of wiki as their sources.</li>
<li>I meant the wiki entry itself - given the number of unique editors Iâd say the number of viewers is respectable.</li>
<li>I doubt you could sell your underpants on ebay for much money thoughâ¦ cheap shot. Secondly an inselkampf account just got sold for GBÂ£300.</li>
<li>In conclusion: notable enough for retention</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Taintedink has made assertions of notability that I'm not confident of my ability to judge. Revoking my vote pending further evidence and expert opinions. I will say that I don't think two articles are needed - if the verdict is to keep <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemplating_Reiko_ae1d.html" title="Contemplating Reiko">Contemplating Reiko</a>, I would think that <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reiko_Mouryou_25e1.html" title="Reiko Mouryou">Reiko Mouryou</a> should probably be merged into it per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>'s recommendation that individual articles be reserved for world-famous cultural icons. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <i>Contemplating Reiko</i> is a long-running comic often in the top fifteen if not the top ten highest ranking web comics on such sites as Buzzcomix.net, Top Webcomics, and The Webcomics List. <i>Contemplating Reiko</i> has also made an appearance in the immensely popular <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotically_Yours_dbf8.html" title="Neurotically Yours">Neurotically Yours</a> series and been published in <i>Zoinks</i> magazine and <i>Lollipop</i> magazine. Why is it then considered "Non-notable"? This Wikipedia entry has also been up since July with no complaints until recent expansion on the entry. If it seems "promotional" then a rewording of offending text seems more appropriate than deletion. -Taintedink 18:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two magazines I've never heard of and at least one comic ranking site that seems to be a haven for self promoters (specifically with Buzzcomics.net, I note that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a> doesn't even break the top 100 on their list; but then maybe there's something I missed). If you'd like me to reconsider my vote, give some sources for this notability that aren't biased or are themselves notable. âLocke Cole 19:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The publication details are verifiable: the comic has indeed appeared in both claimed magazines. <a href="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/" class="external text" title="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/" rel="nofollow">Zoinks</a> is a new 'zine devoted to printing webcomics; it's published two issues so far, and it's unclear how selective they are or what their circulation is. However, <a href="http://www.lollipop.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lollipop.com/" rel="nofollow">Lollipop</a> is a more significant concern - it's been running for over five years, and claims a circulation of 30,000, which is pretty good for a 'zine so far as I know. If I'm reading their gallery correctly, they've printed 48 cartoons by the author of Contemplating Reiko. I'm honestly not sure whether that compensates for this comic's relatively weak online presence.
<p>Taintedink, from your username it seems probable that you have direct connections with the comic. If that's the case, would you happen to be able to provide more information on its popularity? For example, traffic figures for the site that aren't distorted by Alexa's bias towards non-techie users might reveal greater popularity than is currently apparent. Review <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for the guidelines we normally follow for inclusion - though they <i>are</i> only guidelines rather than strict policies, you could tip the scales in the comic's favour by demonstrating that it has notability equivalent to anything on that page. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Notable for being published outside the web and for the Neurotically Yours cameo. I think it's safe to keep this given the current form of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that's being bandied about. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 06:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I do support the idea of putting the info on Reiko into the comic page, as this is keeping with <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s policy on trying to remain parsiminous with the number of pages devoted to a single thing. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 06:04, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'll accept that the comic may be notable for the above cited reasons, but I still don't believe it's notable enough to warrant articles for individual characters (even the lead). Besides, as the comic article is fairly short, I think expanding it with the lead characters info would prove useful. (As an example of why I don't believe the lead should have an articleâ as far as I know Gabe and Tycho of Penny Arcade don't have their own articles). âLocke Cole 07:35, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Whether on its own or merged into an article, those data holds no value. Nothing more than directory data. I will not salvage or help this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<p>This title seems quite inappropriate for a Wikipedia article. I was planning to move it, but then wondered whether the content was worth having anyway. There are three flag proposals in the article. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_concepts_for_the_South_Island_7965.html" title="Flag concepts for the South Island">Flag concepts for the South Island</a> (which the "other" refers to) includes a proposal which was seen a bit of use, but there is no indication that these flags have been used at all. So I am not sure whether to move or delete. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 12:46, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd be inclined to <b>delete</b>, myself - and I speak as the designer of one of the flags shown. The North island flag hasn't been used, the Ross Dependency flag is more of an art project (though it has appeared in Ross Dependency), and there is already a flag for Stewart Island (though it's never used) and it's not the one shown. I really don't see much point in having this page on Wikipedia. If we're going to open up pages for all "proposed but not adopted" flag designs then we'll run out of pixels. It's the flag equivalent of failing <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for having an album that's planned but never released. I also wouldn't be at all alarmed if <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_concepts_for_the_South_Island_7965.html" title="Flag concepts for the South Island">Flag concepts for the South Island</a> was deleted, since the only design on that page which has seen any use has seen pretty minimal use and is unlikely ever to be adopted.

<ul>
<li>Was your flag proposal documented anywhere by a third party? Did it hit the headlines <i>despite</i> not being adopted? Has someone who is wholly independent of you written and published a list of flag proposals in which yours was included? It's not <i>quite</i> as simple as "proposed but not adopted", any more than it is not <i>quite</i> as simple as "never having won an election". <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screaming_Lord_Sutch_89af.html" title="Screaming Lord Sutch">Screaming Lord Sutch</a> never won an election, but was widely discussed and documented, in non-trivial published works, by other people for not having done so. A failed flag proposal that was similarly widely discussed and documented belongs here for the same reason. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:23, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It seems to have been mentioned in a couple of websites that I'm not connected with. Other than that though, I don't think so. As I said, it's hardly notable. One day, maybe... I'm toying with the idea of applying for the Antarctica arts scholarship (run here in NZ, it gives artists a month on The Ice during which time they work on art related to the continent). If that happens it will make more of a splash, but until then, it doesn't deserve a Wikipedia article. Same with the South Island one - it got one small newspaper article and has been flown in a couple of parades and things like that, but that's all. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> I created this article, but it is not fancruft. Pure Sociology is an entirely new way to conduct sociology, as detailed in the article. It was very much an invention of Black's, and did not exist previously. However, it is no longer an activity of one man, but has a growing school of practitioners which has developed over the past 30 years. More importantly, and more germane to Wikipedia and AfD policy, it is a subject worthy of its own article, distinct from a merge into Black's biography, and ready for further development as others contribute. I have already extensively revised and extended the article from the short piece nominated for deletion, and am certain that continued development of it will further justify its presence in Wikipedia. Per AfD policy, "If in doubt, don't delete." <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirumel_43ed.html" title="User:Airumel">Airumel</a> 21:15, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

If you could add some references, to published books and articles and the like, that we can use to check this information, then I think it's quite likely that this article could be kept. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:31, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see no reason why this article should be deleted, particularly not now that <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirumel_43ed.html" title="User:Airumel">Airumel</a> has expanded it and added references. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>'s nomination appears to suggest s/he believes Black did not invent this approach - but even if that were the case, it would be a reason to <i>correct</i> the article, not to delete it. (And I will note in passing that such limited research as I've been able to conduct for myself, with the help of Google Book Search, has left me with the impression that the article is accurate.) â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 20:58, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Pure sociology is a noteworthy approach in sociology, regardless if one agrees with it or not. It would perhaps be better to write that Donald Black 'developed' the approach, rather than invented, since it is built on the work of otrhers as well. But by its own aspirations, the approach is indeed very different (whether it actually is that different is up for debate). <small>â<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeflem_3a52.html" title="User:Deflem">Deflem</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/f/User_talk%7EDeflem_6eab.html" title="User talk:Deflem">talk</a>&#160;â¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deflem_a7ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deflem">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li>The article describes a software package that is "as yet unavailable", and so certainly not one that has suffered from genericization of its name. The article cites no sources, as usual, and searching I can find no published works dealing with this package that aren't trivial (e.g. directory listings of things that are coming "real soon now" with no real information), or from unreliable sources (e.g. pseudonymous people describing it in discussion fora as "now mythical"), or sourced directly from its creator (e.g. screenshots that people only have the creator as a source for).

<li>Dude, you seem to be having extreme difficulty in your obtuseness in understanding the very simple fact that I was not "doing research" in the sense in which you intend. As a regular contributor to the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> article, I know about as much as I need to know about non-Trinitarianism, and I already knew beforehand pretty much what I would find when I made the Google search -- and if the Google search results had been drastically different from what I expected, then I would have first suspected a flaw in Google! The sole and exclusive reason I went to Google at all, was only to address KarmaKameleon Google-driven claims that non-Trinitarianism was a neologistic concept. Furthermore, there is a slight difference between 8 and 48,600. You certainly seem to find it very important to feel smugly condescendingly officiously superior to other people, even when there is extremely little basis in fact for such feelings. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 16:02, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't blame me, it is a guideline, and you can't argue with that. This would be my 10th edit. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmaKameleon_84b8.html" title="User:KarmaKameleon">KarmaKameleon</a> 20:40, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it were that easy there would be no AfD discussions. This is, however, the real world, and yes, we can "argue with that", and we may be arguing based on experience that you haven't had. For instance, you seem to think that "it is a guideline" means "it is an unalterable rule to which no exceptions can be considered", but more experienced Wikipedians understand that not even policy is the sort of "don't discuss, just obey" rule you seem to think it is -- and guidelines less so than policy. For another, we realize that it is very possible to misapply guidelines and policies (because hey, sometimes people have ulterior motives, and they try to pose as "only following the rules" when what they're really doing is trying to stretch the rules.) Speaking of misapplying guidelines, you quoted the part of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> that defined neologisms; did you also read the part about "Sometimes, experienced grammarians who know the meanings of prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and other -fix words might make articles about those words"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And would'nt that be nice? I disagree that in the "real world", we choose not the follow the guideline. Might as well not have them, if no ones going to follow them. There's no "misapplication" of guideline here, it's a total ignoring of it. The guideline is as plain as it can get and there's a reason why what I quoted was the first one. It needs to be applied first before the other. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmaKameleon_84b8.html" title="User:KarmaKameleon">KarmaKameleon</a> 15:37, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So basically, based on your vast experience with Wikipedia which just reached ten edits, you're <i>absolutely sure</i> that following a guideline means applying the first sentence rigidly and ignoring everything after that first sentence. (Interesting that that first sentence, which came first because it was clearly the most important one, wasn't even in the article a month and a half ago.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms&amp;diff=26865764&amp;oldid=26770143" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms&amp;diff=26865764&amp;oldid=26770143" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>) As for "Might as well not have them if no one's going to follow them", I suggest that you look at <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Wikipedia:Ignore all rules</a>; maybe then you'll start to understand that Wikipedians are not only <b>allowed to</b> but <b>expected to</b> ask the question of which situations call for application of a guideline or policy, and which situations call for the guideline or policy itself to be modified. In particular, I think this AfD has illustrated a need to clarify that adding a well-known prefix such as "non-" to a well-known root word is not enough to create a "neologism" of the sort Wikipedia is trying to avoid. I am not ordinarily a fan of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> but if you <i>actually</i> think you're acting in the spirit of Wikipedia by trying to delete the information in the article just because some page you found in the Wikipedia namespace said "avoid neologisms" (not "seek and destroy neologisms", I must observe) then you <b>really</b> need far more experience with Wikipedia before you get anywhere near AfD. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:52, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. "Ignore all rules" applies to the rule your trying to set. Maybe you should read what you write, and realize all of it applies to you too. ultimately these rules/guidelines meant to consider all sides. Also, where do you get the idea that I am "trying to delete the information in the article"? If you're confused by the title of the project, that wasn't my own. Look at my vote I'm leaving a lot of option for those who are 'truly' experienced with wikipedia, and not just the posers.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If I may jump in... Antaeus, I think your original comment in this sub-discussion here might be considered to be violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. I see no evidence whatsoever that the nomination was in any way malformed or in bad faith. My personal opinion is that its a good nomination, and in fact I boted to merge the article. It's true that the information in the article should not just be thrown away, but a merge consensus is often a good and appropriate result of an article brought to attention via AfD. I also don't see why a new editor cannot lurk for a while and begin her editing career in AfD, if that is the path she chooses, and as long as her nominations are made in good faith and are properly formed, as here.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 12:55, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that is an unwarranted accusation on your part, Herostratus. My "original comment in this sub-discussion" was that KarmaKameleon "might be better advised to spend more time participating in other Wikipedia activities to get a feel for Wikipedia before initiating AfDs." If KarmaKameleon were to double his/her edit count in the next five minutes it <i>still</i> wouldn't bring him/her up to what Wikipedia considers the standard "voting age". In what way is it biting a newbie to say "Hey, maybe you shouldn't jump right into the deep end of the pool"? As for not assuming good faith, I <i>did</i> assume good faith -- when that was still a reasonable assumption. By the time KK was saying "It's a guideline and you can't argue with that," there were two possibilities left: that KK was acting in bad faith, trying to get the information in the article deleted or marginalized in order to push POV, <i>or</i> that KK, being so new to Wikipedia, did not yet grasp that neither guidelines nor policies have that inalterable "you can't argue with that" quality he/she claimed for <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>. But when KK suddenly switched tracks, from 'there's no other correct interpretation of the guideline and the guideline is inalterable' to 'Ignore All Rules? Sure, poser, we'll start by pretending you're trying to make new rules and use that as an excuse to ignore you' it became clear that KK was not trying to argue the deletion of the article as a means to the end of obeying the rules (which would be misguided, but a mistake a newbie could make in good faith) but instead was pressing for the deletion of the article as his/her end, and was willing to switch as needed between the standards of 'we need robotic compliance to The Rules' or 'hey, I'm just trying to <b>examine all options</b> when I propose deletion' in pursuit of that goal. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sure that KK is sincere at some level, but unfortunately KK started participating in Wikipedia by immediately trying to jump to an advanced level of procedures, and by presenting a proposal which it is only too easy to interpret as motivated more by technical lawyering than a desire to improve Wikipedia. The fact that KK's non-AfD contributions are mainly misspelled semi-grammatical edits to the first-paragraphs of large "mature" articles like Christianity and Trinity (which have been quickly reverted) doesn't do anything to dispel this unfortunate impression. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 18:55, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I understand your point there, but KK doesn't have a real track record. I mean new editors need guidance. I mean, lots of editors, their first work is "DOES THIS WORK???" or whatever. There's no danger of the contents of the article being removed (a merge or move is possible), so don't let being upset of it being AfD'd be cause to forget <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the long-standing precedent to keep all verifiable settlements. We must have thousands of bot-created articles on U.S. "cities" of under 100 inhabitants, every single one containing nothing but the same identical statistics spouted straight from a census; that's a heck of a systemic bias to counter. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:37, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, if this place is real, in accordance with precedence from the U.S.A. and to counter <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. India has three times as many inhabitants as the U.S. and, assuming any kind of similar settlement pattern (which is not a given, but too much for me to research now), we should ultimately end up with about three times as many articles on places in India as we have for the U.S. But with the relatively few Indians on Wikipedia, there is a risk that hoaxes could slip thorough the cracks. We really need some authoritative gazetteer(s) for india which could be consulted for verifying information, and which should always be referenced in the articles. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:31, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Following a discussion with <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeasea_4da6.html" title="User:Peasea">User:Peasea</a>, I would like to change this article to a one line stub which just says it is a small village near <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrissur.html" title="Thrissur">Thrissur</a>. This place is very insignificant - Peasea lived quite close by and knows about it; I come from a place which is about 40 miles from there and have never heard of it. While the places referred to in the article like Chimminy dam and Kurumali river are real, the descriptions looks so suspicious that it is probably fake. Note that the article does not say anything it being near the dam, but a 'stop enroute'.</li>

<li><b>Keep if citations are given</b> for the claims for national notability. My concern is that the only reference currently given is to a site apparently run by one of the activist organisations this person is involved with. The article claims, firstly, that Engler has had articles published in the national newspaper <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Globe_and_Mail_a135.html" title="The Globe and Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>, and secondly, that his act of protest in June made national headlines. Both of these claims for notability should be easily verifiable if true, but we need precise references added to the article. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:49, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>âkeepâ Yves is a well known Montreal activist and published author. His books appears in numerous well known bookstores across Canada and a quick google search reveals his prolific journalism on numerous political subjects. Lastly, I think the work that he's doing is important and find it suspicious that at this particular time, during the federal election campaign period, as Yves faces charges for confronting and heckling Paul Martin abbout Canadian foreign policy in Haiti, his Wikipedia article is being dubbed a vanity site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knave75, the definition of a vanity article is "the article was written by the subject himself". There's <i>no</i> evidence that this is the case here, as far as I can tell, and a lot of evidence that it <i>isn't</i> â just look at the creator's contribution history: <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Baxter_22cd.html" title="Anne Baxter">Anne Baxter</a>? <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>? <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven-Symon%C3%A9_84af.html" title="Raven-SymonÃ©">Raven-SymonÃ©</a>? <a href="../../../o/z/z/Ozzy_Osbourne_4e24.html" title="Ozzy Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>? <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter_tart.html" title="Butter tart">Butter tart</a>? Do edits like that <i>seriously</i> imply "this user is Yves Engler" to you? Because I gotta say...they sure as hell don't say that to me.

<li>Even if you *did* say "thin ups", doesn't mean the expression was in common use. Providing a number of links of its usage would back up your case more strongly.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think this show has made enough cultural impact -- and not in just the esoteric world of <i>Seinfeld</i> fans -- to warrant a second look. Though the list could be cleaned up a bit.</li>
<li>Keep it* , this show has changed the face of comedy and sitcoms. The words they came up with were an important factor. Where else would someone find an article like this. Lastly, does it really affect anyone with it being there. Does it change someones view of life because it is there? No. If you dont like it, dont look at it.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is fancruft. Really, how many times have ANY of you heard any of these phrases used in everyday conversation? I've certainly not heard a single one.

<p>Anon puts false info in article. Seigenthaler complains, false info removed. A lot of people write a lot of articles about this which all say pretty much the same things. Is this really the stuff of an encyclopedia article? Let's avoid intense self-referential navel gazing, please. This deserves nothing more than a paragraph in the Seigenthaler article. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:05, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This should be kept. It is an event in history that occured and as such has every right to be documented, controversial or not.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps this will be no more than a tempest in a teapot; right now, it's a big tempest--which makes it notable. It certainly is verifiable. And it's one more item in the ongoing debate concerning anonymous Internet publishing (Wikipedia, blogs, etc). Had Seigenthaler not gone public (making the incident notable), then yes--I would argue against such an article. But the fact that it has erupted into a somewhat major public controversy makes the topic noteworthy. My main concern about the article is that it's too self-referential or too "meta"--but Wikipedia can write about Wikipedia, and this is one of those instances. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 20:09, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> since this incident appears likely to have lasting implications for Wikipedia (including, hopefully, the elimination of anon vandals).

<li>Is it appropriate to move an article while an AFD is pending? (Especially since one of the possible results of an AFD is moving the article!) Such a move has been proposed in the above discussion; it seems to me that it's highly inappropriate for it to be moved before the AFD process completes.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy delete</b>. The article comprised three things, simply copied and pasted into the article: A press release issued by <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_9905.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, a copyrighted article published (and not licensed under the GFDL) by Enchanted Learning, and a Yahoo! mail message. At the bottom of the article it handily provided the URLs of all three. The press release is unacceptable content here <i>anyway</i>, but I speedily deleted the article for the inarguable copyright violation. The author's edit history comment when creating the article, which was "Drafting Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani for President in 2008", lead me to believe that this was not an attempt to create a neutral point of view encyclopaedia article.

<li>You have nothing to apologize for. I still don't understand the nominator's rationale.

<li>To answer <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> below and expand on my reasoning, ITED isn't worth an encyclopedia article because it's a standardized test used in <i>some</i> high schools in Iowa. There are a ton of standardized tests used in schools accross the world, and only the major ones (SAT, ACT, etc.) are likely to warrant an entry.

<ul>
<li>There was little information on the page at the time of nomination, but that wasn't necessarily <i>always</i> going to be the case.

<li>These really are used a lot of places - this is one of the most commonly used standardized test families in the United States.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Apparently the tests are used across the nation, not just in Iowa. I went to school in Texas and I remember having to take "Iowa tests."

<dd><small>6 of those votes (since you're counting anonymous votes) state reasons that have nothing to do with the notability of the subject as such ("it has only caused trouble", "it's harmful to the Icelandic Wikipedia", "it will undermine the image of the site", "it's indecent").

<dd><small>Is the fact that it was prematurely started reason enough to abandon the whole idea of getting third party input on the matter? Might it not be advisable to refactor the page and try again? One might conclude that your refusal for a vote on meta is due to the wider community being in favor of keeping the article. â<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason">Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason</a> 15:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Several users, including Biekko agreed that a <i>binding vote</i> should take place on meta to decide the future of the article, without any mention of a local vote being held first. Biekko later made a post that began the current vote where he stated (yet again, this time direcly and not by a vote) that a binding vote should be held on the Icelandic Wikipedia <i>first</i> and and only in the case of the result of that vote not being <i>clear</i> would a vote on meta be held. The terms of the vote <a href="http://is.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spjall%3AStef%C3%A1n_H._%C3%93feigsson&amp;diff=70475&amp;oldid=70463" class="external autonumber" title="http://is.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spjall%3AStef%C3%A1n_H._%C3%93feigsson&amp;diff=70475&amp;oldid=70463" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> were later modified by another user to state that whatever the majority decided to do with the article (options being <i>keep</i> and <i>delete</i>) would be the outcome of the vote. So the only way I see this ending in a vote on meta is if the vote were to end in a tie.</small></dd>
<dd><small>I haven't voted in the Icelandic vote because I think that a vote on meta should be held as was the original <i>binding</i> agreement. I don't consider it the private matter of individual Wikipedia editions to decide whether articles on certain topics which are clearly considered notable on the biggest Wikipedia edition should be included. This is not a case of the Icelandic Wikipedia merely having such extreme standard on notability either, it doesn't, we have tens of articles on subjects much less notable than this one, this is a case of selective enforcement on one subject. Furtheremore when people are listing <i>harmful to the project</i> as their reasons for deleting something that in my opinion is something that warrants a project-wide opinion. â<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason">Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason</a> 14:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>5 people had voted in favour of the meta solution when you started the vote there, 9 people have voted in the local elections thus acknowledging it. It surprises me that you are such a huge formalist all of the sudden that you are speaking about "binding" agreements on wikipedia! on the basis of 5 votes! I did not foresee that the vote on meta could possibly continue and in any case it would be very time consuming to translate the debate so I sought to end it without outside involvement and the community agreed. You may think votes like "this is damaging the project" are worthless and I would agree with you if it was about controversial but obviously significant material but this is not it, it is my sincere believe that this is tabloid stuff with no encyclopedic value at all. With that I must say that I do understand and respect your point of view, I simply disagree. This is nothing personal, you have made the Icelandic Wikipedia into what it is and I hope you will keep up the good work, I will continue to support you in doing good things as I have done in the past.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../b/i/e/User%7EBiekko_f159.html" title="User:Biekko">Bjarki</a> 02:10, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>If you think it has no encyclopedic value at all why did you propose that it be deleted but stated that you'd accept the removal of the criminal case, the image and "preposterous categories" (presumably the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Category%7ERapists_0a6b.html" title="Category:Rapists">rapist</a> and/or science web categories) as a compromise? One can only assume that you do think the subject is notable but are uncomfortable with having certain information in the article. Since I think the subject itself is notable (and would be with or without the criminal case) I originally wrote an article article on it with the same goals that I have when writing any other article, to explain the topic in question from a fair and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. To write an article on this man and not include what he's arguably most notable for would would be biased an unneutral.</small></dd>
<dd><small>Regarding my future with the project (iswiki) I don't think I'll continue to contribute to it. The only reason I ever did was with the goal helping create a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free</a>, unbiased and neutral information resource. Although I do realize that I could continue to make uncontroversial edits there â which I dare say applies to all of my approximately 13,000 edits save for around two <a href="../../../d/o/z/Dozen.html" title="Dozen">dozen</a> on this topic â I belive that an encyclopedia needs articles on controversial topics as well. This article is unanimously (save for the nomination) considered notable enough to exist on the English Wikipedia and I consider it a major flaw and a severe sign of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> that the Icelandic Wikipedia doesn't consider this a subject that it can have an article on, especially considering that this is a matter local to Iceland which, all other factors being equal, should work in its favor on the Icelandic Wikipedia and against it on the English one. â<a href="../../../%C3%A6/v/a/User%7E%C3%86var_Arnfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0_Bjarmason_03c5.html" title="User:Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason">Ãvar ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason</a> 09:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>I don't think having a Master's degree and essentially no publications makes one a noteworthy scholar. Throughout the discussion I have seen numerous references to his being the only or one of the only Icelanders to hold such a degree and no supporting citation or reference of this fact, so I think basing decisions on that fact is questionable. From what I have been able to find, he was a minor functionary in a government-sponsored technological and economic development agency who was working on proposals for cooperation with the ESA.</dd>
<dd>If the guy's notability derives from his work, as many claim above, can someone find something published about him prior to the rape scandal? So far, we just have (1) that he was recorded in the census and (2) a line-item in a government report that confirms he got a grant for his project.</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. There's nothing notable about his career or crime, at least the article and sources don't claim that he is. The smallness of a country doesn't make its citizens individually more notable - his B.Sc. degree is not notable by itself, even if it is in rocket science. The only other thing that could make him notable is the rape case. Since we are not in the business of listing everyone in the world who whas been sentenced for a crime, that doesn't make him notable either, even if it appeared on "front pages of Icelandic newspapers". Slovenia is nearly 10 times as big as Iceland is, and I have written for and appeared in newspapers and on national TV. My name was even used once in a crossword in Delo, our national newspaper. That alone doesn't make me notable. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 16:23, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Regarding the current proposal being discussed on the talk pages at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. A <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> vote is being touted as a <b>compromise</b> that might get us out of school AFD hell. Presently people create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, <b>it is preferable, and takes much less energy, to merge</b> the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district, either a local education authority or other school system. This should be done while taking care <b>not to delete</b> the information contained in the article.</p>
<p>How would this compromise work? One solution is to tag new school articles that are considered candidates for merging with a template such as the following, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">template:schoolzone</a>, to warn those unfamiliar with the process from tagging it for AFD. This will also serve as a holding category and bring to attention schools that need to be merged or expanded.</p>
<p>Merging is appropriate if the school article is both below three sentences and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.</p>
<p>We now have an good chance to test this proposal since <a href="../../../b/p/2/User%7EBp28_2858.html" title="User:Bp28">User:Bp28</a> has just created the school district page <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Public_Schools_132d.html" title="Lincoln Public Schools">Lincoln Public Schools</a> including new pages for all the middle schools and high schools in the district. Already four of the middle schools have been tagged for deletion by <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">User:Luigi30</a>. Do we really have the energy for 11 middle school AFD's? I have tagged the remaining schools with the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">schoolzone template</a> in the hope it will prevent the others reaching AFD.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the current state or all the schools involved in this discussion.</p>

</ul>
<p>Lets see how these grow over the next week and then discuss which ones if any are merge candidates after that period of time. This will be a useful exercise for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help convince those who wish to delete such articles that given a chance they will grow if less time is spent arguing in AFD.</li>
<li>It will help determine what form a merge candidate will take.</li>
<li>It will also help us reach a consensus of the type of school article that is worthy of being kept without merging.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Comment</b> Regarding the current proposal being discussed on the talk pages at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. A <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> vote is being touted as a <b>compromise</b> that might get us out of school AFD hell. Presently people create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, <b>it is preferable, and takes much less energy, to merge</b> the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district, either a local education authority or other school system. This should be done while taking care <b>not to delete</b> the information contained in the article.</p>
<p>How would this compromise work? One solution is to tag new school articles that are considered candidates for merging with a template such as the following, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">template:schoolzone</a>, to warn those unfamiliar with the process from tagging it for AFD. This will also serve as a holding category and bring to attention schools that need to be merged or expanded.</p>
<p>Merging is appropriate if the school article is both below three sentences and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.</p>
<p>We now have an good chance to test this proposal since <a href="../../../b/p/2/User%7EBp28_2858.html" title="User:Bp28">User:Bp28</a> has just created the school district page <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Public_Schools_132d.html" title="Lincoln Public Schools">Lincoln Public Schools</a> including new pages for all the middle schools and high schools in the district. Already four of the middle schools have been tagged for deletion by <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">User:Luigi30</a>. Do we really have the energy for 11 middle school AFD's? I have tagged the remaining schools with the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">schoolzone template</a> in the hope it will prevent the others reaching AFD.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the current state or all the schools involved in this discussion.</p>

<p>Lets see how these grow over the next week and then discuss which ones if any are merge candidates after that period of time. This will be a useful exercise for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help convince those who wish to delete such articles that given a chance they will grow if less time is spent arguing in AFD.</li>
<li>It will help determine what form a merge candidate will take.</li>
<li>It will also help us reach a consensus of the type of school article that is worthy of being kept without merging.</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Regarding the current proposal being discussed on the talk pages at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. A <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> vote is being touted as a <b>compromise</b> that might get us out of school AFD hell. Presently people create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, <b>it is preferable, and takes much less energy, to merge</b> the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district, either a local education authority or other school system. This should be done while taking care <b>not to delete</b> the information contained in the article.</p>
<p>How would this compromise work? One solution is to tag new school articles that are considered candidates for merging with a template such as the following, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">template:schoolzone</a>, to warn those unfamiliar with the process from tagging it for AFD. This will also serve as a holding category and bring to attention schools that need to be merged or expanded.</p>
<p>Merging is appropriate if the school article is both below three sentences and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.</p>
<p>We now have an good chance to test this proposal since <a href="../../../b/p/2/User%7EBp28_2858.html" title="User:Bp28">User:Bp28</a> has just created the school district page <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Public_Schools_132d.html" title="Lincoln Public Schools">Lincoln Public Schools</a> including new pages for all the middle schools and high schools in the district. Already four of the middle schools have been tagged for deletion by <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">User:Luigi30</a>. Do we really have the energy for 11 middle school AFD's? I have tagged the remaining schools with the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Template%7ESchoolzone_e317.html" title="Template:Schoolzone">schoolzone template</a> in the hope it will prevent the others reaching AFD.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the current state or all the schools involved in this discussion.</p>

</ul>
<p>Lets see how these grow over the next week and then discuss which ones if any are merge candidates after that period of time. This will be a useful exercise for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help convince those who wish to delete such articles that given a chance they will grow if less time is spent arguing in AFD.</li>
<li>It will help determine what form a merge candidate will take.</li>
<li>It will also help us reach a consensus of the type of school article that is worthy of being kept without merging.</li>
</ol>
