<li>Don't Delete it! The term mule is a brilliant one and the mulish legacy will live on in New England forever. Can you not see the picture with Andrew WK Performing the mule sign?

<li>Don't Delete It! The term "mule" is something very important here. The article is perfect! We love mules. YOU are a mule and if this article is deleted that's very un-mule of whoever is in charge. Another mule story is that the now deceased ska band The Eskapade used to post a picture of a mule on their mic stand and during guitar solos the crowd would all make the mule hand sign. To delete this article would be very sad, please leave it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.60.186.38 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.60.186.38_b8ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.60.186.38">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>The fact that there are several different usages of the term (as mentioned above) in no way invalidates the use of this entry. There is already an article about drug mules; I don't see that this article conflicts with that. To the contrary, it is most useful to have a comprehensive definition.

<p>DON'T DELETE THIS - mule is in every sense a huge part of the New England youth vernacular. When I think of my high school experience in New England I think of the Red Sox, Cape Cod, Dropkick Murphys, and MULES. Please keept his entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.133.181.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.133.181.114_dc87.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.133.181.114">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>As the original creator of this article, I feel that given the youth culture associations of the term (the hand-sign, the particular celebrities thought to be examplary) place it beyond the purview of a dictionary. Wikipedia does have an entry on the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_horns.html" title="Devil horns">devil horns</a>. Admittedly, millions of people know that sign, while only hundreds know this one. Nonetheless, it's legitimate and accurate. Obscure, but legitimate. To delete it would simply be to make the Wikipedia less complete. There are two external links here. Avery Score was not a blogger for Gamespot, he was a columnist, with over 300 articles credited to him. The Eskapade page is not a blog either; it's the homepage of an established band. I understand the counterarguments, but I respectfully disagree with them.

<ul>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>. Seeing as Wikipedia has articles on other slang, subcultures, and symbols, I do not find a reason to exclude this. People come to Wikipedia to learn more about many things. The internet and even Wikipedia itself could be construed as a subculture with just as many slang words and symbols/icons. Why would you neglect something similar just because you haven't heard of it? If people can't learn about something new what is the use of an encyclopedia anyways? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.119.142.185 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.119.142.185_f796.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.119.142.185">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>It wasn't just "made up one day." It's a term that comes from a point in history, a point in history that continues to this day.

<p>Good point. Unfortunately one fact shoots a hole ithrough your argument: a term such as this could not -possibly- be made up in school one day. Or made up in school over the course of several days. What muledom is and what it stands for is as organic as soy milk: hearty, earthy and completely un-squalid. Something so un-squalid, in fact, that it must be experienced to be believed. But you're all mules, we know this, and we have faith in you to do the right thing. In summary: Wikipedia -IS- for things formed -organically- through -life- over the course of -experience-! 05:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC) St. Alexi the camera-man.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.7.44.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.44.231_2bbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.44.231">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>delete</b> round here "mule (slang)" might be an insult implying sterility and poor ancestry, or it may mean a dugrunner... this is far more made up in school one day. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 05:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I'm not familiar with the term the fact that Andrew W.K. is in the picture doing this so-called mule sign or salute gives some credence to the term. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmortimer_a52c.html" title="User:Bmortimer">Bmortimer</a> 02:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Do Not Delete</b>I first heard the term 'mule' in the greater Boston area in the late 1990s. I'm not sure that the usage can be found in any major print publication, but if you visit any Boston-area highschool, you're bound to come across some 'mules.' The same could have been said of the term 'wicked pissah' when it first appeared, perhaps as long ago as the mid-1970s. Now the term is practically a cultural phenomenon. I believe it's in Wikipedia's best interest to keep this definition available. Thanks. ~~ C.
