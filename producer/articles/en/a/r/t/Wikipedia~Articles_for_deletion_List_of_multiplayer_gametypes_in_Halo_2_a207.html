<li><b>Comment</b> It's looking like the consensus is leaning towards keep. That being said, this is still highly unencyclopedic feels a bit thin, materialwise. I'd be willing to suggest a merge instead, if people would be behind that. Since everyone's here, would you rather merge it with the maps article per TKD, or with the main Halo 2 article?

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> AfD is not an appropriate place for merge requests. This isn't a guide and it is too long for the main article. Halo 2's popularity is largely based on the strength of its multiplayer, so this is notable. Why is it we can include plot summaries of a few hundred words and have dozens of pages for characters in popular games (hundreds in Pokemon's case), but can't include any information about gameplay? We're treating games as if they were movies with silly inconsequential interactive bits, which isn't right. This would be like if the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_card.html" title="Playing card">playing card</a> article gave the names and history of the cards, but never addressed what games you can play with them. Not all information about game play is a game guide. This isn't strategy advice nor fancruft speculation, it's merely an empirically verifiable list of the game types and explanations of what they are. There seems to be a move lately to call any video-game article cruft/game guide, which is sadly getting a lot of support. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 10:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd hardly call every video game article "cruft." I simply think that the articles I've nominated can be condensed and merged into the main articles for their games. It's really obvious in the case of List of Halo 2 changes, but this one qualifies, too. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoogie2K_5a8e.html" title="User:Doogie2K">Doogie2K</a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoogie2K_8e79.html" title="User talk:Doogie2K">(talk)</a> 16:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That wasn't so much aimed at you as certain voters who seem to just say delete on all these articles without reading eople's responses. Though it sounds like you wanted a merge, not a delete. This seems pretty lean already though. I'm not sure what you could take out and the main Halo 2 article is too long as is. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 18:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Ace of Sevens. The multiplayer is notable, in respect to game design and the game's place among its genre and other contemporary games. This is not a game guide, but an objective description of what multiplayer is in Halo 2. The balance between a summary for the main article, and a reasonable expansion of the subject in this sub-article seems fine to me. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 00:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The following is the entirety of the coverage of gametypes in the main Halo 2 article: <i>For example, the "Rumble Pit" playlist offers a variety of "every man for himself" game types, primarily Slayer or variations thereof; "Team Skirmish" offers a number of 4-on-4 team games, which are primarily objective-based games like Capture the Flag; "Big Team Battle" is similar to Team Skirmish but allows teams of up to 8 players.</i> Do you really think that's sufficient? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 10:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll throw yet another <b>Keep</b> per Ace of Sevens into the mix. I think that on AfD, for some reason, video game articles are more subject to deletion than other articles. However, I'm voting keep based on this specific article, not game articles as a whole.

<li><b>Keep</b>: It's no doubt notable (multiplayer is huge part what Halo series is known for). Merging doesn't seem to be an option since the original article is too large. As to the matter of condensing, I don't know the game but it seems simple enough to me (7 variants each with a 1 paragraph lead section). Perhaps the subvariants could be trimmed but I'd say leave that to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Halo_dfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Halo">Halo</a> people. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 09:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as stated by others above me, this is not comparable to lists of weapons or items.

<li>Where are you getting this idea of one article per game? I don't see it in the guidelines, most popular games have several articles and we certainly have nothing of the sort for books or movies.
