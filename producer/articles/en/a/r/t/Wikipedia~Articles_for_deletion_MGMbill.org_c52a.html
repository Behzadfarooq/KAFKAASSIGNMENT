Edit: Actually looking at the sources, most are either self-published, or self-released press releases.

I don't see it violating any of those three (the NPOV is arguable, but then this is an advocacy organization and its views should be stated). "Who has written the material should be irrelevant so long as these policies are closely adhered to. The imputation of conflict of interest is not by itself a good reason to remove sound material from articles."

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's hard to criticize an organization that isn't on the radar. I think most groups who oppose it simply feel that by criticizing the group they lend it credibility. That's a thought, not a fact. So no, adding a "criticisms section" doesn't resolve the soapbox issue. Removing statements about what the group is for does that. The article should be about who the group is (no mention of its leadership or members is made) and what the group has done or trying to do. It should not be a platform to discuss issues that are described in other articles. The article is more of another forum for the group to make its political points and violates <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> by attempting to couch the neutrality of the article as its actions.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is bogus. It <i>looks</i> like a well-sourced article, but all the links (with one minor exception) don't pan out. Most are to a variety of PR or self-publish sites. Another is a news service associated with Columbia University, which I assume is place for students to practice their chops; it's better than a high-school paper but not the same as a real commercial news source. The sole neutral third-party source is medicalnewstoday.com, whatever that is. That's <i>one</i> obscure source. The "comments by legislators" are essentially form letters: <i>"Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind should the Senate consider this issue in the future."</i> == <i>"yeah yeah yeah whatever"</i>. I've got to hand it to User:Mgmbill. He'll make a fine editor if he wants to be. Here, he's done an outstanding job of making what <i>looks</i> like a well-sourced Wikipedia article on a notable subject, but in fact is a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potemkin_village.html" title="Potemkin village">Potemkin village</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>: 100 Google hits. The first link back to the site. While the cause is interesting, until the group gets a bill passed somewhere, they're just a fringe lobby group. I would be willing to change my vote if other lobby groups have pages. The interesting thing about this page though is that they aren't so much talking about themselves but rather they talk about the cause they're fighting for (or against). --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter Görlitz">Walter Görlitz</a> 05:34, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I would welcome more information about the topics involved here, but this is an encyclopaedia, and this BIO of a lobby group isnt of value.
