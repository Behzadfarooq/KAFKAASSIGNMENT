<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>Deleting with prejudice</b>. I am dismayed at the sockpuppetry occuring here, and I must express my thanks to those of you who watched out for it and pointed it out when necessary.

<p>Although I am unfamiliar with the details of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus dispute</a>, this article seems to be a POV attack designed to further the views of <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">User:Argyrosargyrou</a>, It is in a similar vein as Hellenic Holocaust and Hellenic Genocide, all created by this user and subsequently deleted.

<p>Most of the above votes for deletion are personal abuse and should be disconunted. I doubt that any of these voters have actually read the page in question. No one has pointed out anything that might factually inaccurate in the article let alone proven it to be nor have they even attempted to discus its contents, so I take that no one actually objects to the subject mater of the page at all. Obvious campaigning has taken place for votes for deletion as noted by other people, and these votes were cast because of unfounded slanders against its contributor. The discussion below which is all directed against the same person proves that. The above votes should be discounted and the entire RfD should be thrown out. If so-called sockpuppets are not allowed then neither are people ganging up against someone else, they are sockpuppets just as much.

<dd>I have never, ever used a sockpuppet on the Wikipedia. Considering I have a totally static IP, it would be isntantly detectable. However, its clear that all the Keep votes are from the one person.</dd>
<dd>Also, I have read the article. Theres some MAJOR problems with it. Its completely and utterly hopeless unsavable POV. Its a huge mainly unwikified text dump from a Public Domain source and doens't come close to meeting the MoS. Its very poorly referenced - an autobiography or two, and a lot of redlinked books. And its by an author who is likely to getting banned by RfAr, meaning that their edits will all be reverted anyway. And thats just the start of reasons why it doesn't deserve to be in the Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>I couldn't care less about what the article covers - its not a peice of history that interests me.

<dd>I've never read so much nonsense that borders on holocaust denial in my life. Why don't you tell me that the stories of the Jews who were deported from the Europeans cities the NAZI's occupied should be banned from Wikipedia because they are too controversial. Why don't you actually read the books that are linked to and vist the web pages on the issues. It was PROVEN in a Turkish court that the Turkish government was responsible for the pogroms in Istanbul when the officials responsible were put on trial. How can you claim that something is poorly reference when you have not even read the references. Is the US Congress, House Concurrent Resolution 148, September 9, 1997 also a poor reference&#160;? Have you visited <a href="http://www.hellenicgenocide.org/quotes/photos-cons-cem1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hellenicgenocide.org/quotes/photos-cons-cem1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellenicgenocide.org/quotes/photos-cons-cem1.html</a> which contains photographs of the destruction of Greek Churches and Greek owned property in Constantinople in 1955 and pictures of the Turkish mobs&#160;? Are you telling me that "The Economist" which is quoted is not a good enough source.</dd>

Its nothing more than a gang of your and ChrisO's sockpuppets ganging up against one person because he's challenged their one sided point of view and he knows about the issues that he is talking about better than them or you and that's what you and they don't like.--HeavensDoor 00:29, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I see nothing in this page that is not historically accurate, biasd or unfair and I believe that certain users are only voting to delete this page because of unfounded prejudice against the person who created it, while I know that others, from what they have said on their talk pages are colluding with each other in order to peruse a pro-Turkish agenda. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintJerome_4c09.html" title="User:SaintJerome">SaintJerome</a> 00:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even if he wasn't I was and I do not appreciate your attempt at censorship of information which I found extremely useful. I am disgusted with the way that this page was nominated for deltion based on personal prejudice and a lack of knowledge of the events.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If this resourse wants to stay an encyclopedia and not degenerate in one of the numerous opinion forums then this attempts to delete the artickles regarding the historic facts should stop(however please feel free to edit the artickle and discuss changes at the talk page). I prefer to see a vanity pages once in while (which will be abandoned any way) instead of seeing a useful artickles about historic events being constantly marked with a deletion tags only because they hurt someones pariotic feelings(or other feelings does not matter). This deletionism should stop.</li>

<p>If one checks list of users and admins here, then it will be possible to see that many wikipedians are now not engaged in writing the artickles, not even participating in editing wars, but mostly spend their days voting for page deletion(or keeping).

<dd>If you want to prevent Wikipedia from degenerating into an opinion forum, then it's these Ã¼bernationalistic rants that have to stop, not the attempts to delete them. Edits to articles by Argyrosargyrou have been attempted, but they have only led to immediate reverts by Argyrosargyrou or one of his sockpuppets, followed by seemingly incessant back-and-forth revert wars. Argyrosargyrou will not discuss his edits, and he is not willing to compromise or seek a consensus. He will only accept his way, with only the wording he chooses, and the words he chooses are not encyclopedic at all. And in those cases, I think it's better not to have an article at all, than to have an unencyclopedic, sometimes factually incorrect, one-sided POV rant by perhaps one of Wikipedia's biggest trolls. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 23:00, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
