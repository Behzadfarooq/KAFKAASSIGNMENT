<p>-The article should not be deleted. It's just as good as other mentioned comics such as Penny Arcade, Sabrina Online, and VG Cats. Not to mention that the artists are active and host a weekly radio talk show. They put time and effort in to their work, and it deserves notification. ~ Wovstah</p>

<p>-I just told you why this comic is notable. The website is given, and on the website you can see that is regularly updated. Furthermore, the Livejournal Community 'cakepieces' shows that it has a good amount of viewers. Lastly, the fact they host their own radio show which, to my knowledge neither VG Cats, Sabrina Online, or PennyArcade do, shows notability. --[[User:Vidyaranya}Vidyaranya]] 05:52 5, April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because a website is there and regularly updated doesn't mean it's notable, even if it has a radio show. How big is this following? Why is the Alexa ranking so low?

<p>-I am still new with the entire system of Wikipedia. I am not sure what is ment by the ranking. There is no definate way to say how big the following is, but judging the IRC chat, which is also held, it has a generous sized following. What does it matter, really, if its notable? A lot of entries on Wikipedia contain only one or two lines about things which are even less known than this comic. -- <i><a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">User:Vidyaranya</a></i></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The notability of a webcomic has nothing to do with how often it is updated, how hard the writers work at it, whether or not they host a self-referential webcast or whether the web page has a forum (don't they all?). It's <i>how many people read it.</i> With an Alexa rank in the 400,000s, the answer is "not damn many."

<p>You're not sorry at all, so don't say so. I don't know how to clarify it to you, and further more I damn well know its notable and if you can't see that then you must be blind.

It's just that one of the standards by which we judge whether an article is worth having in the wikipedia is whether the subject is sufficiently notable.

<p>Since you guys are so adamant about Alexa, may I ask one thing. On Wikipedia's own entry for Alexa, it says:</p>
<p>Alexa themselves admit several sources of bias - for instance, sites with relatively low traffic will not be accurately ranked, nor sites with a disproportionate amount of users who use non-IE browsers; and subdomains are included in the main domain's rank/trend figures. [2]</p>
<p>How do you know it is being accurate in this particular case? <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a> 18:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No tool is perfect. However, on average it does give a reasonable estimate for the majority of sites that have no particular reason to be visited predominantly by non-IE users.

<p>If you really want to know why there's an increase in the fandom's demands its because the community has been heavily discriminated against. Even some of the material that is in Wikipedia about the community is negative and upsets people who are true to the fandom. Quite basically, a lot of people who are part of the fandom and have been persecuted for being so are fed up with it to the point they don't tolerate resistance. I still question Alexa since there is controversy about it. If you're going to get reliable statistics, then you should use a system that covers all broswers instead of just IE. Now, I don't about you guys, but when I first came here I was lead to believe Wikipedia was for the providing of information about everything. This entire notability issue, especially with an established comic which has been nominated, as GreenReaper point out--still it seems even that was ignored. But the fact there is a policy on notability denotes a form of elitism.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not attacking anyone by saying this, but is it right to only include things that thousands of people are aware of? What matters to most people is the fact an object is out there and there is information on it...not how notable something is. The level of notability does not change the fact it still exists. The purpose of an encylopedia is to provide truthful information regardless of how well known it something is. I'm sorry I ever believed in this place's credibility. I don't intend assisting the mainstream wikipedia section any longer due to this issue. From now on I'll stick to the WikiFur and make Fandom based pages on what is important and known to the fandom.</p>
<p>I heard how Wikipedia even gave WikiFur, at one time, trouble when it first started out. I've made this decision to fully support WikiFur's prominence to the benefit of WikiFur, not Wikipedia as a whole. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a> 00:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"But is it right to only include things that thousands of people are aware of?" Pretty much, yes; that's what makes Wikipedia an encylopedia and not a blog or a bulletin board. I'm sorry you presumed Wikipedia was something other than it is, but I'm likewise sure you understand that (as with any online website, blog, project, whatever) it is far less likely that Wikipedia will change its rules and practices to accommodate your personal preferences than the reverse. I note, for instance, that WikiFur has its own set of policies and guidelines <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/WikiFur:Policies_and_guidelines" class="external autonumber" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/WikiFur:Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to which I imagine I would be expected to conform on that site. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as, unfortunately, not notable enough to keep. Wow. Vidyaranya, I was going to post on your talk page, but you indicated not to; please, understand that this is a process that ensures only truly notable and encyclopedic topics are part of Wikipedia. As much as I myself enjoy V&amp;A, read it all the time and think its creators are great, if Wiki allowed it to remain with little in the way of notability - and as much as there is a large following, there's no way to gauge it and no indication of it in referrable sources - it would open the floodgates to all kinds of crap that I've watched being deleted lately. Don't take it personally that it's being considered here. (And as a furry, I'm fine with the efforts that other furries have given to keep the related articles NPOV, for the record.)<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 01:02, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Despite the Ursa Major Award nomination, not notable enough (would have been a weak keep if I could find some evidence website received more visitors than various webcounters would indicate. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeBriggs_5c2a.html" title="User:MikeBriggs">MikeBriggs</a> 20:20, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
