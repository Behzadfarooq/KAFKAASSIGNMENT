<ul>
<li>If anything, it should <b>not</b> be renamed to "List of notable American Idol contestants." I don't remember the exact policy, but I have seen arguments that a list of anything should imply notability; thus adding "notable" would be unnecessary. If you are willing to do it, you can add the additional sentences to as many of the names as possible and we'll see how it looks. I would not remove the red links until <i>after</i> that is done in order to see how non-notable those people are. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, that's not quite true. It's possible for a list <i>as a whole</i> to be notable, but not have every single member of the list be individually notable. For example, a prolific actor might appear in hundreds of television shows and films, not all of which are notable enough for their own article. But the "list of works" for that notable actor would probably be notable <i>as a whole</i> and worth including in some form in his article. Likewise, not everyone on the cast of a notable film is always notable, but the cast list as a whole for a notable film would probably be worth including. So basically the premise that every entry in a notable list must be notable isn't correct. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I started by creating a mirror article as a subpage to my userspace which wasn't looking too bad: <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_List_of_notable_American_Idol_contestants_4e60.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/List of notable American Idol contestants">User:PageantUpdater/List of notable American Idol contestants</a> (although I do get what you're saying about the title). Anyway this was all well and good but then i started clicking on some of the blue links to see what the people were notable for and I found that many of them are simply redirects! So I'm taking a breather until I decide whether it's worth checking the rest. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 04:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's another consideration: Could each season of American Idol handle the names of notable contestants in their respective season? In other words, if the people are mentioned in each season, would the master list be redundant? <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The redirects are intentional; they are to avoid a potential article being made when it would not be notable. If they have a subsection in the article, they should redirect. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 14:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I definitely wouldn't want a <i>category</i> like this, as this is basically a list of combined guest spots and full contestents who appeared on television competing on the show, and we don't categorize by guest spots. However, list articles go by a different, easier to meet standard compared to categories, and a list article to handle guest stars on a show is probably ok. I also do see the potential use of having a list article index of existing Wikipedia articles about Idol contestants, since the show presumably has a fair number of readers interested in looking at articles about various singers on the show. So overall I'd say no to a category, but I generally don't have a problem in principle with a list of contestents who had the opportunity to sing on the televised show. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree. Like I said above there are probably nearly a million Idol participants. Nearly all of them are in no way notable. Even the small percentage that appear on TV do not get notability by default, <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy.html" title="Jeopardy">Jeopardy</a> is notable, but there is no need to list every contestant.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am a regular contributor to the Idol articles, but frankly, this list just isn't needed. The American Idol Participants category is sufficient. And as many have mentioned, it's an impossible list to maintain. And figuring out notability is a nightmare as it is when it comes to the Idol articles. This list is just too hard to keep up with. And it's redundant to the cat. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 09:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and definitely DON'T create a "List of notable American Idol contestants" because the only sure way to become notable as an American Idol contestant is to become (at least) a finalist. If anyone is notable for another reason, they could have an article, but it doesn't make sense to have a separate list to accommodate finalists and the odd random non-finalist who also found note somewhere else. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:11, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
