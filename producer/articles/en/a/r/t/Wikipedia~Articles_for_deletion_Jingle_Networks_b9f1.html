Since this is the first wiki article I've voted on, I asked myself if there's any possible situation where this page would be a resource for me, and I don't see how (at its current state) the article can. -<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarthogDemon_a18b.html" title="User:WarthogDemon">WarthogDemon</a> 00:09, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. A LexisNexis search over the last two years brings up articles from the <i>Boston Globe</i>, Associated Press, <i>The Miami Herald</i>, <i>The New York Sun</i>, the <i>Telegraph Herald</i>, and <i>Chicago Sun Times</i>. These articles deal with either the novel business plan or the large amount of startup money from Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Hearst Corp. The most recent article was from <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.

<dd>There are some more, but they are all essentially the same. Some of those stories above were copied by multiple papers. It is important to note that these articles are only about 200-500 words each. I would personally count them as trivial, but I suppose I'm not completely sure. This company does have a novel business plan and did receive a little money from important investors, but that is their only claim to notability whatsoever. Their stock was listed as a hot buy some time ago, but there is nothing else concerning this company other than the investment and business plan. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 16:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> 200-500 words, though small, isn't "trivial" to me since the whole of the article concerns the company in question. I do have to ask whether the five articles contain substantial similarities in content; if that's the case, then it should pass. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:30, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> They are all about the large amount of investment money or the novel business idea, and yes, their content is pretty similar. The sources given below by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> did not all show up in the LexisNexis search, but the articles I presented have highly similar content.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Unfortunately, users have different standards of "notability" on Wikipedia. I personally feel that an article about a business that provides a unique service is more notable than the List of people predominantly seen wearing sunglasses. Also, there are articles in important news sources about the company. Including <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/22/ap/business/mainD8KTRGOG0.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/22/ap/business/mainD8KTRGOG0.shtml" rel="nofollow">this one</a> from an AP Business Writer shown on the CBS news site. Perhaps this passes the notability test for companies as defined on Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> 05:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's one non-trivial published work. We need more for WP:CORP to be properly satisfied. Please cite more. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:10, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that the list you mentioned is up for deletion as well, which is why talking about being "more notable" than another article is not a sound plan (which I think is a synonym for "more useful" in your case, even though notability doesn't actually talk about usefulness). The article satisfies, but we need more than one. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:24, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="http://www.free411.com/about/press" class="external text" title="http://www.free411.com/about/press" rel="nofollow">Jingle Networks press page</a> lists many articles from non-trivial news sources including the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, NY Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post. The NY Times article from March 9, 2006 is especially interesting in that it lists some competitors of Jingle Networks such as inFreeDA who operates 800-411-METRO and easy411.com who operates 1-877-Easy411. The easy411 service is not free, but does not have any advertisements. -<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> 17:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I didn't read the press articles, but it seems this company has a certain notability to me. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_3ae6.html" title="User:Lucasbfr">lucasbfr</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucasbfr_039f.html" title="User talk:Lucasbfr"><font color="darkblue">talk</font></a></sup> 21:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability criterion that relates to this article is: "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." A google search on "Jingle Networks" yields 148,000 pages. A google news search yields 164 news articles (some not necessarily unique). Virtually every major newspaper in the country has at least one article about Jingle Networks. It would be difficult to reason that these sources are not independent. The authors are different as well as the editors and media itself. I doubt that neutrality is impossible to verify in this case unless there is some mass conspiracy of journalists. I claim that it is difficult to dispute that there are multiple independent sources reporting on the company. The question then becomes, are these articles "non-trivial?" Clearly, people have differing views on what is considered trivial. I would argue that the wikipedia criteria for notability defines triviality in a particular way. One guideline is that "media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company" should be excluded from granting notability to a subject because they are trivial. Also, "Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories" should be excluded. An in-depth NY Times article does not fall under the domain of triviality according to the two exclusion clauses. Individual users may feel that Jingle Networks performs a trivial service to society or that the business is too small (and in that sense trivial) to warrant a wikipedia article; however, those notions of triviality are not in the spirit of the wikipedia notability criteria. The wikipedia notion of triviality is related to whether the published work itself is trivial in that it is a duplicate of an already existing article, an advertisement for the company, or an article published in a business directory. In that sense the article would really be trivial. The intent of the notability requirement is to prevent individuals from creating articles about their own small proprietorships or corporations. Once a company becomes important enough that it is mentioned in every major newspaper (and sometimes more than once), and the articles present different information from one another, the company has become notable enough to have a wikipedia article. I raise this issue because I believe that we should adhere to the notability and triviality criteria as defined by wikipedia rather than by using personal notions of these terms. -<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> 23:23, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (edit conflict) Multiple non-trivial independent publications about the company (see above) demonstrate notability. The article does need attention to stop reading like an ad, the lead in particular, but this isn't grounds for deletion alone. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:26, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
