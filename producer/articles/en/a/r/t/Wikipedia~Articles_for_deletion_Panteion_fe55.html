<p>The Panteios University has history of 75 years. A history creative, ascendant course that was connected not only with the course of Maximum Education and the growth of Social Sciences in Greece, but also with the more widely social transformation in our country. It deserves for this sees no one closely how it was created initially as Faculty and how it developed until today. Two persons connected their name with the arrest of idea, the foundation and the first steps of Faculty. G.Fragkoy'dis, of synjdryti's Panteios University the one was the Cypriote Gew'rgjos P. Fragkoy'dis (1869-1939), that came from historical family of Lemesoy'. It legally studied in Athens and Political Sciences in Paris. Kosmogyrjsme'nos, afterwards his return in Greece dimosjografoy'se and poljteyo'tan. In December 1923 was elected attorney Athens and Piraeus. In in the National assembly he was head of team of reformers. It published a'llwste - with the Koytoy'pi - the newspaper the "Reform". Existed friend and collaborator of El. Venjze'loy and G. Papandreou. Al. Pa'ntos, donor and synjdryti's the Panteios University second was Alexandros J. Pa'ntos (1888-1930) from wealthy family of Volos. Studied also he Legally in Athens and later Political Sciences in Paris. It coincided also the two men they watch - in different however each one season because difference of age - courses in the "Freely Faculty of Political Sciences of Pares". This Faculty, as free step of scientific knowledge and expression, practised big influence in the intellectuals. However, the streets of two men were not crossed never! They had however a common vision. This vision was the foundation in Greece of Faculty of Political Sciences, as that of Paris. The first, Fragkoy'dis, some moment made this vision work of life. The second, Pa'ntos, dying gave the economic possibility is completed the vision, after it left entire his almost fortune for the foundation in Greece of "Faculty of Political Sciences" at the system of "Free Faculty of Political Sciences of Pares". Promoting his reforming ideas, the Fragkoy'dis founded in 1924 the Company "Educational Rebirth" locating thus in the Education and in particular in the "Maximum" space of necessary reforming changes. As repeatedly djeki'rytte: "If he is true that via the education and only it is possible anadimjoyrgici' Greek patrj's, the foundation of Faculty (it later means the one that he became Panteios) dw'si the sign of national reformation via the creation of hearth of studies of national questions and step of superior reforming teaching". For the realisation of this objective, the G. Fragkoy'dis through the "Educational Rebirth" founded the Faculty of Political Sciences. It aspired constitutes this for Greece what was the "Freely Faculty of Political Sciences" that existed hearth of reformation of French Administration and world importance Institution. Justifying little later her foundation, it wrote: "With tojay'tas thoughts was founded the Faculty Political, Economic and Social Sciences, to opoj'an edj'daskon men between the most excellent Greeks and which will turn out superior Academy of moral education and regeneration". On 2 January 1927, the chairman of Democracy admiral Pavlos Koyntoyrjw'tis placed the foundation stone of central building, that is found today in the avenue Syggroy'. Two chairmen of Greek Democracy existed excel professors of Faculty: the M.Stasjno'poylos that djete'lese and first Dean of Faculty (1952-1958) and the K.Tsa'tsos. And other of course her professors were elected in academicians, while a pleiad from them they kept occasionally or keep still important leading places in the policy and generally are distinguished for their important role in the public life of country. The first building of Panteios Faculty the construction of her first building did not stand easy. The G. Fragkoy'dis in order to it finds the necessary money made repeated calls in the interior and abroad and it was forced to travel also the himself in order to it convinces the fellow countrymen of America mainly, they strengthen their work. The courses begin officially stjs 18 November 1930 with the presence of Prime Minister El. Venjze'loy. the himself aspired he is the first professor of Faculty and existed her first donor. At the same time, the death and propanto's the last will of Al. Everywhere, that died in June 1930, came it helps decisively. Wish his was with the bequest that left to be founded Faculty of Political Sciences. Charm in the persuasiveness and the enthusiasm of animator of idea G. Fragkoy'di, but also the perspicacity and the readiness of El. Venjze'loy that as Prime Minister was executant of will Everywhere, the bequest with the building of "Educational Rebirth" they incorporate in 1931 in the "Panteios Faculty of Political Sciences". Thus the initial vision of two men becomes reality. The Panteios Faculty of Political Sciences functions as NPJD and her first regulation is voted 1933. With this is created two departments: 1) The Politician, that had ten tactics and six extraordinary seats and 2) Socio-economic that it had nine tactics and five extraordinary seats. The study is forecasted three-year. The Faculty grants degree and also is forecasted also the handing-over of doctoral diploma. The wealth of courses and the distinguished professors that constituted the first instructive personnel (A'mantos, Eyelpj'dis, Kalljtsoyna'kis, Keramo'poylos, Kanello'poylos, Koyge'as, Koytoy'pis, Loy'varis, Sgoyrj'tsas, Seferja'dis, Sjde'ris, Tsa'tsos k.a.) contributed in is established fast the Faculty, in 1936, as self-existent Institution of Maximum Education, equivalent to the Universities and the other Maximum Faculties. In 1937 are nominated in Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences and function as NPDD. Her aims, as they are reported concretely, are: A) The benefit of superior political education and the national and intellectual constitution of leading executives, with conscience of mission and responsibility of these, via the prosperity and progress of in general Homeland. V) Friday of public employees, via the growth of policies, economic and social scientific knowledge. C) Of further training of public employees as well as graduates of Law, oj'tjnes it is djda'xwsj to the High schools and the Urban Schools "the Elements of Right and Policy of Economy" D) the dj' of eklaj!keytjkw'n lectures, studies, garages erey'nis and other educative means policy of population education and enlightenment on the government owned aims and objectives, the awareness of need of discipline, solidarity and collaboration of various social classes, the culture of spirit of sacrifice thanks to general good, the reinforcement of patriotic belief and the fighting of partisanship and in general atomistic and egwjstjkw'n tendencies and ideas... ". M.Stasjno'poylos, dean 1952-58 in 1939 the Faculty is renamed in Panteios Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences and Public Employees. Above in these constitutive beginnings it tried walks the Faculty, rendering intense her existence, not only in the space of Social Sciences but also the wider social space. The public debates in Panteios for subjects of more general interest constitute henceforth delivery for the Faculty, beyond the scientific congresses that are organised in this, in tactic almost base. It deserves we report here, one from the first public debates, with which Panteios was established as free step of expression of ideas, as him had envisioned her founders. It is the eminent discussions on the parliamentarism that became in her rooms in the 15,1 7,19 and 22 May 1932. In that discussions they took part distinguished parliamentary, as the G. Papandreou, minister of Education then, and other distinguished scientists, many from which they were already professors of Faculty, as the Svw'los, Sgoyrj'tsas, c. Tsa'tsos, Kanello'poylos, k.a. as well as her a lot of students. Wing M.Stasjnopoy'loy Sample from other of her social sensitivities and progressive her character existed also the establishment from beginning afternoon and evening hours of courses, so that they can him watch the workers. Also they could be written also women in the Faculty, while was forecasted by the regulation even the organisation of students in association. The students her first time of operation were 205. With the N.540/43 the Faculty recovers her old name Panteios Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences, with which it functioned up to 1989 and it acquires the right to grant doctoral diploma. With the same law in the Faculty is founded "Department of education of journalists aim having the preparation via the journalistic profession and metekpaj'deysin the already workers of journalists". The operation of Department they would be regulated with special Decree, which however was not published. From 1951 is imported the traditional Academic organisation in the Faculty. The Administrative Council is replaced by the Dean, the Senate and the General Assembly of Professors of Faculty. K.Despoto'poylos, dean 1978-79 in 1963 the study is fixed four-year and the Departments of Faculty is named: Political Science and Public Administration. Afterwards the reformation of maximum education with the application of N.1268/82 the Faculty katate'mnetaj, in 1983, in three Departments (P.D.462/83). These are: a) the Department of Political Science and International Study, v) the Department of Public Administration and c) the Department of Sociology.
