<li>There is continued discussion about Halls of Residence. A compromise that has been reached in some other places is for a single article that gives information about all Halls in a particular university. This is usefull when the main university article is getting large. The suggestion here is a merge to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_University%2C_Clayton_campus_b858.html" title="Monash University, Clayton campus">Monash University, Clayton campus</a>. This article for the main campus is very recent and will get much larger. Most information on the main campus was and still is in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_University_52c3.html" title="Monash University">Monash University</a>. Articles for some of the other smaller campuses at Monash are larger than the one for the main campus. My proposal is to <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_Residential_Services_bef8.html" title="Monash Residential Services">Monash Residential Services</a> but <b>delete</b> the articles for the individual Halls at Monash but adding <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Flats_cbc3.html" title="South East Flats">South East Flats</a> to the five listed above. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately that is not a correct assertion. The facts were contributed by someone. As such the history of the edits must be kept.

<ul>
<li>It is a correct assertion, and it's what makes Wikipedia, a secondary source, possible—copyright doesn't protect facts, or the effort of researching them. It only protects creative expression. There's accordingly no obligation to keep a record of who contributed what facts as long as you're not using their copyrighted expression. See <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a>, rejecting that copyright protects the "sweat of the brow."

<ul>
<li>Apparently you dont see the distinction between copyright and GFDL, GFDL actually cares about contributions and as such you should find a better case law precedent for your argument. BTW, it is relevant here, not on your talk page. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 10:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was just trying to keep a tangent from swamping this AFD. Anyway, I'm really not clear on what your rationale is. You seem to be suggesting that the license itself creates rights in the grantor, which is not how it works. The GFDL is a license for the use of copyrighted material. A license is a grant of permission extended by someone who has the rights to control the subject matter of the license. If something is not copyrightable, licenses are irrelevant, because your permission is not needed for someone to make use of something you do not have the right to control. You can't give more than what you have. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps they could be merged into a new article, Notable Residential Halls in Monash University or something. I'm not too fussed about the fate of those particular articles. However, if there <i>is</i> a merge, the articles almost <i>must</i> be kept. Here are the reasons we always merge and redirect instead of merging and deleting:
<ul>
<li>As Peter pointed out above, <i>the bloody GFDL</i>. We can't deliberately take someone's work and then delete any records tying them to their contribution; it's not only a copyright violation, it's immoral, too. And something like "rewording the facts to get around copyright" fixes one problem, but not the other.</li>
<li>People will expect to be able to find the articles at their current locations; if we move the information to another article, it's Common Sense to provide a redirect so everyone knows where it's gone.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, searching. If I've just stumbled across Wikipedia and I want to find out about Howitt Hall, a redirect is very useful for that purpose (since our search engine sucks).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There is no good reason for deleting the redirect. Some people on AfD (usually newbies, which is why it's disappointing to see people like Postdlf arguing otherwise) tend to want redirects deleted after merging so they can have the satisfaction of deleting <i>something</i>, and that's just <i>sad</i>. Why delete when you don't have to?</li>
<li>Surprisingly enough, it's actually more work for the closing admin to merge and delete. And as a closing admin, I put enough work into these damn things already without all y'all inventing more out of sheer devilment.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And here's why we might want to delete the redirect instead:
<ul>
<li>It has an offensive name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's the <i>only</i> reason. So ... why are we merging and deleting, again? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
