<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, you have no right to publish original material here and you author your work under the assumption (you aknowledge it by simply posting here whether you've read about it or not) that your work can and will be criticized at anytime. Criticism of your work is not defammatory, nor is it libel in even the <i>weakest</i> sense. I suggest you grow a thicker shell and stop what appears to be advertisement of your website.

<dd>We get a lot of copy and paste copy vio around here. Unless you stated on the discussion page, how would we know? I'm no expert, but I think the Foundation would need some real assurance that it is your own work before accepting anything already existing elsewhere. Considering the real danger we could face for distributing copyrighted work, I think our concern is understandable. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 03:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We regrettably take copyright violations extremely seriously here, and as such, we tend to be a bit paranoid (but not too paranoid). Stating that one has <i>suspicion</i> about copyright status of the article is perfectly okay, as that may encourage people to verify the copyright status; stating it's <i>definitely</i> a copyvio without a shred of proof is another matter altogether. Since you state, for emphasis, that you are indeed the copyright holder, we're more than happy to believe you unless damning evidence to contrary materialises. However, we still need to determine whether this material is suitable for Wikipedia. In particular, you're incorrect in presumption that "anyone offering an article on this subject must needs be from the wedding industry" - expertise on the field is very valuable in compiling the article, but we primarily need <i>encyclopedic research</i>, which means aggregation of facts from <i>sources</i>. (See <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.) Expertise just helps a bit in explaining how facts correlate. As for this article, it really needs sources. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete if you will</b> Author pjbruce. I really don't mind what you do. This is not a newspaper and i do understand that and am glad for it. I do not agree this is advertisement, if you actually read my response i told you to take out the link to our free service it's not a problem and that is the only thing which could possibly turn it into an ad, the other link are sources and nothing to do with me. But the libel issue still stands User:SliceNYC stated plainly that he felt this was copywright violation and it isn't. He didn't even check with me nor did any of you about the genuine nature of the material, yet you public feel free to make your statements. I think wikipedia should be very careful if their going down this road. Personally i will get in touch with the chairman (if there is one) of wikipedia, there really ought to be some guidlines and or training about the way you deal with public domains and material. User:SliceNYC's statement was libelous because it was written in his official capacity and published which as a supposed authority makes it defamatory especially when my user name was attached to it and a business reference. Really guy's this is completely unacceptable. I think the least you can do is publish a public apology on the front page of wikipedia to stand for one month and perhaps next time you will consult authors first.

<p><b>Media Law Resources</b> In order for the person about whom a statement is made to recover for libel, the false statement must be defamatory, meaning that it actually harms the reputation of the other person, as opposed to being merely insulting or offensive.</p>
<p>The statement(s) alleged to be defamatory must also have been published to at least one other person (other than the subject of the statement) and must be "of and concerning" the plaintiff. That is, those hearing or reading the statement must identify it specifically with the plaintiff.Pjbruce 14:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The alleged statement meets none of that criteria. It did not hurt your reputation in the least and was a critique of how and what you wrote. Peddle your scare tactics elsewhere, some actually understand the nature and the spirit of the law. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 15:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>You guys are unbelievable</b> I can't believe what I'm reading here. You know I'm not bothered in the slightest about the article (i've got too much else on) what concerns me is the lack of professionalism many of you editors demonstrate and is also what I am currently taking up with the foundation. The fact is people shouldn't be publishing comments that voice suspicions of copywright violation, that is libel under the terms of the law and why risk it? Nobody has threatened legal action, I'm trying to get you to see sloppy dealings with the public like this will only alienate you from the people you mean to serve. If you look at the editorial comments above many of them contain cheap shots and patronizing comments meant to enflame and ridicule. This is attrocius. Not one person has been able to deal with a valid complaint which was simply that instead of publishing incorrect and unjustified suspicions about a professional person, a private message or email would have been much better. I will certainly not contribute to wikipedia again and for one reason only you have alienated me by by your parochial attitude that demonstrates more a sense of a private club than a public service. I regret you've lost sight of the vision gentlemen.CC wikipedia foundationPjbruce 13:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> You seem to think people citicizing your work is a bad thing. If you can't take criticism, I suggest you leave or simply not edit. It is completely acceptable for someone to nominate your article for deletion and criticize it until nothing remains. That is completely <b>legal</b> and accepted practice on Wikipedia. You sir, are the <i>only</i> person who lacks professionalism here. You couldn't hack your article being thrown out, you couldn't take the criticism, so you throw a fit and start <i>inventing charges</i> against someone who criticized you. That's seems like a pretty cowardly and pathetic action to me. If you actually have a problem with anything said in this article, I suggest you find a rule against it on Wikipedia and take it up with an administrator instead of making vauge accusations about libel (which you have no understanding of). If you find it strange that no one has dealt with a valid complaint of yours, that because you don't have a valid complaint. The libel "complaint" had my friend and I laughing for a good 5 minutes solid. If you can't defend what you wrote, that's fine, we'll delete it for you. Don't compensate for your inability to defend yourself by alluding to imaginary legal wrongs, simply admit your fault and move on. If your pride can't take that hit, then I don't suggest your put it on the line.

<p><b>Dear Mr Shazbot</b> You still don't see, the complaint is about behaviour like yours which is rude and offensive and nothing constructive. I really don't understand why you keep going on about the article, the article has never been the issue. I have indeed forwarded the complaint to the wikipedia foundation along with a copy of this dialogue, I really am apalled that you treat members of the public this way. I think if this were public knowlegde you would loose a lot of support. It's a real shame. Pjbruce 19:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
