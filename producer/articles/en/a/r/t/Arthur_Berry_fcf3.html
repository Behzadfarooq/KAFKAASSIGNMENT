Despite a rebellious start there, he came under the care of renowned Pottery designer and superintendent of Art at Burslem, Gordon Mitchell Forsyth, (1879-1952)<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and later gained a place at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Art_9626.html" title="Royal College of Art">Royal College of Art</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. After his education he returned to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burslem.html" title="Burslem">Burslem</a> to teach at the School of Art, and his individual creative work became deeply rooted in the culture, people and landscape of the industrial pottery town of Burslem. More latterly he lived with his second wife, Cynthia, in <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolstanton.html" title="Wolstanton">Wolstanton</a>, a district to the north of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-under-Lyme_41c2.html" title="Newcastle-under-Lyme">Newcastle-under-Lyme</a>.</p>
<p>His first play was staged in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, followed by others and a remarkable autobiography, <i>Three and Sevenpence Halfpenny Man</i>. His <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> work <i>Lament For The Lost <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub.html" title="Pub">Pubs</a> Of Burslem</i> was awarded the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>/Pye Award for the best radio monologue of 1979. It starts with the immortal lines:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I sat down and wept when I remembered the lost pubs of Burslem, the demolished Star that stood where the Moonglow Ballroom stands now, on the corner of the street of the Preacher and the Tote office; it was a gaunt, dark building nicknamed the Star of Bethlehem, a grimey stuccoed star the colour of years of wet smoke. From outside it looked forbidding and empty, lit only by one or two naked electric light bulbs; its doors were difficult to find, its main door on the corner of the Square had been screwed down for some reason and on the inside covered with a piece of painted plywood. Only the side-doors would let you in and these were narrow and difficult to open. One was in Queen's Street and the other in William Clowes Street, opposite the Dolphin... for all its dreary appearance, the Star was the highest drinking temple in the town; nothing has been the same since it was knocked down. No pub has been more lamented."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>His other works include <i>Dandelions</i> (a volume of poems) and <i>The Little Gold-Mine</i> a collection of stories about Potteries life.</p>
<p>Until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> he held the post of Lecturer in Painting at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire_University_e083.html" title="Staffordshire University">North Staffordshire Polytechnic</a>. His paintings are held in numerous private and public collections, and he is known as 'the <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._S._Lowry_1ab0.html" title="L. S. Lowry">Lowry</a> of the Potteries'.</p>

A work of art created by <i>Arthur Berry</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Arthur Berry is more than just the <i>Lowry of the Potteries</i>. He was and remains a cultural icon of North Staffordshire life, still revered and loved by those who knew him or who met him just walking his dog along the canal tow-path. Even though he was in many respects an educated intellectual, yet he retained the warmth, the common touch, humour and manners of the working class people he had grown up with, and who he loved and mixed with daily. In this respect he remained truly and deeply loyal to the plebeian culture that had spawned him.</p>
<p>He was a lifelong pub aficianado, a pig breeder and an agoraphobic, deeply attached to the entrenched patterns of working class life and resentful of change and 'progress.' <i>The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery</i> admitted to me on a recent visit to the Berry archive how embarrassesd they are that they only possess half a dozen of his works. Many paintings were sold and just as many were lost. Apart from obituaries, it is also embarrrassing that the <i>Hanley Local Studies Library</i> does not possess any of his plays or radio talks. Much has been lost.</p>
<p>For example, Berry describes what a load it was off his mind when he sent several cart-loads of paintings, some large canvases, to the local tip during the 1950s and 60s. He was a complex man, tormented it would seem, by his gloomy art and yet deeply attached to the working class culture of pits, pot-banks and pubs, which he had strived to depict.</p>
<p>Many of the characters in his pictures were common working people he saw regularly in the pubs of Burslem. His <i>Lament to the Lost Pubs of Burslem</i> is an absolute gem, a literary masterpiece very much akin to Dylan Thomas's <i>Under Milk Wood</i> though narrower in scope. It vividly and amusingly depicts not only the lost pubs of Burslem, but the passing of an entire age of British working class life. It commemorates such life in the pubs of any northern or midland town, or indeed of anywhere in Britain in the 50s and 60s. That is what makes it so great. He was a keen social observer and had an almost sociological attunement to human quirks and needs and how they play out into the clannish and amusing behaviour of people. His work always warmly portrays the working people he loved so dearly. This simple affection for place and people shines brightly as a feature common to his writings and his art.</p>
<p>Berry recalls the artistic inspiration he obtained from "the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> Lamenting change, he bemoans that, "the old wooden mangle rollers were replaced by rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared..." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> He felt he had been born into a tightly cohesive society, but "the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> He loved a world that was filled with, "a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and a smell of gas...youths playing cards at the back of the old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> This was a "place of empty chapels and aborted kilns," "the window cleaner with wild eyes and a mania for gambling," <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> or indeed "an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: "at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink," <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> and when one might feel "as dry as a lime-burner's clog." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>He loved "the sunken bricks of his garden path." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: "as I stand piddling in the crazed urinal stall I can see the red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world." <sup id="_ref-dandelions_poems_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dandelions_poems" title="">[2]</a></sup> His love of North Staffordshire was deep and permanent; he indulged an incurable addiction to the place. He "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by "an invisible umbilical cord," which could never be cut." <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup> He said of his childhood "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog." <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Certainly then he was, "a thinker of the working class who developed a love of middle class pursuits." <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup> He said he had "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part," <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup> while declaring, "I am a man of habit and pattern." <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup> He "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." <sup id="_ref-thinkeroftheworkingclass_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thinkeroftheworkingclass" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea [College of Art] he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." <sup id="_ref-biddulphchronicle_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-biddulphchronicle" title="">[4]</a></sup> And indeed "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." <sup id="_ref-timesobituary_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesobituary" title="">[5]</a></sup> Yet it was during the 1950s that the, "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire for the rest of his life." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Cheeseman recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> He was "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious...[and] an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." He was "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> He was really "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> As a painter, he strained "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> He felt his paintings to be "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> This was indeed "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup> As he told Cheeseman, "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [of Smallthorne] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." <sup id="_ref-richdarkportraits_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-richdarkportraits" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The rare and wonderfully warm observations Berry made of working people are perhaps the most enduring: "old women, who sat night after night, squat as frogs, drinking, watching, eating and taking all in," <sup id="_ref-lamentforlostpubs_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamentforlostpubs" title="">[7]</a></sup> "and the publican had got a clean collar and tie on, and all the world was ship-shape--this was happiness." <sup id="_ref-lamentforlostpubs_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamentforlostpubs" title="">[7]</a></sup> "I once saw a pot-woman dance an impromptu fertility dance...the woman sitting with him had knees the size of hams, and drank a case of bottled beer as she sat there." <sup id="_ref-lamentforlostpubs_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamentforlostpubs" title="">[7]</a></sup> And "then there are the princes of drink, men high in the hierarchy of booze, popes of the tap-room...they manage to live and live with style; to smoke and drink and back horses without ever seeming to concern themselves about money...savour the full richness of the working class who can live without work...I have known such men rear big families on the dole, and strut up the street with a rose in their buttonhole." <sup id="_ref-lamentforlostpubs_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamentforlostpubs" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Then there are the "ordinary men who cannot make ends meet and are under the rule of women...lesser men, who are pestered by women and children, whooping cough and rashes of one sort or another...troubles that reduce an honest man to a worrying machine...all the bellyaching and mither and half-pint scrimping that bogs most men down...the poverty, and the poverty of just being able to make ends meet...[for it is] bosses and women and children [who] pull men down from their dignity." <sup id="_ref-lamentforlostpubs_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamentforlostpubs" title="">[7]</a></sup> Words and sentiments from what is now a bygone age.</p>

<p>In Berry's book <i>A Three and Sevenpence Halfpenny Man</i> he tells of his childhood and his daily life at Burslem art school, and of his drawing skills. He tells of going down to London and meeting great artists like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_MacBryde_76d0.html" title="Robert MacBryde">Robert MacBryde</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Colquhoun_80b0.html" title="Robert Colquhoun">Robert Colquhoun</a>, of perusing pictures in the galleries of the capital and of boozing his way through his student life there at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Art_9626.html" title="Royal College of Art">Royal College of Art</a> in Chelsea. He also tells of his life back in Stoke and his trip abroad with his wife in later years travelling on his own little <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Tour_9492.html" title="Grand Tour">Grand Tour</a> through <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. He recounts these tales with great relish and his usual eye for fine detail. It is a delightful book. His other book of short stories, <i>The Little Gold Mine</i> is written in much the same vein but depicts in novel style the people of North Staffordshire and the kind of lives they lived in the 1950s and 60s. It contains some nice pencil sketches of Potteries people and sketches in words of their characters.</p>
<p>Berry describes many people and places in his poems and stories. These include "a dirty-faced child," [Dandelions, 39] a "chinless creature with slack stockings," [39] and "a baby with a big head and a chalk-white face who didn't look as though it was for this world long." [39] All "her ever thinks about is her belly, she would eat a raw monkey if there was any chance." [41] In a long poem, he describes lots of people one might encounter in a dole office: "the wives of unemployed window cleaners, threadbare dandies, part-time tatooists, ex-bin men with double ruptures, alcoholic chefs, addleheads, pinheads, honest clerks, and loud-mouthed shitheads, with hanging trouser arses, flyboys and water-headed idiots led by their mothers, and reasonable men, genuine victims with polished shoes." [44] Also a man who helps poor people make claims: "a master of claims and benefits, a poor man's lawyer in fact," [57] helping "a poverty-stricken illiterate," [57] and "men who have put their hopes on horses - men that have lived beyond their women, and those who were always too ill-shaped to love, and so loved drink...and laughing men, who have boozed their dead wives club money, and those that sleep late and stand waiting for opening time," [58] for "drinking men often die lonely deaths, those who have forsaken women and have died in their camararderie of booze." [64] As opposed to those "dutiful husbands who have faced up to their responsibilities and not drunk every penny they could get their hands on." [64] He describes "an old man in a gate hole spits into the cobbled backs and watches a young woman with a fat behind, pinning washing out, in a pair of slacks." [65] He describes a pub regular called Bernard who "has a small stomach and has difficulty in polishing off a bag of crisps at one go," [67] Love, Berry suggests, "is also often held in silence and sometimes you don't know its been there till it's gone." [86]</p>
<p>His advice about art can be summarised thus: "in painting pictures, accidents can often be fortuitous." [55] In this comment he comes close to <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dali.html" title="Dali">Dali</a> who said "mistakes are almost always of a sacred nature. Never try to correct them," and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picasso.html" title="Picasso">Picasso</a>: "I make a lot of mistakes, but so does God."</p>
