<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Okay, this one was a toughie. Once one discounts the obviously silly bits ("Noah Feldmen lent his name!", "why should it be encyclopaedic?", and my favourite "keep if it's not a hoax, I know it's unverified"), and the anon who signed as a logged-in user but wasn't, there's not much left but arguments for deletion. Good arguments, like "it's not even on IMDb" and "there's no independent verification", the sort of arguments we like to see on AfD (as opposed to an unqualified "non-notable", which is the more common fare). So, delete. I am equipped with a talkpage if anyone wants to hurl rotten tomatoes at me later. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 16:12, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: all info has been submitted to IMDB, they take 2-4 weeks to process; film has already shown at one festival, will show at many more over next six months; the caliber of film's interviewees should demonstrate that AZ is a serious work, not a non-notable indie.

<li>So you say. When IMDB has it, we can verify it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was the 2007th person to visit the website of her magazine established in 1995. Given this, I suspect it doesn't have a big circulation.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The magazine has a very popular phrase as its title, and yet the site does not seem to be flourishing. The print version of the magazine was not found in the university libraries online that I searched. The article looks like a tear sheet or <i>CV</i> for the author, and Wikipedia is not Monster.com. I wish her luck and success, as I'm sure we all do, but she is not yet an appropriate target for an encyclopedia biography, based on the material presented here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you're partly right, the text probably came from somebody with the company, but that's meaningless. A typical promotional photo is released to the public to promote a person, yet we can only use it with fair use, and could never use it as GFDL. Releasing something for promotion doesn't mean its usable by Wikipedia (often explicit permission to use on Wikipedia, isn't even good enough). Now, if the copyright holder is a private individual, and that specific individual copyied the text, then that would not be a copyvio (as the upload would constitute licensing under GFDL). But we can't guesse if the uploader is the legal copyright holder (their employee/agent might not be authorized to donate corporate property). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:41, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Formally, this article is original research, and possibly hoax vandalism. Informally, this article is, as it stands, complete and utter tripe.

<p>Having attempted to research this subject, I've come to the conclusion that this article will just relist information found on both IAFD and IMDB.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Today's Azlea Antistia is tomorrow's 1970 <i>Penthouse</i> centerfold. Unless she has some reason for a biography other than her pornographic films or unless she is one of the few porn queens discussed in other media, we're talking about preserving a stage name, not a real name. I wish 200 porn films was a large number, but, with the video production of the porn industry now, it could represent two months of work in 15 shoots that have been recut and repackaged a number of ways.

<li><b>Conditional keep and merge</b>. Some of this article appears to be OR, some of it appears to be non-OR. There appears a problem in the conveyance of information about the history of physical biology, and physical ecology. Such a topic seems to attract those from physics who are not familiar with the basic works. Likewise it attracts those from ecology and biology who may not have a foundation in mathematical physics, and so cannot formulate proofs in the language of mathematical logic. As for the debate about the title, I'd like to draw your attention to the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_power_theorem.html" title="Maximum power theorem">maximum power theorem</a> entry because it has vertually no references at all (except for the one I put there, is it not therefore OR?), and yet seems to have been unchallenged, <b>even though</b> the use of the term 'theorem' in the title is in conflict with the definition of the word 'theorem' given in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theorem.html" title="Theorem">theorem</a> article. As I understand it, the maximum power "theorem" is defined as the "law" of thermodynamic evolution - so what is a thermodynamic law, and what is a electronic theorem? (Note also that Clausius identified the entropy "law" as a theorem).</li>

Odum referred to a concept of biological "thrust" - such as the "thrust" of a tree as it grows and raises mass up from the soil, into the air against the force of gravity, and transforms it into an apple which then could drop due to the force of gravity and hit Newton on the head. Is this "energy-transformative thrust" analysable in terms of thermodynamics, and can we expand this beyond the consideration of the life cycle of just one plant (for instance), and extend it to the succesive genearational adjustments over the 'evolution' of a species of plant? Does evolution attempt to optimize biological and ecological thrust?</li>
<li>In the context of thermodynamics there is a massive issue, and it is with the notion of "neg entropy". This concept, was discussed by Schrodinger in the context of the physical definition of "life", seems to be equivalent to the concept of "exergy", and appears to be in contradiction with the first law of the conservation of energy, I.e. exergy algorithms are, in some instances, non-conservative. Consider a pregnant woman. S.E.Jorgensen in 2000 suggested that a preganant mother living in a big isolated room with sufficient food until she gives birth to her child will increase in exergy because the growing child has more exergy than the food she consumes.</li>
<li>How do we get around this issue, or introduce it here in WIkipedia?</li>
<li>My suggestion is that we consider merging the thermodynamic evolution article with the article on <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_power.html" title="Maximum power">maximum power</a>. However this does not resolve the issue of whether maximum power might be simultaneously considered both the 4th law of thermodyanmics and the thermodynamic law of evolution.</li>
<li>My conditions are that such an article be uncompromisingly rigorous, with deletion of any original reserach - lets stick to the history of the development.</li>
<li><b>but</b> that those who object to this article commit to doing research in the area so that they can help keep the treatment rigorous, and so that they can contribute to the formal expression of these matters in terms of mathematical logic. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 10:08, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for diambig and major rewrite. Many use system boundaries in conceptual ways when discussing thermodynamics, but slamming the big bang and the biome together just aint right. "Thermodynamic evolution" should lead to a disamb because the term is ambiguous and doesn't answer the question "evolution of what?" Most of this article should be titled "thermodynamics of biological evolution" and have a major rewrite to add specificity. The last bit should be titled "thermodynamics of the evolution of the universe" and would ideally be fleshed out more completely. These topics are mentioned elsewhere, but individual articles dedicated to them would be a good place for more detailed information for the thermodynamically inclined. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 16:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are always usually different types of example of what podcasts are, I don't think they are giving the defination of podcasts, they are defining themselves. Just as there may be an insert for The Tonight Show and it's history. I think there should be a section on the different genres of podcasts and the history of the hosts. - Perhaps in the defination of podcasts it could go into the different types that are out there. and allow podcasters to post about themselves and their show. We are going to miss a great history not with just Bibb and Yazz, but with all the shows that started it all. What was the very first podcast? Who did the first couple cast? Who did the first podcast over 2 hours. If someone did want to right a paper or article on podcasts the defination is all about feeds and internet jargin. We all know podcasts are about the people. 12.226.99.247 03:33, 15 December 2005 (UTC)Kelli~ <small>(first edit by this anon user)</small></li>
<li>so it is a question of importance??? and who is the judge of that??? yaz
<ul>
<li>The world at large is. Furthermore: The best way that we here at Wikipedia can tell that the world at large has adjudged something to be notable is the fact that multiple people in the world at large, who are independent of the subject, have deemed it notable enough that they have expended the time and effort to create and to publish non-trivial works of their own about it. So if you wish to demonstrate that your podcast is notable, point to where it has been reviewed in magazines, where it has been reported in newspapers, where it has had books written about it, where it has had a third party independently write a history of it, and so forth. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:05, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I would need external references to independent sources discussing the significance of Bibb and Yaz to be convinced that this podcast is notable; if those references are added to the article, I'll reconsider my vote. To User:12.226.99.247: I agree that it would be worthwhile to research the origins of podcasting, but if you have verifiable information about that, you should discuss it at <a href="../../../p/o/d/Talk%7EPodcasting_146e.html" title="Talk:Podcasting">Talk:Podcasting</a>, not under Bibb and Yaz. At this point, I can't tell whether Bibb and Yaz is a landmark in the history of podcasting or just another podcast, but I'm leaning toward the latter unless I find out otherwise. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then don't go deleting stuff because you dislike it. I think all emo and hiphop and pop music is "not notable", but I'm not going to go deleting any page about/referring to it. Podcasting is becoming popular, and Wikipedia is going to have to start accepting podcasts into its databases.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Podcasting, like other DIY media (incl. blogs), is very difficult to assess, but number of weekly downloads <i>might</i> be some indication. However, it isn't a case of "is it popular" that, it seems to me, we need to address. There is one simple rule that will help us separate wheat and chaff: are <i>other media</i> discussing it? (And I mean other than, in this case, websites. In the case of magazines, I would ask for radio/tv or web discussion. In the case of a forum, I'd ask for magazines, radio/tv.) Are there newspapers, tv shows, magazines on paper, or radio programs discussing this podcast? If not, Wikipedia is not a secondary source of information. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:24, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: From what I have seen, the Bibb and Yaz podcast has been in existence for over a year (or close to it from what i have found). Many podcasts that I have seen in the past have no staying power as compared to this one. I see no need for public justification outside of the podcasting community if this is one of them who has been around since close to the begining.(61.26.193.182 13:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC))</li>

<p>It should be deleted because this article says nothing more than "We are a Scout troop from Detroit. We do Scout-type stuff. Cool!". There is absolutely nothing provided in the article that demonstrates the importance or significance of this troop. I will admit that your troop has significance to its members and the local community, as does mine, but we're talking a state-wide or national-wide impact outside the scouting community here.</p>
<p>Had this come in a few days later, it would have fallen under the new expansion to the <b>Criteria for Speedy Deletion</b>, section A-7, which is what I have based my reasoning above on.</p>
<p>I should also refer you to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider</a> section of the <b>What Wikipedia is NOT</b> policy. The material here would best be suited to a website, which you can set up for free with numerous providers. Wikipedia <i>is not</i> for your troop's personal homepage.</p>
<p>On the above, I believe that this article is <b>a suitable candidate for deletion</b>, and do not change the vote I provided above. If my Rover Crew suddenly received an article, I'd have it deleted, for the exact same reasons. Don't take this personally. You're probably a good troop, just not a suitable one for Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Oh how I disagree. Every scout troop is deservable of a wikipedia article. Also, the troop has a very rich tradition and history that is over 50 years old, however that information has not been organized yet, so it cannot be posted.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> = this is so notable, every signle of the 43,984 troops deserves a wikipedia article, also maybe you or your son should write an article about that troop.</li>

<p>This game is the only UFFICIAL version adopted by the international Kick Off Organization (1400 members) and is actually used on all the major international tournaments. Kick Off 2 competition version was firstly used on july 2005 with the national UK championship and then it was used on the kick off World cup this year, 12-13 november in Cologne (Germany) with 63 players from 11 nations.

<p>Both the film and the actor exist and are moderately well known outside of the commercial film-making arena. <i>Hungarian Surf Trip</i> is currently available to buy on very limited release from either the director, Desmundo Profundo, or the production company.

I met him during my time on the Eastern European theatre circuit. He was a rather abrasive character who was often drunk, but not a bad actor - although it surprises me not one bit that Hollywood has not yet 'discovered' him....

<li><b>Keep</b> - So are the Ojama Trio, Vehicloid series, &amp; Harpy Lady. The Dark Scorpion Gang were also an important part of the series do to their leader being one of the main villians.
<ul>
<li>Because characters use them rather often doesn't mean they warrant an article. Especially in the case of Harpy Lady, whose user only plays in few episodes. I can see reason to keep the God card articles, as they're important plot devices in the series, but cards like Harpy Lady only warrant few sentences in their user articles saying "(Person) often uses (Card), which is a (Type) card, that can (explanation of user's strategy or card's effect)." Maybe an iamge if you really feel the need. What those cards certainly don't deserve are articles, with potential copyvio problems, no less. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 17:01, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Truth but if a card evolves into series of cards that revolve on that one original card, it should be acceptable.
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. To me, that's tantamount to saying that people who produce offspring and a family lineage are automatically notable. Series of cards still need to be notable to warrant inclusion. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 19:20, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most of the cards mentioned are notable due to being used on the show. They are not as major like the Gods, Dragons, &amp; Demons, they still played a big part in the storyline.
<ul>
<li>Harpy Lady certainly wasn't a big enough part of the storyline if all we have for notability is that "Mai uses it!" Same goes for Toon cards, VWXYZ series, and clearly others. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 04:56, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

Is this a quotation from Sri Swami Atmananda? If so, what page of what book, article, or interview is it from? You lower the value of the entire Wikipedia project when you carelessly insert text like this. I appreciate that you understand Ajativada in a deeper way than I do, but you really need to be more careful and to read the Wikipedia guidelines if you want your contributions to be respected and retained.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. This is real; or at least, I've heard of it before.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> I appreciate Smerdis' point. Also, our own <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affect.html" title="Affect">Affect</a> article describes "blunted affect" briefly. However, the text here is not specifically about "blunted affect". In fact the title given at the top of the article text is "Affect and how to describe it." It's written from the author's very specific point of view.

<li><b>Keep.</b>The V.Rex and others are interesting aspects of a movie that creates creatures distinct from anything else. They are featured and described in a field guide to skull island, and are more than simple plot-devices. These creatures were created by artists who wanted to schulpt something new and interesting, something with real backgrounds and interesting qualities that would capture the imagination of true fans, and so far, Wikipedia has beent he pnly place to get easy access to any of this information. If deleted, many will truly miss out for the disinterest of a few. Indeed, I agree that the articles should be enhanced with more substantial background information and images.

Even a cursory examination of this article suggests "clean up" would be a massive undertaking.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no consensus that "Criticism of X" articles are automatically POV forks, as some editors here have alleged. They of course <i>can be</i>, but it is no more inherently POV to write about criticisms of a particular person, place or thing than it is to write about any other aspect of that person, place or thing. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Presenting a discussion of a subject in such a way as to only include the negative views of it is non-neutral. The NPOV policy requires that Wikipedia not present debates in ways that implicitly advocate specific sides. Articles should be neutral in scope. The fact that almost all of our "Criticism of X" articles have sported chronic neutrality disputes should be evidence enough of the fact that that isn't the case for articles that are formulated with "this article contains only negative views" scopes. Ironically, in this particular case, we <i>already have</i> proper neutral-scope articles, pre-dating this article by the larger part of a year. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Presenting a discussion of a subject in such a way as to only include the negative views of it is non-neutral." Well, then, there's no problem, because that is not in any way, shape or form inherent in an article titled "Criticism of X". It is certainly <i>possible</i> to cover the subject of "Criticism of X" one-sidedly, but then that is also possible for the subject "X" to begin with. How many times does it have to be said? If an article covers a subject from only one point of view, <i>that</i> is the problem, not the fact that the subject is "Criticism of X". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:11, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i>. Feldspar, your analysis is clearly wrong. "Criticism" does suggest only one side of the issue. Nothing about that asks for the opposite, let's just call them "glowing reviews". By having a criticisms, especially in this case, you're asking for only those things that criticise the BBC's overage. I can't even imagine how that would constitute NPOV as it totally avoids the other side. Besides, is there a single topic that doesn't have its critics? On the other hand, "BBC controversies" sort of asks for the controvery to be explained; it BEGS for both sides. In addition, most of the legal topics I could do could also have an entire article devoted to legal criticisms, but I don't think that anyone would advocate such a thing. That's not to say, of course, that there isn't room for them, but rather there's no point and needlessly POV and lopsided. <span style="color:#996">mmm</span><span style="color:#963">beer</span><sup><a href="../../../m/m/m/User_talk%7EMmmbeer_edf0.html" title="User talk:Mmmbeer">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mmmbeer_1cdb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mmmbeer">C</a> / <a href="../../../m/m/m/User%7EMmmbeer_c9c3.html" title="User:Mmmbeer">?</a></sup> 16:14, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I consider a list of postcodes to be of very dubious value on wikipedia given it is derived directly from freely available data from the Australia Post website.

<li><b>Delete</b> or at the very least reformat into a very short article with a link to the current Australia Post web site. I appreciate a lot of work has one into this but I question the value of maintaining such a list; the only current list is maintained by Australia Post. It is not a particularly static list and if someone wants authoratative information we should be pointing them in the right direction, not offering something that might not be up to date. My comments apply to all lists of postcodes in Australia. They do not imply that the current lists are not up to date, but we cannot guarantee they will be completely right in 6 months time. Took me years to cotton on that ANU had its own weird postcode (0200 not 2600) - not sure when it changed but I believe well before I dropped the habit of addressing letters to the institution under 2600.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 04:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as I have already voted delete above. <small><i>(Some of us graduated from ANU more than ten years ago&#160;:-)!)</i></small> You would be surprised how quickly these lists do get out of date and what an issue it might be to maintain them, for example to cover new suburbs. In my (real world) work, most documents of importance (or not just importance but reference), for example policies and procedures, are tagged as being not an authorised copy and that the only authorised copy is the electronic version from a specified location on our intranet. I think at the very least any and all lists of postcodes should be similarly tagged with a qualification and pointer to where the official list should be found. Due to the success of Wikipedia, googling list of postcodes means our pages will rise to the top. At the moment googling postcodes and canberra gives Wikipedia third, after the WA government and the white pages. We are followed by Aged Care and the ACTU before Australia Post comes up, and even then it is not a post code page but a page for Express Post. Obviously, one can format the search better, I am trying to think how the "punter" might approach the issue.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When one navigates to Australia Post's post code page, you can download the database. It comes with a disclaimer, firstly about copyright - and there have of course been copyright coases on telephone listings and the like but I am sure that lists of postcodes are not copyright so long as they are not generated by a cut and past. The second is the qualification about accuracy and a caveat about not relying on the list - to my mind something akin to buying a child for a toddler, marked clearly for two year olds with a warning not to be used by a child under three - if you can't rely on a list from Australia Post?!?</dd>
<dd>I have not searched the database for wrong codes, but have found missing ones (2914 for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_95fc.html" title="Harrison, Australian Capital Territory">Harrison</a>,<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonner%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_fd83.html" title="Bonner, Australian Capital Territory">Bonner</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forde%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_abcf.html" title="Forde, Australian Capital Territory">Forde</a>&#160;; according to the Harrison article, building in Harrison has commenced and thus people are quite possibly already there.) If we cannot and are not maintaing the list (and I did fix it), should we have it and similar lists? The ACT is small - I bet NSW and Vic have even more ommissions. I can't speak about overseas. In conclusion, at the very least such lists should be tagged as potentially not complete.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:06, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Everything in this article was correct. Postcodes for already existing suburbs don't change. Making sure we add new suburbs when they are created (heck, Bonner and Forde don't even exist yet, but have been recently given postcodes anyway) is something we'll have to keep an eye out for, sure. However, that is easily enough done, and even with an omission or two in these very new cases, the list is still a reliable and useful resource for at least the vast majority of cases. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 22:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - though I personally would delete all articles on postcodes, telephone area codes and road numbers as more suitable for an almanac than an encyclopaedia. But if people want to keep ZIP codes and UK postcodes then theres no reason to delete the Australian version - or the postcodes of Mongolia if someone chooses to put them up.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am swinging on this, so I will just go over my reasons in point form:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Why it is worth deleting:

<li><a href="http://www.obscuredbyspecies.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.obscuredbyspecies.com/" rel="nofollow">Their main page talks about advertising</a></li>
<li>They go on about being published, yet only have 1 edition published.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Why it is worth keeping:
<ol>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let me put it another way: renaming this article Dirk of West Frisia makes it consistent with the Count of Holland article.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Actually, notability is an important developing policy at Wikipedia for products: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>. Yes, it is not quite "policy" yet, but the ball is in your court: You need to explain why a non-notable download site should be kept, which you haven't. You haven't claimed any positive reason for keeping the article (a double negative is not sufficient). You will notice that in the developing policy notability is the critical issue for products and services: <i>Criteria for products and services: A product or service is notable</i>. If you continue reading, you will find that this site doesn't come close to meeting <i>any</i> of the criteria. Further, you haven't addressed the issue of using Wikipedia for <b>self-promotion</b>. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 16:29, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no relationship between the events of the time of Muhammad, which was not a "Jewish-Arab", but a Jewish-Muslim conflict in which both sides were Arabs by most definitions (including according to this article), and the conflict between Zionists and local Arabs in Palestine that began some 1200 years later. This article inaccurately characterises them both as "Jewish-Arab" conflict and then tries to draw an ahistorical link between them, which is original research. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 15:43, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I speak Hebrew, but not very well, so I am unable to fully comprehend the Hebrew version of the article, so I can't comment. But, think logicaly for a minute. The conflcit is between Israel and the Arab world. The only country in the world which speaks Hebrew as their national language is Israel. Wouldn't it make sense that people involved in the conflict would write with a bias? However, I personaly have a pro-Israel bias, but that's irelavent. This article isn't about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, it's about a fictional event which apparently no one here has ever heard of except for the author. Almost every keep on this discussion has been becuase they didn't know about the subject, and learned from the article. But this article is totaly wrong.

I'm not against the article title so much as this line "<i>The Jewish-Arab conflict is the name given by some people to a series of conflicts from the years 623 to 627</i>". Who are "some people". No-one except for some bloke called <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-kuntzel-s05.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-kuntzel-s05.htm" rel="nofollow">KÃ¼ntzel</a> who studies at a place funded by Vidal Sassoon (yes the hairdresser!) has even mentioned this period according to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=623+and+627+jewish-arab+conflict" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=623+and+627+jewish-arab+conflict" rel="nofollow">google</a>. Maybe there's something wrong with the translation of the title from the Hebrew version. If the article is kept, then it has to be rewritten as a an observation of the conflict over a lot longer period, without any emphasis on it being a "reincarnation". <a href="../../../j/g/r/User%7EJgritz_6f2d.html" title="User:Jgritz">Jgritz</a> 21:23, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I Have updated it and cleaned it up. I think it is ready to go. I have showed it to the democraphic it is supposed to see it and they agree with its facts and would like it to stay up.</p>
<p>I have actually gotten a member of the group to look at it and make sure it is factually correct. He has and I feel becaue he is the leader of one that it must be up now.</p>
<p>I will continue to add more info as I find it in already written readings. This is not my own research. I have read a few books written by people from the cult on this.</p>

<li>That's a tough call. We have other articles which are not much more than dictdefs for words with (minor) cultural significance.

<li>Someone removed the copyvio central listing, but the copyvio tag is still in place on the page. (I reverted the removal of the listing, but reverted my revert because I was unsure of what to do.) A person claiming to be the owner of the source website says he grants permission to Wikipedia to use the definition, but the claim in the Talk page is unsigned. <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoelledeg_d84c.html" title="User:Noelledeg">Noelle De Guzman</a> 12:08, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

We've messed up seven times by not deleting this nonsense, but eventually it will be done. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 10:05, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> much of the "keep" commentary on previous nominations seemed to be based on the assumption that, while not well-known elsewhere, the GNAA is very famous on Slashdot. However, being active on Slashdot myself and doing quite a fair amount of browsing there, I've found that this simply isn't true. In maybe 3 months of at least daily visits, I haven't seen anything there by or about the GNAA, not even in passing reference. Granted, I wasn't exactly <i>looking</i>, but still, if these guys were truly the scourge of Slashdot, you'd think they'd be mentioned with some regularity. Also notice that, while the article has a decently-sized references section, it's (almost) all forum posts, blog entries, and the like. If their activities were important, why aren't they reported on in newspapers? Why aren't they profiled in any published books? The answer, of course, is that forum trolling is only of any interest to a very, very, very small number of people (mostly the trolls themselves) and that individual trolls and groups are seldom, if ever, notable or verifiable in an encyclopedic sense. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:45, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> based on the fact that the page is used for reference by several Wikipedia administration pages on the subject of article vandalism, since a number of alleged members of this group are regular vandals.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I'm Italian. I was planning to add what regions the names are from. I was planning to add a much more extensive list of names. And I was intending to add famous people for every name possible. Kindof like an extensive list of Italian orgiginated surnames, who they belong to... etc. I do not have so much time on my hands just recently as i planned to so until I do... which will unfortunately never happen.

<dd>Maybe you could collect the information you need elsewhere, and then propose it for reference. Even then I'm not sure if such an annotated list would be considered encyclopedic by other editors.

<dd><i>Apples of Gold</i> has just four very short reviews on amazon, so it's not much of a comparison. Regardless, I couldn't find any guidelines on notability for books. You have not made a case for non-notability in the general sense.

<p><br />
I have cleaned up this page, it should no longer be nominated for speedy deletion. Finbar Madden clearly meets the criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p><br />
May i refer you to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
<p>It says one of the criteria for inclusion is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly Finbar Madden fufills this criteria. A quick search on amazon will show you he has sold considerbly more than 5000 copies of three his books on this site alone. For this reason and after cleaning up the page i strongly recommend it is not deleted. N mcdermott 04:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did a search on amazon.co.uk, couldn't find sales figures (just sales <i>rankings</i>) for any of his books. Do you have a link? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:21, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apologies i misread the sales rankings/figures, but clearly having four books published more than meets the criteria, therefore nomination for deletion removed. time for this targed campaign against johnfullerton to stop.</p>

I know we're not supposed to bite the newbies, but this cycle is getting exceedingly boring. #1 Someone posts an unsourced article with exaggerated claims of notability. #2 It's disputed on those grounds. #3 Lots of vitriol ensues. #4 After sufficient arm-twisting they finally cough up references supporting far more modest claims that turn out nevertheless to be sufficiently notable to keep the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> well written article and one which deserves to be seen. Neologism it may be, but additions like this are essential to the English language.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it does actually get several surname hits on Google, while I'm not quite sure why it must appear in Portugese - the chap is Greek after all. Neologisms appear every day on product labels in English, most of them meaningless compound words. This is at least derived from a name, and references a common experience. Perhaps we should give this little word a chance in the big wide world and see how it fairs!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it makes more sense to let the English decide what enters their language than an Argentinian and a Finn. It's quite a handy word, might start using it myself.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this is the kind of logic that would still have us communicating in grunts. "Panyet" is a valuable addition to our empoverished language, and I for one shall be lobbying the OED for its inclusion in their next edition. I just hope nobody else does so first â that would be deeply ironic!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> isn't 'Wiktionary' a neologism (see 'meaningless compound words' above; wiki-dictionary or wikiary would be tolerable). Perhaps that should go too.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is a discussion, not a vote. <i>Panyet</i> is better suited to the <i>Urban Dictionary.</i> It just isn't encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 16:08, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a fine example of the way in which English grows and develops, one of its greatest strengths. Perhaps the article could be updated to make this clear? Am I the only one who finds this sort of thing exciting?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Pinky chocolate fudge dumping" and "rusty trombone" are both to be found on Wikipedia. I'm pretty sure you'll fail to find either anywhere outside Roger's Profanisaurus - as an example of slang they're more or less unbeatable. Why on earth wouldn't "panyet" be suitable?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - why exactly can't there be an article for every crime? Is there a limit on the number of articles in Wikipedia? I also definitely would <b>not agree with merging</b> the article with that on <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molly_Bish_7d62.html" title="Molly Bish">Molly Bish</a> - they are two separate cases with only the most tenuous link between them, almost just one of those flukes of history. And even the issue of whether or not they are 'cold' cases, while supportive of retention, is really irrelevant - a crime is a crime, and ANY murder has significance for many, many people - not only those involved, but whole communities. Wikipedia is an first an encyclopedia, not an aid to crime-solving, though it may be useful in that end. I vote for keeping both articles as they are. -- <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshel99_fc9e.html" title="User:Ishel99">Ishel99</a> 23:31, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well that's nice and open-minded of you Joe, by that reasoning you should trundle off to the Christianity, Scientology and Santa Claus pages and have a go at putting them up for deletion as well.

<li><b>Fair Enough</b> so if I can gather a group of people together who can verify the existance of farditmitts, confirm their use of farditmitts on a daily basis and show their support for a wikipedia entry on the subject everything will be o.k? By the way is this actually a 'discussion' or just a virtual pitstop for power tripping, stuck-up, kill-joys? I mean does anyone actually ever come back to defend their comments once they have made them?</li>
<li><b>vanity?</b> and nonsense... Nonsense, yes, nonsense in a way is the definition of the word farditmitts. But if you want to delete something because it's definition is nonsense you'd better go and delete this one as well: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense" rel="nofollow">Nonsense</a>.

<li>In what way does NPOV necessitate that Wikipedia Watch must get its own separate article? NPOV requires that things be described fairly; you're going to have to draw the connections if you want to substantiate your claim that "Wikipedia Watch described in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a> == good and fair; Wikipedia Watch described in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> == bad and POV". Given the bad-faith "hide the content" games recently played with Wikifiddler, I must agree with FRS; <b>Protected redirect</b> to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:45, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess the problem here is that we've claimed that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> is notable. Now, within the activist community and the conspiracy theory community, he is, and has been for the past 20 or so years. However, those are seriously underground communities, and its really only through <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> that he got any interest beyond those very underground communities, where most people's names are never released to the public. Thanks to Google Watch, his name was released, he was interviewed, etc etc. Yahoo Watch was really just a tag on to Google Watch, while Scroogle was almost always mentioned alongside Google Watch as they compliment each other. So then the issue is Wikipedia Watch. It is, in a lot of ways, just a tag along for Google Watch, because he created it claiming that Wikipedia is an agent of Google, and that everyone here is a CIA agent (or at least enough CIA agents to force us all to be brainwashed in to going along with the CIA agenda). All CIA agents put up your hand so that we know who you are! Come on, anyone? But see the big issue here is this - is Wikipedia Watch just Daniel Brandt? If it is, then merge and be done with it. If not, then don't. Whilst he does go on about his personal views, its not just about him, because he mentions all sorts of other people that were affected by Wikipedia, and it has been contributed to by more people than him. Is it notable? I've counted 15 international news sources that have mentioned it. By my mind, that makes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> quite happily. Sure, most of them are in some way related to the Seigenthaler affair, but not all. So the issue is that - if we wipe this, then can we justify keeping things like <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>? We can hardly suggest that he as an individual is more notable than his pieces of work. Or do we think that <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> is more notable than <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>?

<li>Yes, I put in the redirect, but I didn't write the Chris Beasley article. I for one think that it should be Google Watch Watch with a redirect from Chris Beasley (i.e. other way around to what it is now) but hey, either way. And if Google Watch Watch has next to no media coverage, then Chris Beasley has even less. Outside of Google Watch Watch he is unheard of. Anyone who votes delete on this should put Google Watch Watch/Chris Beasley up for deletion, because there is no way in hell that that is more notable than Wikipedia Watch. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're not answering the question. You're saying that it is unacceptable to have Wikipedia Watch described at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> and have a redirect pointing to it. You seem to be claiming that for consistency, Wikipedia Watch has to have its own article, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a>, because after all, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_Watch_ffee.html" title="Google Watch Watch">Google Watch Watch</a> has its own article, doesn't it? But in point of fact, this is not the case, and you know it's not the case, so it seems that what you're trying to claim now is that Google Watch Watch is <i>automatically</i> so much less notable than Wikipedia Watch that if Wikipedia Watch doesn't get a <i>separate</i> article, Google Watch Watch shouldn't get <i>any</i> coverage -- a premise that I find extremely specious, to say the least. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:04, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What? Anyway, this web site has had major international news coverage and meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And yes, Google Watch Watch does have its own article, and has for quite some time. As stated elsewhere, Google Watch Watch is NOT a site - its an article. Yes, that article has been referenced elsewhere, but that's just it - its an article. Now, if Wikipedia Watch was only 1 article, sure, same deal. But its not. It currently has 4 articles on the site. Granted that's not a lot, but Google Watch was notable when it only had 4 articles on its site too. Wikipedia Watch is a site. Whilst it started off quite personal, it has grown beyond just his personal campaign. Anyway, please stop adding "Outing" to the Daniel Brandt article. Your reasons, that it is "proving" that he is hypocriticial is POV. You might think he is hypocritical, but that's just your opinion, and it doesn't belong there. Instead of just having "Outing" in there, you should write how some people think he is hypocritical. Not everyone does. Most activists would think that he is far from hypocritical. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 05:56, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Suppose I were to send a hoax email to the subject of a Wikipedia article, and then write up the results (haha! got him!) on the talk page and in the article. The subject of the Wikipedia article also happens to be a Wikipedian.</p>
<p>Would that be: (a) good traditional encyclopedia research, or (b) an egregious personal attack?</p>
<p>I say (b), but the Wikipedia community (including several admins) says (a).</p>
<p>Oh, and the article subject/Wikipedia user happens to be very unpopular (in fact has been blocked from Wikipedia). Does the answer depend on that? Should it?</p>

<p>Do you think that I should include "Attacks on Wikipedia Watch" as a sub section? Happy to remove that. Can also include another section "Criticisms of Wikipedia Watch" as well if you like.

<li><b>Strong Speedy Keep</b> Well-known and very famous character with many published books and a half-century of success. Google score is 300,000+. While it's true that he's essentially unknown in the US, that's due to the lack of translated material available (as opposed to, say, Tintin).

<li><b>Keep</b>! Non-notable? The guy is to be put to death, he was not even supposed to be arrested. The original "raid" lacks physical documentation. This is VERY pertinent.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it should be in the news. It's not. Please don't censor it from here as well.</li>
<li>This deserves explanation: Corey Maye is a prisoner on death row in Mississippi. Police officers entered his apartment on a search warrant. He shot and killed one officer. He had no criminal record prior to this event. The police found one joint and/or trace amounts of marijuana in the residence. There was no other associated crime. Maye claims he was sleeping when the police entered and that he fired in self-defense, unaware that the man approaching him was a police officer. His defense attorney had never handled a capital case before. Maye is black and the officer was white. He's garnered some attention in the liberal blogosphere (which isn't encyclopedic, unfortunately). Two legitimate news outlets have covered the story: a local newspaper and the local NBC television affiliate. I checked the websites for Amnesty International and the NAACP: neither site returns any results for his name. After some hard thought I'm voting <b>keep.</b> Two mainstream news sources is enough. This has encyclopedic interest as an example of the United States death penalty system. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Having an explanation was a good idea. People need to realize that a blog is not necessarily a good or credible news source. I expect most of the unsigned comments on this page came here from the blogs. There are literally millions of people in prison and many if not most assert their innocence. Being imprisoned and claiming innocence is not enough to be a notable person. As noted in the nomination, this is a stand alone article linked to nothing else, most likely created by a blogger who desired an article on this person. There seems to be some interest in the case, which is fine by me, but that is a case by case thing. Being on Death Row does not make one automatically notable. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="blue"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 21:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This looks like an unusual case. I gather that this became eligible for the death penalty because the court found that the shooting occurred in the commission of a crime. This logic normally applies to armed robberies, not misdemeanor drug possession. While I'm no legal expert this certainly piques my interest.

<li><b>Keep</b> While merely saying "he should be in the news and he's not" is not a reason to keep an article (I'm glad to see that our recent policy change has um, encouraged, more people to actually open user accounts, the new people need to realize what arguments they need to use, and not use, in deletion votes. This will be instructive). I believe this case is arousing national interest in the U.S. and will eventually be covered by the major media. I know we <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">don't consider blog posts to be serious sources</a> (a policy I think deserves more nuance) but the fact here is that an awful lot of bloggers, people who usually don't agree on much, are picking this case up and drawing attention to it. There is a website devoted to it which has nothing to do with the blog. Eventually the media we consider reliable sources will do stories. I'd rather have the article now than recreate it later. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 22:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: "<i>links to no other articles in en.wiki.</i>" Huh? Within hours of the article being added, I spent one myself slavishly going through and linking where necessary. I have since dabbed a bunch. At the time this AfD was posted, there were plenty of links to other articles. I cannot see how I can assume good faith here, given that the many links in the article were present at the time and could not have been missed.

<li>One can apply the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria for products and services to softwares. (For example: Hdimage (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hdimage_af60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hdimage">AfD discussion</a>) fails to satisfy those criteria, whereas <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grep.html" title="Grep">grep</a> succeeds.) Searching turns up announcements from the author (and simple reprints) and mentions in discussion fora by pseudonymous people, <i>but also</i> turns up people independent of its creator considering this software notable enough to have written their own, often quite lengthy, reviews of it (<a href="http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/3139" class="external text" title="http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/3139" rel="nofollow">by other amateur radio enthusiasts</a> <a href="http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/2211" class="external text" title="http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/2211" rel="nofollow">by more amateur radio enthusiasts</a> <a href="http://www.astrosurf.org/lombry/qsl-review-propagation-software.htm#DXLab" class="external text" title="http://www.astrosurf.org/lombry/qsl-review-propagation-software.htm#DXLab" rel="nofollow">by Thierry Lombry</a> <a href="http://www.eham.net/articles/5070" class="external text" title="http://www.eham.net/articles/5070" rel="nofollow">by John Butcher</a> <a href="http://stroobandt.com/equipment/equipment.html" class="external text" title="http://stroobandt.com/equipment/equipment.html" rel="nofollow">by Serge Stroobandt</a> <a href="http://www.w8byh.com/amateur_radio/product_reviews.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.w8byh.com/amateur_radio/product_reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">by W8BYH</a>) and even to have written softwares of their own to work with it (<a href="http://aobajoke.no-ip.org/~ja7ude/info/ic7000diary0511.html" class="external text" title="http://aobajoke.no-ip.org/~ja7ude/info/ic7000diary0511.html" rel="nofollow">MMD</a>). Although this is far from what an encyclopaedia article about these softwares should look like, and although an actual book would be a much stronger indicator, it appears from the sheer number of people that have done more than simply include this, and its accompanying blurb from the author, in directories of free software for download and that have actually put up their own reviews, on their web sites for other enthusiasts to read, that the WP:CORP criteria are satisfied. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:38, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy delete</b> for being one of a series of submissions that were straight copyrighted advertisements, clearly intended <i>not</i> to be released under the GFDL by the copyright owner. Consider this to be <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_Wikipedia_triage_6885.html" title="User:Uncle G/Wikipedia triage">Extreme Copyright Judo</a>, if you like.</p>
<p>In detail: Supertec (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupertec_b0ee.html" title="User talk:Supertec">talk</a> <small>â¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Supertec_e466.html" title="Special:Contributions/Supertec">contribs</a>) submitted a number of articles on products and services of Super Technologies Incorporated, which were direct copies of the company's own advertising blurb on its web site. From the account name, it is reasonable to presume that this user is, or represents, the copyright owner of the advertising blurb. In three of these articles (Superphone, SuperPBX, and IP-PABX) xe <i>explicitly</i> added the text "All rights reserved. All content is copyright Â© Super Technologies Inc." to the article <i>as a separate edit</i>. In other words, it is clear that this copyright notice was deliberately included. The author clearly did <i>not</i> want this content to be licensed under the GFDL. Two further articles that xe submitted, Virtualphoneline.com and this one, do not contain such copyright notices. But given that they are part of the same overall package of interrelated advertising blurb, with all of the articles involved submitted here one after the other over a short span of time, and that they are <i>also</i> copies of the company's advertising blurb, it is fair to presume that the author's copyright licensing intention, which is wholly incompatible with Wikipedia, applies to these, also.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">Â«<small>Talk</small>Â»</a> 21:13, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>non-notable, advertisement AaronS 21:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> At first, I just edited out the boosterism in this article that borderlined on being spam advertising.. Not only is it a stub (which isn't in and of itself enough to merit deletion, but I can't imagine what else could be said about this relatively non-notable, non-controversial student publication), but I don't think that it would be a good idea to have an article for every small student publication at every college in the world. It's just not encyclopaedic. And, unlike <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dartmouth_Review_21bd.html" title="The Dartmouth Review">The Dartmouth Review</a>, the <i>Beacon</i> has no national presence. It barely has campus presence. --AaronS 21:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Same reasons as AaronS. This a student publication formed last year and is not significant. Luckynumbernine</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I double checked because the well known <i>Dartmouth Review</i> isn't the primary student newspaper on campus. That's <i>The Dartmouth</i>, founded in 1799. <i>The Dartmouth Beacon</i> lists its first issue as October 2004: just another NN student newspaper. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:10, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While the <i>Review</i> is not the official newspaper of Dartmouth, it is significantly more well known than <i>The Dartmouth</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point of my explanation is to state that Dartmouth has two encyclopedic student newspapers. This isn't either of them. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 15:33, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> NN. Been around for two years. The article isn't even factually correct/honest, as it has been "founded" two or three times in the past. --<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.67.html" title="User:152.163.100.67">152.163.100.67</a> 21:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> A little more than 200 Google hits, many of them from a website or two existing to make fun of the paper. Just looking at the history, this page was created as a tribute gag to the current editors. TheDakPAC 23:03, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are a number of dartmouth publications. The dartmouth beacon is one of them. Of course apponents to the magazine's conservative message will object to it's presence on wikipedia, but it is a legitimate magazine at Dartmouth and popularly read and thus a legitimate article on wikipedia. Just like any other political magazine - the review, the jack o lantern, etc.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> Nobody cares about its message, whatever it may be. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dartmouth_Review_21bd.html" title="The Dartmouth Review">The Dartmouth Review</a> is an older and more prominent conservative publication, and everybody here supports its article on Wikipedia. <i>The Dartmouth Beacon</i> is a new publication that has little presence at Dartmouth, let alone outside of Dartmouth. The <i>Review</i> has been around for 25 years and has a national presence; <i>The Jack 'O Lantern</i> has been around for nearly a century and has alumni like <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Suess_af09.html" title="Dr. Suess">Dr. Suess</a>. The <i>Beacon</i> does not compare to either. Wikipedia cannot include every minor college publication on Earth. The fact that the <i>Beacon</i> is at an <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> college makes no difference. "Apponents" don't care about its conservative message. They care that it is non-notable and unencyclopaedic. --AaronS 17:53, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> It's a growing clan. If it bothers people, i'll remove some stuff so it does not take up as much space on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> or move the information to a User page. The reason that there aren't any articles on other PS2 clans is that you would never read about any of them in an encyclopedia. There are very few gaming clans on Wikipedia and most are professional eSports teams, all that stay are over 5 years old, and those that are not professionals have to be large and notable. Few clans can survive the gauntlet, even if as well written as this one is. If you can get newspapers, magazines, or commercial websites to write articles about your clan, it is probably notable, otherwise not. (By the way, the XGT Wolf page will also meet the same fate (so move the information to your user page, where no one can complain....) --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reason why:</b> It just looked as if there was a lack of articles when I put this one up, but I guess I should have researched more. On second thought, most of the information here can be found on the website for this clan and the clan itself is quite a small scale one. Sorry for a waste of space, there's no real need for it.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If they only have 30 members, none of whom are inherently notable, having an article here looks like advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Where to start? First of all, I've never noticed any AfD about notability of a USSC case, all of which are of course notable. Even so, the USSC (and any other court) may often cite case law from other jursidictions, so there is certainly no reason that a case from a lower court should not be encyclopedic just because it's from a lower court. I can't tell much about how important this particularly case really has been, but a draft-era case in which someone you so pointedly refer to as a "draft dodger" was cleared by a federal circuit court seems unquestionably notable to me. If <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sly</a> had a similar legal case at this level, it should certainly be mentioned in wikipedia (but I see no mention of anything like that). <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 01:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, this is not a USSC case. It is an appeal of a local court case. Hence it is essentially a local court case, which is decidedly not notable. It had zero media coverage at the time, and has zero usage for anything other than talking about Brandt's biography. Interestingly, and hypocritically, something of actual note, like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a>, which has meaning well and truly beyond Brandt, is apparently on the road to deletion. There is more than 1 thing wrong with that logic. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An "appeal of a local court case" is essentially a local court case, and therefore non-notable? What about <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>? Essentially no cases start at the USSC; they are <i>all</i> appeals of (more) local cases. In this case a federal appeals court took a case of the US government against a private citizen; this is hardly a "local court case". It got no media attention in 1970? How do we know? Whether it has been an important precedent in draft law I am not qualified to judge, but it is not obviously non-notable. Finally, comparing this to any other AfD is just silly, unless you're comparing it to another appeals-level decision. I'm afraid there's some politicking here I don't get, since I don't even know who Daniel Brandt is, and I don't particularly care; I'm basing my opinion entirely on the article and the fact that a federal appeals court decision on a draft-era case looks notable to me. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 06:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. "We don't know" whether this had any media attention or was notable. Almost certainly it didn't. Unless it definitely did get media attention or was used in some cases then it is most certainly not notable. As for the Roe v. Wade case above, that obviously had some claims to notoriety. What claims does this have? I'll tell you what - in 2004 in Australia there was a High Court case of R v Vizard against <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Vizard_6b2a.html" title="Steve Vizard">Steve Vizard</a>, who was the founder of <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Frontal_cb22.html" title="Full Frontal">Full Frontal</a>, a comedy series, and also a prominent lawyer. He was found not guilty. There was also a Supreme Court trial of R v Trinh &amp; McLean where 2 teenagers were found guilty of the murder of 2 Filipino prostitutes that they said they were forced to kill because of threats from the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hells_Angels_5373.html" title="Hells Angels">Hells Angels</a> who are the largest organised crime group operating out of Darwin. Now, which of these 2 is the most notable? Steve Vizard's one was in a higher court than Trinh &amp; McLean's. Or, wait, what about <a href="../../../r/_/v/R_v_Murdoch_8805.html" title="R v Murdoch">R v Murdoch</a>? That one wasn't in the High Court either. Maybe that one isn't notable. LOL.

<li>Very good point. I guess that the problem here is that his privacy is already breached by Google when they publicly released his name, and then secondly by Wikipedia creating an article about him. So the damage has already been done. This article does not further damage his privacy. Indeed, there is an argument that Google had already breached his privacy and hence that Wikipedia did not worsen the existing privacy breaches, and hence did nothing wrong. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not true. This was an appeal of a local court case. There is a whopping great difference between this kind of thing and a trial of murder or something like that. Do we include every single appeal in here? It's absurd. People are still questioning the notability of something like R v Trinh &amp; McLean, the most important case in Australia of 2004, yet someone is saying that this unheard of case should be included in here, when it has no significance to anything, other than to Brandt's personal biography. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:10, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. SCOTUS cases are inherently notable. And Zordrac's argument is absurd; the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over very few things, almost EVERYTHING starts off as a lower court case. Name the dozen most important cases in US legal history, and I'll bet 10 of them started off as appeals of lower court cases. Zordrac doesn't understand how the US legal system works. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 07:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Again, not a Supreme Court case. This was merely an appeal from an administrative hearing. The decision has not been cited by any court since 1976.

This is a public record and certainly not a "breach of privacy."

<ul>
<li>Just so you know, my Dad had an almost identical case to Brandt's. My Dad is extraordinarily non-notable, his case had 0 press coverage, other than in generally reporting on the combined sum of the cases, which did not specifically mention his name. Yes, you can go down to the court and request a copy of it, and you are not breaking any laws by publishing it up here. But most people consider such things to be an invasion of privacy. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 19:08, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think Brandt's notability or privacy are pertient issues to this discussion. The notability of this particular case should be the matter at hand. Aside from being an incident in Brandt's life (and it is discussed in his biography article), I see zero notability. There is no evidence presented that this case is particularly significant, or significant at all, that it established any notable legal precedent, or that it has been referred to in any way in any legal or historical writings. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 07:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
