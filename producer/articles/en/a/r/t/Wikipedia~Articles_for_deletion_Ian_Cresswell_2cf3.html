<li><b>Keep</b>. If CR says this guy is noteworthy, that's good enough for me. The original entry wasn't more than a single-sentence nanostub which the author politely asked to have "unblocked." It could still use some cleanup, but it's a good start. - Lucky 6.9 06:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is about educating and sharing of knowledge. There is a deep lack of accurate information available regarding Australian composers and performers. Please consider the possibility that a lack of google hits does not equate to the importance or noteriety of an individual.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll take Roadster's word for it, and agree with Brian Orchy that Google's not the best tool for finding information about some topics; composers who don't work with pop or rock music are unfortunately all too often one of them. (And Brian, please sign your votes -- you can do that by typing four tildes, like so: ~~~~ . That'll add your name and the time to your comment.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 08:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Try looking on Australian google and you still only get 600 hits. And they include furniture makers named Ian Cresswell, Assistant Fisheries secretary called Ian Cresswell, Angling coaches called Ian Cresswell and not very many for the PhD student in Music Compostion called Ian Cresswell.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Ignoring the Google test, as a musician and music student myself I regret to say that I simply am not aware of this gentleman having done anything worthy of note. I have neither seen him mentioned in any journals, nor come across any of his compositions; indeed, I had not heard of him before I read the article, and I regret to say that we cannot possibly have an article on every single music graduate that ever existed. If I had even heard of one or two of his compositions, or heard that he had obtained a resident composer or musical directorship position with a (reasonably) notable orchestra outside of Wikipedia, I would not advocate deletion. As talented as this fellow be, I fear he does not meet the Wikipedia levels of notability that are usually expected of musicians. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull"><font color="#906040">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NicholasTurnbull_2b3e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NicholasTurnbull">(e-mail)</a> <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">(cabal)</a> 15:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per Nicholas Turnbull. The argument to keep seems to be that he's turned up in the paper and he's won a few awards. Well, so have my art professors, but they're not in Wikipedia (and I don't think they should be). Just doesn't pass the notability test for me.

It would still appear that detractors of Mr Cresswell are still relying on internet based sources. My intention is to ADD an internet based source so people can find out about Mr Cresswell. For those in need of academic support, there is discussion of Ian Cresswell's piano concerto in <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sitsky_d101.html" title="Larry Sitsky">Larry Sitsky</a>'s book (details as follows):</p>
<p>Australian piano music of the twentieth century / Larry Sitsky. BOOK Westport, CT&#160;: Praeger, 2005. xviii, 335 p.&#160;: ill., music&#160;; 24 cm. 0-313-32286-4 Bibliography: p. 283-292. Includes index. AMC Library number: REF 786.20994/1</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Brian, there are no "detractors" of Mr Cresswell. No-one here has any feelings one way or the other. There are just arguments for deleting or keeping this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> based largely on trusting <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">User:Capitalistroadster</a>'s judgement.
