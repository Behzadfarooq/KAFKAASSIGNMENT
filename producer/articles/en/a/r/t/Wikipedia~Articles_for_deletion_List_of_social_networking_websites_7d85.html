<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I too have used this list for a recent discussion on online social networking sites and without this list I would have been lost!!!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've found this page to be useful for research purposes on multiple occassions. In addition it seems to be well referenced and is a demonstration of the type of fresh data that can easily be put together and presented via wiki.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a useful page that lets you see at a glance how many SNSes actually have a certain amount of members, as well as specifically focused services, and who is allowed to register. It's well-maintained and has a lot of good sources. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 21:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>; useful information, and it does do something categories can't. Spam appears to be common but speedily removed. My only concern is that while it's well maintained <i>now</i>, it would not be immediately obvious if that stopped being the case, at which point it would quickly become misleading; that's not a reason to delete it by any means, but I would urge the maintainers to consider ways of mitigating the problem (perhaps change the "User count" heading to something like "User count as of 2006"?) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:19, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> We have lists of instant messengers, web browsers, etc. I don't see why we shouldn't have a list of social networking sites. However, spam is a huge concern. I propose we permanently semi-protect the article, like <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>.

<dd>Yes, but the nominator proposed this by appealing to existing Wikipedia consensus (i.e., <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) rather than arguing why we shouldn't have such lists. It's therefore relevant to point out the existance of large numbers of "List of" articles, since that suggests that lists aren't against this consensus.</dd>
<dd>In fact, just take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_2143.html" title="Category:Lists">Category:Lists</a>, with all the subcategories and who knows how articles. Are we debating that many or all of those lists should be deleted too, or is there something special about this article? So far the arguments put forward suggest the former, but it's probably better to raise this somewhere more general. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 19:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Firstly, I disagree this comes under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a> - I don't believe it comes under any of those examples listed, and disagree this is indiscriminate. Secondly, Categories do not display user counts, description/focus and registration type, so it is not true that they do the job. Thirdly, in response to Pgk, I disagree this comes under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a directory</a> - that refers to excessive external links in an article, not these "Lists of Wikipedia Articles", of which there are many examples on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 18:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this looks like a useful comparison that collects information in a form that can't be found anywhere else. Much of the information is cited. If there are non-notable sites or unverifiable claims they should be removed, but that doesn't justify deleting the article. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 20:03, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand the doubts about this article, but a few of us are pretty vigilant about keeping it "discriminate" and free of linkspam.
