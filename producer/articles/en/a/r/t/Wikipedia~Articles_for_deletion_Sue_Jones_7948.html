<li>I mean, a little bit of <b>merge</b> wouldn't hurt with that <b>delete</b>, but I agree with <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> as well. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 04:06, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, she seems to be related in someway to two different famous people, so someone doing research on either one can look her up <i>-- 24.15.84.34 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.15.84.34_e864.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.15.84.34">contribs</a>)'s four edits are all to the article, this VfD, or <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norah_Jones_7d2a.html" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a>.</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, My take is different. I think it is worthwhile to keep since any story on Norah Jones seems to refer to Sue Jones, especially her methods of imparting musicall awareness to Norah at a young age. If we keep it, may be someone else may add more details on that which can be useful to other parents. If you merge, you lose that wonderful possibility. ssinger 07:51, July 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> having articles like this saves space in the other articles, so they don't have to be clogged with biographical information about parents and siblings and the like. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">malathion</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 14:50, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are we short in space in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norah_Jones_7d2a.html" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a> article? More importantly, a separate article about a topic implies its seperate encyclopedic note: "making space" doesn't really have any bearing seeing as WP:NOT paper, and all. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 18:15, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> with some formatting changes. To me notability criterion is met, notable because of contribution but may not be in the public eye. A bit of parallel I see is Venus and Serena Williams' father in the Women's tennis world. He is a bit more in the public eye because of media exposure but the real story is how he coached them in an unconventional way. 18:24, 18 July 2005 (UTC) <i>-- this vote is one of 63.210.102.138 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.210.102.138.html" title="User talk:63.210.102.138">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.210.102.138_9ddf.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.210.102.138">contribs</a>)'s two edits so far.</i></li>

I don't like the "notability chain rule", as it's neverending. Are we going to include everyone's mom/dad/sister/etc? Besides, this is full of unencyclopedic stuff like she's "described as a kind and helpful person", "On the gossip front...". She'd like Norah to record some standards. Good for her, now why's that here? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:50, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I don't like the idea of a redirect. Redirecting people to people can easily be problematical. Since I doubt anyone who doesn't already know Sue is Norah's mother will search for this, I'm going to vote to <b>smerge and delete</b> (and quite a slight smerge at that). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:29, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>If we smerge, we can't delete, I thought? GFDL and all...-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 13:57, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a way to do it while preserving the history; though I forget what it is. If it's too much trouble then I'll vote delete. If someone wants to add some of the information back in their own words, I imagine they can do it without violating GFDL and all. I mean, the original contributor just took something he/she read and rephrased it presumably anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:40, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I take issue with those arguing notability criteria is passed (see <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>). These facts should be merged into <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norah_Jones_7d2a.html" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a> (where they will have merit, they are important to understand the artist's development).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> not notable on her own. <b>Merge</b> anything worth keeping into her daughter's article. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 23:51, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An unencyclopedic, gossipy, mish-mash on an individual of absolutely no note whatsoever. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 17:31, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It can use some edits to tone down the gossip and make it read better but that kind of stuff takes care of itself over time. She is not a media story like Joseph Jackson but deserves notoriety for a similar reason, a single woman spotting and nurturing a great talent. <small>(Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../1/9/3/User%7E193.188.105.22.html" title="User:193.188.105.22">193.188.105.22</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.188.105.22.html" title="User talk:193.188.105.22">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.188.105.22_378a.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.188.105.22">contribs</a>))</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. reasonably notable and interesting character.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not interesting enough for an encyclopedic entry. Nothing notable except being the mother of a famous person. Maybe a line mentioning that Norah was inspired by her mother's love of Billie Holiday can be included in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norah_Jones_7d2a.html" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a> --<a href="../../../f/i/t/User%7EFitful_cc6c.html" title="User:Fitful">Fitful</a> 21:19, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand why the big opposition to keeping it. It is probably in the grey area but let us err on the side of keeping it. The content definitely needs improvement. - occasional visitor 06:13, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> with edits to the content. In the few minutes I thought about it, I went back andd forth a bit but eventually decided to vote to keep. My hope is the community will beef up the content over time shedding more light on the mother's influence on the talent. I learnt about Joseph Jackson after seeing it mentioned here and it was informative. So someone else might find information about this parent useful. Jim Pulaski 04:14, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
