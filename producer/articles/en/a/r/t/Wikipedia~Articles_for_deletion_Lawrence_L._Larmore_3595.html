<p>This page is apparently an autobiography. Additionally, two key linked articles, <a href="../../../k/-/s/K-server_problem.html" title="K-server problem">K-server problem</a> and <a href="../../../t/-/t/T-theory.html" title="T-theory">T-theory</a>, were also created recently by the same user. These articles are only linked by <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_L._Larmore_daa4.html" title="Lawrence L. Larmore">Lawrence L. Larmore</a> (except for a couple automatically-generated links), and should be considered included under this nomination. It seems that this is an instance of an individual writing about his specialized area of work, and making it seem more important than it actually is. I will invite comments from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Computer_science_f7cb.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science">Computer Science WikiProject</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliyak_a018.html" title="User:Eliyak">Eliyak</a> <small><a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliyak_b99a.html" title="User talk:Eliyak">T</a></small>·<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eliyak_241c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eliyak">C</a></small> 04:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I feel too close to the subject of this AfD to have an unbiased opinion on it, and I don't know what T-theory is (perhaps I should), but the K-server problem is a central topic to online algorithms, is relevant to important practical problems such as cache replacement strategies, and was for several years quite a hot topic in theoretical computer science more generally. It deserves a much less stubby article than what's there now, and I think it is to Larry's credit if he was the one to notice and correct its absence here. I'll take a look at expanding that article into something more informative. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 06:06, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Last time I checked, T-Theory is a branch of mathematics. Shall we each individually propose deletion of every topic that we are unfamiliar with or do not understand? Ridiculous. Secondly, how "important" something "seems" is subjective. If you don't find these topics important, then avoid them. Deletion seems extreme. Lastly, a quick check in two of my CS textbooks (Data Structures ISBN: 032144146X, and Online Computation ISBN: 0521619467) reveals Larmore in the index. Enough said. --<a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparameter_917a.html" title="User:Tparameter">Tparameter</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I do not know much about his area of research, but I draw attention to the fact that we have articles about obscure fictional characters and rock bands, and here we debate the deletion of an article about a person who appears to have done some scientific research.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the external links could use trimming. Seems referenced well enough; the related articles seem fleshed out enough to assuage worries about a single-user build-up attempt. Also a comment on the comment: that's a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>; articles should be ideally be judged individually from each other.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. One reason to do an AfD is to give proponents of the article a chance to make improvements, in a case where the article may have potential but falls short in its current state. A mere laundry list of algorithms he helped create won't be enlightening. A nice short, punchy exposition of one of the algorithms showing its value could make the difference. The article says nothing about practical importance of his work. If his work is only theoretical, and is not practically significant, could its mathematical value be illustrated? <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The article has been improved and adjusted by recommendations. In addition, T-theory, tight span, package-merge algorithm, k-server problem, and other related topics have been expanded by several different contributors.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Previously the reason for deletion was <i>no references</i>. I updated the site and included requested references.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The current reason for deletion has two arguments.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1. The article is an autobiography<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. The material presented is not important.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>Eliyak</i>, you referenced this page as an autobiography. By definition, an autobiography is writen by the person who the article is about. Since I wrote this page, it is not an autobiography, it is a biography, which wikipedia allows as long as the person is of importance. Larmore's importance is clearly shown in the references I provided earlier this week.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Next, we address the importance of the <a href="../../../k/-/s/K-server_problem.html" title="K-server problem">K-server problem</a> and <a href="../../../t/-/t/T-theory.html" title="T-theory">T-theory</a>. If you google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22t-theory%22+%22mathematics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22t-theory%22+%22mathematics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"t-theory" "mathematics"</a> you'll get 10,000+ pages of relivent information. If you google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22k-server+problem%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22k-server+problem%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"k-server problem"</a> you'll get 14,000+ pages of relivent information. Clearly these topics have value. In addition, after I created stubs for each of the topics, others have been adding/modifying the information. Clearly there are others who care about these subjects.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>EdJohnston</i>, thank you for your comments. You mentioned that AfD gives a chance for improving the article. Adding algorithm details should be a wikipedia topic on its own, not covered in the biography of person. Deleting the topic is a bit much. If improvments are needed, you could help improve it (since that is the beauty of wikipedia). Additionally, I'll add some additional information about some of Larmore's algorithms later this week. Hopefully, this will satisfy your request.<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your list of "references" is actually (with the possible exception of the Borodin and El-Yaniv reference, which I don't have access to and can't check) a list of Larmore's publications. These references do not directly support the assertion that Larmore is "known for" his work. Nor do they provide any indication that his work in these (I am willing to stipulate) important areas is itself important or notable. I suppose you could infer importance or notability from the prestige of the journals in which the publications in question appear, but that smacks of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. More helpful references might be things like a survey article on the field in question (one n ot authored by Larmore) that points to Larmore's work as influential, and a biographical article or webpage that provides <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> for the different degrees that are claimed. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 04:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Allan McInnes - <i>I suppose you could infer importance or notability from the prestige of the journals in which the publications in question appear, but that smacks of original research.</i></dd>
<dd>If you could please clarify this statement I would appreciate it. The journals listed are notable sources. By the link you provided, this satisfies being non-original research because the papers published come from notable sources. Perhaps the following link will also help with the <i>notability</i> issue. From the Most cited authors in Computer Science - June 2003 (CiteSeer), <a href="http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu/allcited.html" class="external text" title="http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu/allcited.html" rel="nofollow">Larmore is 6641 out of 659481 authors</a>, clearly he is a <i>little</i> better than the average professor (from this measurement he is roughly in the top 1%). <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOravec_9f2b.html" title="User:Oravec">Oravec</a> 23:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that we're not concerned with whether or not Larmore's work is original research. What we're concerned with is whether or not the claims <i>about</i> Larmore's work are original research. Making the assertion that Larmore's work is important because it has been published in notable journals can be construed as original research, since you are coming to a conclusion based on the analysis of data, rather than citing someone else's analysis or conclusions. The same goes for analyzing Citeseer data (which isn't all that unbiased to begin with, but that's a separate issue). That's why I encouraged you to dig up a survey article that states that Larmore's work is influential or important - that conclusion would be citable, and not OR. The alternative is to avoid claiming that Larmore's work is important, and to simply state that his work has been published in journals X, Y, and Z (supportable via citations of the articles themselves), and that he is the 6641st most cited author on Citeseer (supportable via reference to the Citeseer page). In neither case would you be inserting your own opinions or analysis. You would simply be presenting verifiable facts, and letting the reader draw their own conclusions. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 04:27, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An example paper for the field I'm most familiar with, Huffman coding, is <a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666911" class="external autonumber" title="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666911" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a survey of code and parse trees. (A free version can be found at <a href="http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsiam/publication/org/Abrahams.ps.gz" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsiam/publication/org/Abrahams.ps.gz" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.) It includes, "Currently the best algorithmic approach to Huffman coding under the maximum codeword length constraint is due to Moffat et al. based on the algorithm of Larmore and Hirschberg." So the best practical approach is a modification of one co-introduced by Larmore. Huffman coding under the maximum codeword length constraint is useful for the fastest method of near-optimal lossless coding for known sources. It's hard to say how much that is used in practice, but it doesn't seem too pedestrian to me.... <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 05:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Allan McInnes</i> - Thank you for clarifying your statement for me. I must agree, althrough I think it is common knowledge that he is well-known (in his research areas and then some), there is no real way to measure something unbiasedly (even though citeseer is a 3rd party and you asked for a reference). So I reworded the page to: <i>One of his main research areas is competitive analysis of online algorithms, particularly for the k-server problem.</i> This addresses his research efforts and allows for everyone to maintain their own opinion. Please let me know if all is satisfactory. Thanks, <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOravec_9f2b.html" title="User:Oravec">Oravec</a> 16:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> From the Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a>, criteria for biography: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." This is satisfied by the aforementioned fundamental algorithms and references in widely used textbooks in CS. Secondly, under "alternative tests" on the same page, "The professor test -- If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor..., they can and should be included." Since Larmore has two PhDs, and an abundance of publications in mathematics as well as CS, and he is referenced in Textbooks - I think it is safe to say that he is more well-known than an "average college prof". He is after all above average in these three areas, which are definitive for professors. <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparameter_917a.html" title="User:Tparameter">Tparameter</a> 20:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
