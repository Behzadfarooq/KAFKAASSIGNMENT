<li>These statistics are ludicrous. I haven't had time to do a calculation as to what the average IQ of the sample is based on these numbers, but I'm betting it's considerably below 100. Secondly, the idea that the mean IQ of the citizens of Guinea (59, according to the table) is more than two standard deviations below the global mean beggars belief. According to the <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_560e.html" title="IQ">IQ</a> article, people with an IQ below 80 are regarded as being candidates for special ed. As this article is basically a collection of statistics, and as they are so beyond the pale, I can't see any alternative but to delete the article. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 10:04, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. I agree with Robert's comments above. problems with the definition of IQ aside, any samples involving more than 10 representatives of each country should fall within a two and a bit points of 100 (<i><a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopbanana_c4c6.html" title="User:Topbanana">TB</a> 07:46, 7 May 2004 (UTC) adds: if the data is normalised, the tests truly comparable and underlying national IQs are equal</i>).

<li>I've done some more looking into this, and these statistics are actually from a scholarly publication by two retired professors, and the book has been reviewed positively in an Elsevier journal (look on the article talk page for a link).

<li>Comment. Distasteful, yes. Since it's reprinted data is it copyvio? Or even wikisource? The reason I'm not saying <i>delete</i> is that there's a list of <i>The 100 Best Stand-up Comics</i> as listed by an American publication somewhere, and - other than if a distinction is made on grounds of taste - I guess all other <i>rankings</i> tables would have to be deleted too?

<li>My problem isn't with a list of average IQs in certain nations, my problem is with the methodology that, as Robert said right at the top of this thread, produces statistics that border on the absurd. A relative layman's look at this page makes me think that these figures say the average human being is below the defined average for IQ, and that doesn't make much sense. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 17:07, May 6, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Well then, I challenge you to multiply the average IQ of each coutry by its proportion of the world's population, and see if it adds up to 100. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> 17:10, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's verifiable information and comes from numerous sources. In regards to Bodnotbod's concerns above about copyvio - the data itself cannnot be copyrighted.

<li>The copyright would be for the particular data from that study. The facts cannot be copyrighted, of course, however were the study to be repeated, sampling error would yield different numbers.

<li>Just for my education, <i>this set of numbers is copyrighted</i>... can that be right? Anybody know the real legal position on this?

<li>I don't see anything in US Code that says we are not allowed to restate the results of a scientific study. I also do not see anything that explicitly says we are not allowed to. However, it does say that information cannot be copyrighted.

<li>The article lists where the data is sourced from and states that the data is dependent on the validity or invalidity of the research methods used, so I can't see anything factually wrong with the article. If the data was about something less controversial and with fewer sociological ramifications, such as a list of the best standup comics as rated by Comedy Central, or <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html#List_of_economies_by_GDP" title="Gross domestic product">List of countries by GDP</a>, would you still want to delete the article over concerns the data could be statistically flawed?

<li>Comments: If all that you say is true, a better preamble might save the article. I suggest you have a go at this yourself. Comparisons with other articles are not convincing IMO.

<li>Then how about we change the title to "List of countries by IQ as ranked by Lynn and Vanhanen" (Even though they themselves are sourcing the information from numerous worldwide studies). Would that be acceptable? This is true and useful information with heavy sociological implications, so I can't understand why there are people who want to erase it from existence or hide it from Wikipedia readers who are interested in having access to it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> 18:41, 6 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: It's not the title that's the problem IMO. See below for a better renaming suggestion. This would involve rewriting the introduction, which is what I think is most needed. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 19:01, 6 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I half-agree with Andrewa -- it's the title <i>and</i> the intro that are the problem. A comparatively new hypothesis is presented as if it were fact, or at least widely accepted within the field. Even a possible title like "List of countries by IQ as ranked by Lynn and Vanhanen" skews the emphasis. What makes this highly questionable claim worth including is that somebody with some sort of credential said it. Change title to "Lynn-Vanhanen hypothesis of national IQ and wealth" or some such, to emphasize that aspect, then report what they say and what their critics say. It should begin along the lines of: "The Lynn-Vanhanen hypothesis of national IQ and wealth holds that about 58 per cent of the differences in national wealth can be explained by differences in intelligence, with each average IQ point above 70 being worth about £500 in GDP per head of population. (Rewrite the foregoing because it's probably copyvio - I took it almost verbatim from the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8122-888798,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8122-888798,00.html" rel="nofollow">Times One</a> article.) (Start new paragraph) In (insert year), Dr. Richard Lynn of the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, and Dr. Tatu Vanhanen of the University of Tampere, Helsinki, Finland, in their book <i>IQ and the Wealth of Nations,</i> presented IQ data by country, taking averages when multiple studies give varying results for a country. Thus, some of these figures are based on much more data and larger studies than others." Then continue with their data, more detail on their methodology, their conclusions and comments, and opposing points of view, including general critique of IQ scores and any specific responses to Lynn-Vanhanen, any rebuttals they make to their critics, etc. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 05:30, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this is another indication that an IQ test is a method used to determine how good a person is at taking IQ tests. <a href="../../../m/k/_/User%7EMK_d3fe.html" title="User:MK">MK</a> 18:24, 6 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That may be so, but it doesn't mean that the list itself is invalid. If you're right, then we still have a list of countries sorted by average IQ, even though IQ might be nothing more than an indication of how a person is at taking IQ tests. If you want to add that IQ doesn't measure much except how good someone is at taking an IQ test, feel free to do so, although such discussion really belongs on the <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_560e.html" title="IQ">IQ</a> page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> 18:34, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that the data makes you uncomfortable is not a reason to erase it. It is a well-sourced and important piece of the IQ debate.

<li>Keep, <i>very</i> cautiously. If these studies were done, and have held up under fire, I think there's no reason that we should censor the information.

<li>I've done some work on the article, to make it somewhat less misleading. If the research is credible, yes, we should keep it. However, this is very <i><b>dangerous</b></i> information. For example, it may deter future investment in low-ranked countries, or be used to justify racism or nationalism at some point in the future. We need to make this article as fair and not-misleading as possible. I think I've made a good start by, for example, noting the fact that the countries where measured IQ is highest are also those that use frequent IQ-test-like-exams in their educational systems, and that by practicing IQ tests people can improve their scores dramatically (I know a guy who worked his supposed "IQ" up from 150-ish into the 200s, by practicing these tests.)</li>
<li>Even with all that said, I'm still highly doubtful that this research means anything, and I expect to hear, at some point, that it was flawed, faulty, or corrupt. When that happens we should remark even further that the study was discredited. Some of these results are bizarre. Guinea at 59? That's a mental age of 9.44 (IQ theory is that IQ = 100*(mental age)/(chronological age), but intellectual aging stops at an arbitrarily selected 16.0 so for adults you use 16 as the denominator)-- seems quite ludicrous to me.</li>
<li>So, yeah... I'd say keep, because I'm opposed to censorship, but be <i><b>very</b></i> careful to make sure this article is not misleading. I've done some work on the article toward that effect, and I encourage others to do so as well. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 02:00, 7 May 2004 (UTC)

<li>Delete. I don't believe there is a total order among people.

Also, the appropriateness of <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_560e.html" title="IQ">IQ</a> as a measure of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> itself is debatable. More <b>importantly</b>, the method employed for arriving at such a result is not convincing. Many of those who voted to keep this article have cited various other articles which violate this principle. If that be true, they should also be deleted. In general, I'm against ordering of any sort except based on scientifically measurable quantities with strong backing of facts.:-- <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundar_8811.html" title="User:Sundar">Sundar</a> 12:50, May 7, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Take a look at this article: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_GDP_35ec.html" title="List of countries by GDP">List of countries by GDP</a>. It's almost identical, but the only difference is that IQ has been replaced with GDP. Yet this article has been existence since February without much controversy. GDP is as difficult, if not more difficult, to measure than IQ. How exactly does one go about measuring the total value of all goods produced in a society? What about grey market or illegal sales? What about corporate accounting fraud distorting sales figures? Or cash transactions that go unaccounted for? What about inflationary effects on prices and sales revenues? Any argument that could work against the IQ article could also work against the GDP article, so I can't see any reason why the GDP article should be kept while the IQ article should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> 01:59, 8 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No statistic is completely free from doubt, but there are gradations. Figures on GDP are routinely compiled by governments, central banks or international agencies, applying some comparatively objective standards. The kinds of issues you raise are considered and discussed by different economists. Here, we have a computation of national IQ that's found in one book. It doesn't seem that other researchers have even picked up on this idea. Still less have these figure been through the kind of scrutiny applied to GDP numbers. Although I don't favor deletion, it would be misleading for us to present the numbers from this particular book in a table like that for GDP, as if the two sets of data had equal reliability. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:02, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Objections to proposed new title "IQ and the Wealth of Nations"</b>
<ul>
<li>Several people have suggested this move, but I <i>strongly</i> disagree. To have an article with that title, and only this content, would imply that this one book is authoritative on the subject. Furthermore, I doubt we could augment such an article much, because I don't think there are many other researchers trying to find such a correlation. That's why I suggested instead <b>"Lynn-Vanhanen hypothesis of national IQ and wealth"</b> as a title. I agree with the POV that this hypothesis is bullshit, but, obviously, that <i>is</i> just a POV. We should report on this claim. After all, we report on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. Only, let's not give the false impression that this is anything more than the opinion of one particular pair of authors, who use questionable data to reach convenient conclusions. (I love the part where the exceptions are explained away as reflecting the superiority of capitalism. It sure sounds like they started with a set of right-wing doctrines and tried to manipulate the data to provide a veneer of scientific support.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:49, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't. It's standard procedure to file articles on books under their titles, even if the title is POV. The first sentence will be, <i><b>IQ and the Wealth of Nations</b></i> is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversial.html" title="Controversial">controversial</a> book by L and V which puts forward the thesis that, etc., etc. If we don't allow it to be under this title, can we move <i><a href="../../../l/i/e/Lies_and_the_Lying_Liars_Who_Tell_Them_bb5c.html" title="Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</a></i> to Al Franken's hypothesis of inaccuracy in FOX News reporting? -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:22, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a distinction between the general hypothesis (the Holocaust never occurred, FOX News is biased) and a specific book (<i>Did Six Million Really Die?</i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/e/Lies_and_the_Lying_Liars_Who_Tell_Them_bb5c.html" title="Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</a></i>). With the Holocaust, we have the article on the hypothesis (<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>) which mentions that book, but the book doesn't get its own article. The Franken book merits its own article because of its significance (best-seller, subject of lawsuit, celebrity author), whatever you think of the merits of its claims. The analogy isn't perfect -- there is no separate article on the claim that FOX is biased, because that discussion finds a ready home under <a href="../../../f/o/x/FOX_News_25d6.html" title="FOX News">FOX News</a>. In the present case, the Lynn-Vanhanen claim deserves to be reported (though it is indeed Nazi/racialist bullshit), but the article should be about the issue, not just the book. Then other publications that support the hypothesis (if any) can readily be accommodated. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:00, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. The existance of the study itself has been verified. The version of the article I looked at was reasonably NPOV in presenting the findings of the study. Comments about the validity of using IQ tests as a measure of intelligence or critiques of the methodology are irrelevant to the deletion debate. (They are, of course, fair critiques that may be appropriate <i>in</i> the article.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 02:22, 8 May 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By the way, I disagree with most of the emotional rhetoric above. IQ tests are optimized for the cultural context in which they have been developed (pretty much exclusively UK and US). Why would it possibly surprise anyone that people from outside that cultural context score lower on tests than those for whom the test was designed? That was the <i>only</i> implication I drew from the article even before all this discussion about changing the introduction back and forth. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a></li>

<li>As I noted in the article, L&amp;V's table is not their own research but data culled from various published studies in the field.
