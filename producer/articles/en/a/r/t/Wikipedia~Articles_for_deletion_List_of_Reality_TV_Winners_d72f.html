<p>The list is a loose association of reality show winners by program. Even if the list was expanded to include all winners of all reality TV series (not just "the most popular, big budget, ongoing North American Reality TV series" as of this writing), I don't see how that would be valuable. An example: how would a winner of <i>Survivor</i> compare with a winner of <i>Project Runway</i>? In comparison, a list of all game show winners would really appear as being loosely associated; although a list with a limited criterion, as with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_game_show_winnings_records.html" title="American game show winnings records">American game show winnings records</a>, would have some meaning. There is also an existing <a href="../../../r/e/a/Category%7EReality_show_winners_dd8e.html" title="Category:Reality show winners">Category:Reality show winners</a>, but I am not necessarily nominating for that reason. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 09:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to reply, the requirement that every person on a list has to be notable for the list itself to be notable is incorrect, nor I believe do you find it in any guidelines or policies. A list can be notable <i>as a whole</i> without every individual entry on the list being notable. For example, many notable movies include non-notable actors, but their cast list <i>as a whole</i> is a notable item worth inclusion either in their article or as a subarticle depending on the space. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article's flaw isn't notability, as I mentioned above. It's that it is attempting to collect into a single list a wide variety of otherwise basically unrelated people. It has selected four game shows, apparently arbitraily as a result of the original author's opinion, and lists the names of the winners with no attempt to explain exactly what these people have in common that justifies being on the same list. It's a bit like trying to make a "List of Sitcom Stars" by listing the regular cast of Friends, Cheers, I Love Lucy and Taxi. Sure, all those shows are popular and notable and the cast lists are notable individually, but they have nothing in common so why should they appear in the same article? I probably wouldn't have a problem with the individual lists appearing as subsections of their related game show articles, though, or even as subarticles for those game show articles if the lists are large (provided everything is properly referenced). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as indiscriminate list. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 06:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to clarify, I think the correct part of policy to quote here would be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, since this could be considered a "List or repositories of loosely associated topics". This wouldn't fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> since that section doesn't deal with "almanac tables" or "trivia" or "directories". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> albeit I wouldn't really consider these people non-notables. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 08:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Otherwise why stop with reality TV shows? Why not a list of <b>ALL GAMESHOW WINNERS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD EVER</b> On the other hand , perhaps not. <a href="../../../a/1/o/User%7EA1octopus_952d.html" title="User:A1octopus">A1octopus</a> 19:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia rocks! I started adding names and links to this page as a way to kill time while at my workplace. (Yeah, I know, the boss could have caught me and given me the boot, but what are you gonna do!?!) The fact is I had never intended on adding much more because I don't have a lot of free time outside work. For the most part, I just wanted to familiarize myself with how wiki pages are edited. The fact that this has generated into any type of discussion is awesome. Sure, I guess Iâ€™ll agree with deletion because it doesn't include every reality show ever conceived. Doesn't matter much to me. Although in all honesty, most of the other trashy TV winners out there don't warrant much mention. Besides, I personally like how having a limited list provides a quick access to the history of each show's relevant season, and it helps viewers reminisce about who won, and when. Well, there's my 2 cents. Maybe if the boss goes on vacation I will try to add more shows.... <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBBlze1_ab0d.html" title="User:BBlze1">BBlze1</a> 02:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
