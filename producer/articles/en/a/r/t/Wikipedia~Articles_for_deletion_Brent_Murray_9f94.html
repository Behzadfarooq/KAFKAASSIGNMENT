<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Several votes said "Keep if references are added." Though external links were added, none of the originally questionable info was referenced; in fact, most of it has been removed. Thus, I add those borderline votes to the 60% or so who are voting straight delete. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The <i>NYT</i> links need registration. (No, this doesn't automatically disqualify them, but it is irritating or worse.)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and rewrite. NPOV is a MAJOR problem. This article is 100% autobiograhpical, but he's somewhat notable. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1949935/maindetails" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1949935/maindetails" rel="nofollow">IMDB has an entry</a>, though its paltry. However, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Brent+Murray+Photography" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Brent+Murray+Photography" rel="nofollow">google search</a> turns up MANY pages that do not include self-created pages. He does seem to be the guy he claims. Still, by the standard that "if no one who doesn't know you is inspired to write about you, you are probably not notable" then, well, maybe he's not notable. His body of work is impressive, and the article can be brought up to standard if someone were so inspired. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, IMDb is not really authoritative, information can be submitted by anyone who registers (i.e. possibly Murrary himself) and IMDb doesn't maintain the standards and quality checks that Wikipedia does. The Google search is pretty underwhelming; only two sites apart from his own turn up: <i>lightstalkers.org</i>, which seems to be nothing more than a CV hosting service, and <i>modelmayhem.com</i>, which is the same thing. Both these sites merely host information supplied by the photographer himself. Conducting my own search I found a hit for a site from which his member name has been deleted and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/asimov-bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/asimov-bio.html" rel="nofollow">one credited photo from a brief NY Times article</a>, plus one or two others. There's also this hit (with a link to an article that requires registration): "<i>Ms. McNally joined The Times in 2004 as director of photography. ... And special thanks to Brent Murray of our Web site who painstakingly inserted visuals ...</i>" that makes Murray sound like a fairly low-level employee, though more might have been revealed if I had registered. I suppose. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 13:23, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> In its most current iteration, the article appears to be unbiased, and the NYT articles references are indeed legit.

<li><b>Questions</b>: I'm still puzzled. There are two lists of links. The first has two links: one to Murray's own site and the other to what appears to be a page supplied by him to some networking (?) site. The second mostly has links to pages in the NYT that are said to show photos by him; of the two that aren't NYT, one shows nothing by him and the other shows a competent but completely humdrum publicity mugshot. Talk of "multiple publications" suggests to me a list of books, or at least major magazine features. Are there any? Any news stories about him? Any exhibitions by him? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> -- Sorry, I should have been clearer -- he has multiple commercial publications of individual photographs, most of which do seem to be related in one way or another to the NYTimes. All links in "Photographs reproduced" do include a shot by him (Margo Jefferson on the Random House site and Ben Brantley (credited in the alt text) on the BBC's, and breaking the list out in that way was my attempt to clarify that the links were not, strictly speaking, as had previously been indicated, "References." I'm not saying he's <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a>, but he does appear to be a working photographer of some established professional notability. That the page started with very definite vanity and autobiography issues seems to have been overcome, although it still needs stronger sourcing and, as noted above, will bear watching. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 07:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well done. I appreciate your work on this and your position. But meanwhile, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">this</a> does say that photographers should have been published and have <i>received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i> True, this is a mere guideline, but I thought guidelines are, if not observed, then bent or broken only for good reason. On the evidence adduced so far, BM seems an unremarkable photographer. If his work (for the NYT or elsewhere) had won comment in some newspaper, that would be a different matter. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with Robertissimo's standard is that we have not consistently applied this to other AfD discussions. Brent Murray's self article still fails the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> guideline that has been consistently applied to other AfD discussions that I've monitored. Yes Murray can show that his photographs have been published, but, as Hoary points out, these do not consitute 'multiple independent reviews or awards.' The article still does not contain verifiable references that were not self-generated. Many, many photographers have had work published by the NY Times -- will this be a new standard? As I've said before, I think Murray will someday be notable, but, unless we want to lower the standards for everyone else that we've deleted, he is not notable today. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 14:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> <s><b>Neutral</b>.</s> I would say keep as long as someone (not me) wants to rewrite it NPOV, with content. He seems notable enough to me, as per <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a>, but the article was created as vanity or at least autobiography, and needs much work. If no one's willing to do the work, then that speaks for itself. If he had to create his own article, and even with that push no one wants to expand it, he probably isn't notable enough to be included at this time.

<li>Also, I meant to say, reasoning from <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. WP:AUTO is clear about this, and the proof is in the unwillingness (or inability) of others to expand and make a workable article.
