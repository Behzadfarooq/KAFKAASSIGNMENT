<li><b>Comment</b> No vote yet. Amazon sales rank 10,562 in Books is <i>reasonably</i> impressive. However, whoever created it was asking for trouble by not developing it to at least the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">good stub</a> stage before creating the article. The class should be encouraged to hurry up and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite some sources</a> that show that the book is important and influential. If the article is in quarter-decent shape before the end of the AfD discussion I'll vote keep. I'll want to see something more substantial than, say, a plot summary, and any statements of opinion should cite a published source. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC) P.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Chris Curtcher has a page on Wikipedia and is a very well known author of young adult fiction. The book is noteworthy because so many schools have banned it, along with many Chris Crutcher novels because they deal with real issues facing teens.

<dd><b>Comment</b> For the benefit of those new editors: inserting almost <b>any</b> material into the article that <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cites a source</a> that meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines will be more effective in getting the article kept than anything they can say here in AfD.

<dd>Quick Googling turns up a number of references to the book as being "controversial,"<a href="http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21716/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21716/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> "frequently challenged,"<a href="http://www.wilsonville.lib.or.us/teen/challenged.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wilsonville.lib.or.us/teen/challenged.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, etc. and Crutcher is often identified as an "author of banned books," but, so far, I haven't been able to find anything that says this <i>particular</i> book by Chris Crutcher has actually been <i>banned</i> anywhere. Crutcher says vaguely "I think they've all been banned somewhere. Usually they get banned in middle schools. I know they've all been challenged many times."<a href="http://www.booksense.com/people/archive/crutcherchris.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.booksense.com/people/archive/crutcherchris.jsp" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<li><b>Cautious Keep</b> Seems just about acceptable enough, if more info on the banning can be given. However, does the literature class understand that how Wikipedia works? It's an imaginative class assignment, but perhaps a bit misguided about what Wikipedia is. Will this page be the repository for 10 to 20 (or more?) class homeworks on this book? (And I assume that if this assignment is to be substantive - this is apparently an assignment for a <i>graduate-level</i> class, despite some high school-like writing here - these have to be homeworks of significant length). Will these homeworks be written in an encyclopedic fashion, or will they be typical student essays or will they be POV literary criticism guides or how-to teach this book guides? Those last three will raise alarm bells. Does the class understand that any Wikipedian can come along and change their homeworks freely? How will the class and teacher feel about that? Will they say that that would be disrupting their use of technology? Do they understand that Wikipedia is not a free resource for people to use any way they see fit?

<li>Well... I am the professor and this was not a homework assignment, but rather an in-class endeavor. As a class when we used Wikipedia to look up information about Chris Cruthcer and about his text Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes we were in shock to find that the Crutcher entry was quite short and that there were no entries for his novel. We decided to break into four groups: one to prvide informaiton on why the text is noteable, one to provide the plot information of the text, one to provide information on characters, and one to provide information on internal links. There is not 10 to 20 homework assignments being posted. We have blackboard and web-hosting technology of our to do that. This 'assignment' was a choice to provide the encyclopedia type entry information for a text that as a group we felt was worthy of more mention than Wikipedia had on it. Furthermore, Wikipedia is a space that users, when noticing a lack of informaiton should feel free to add. No one here offered opinion on the text saying it was a 'must read' or trying to sell it, but we want readers, educators, writers, and others to have access to the information about the text that they may seek. When looking at other pieces of fiction, the entires were rather short and provided less information than we did. We are in the process of editing, but felt rushed to get the information up since we were not given even a reasonable amount of time to get information up before the slew of delete tries came through. I think that in 2 hours, which is what we spent on it, we did a fine job of providing a decent entry, which leaves rooms for others to add to. A part of me is happy to know that Wikipedia is a self-policing community because as a professor when I tell students to use Wikipedia I am more assured of the quality of information they are seeing. I am really sad, however, that Wikipedia, or at least the people that have been somewhat brutal on here, have been so impatient. As educators we want to encourage our students to contribute in communities like the Wikipedia community, but how would they ever feel confident when they woudl not be given the space of 24 hours to work on an entry. I want to be CRYSTAL CLEAR that we were not creating a webpage on the Novel or tyring to ge free hosting --- OUR COLLEGE PROVIDES THIS FOR US --- we were and are trying to provide a valuable entry that others can reference when looking at young adult fiction! <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">Litclass</a> 05:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Explanation</b> This entry is not a homework assignment but a tool to inform others about Chris Crutcher's work. It was an in class assignment in which we created a site to support a book that has been challenged in many schools. We believe this book is worthy of recognition and have written a page to provide readers with information on Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes. This is a book that adolescents can relate to and benefit from reading. If one person reads this book due to this posting then the purpose has been achieved.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd suggest giving the class enough time to write the article and learn about Wikipedia as they go. Since the length of their class is fixed, they have a deadline to worry about; Wikipedia on the other hand, does not. If necessary, other editors can clean up later. In the meantime, if we let the class learn about <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> in a positive manner, maybe maybe some of them will stay and be good contributors. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 02:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is really sad is that we are not even being given in a chance. In 24 hours we have gone through and created a full entry for this novel, a novel which is recognized as a popular piece of young adult fiction from a well known young adult fiction writer. Wikipedia claims to be a space where members create and work on the entries. If we look up MANY pieces of literature, the pages do not have nearly as much information as this page has. Furthermore, 'tone' is a matter of persepctive. The information in this entry, was written by educators who work with young adults, and is written in a format that will be 'reachable' for both adult and young adult. Young adults should be able to make the best of Wikipedia as an ency. resource with which they can access information, for example here, about text. There is plenty of information on this page which now alerts viewers to why the text it self is notable, the plot and characters are provided, along with a multitude of external links to guide viewers of the entry to more information about the text. This entry is quite informative, and is of equal value and style to many entries on pieces of literature. Thus, please stop trying to delte and get rid of this page. It is a good solid stub that others can continue to contribute to. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">Litclass</a> 05:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody is "trying" to delete anything. You brought this on yourself by creating the article prematurely. Deletion discussions run for a full week. I don't think I've yet seen a case of an article being deleted if the topic was halfway reasonable and if the article creators put a halfway reasonable amount of good-faith effort into it. You just have to endure the ugly AfD tag. Remember that the guideline for administrators is that a two-thirds majority is normally required for deletion, although administrators may use judgement in ignoring things like "sockpuppet" votes. People regularly change their votes as articles improve.</dd>
<dd>In retrospect, it would have been better to concentrate on improving the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crutcher_e49f.html" title="Chris Crutcher">Chris Crutcher</a> article first, put individual book descriptions into that article, put redirects from the individual book titles, and only break out the individual titles when there were several paragraphs about the title.</dd>
<dd>As things are now, yes, you will have to endure seeing the ugly AfD label on the article for a few days. Tough it out. Concentrate on improving the article and resist the temptation to follow this discussion too closely.</dd>
<dd>I'm still not voting yet, but there's very little chance that the article will be deleted now. That's not to say the article is in good shape. The section on why the book is noteworthy is excessive but understandable. The entire article needs sources, sources, sources!

<li>Obvious keep in present state. Close to a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">perfect stub</a>. Well, more than a stub. To whomever wrote the previous section on why the book is notable: don't worry about its being chopped down. The bar for notability isn't really all <i>that</i> high, and <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> included all the important points concisely. On the removal of the long sections on characters and plot, it's probably better to start from scratch. My $0.02 is that we don't want a detailed plot summary, and we don't need anything but <b>short</b> descriptions of the <b>major</b> characters... and anything that's said should be backed up by source citations. Don't be afraid to add to or change the present article... see <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">the "be bold" policy</a>... and don't be upset if other people change your changes. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>P. S. Don't worry if you don't understand the reference apparatus, like the &lt;ref&gt; tags and the {{cite web}} template. Just put the reference in in any sensible way, other Wikipedians will be happy to do technical cleanup. For a web reference, just type the url within square brackets like this [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8] and it will come out like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. That's more than good enough. For a book reference, try to get in the author's name, year, title, ISBN number, <b>and page number.</b> Just do it any old way, others will get it properly formatted and into the references section. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not fun, you all are making this process disgusting. It is meant to be a fun experience where community can build, not tear down others works. just leave the page alone -- you haven't read the book and thus you don't know what it needs. Many people said KEEP our version and by the way Badlydrawnjeff keeps reverting so he too is in violation. Let the entry be, it is what young adults and adult readers need in terms of reference information! <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">Litclass</a> 18:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, notable enough book, but Litclass needs to understand that they have no "ownership" of the article. Anyone can, and will, edit it, and it's not grounds for reversion that the Litclass is "more qualified" to edit it. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 19:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Due to missteps on the part of Litclass the article was created prematurely and nominated for deletion, but under the pressure of AfD notability was shown, and the article is in no danger of deletion. The outcome of interactions with others, particularly BadlyDrawnJeff, have resulted in the cleanup of the article and its transformation into a good short article. The material Litclass assembled has obviously been used and drawn upon by others. Litclass has also raised my own awareness, and probably that of others, that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crutcher_e49f.html" title="Chris Crutcher">Chris Crutcher</a> is definitely notable and the article could use expansion. A pity that the process has not been as much fun as it could be and that revert warring is currently in progress. Material about the plot, characters, and themes would be appropriate but not in the form Litclass presented it, which was clearly in the nature of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<dd><b>Comment from Nominator</b>. I actually don't think anymore that this article deserves to be deleted. I'm sure it's easy to understand, however, why I nominated it in the first place. If you check the original page, you see that the article is a <i>clear</i> case of db-empty. It's a shame that the author wouldn't allow wiki-process to take place, but I guess it's somewhat understandable given her inexperience. Anyway, if nobody has any objections, I'll close this afd (I think I can close it as nomination withdrawn). Thank you all for your good feedback.

I am thankful to the handful that have had patience. We have been trying to do something that we would encourage educators and students alike to do -- contribute to Wikipedia. The real shame here is that <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threats.html" title="Threats">threats</a> and warnings are what is thought of as the first response instead of trying to let us participate with it and learn about it. I have gone to pages that some of our critics have contributed to, and am myself not overly impressed - so we ALL have room to grow. In 2 hours -- which is the amount of time that a majority of the entry was put together, we did a fantastic job that of course is open to editing. Cutting it down like badlydrawnjeff did, to nothing, and changing it so much that it lost important information about the book that a potential reader or anyone looking for a citation or reference would need was uncalled for. Huon's attitude has been so much more appropriate in dealing with this, and trying to make it a good page that others can use. Alphachimp has done nothing to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contribute.html" title="Contribute">contribute</a> to the viability of this page, yet in his own page he seeks to be an editor and someone with control at Wikipedia. Learning comes from teaching and doing, and while we have most def. learned a lot in this <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">process</a>, I wonder how much others who have been outright mean to us have learned about dealing with others. As much as you may think or try to be '<a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective.html" title="Objective">objective</a>' no encylopedia or other reference is truly objective --- any author brings a piece of herself or himself to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project.html" title="Project">project</a>. If you have nto read the book, read the book before lodging mean attacks that are meant to discourage us from participating in the Wikipedia community.
