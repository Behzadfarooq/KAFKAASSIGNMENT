<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_conservatives_942c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of conservatives">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">List of conservatives</span></h3>
<p>This list is not and has no potential to become encyclopedic. Conservatism is an exceptionally broad term which, in the Western world, encompasses a wide variety of doctrines, ideologies, and doctrines. In the United States alone it comprehends <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleoconservatism.html" title="Paleoconservatism">Paleoconservatism</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservatism.html" title="Neoconservatism">Neoconservatism</a>, and arguably <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a>. In a broader sense it can include any who <b>today</b> follows the doctrine of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">classical liberalism</a>, depending on your point of view and which country you live in. Even worse, people can be conservative in one way but "liberal" in another. Some are fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or vice versa. This list, in order to be comprehensive, must ignore all of these distinctines and lump every possible sort of conservative together.</p>
<p>I would ask of anyone who votes to keep what value this sort of general list has. For the most part it's unsourced, and might possibly qualify as original research. This isn't like a list of office-holders, which can be independently verified and which has obvious utility. It's a list of people that are deemed conservative in some manner, or deem themselves conservative. There is something strange about a list which includes together <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan_3245.html" title="Alfred Thayer Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>. They're conservative for different reasons in different contexts. This list takes no account of someone like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, who would seem "liberal" (in the American sense) in 1880 but would appear ultra-conservative today. In short, this list is unencyclopedic, subjective, unverifiable, and anachronistic, and I would argue that its very nature precludes rectifying these problems. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 00:26, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As Mmmbeer alluded, "incident response team" is a common phrase. For instance, a number of state DOTs have incident response teams that specialize in such clandestine and risky missions as clearing overturned tractor trailers. This current content reads like an amateur conspiracy theory, so I'm guessing it should go. Thing is, I can't figure out if "Incident response team" can actually be expanded far enough beyond "An incident response team is a team that responds to incidents" that it wouldn't be just a lengthy dicdef. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Cursory research (Google) lists (le Syndicat) as an individual, not a band. Could be similarly named artists. The individual goes by Le Syndicat or alternately Le Syndicat Electronique.

<p>And it's not only POV, it's inaccurate and misleading. Many quoted "allegations" can not even be traced to a source. For example, Google results for 'Bush and alleged overseeing of "bribery and coercion of individuals and governments"' yields 1 result - <b>this wikipedia page</b>. The charge of 'Alleged "Concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment;"' seems to have been copied verbatim from <a href="http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm</a>, but the source has no supporting evidence to back up this claim ... and it should also be noted that the author of the source web site in question is none other than Ramsey Clark, Saddam Hussien's and Slobadan Milosevich's lawyer, as well as a leader in the World Worker's Party - ie. not the most credible source, especially when he presents no supporting evidence to back up his claim that the US President actually was "Concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment"</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Persuasiveness comes with fewer exclamation points. Meanwhile, I'm puzzled by your harping on at the fact that Clark is/was Saddam's lawyer. I happen to think that people accused of war crimes (or of pedophilia, of embezzlement, or whatever) should be represented by good lawyers, and that a conscientious freelance lawyer is not besmirched by the crimes, etc., of his/her client even if that client is found guilty. Have I misunderstood US law?

<dd><b>Reply to Comment</b>: True Hoary - but if one examines Clark's activities over the past 20 years, then one notices a patern. He defends Slobadan Milosevich - then Saddam - before that he heads up the World Worker's Party - in short, he consistently befriends enemies of the United States of America. So then one must ask himself (or herself) "why?" Why would one take up common cause over and over again with enemies of not only the US, but enemies of freedom, human rights, and life itself (both Saddam and Milosevich were responsible for the genocide of hundreds of thousands of people) - so if he starts a "movement" to impeach the president, is that newsworthy or encyclopedic? and if so, is it encyclopedic enough to warrant its own entry, or is it just a footnote to an encyclopedic topic (ie. the President of the United States)? I've never seen any report on CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX or read any report in the NY Times, Washington Post or any other paper that leant any credibility to his "movement." There are all sorts of "movements" in the United States, and many of them are not encyclopedic - so why is this one? This falls more into the category of "silly actions of crackpots," and thus is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryfooter_c6e7.html" title="User:Larryfooter">Larryfooter</a> 16:05, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. A movement is "a series of organized activities working toward an objective", as, for example, the Civil Rights movement. Opinions and statements are not a movement. When people are massing in the streets clamoring for Bush's impeachment...that's the time for a "movement" article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You have a point, but I think you're defining "movement" rather too narrowly. There does seem to be some evidence that there really was a "vast" (well, pretty big) right-wing conspiracy out to get Clinton; you don't need massing in the streets when you've got Fox on the boob tube, AM blowhards, Murdoch journalism, rightwing Christian fundamentalists, etc.: I'd say there was a "movement", or at least the illusion thereof. There do seem to be organized activities working toward the objective of impeachment; I happen to think that impeachment is unlikely because of lingering distaste of the preceding one, but we'll see. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:35, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

If something actually comes up in Congress, then let's make an article, but until then its not encyclopedic.

<dd>The Congressional standard is explicitly higher than the wiki standard of notability. Since a subway station is "notable", and a radio station notable if it broadcasts "beyond a city", setting the bar at "impeachment charges introduced" is both high and, quite frankly circular. How are charges to be filed with the judiciary if there was no movement to provide political cover? The movement to Impeach Earl Warren never even got hearings, but was mentioned in the press and in books, and was clearly "notable", even if it went nowhere in Congress. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 05:06, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I say <b>keep</b> it. This page is a testament to the growing feeling in this country that the President lied to the citizens of this country to fight a war that was based on altogether different motives than the one(s) presented. The massive fraud and corruption that is tied to this military action is appalling, not to mention the absolute reconstructing of the government. For example, since when does the Senate forego consent and advise for an up/down vote? One is a Constitutional responsibility. The other should come after that responsibility is discharged. Yet consent and advise was compromised away. And what of the effort to do away with the Constitutional restrictions on terms served by the President? Thjat would be the 22nd Amendment. It was presented by Representative Hoyer with several co-sponsors.(www.thomas.loc.gov) Let alone the claims of Delay to make Republican rulership permanent.(You can Google this) The ravings of a madman?

<li>Very strong keep - Some of us started the impeachment process on January 20, 2001, when GWB falsely swore to uphold the constitution by illegally taking office after systematically stealing approximately 1.2 million votes. This is not a new movement, it is just one that has taken a long time to catch on due to corporate media protection of a man guilty of 39 crimes and misdemeanors, at last count. If we apply the same standards of evidence that he applied to the minority inmates he executed as governor of Texas, then we not only need to impeach him but should also execute him.

<li><b>Keep</b> Movement does exist and there are notable figures behind it (ie it's not just a fringe website). That the chances of success of such a movement are highly remote (unless the Democrats take both houses of Congress in the 2006 election) is not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - This is an <b>important</b> and <b>historic movement</b>. There are several campaigns (organized and otherwise) within the U.S. with the goal of impeaching George W. Bush. That the main-stream media refuses to report on these is neither surprising nor is it a confirmation of non-existence of such a movement. Let us not get side-tracked with bellicose detractors who wish to distract us with arguments such as no "official" stamps of approval exist to provide legitimacy to the movement or the precise meaning of the word "movement" or that we should include opinions on why the president should not be impeached, and other inane contentions. This is a movement involving citizens of the United States of America against a corrupt government that continues to erode the Bill of Rights and constitutionally provided rights and liberties. One only needs to look around to realize that the citizenry is disenfranchised and is demanding redress. Such redress, which is our constitutional right to seek, has thus far been denied by this out-of-control government on several occasions. This is a bipartisan movement and should be documented here in a prominent way as it unfolds. --Light Messenger 20:06, 2005 July 27 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This page is utterly ridiculous and shows an inability for certain liberals (I say "certain" because I myself am a liberal who thinks Mr. Bush is one of our nation's worst presidents in history) to write a reputable and neutral encyclopedia. The amount of keep votes here is shocking. A few people don't like the president, fine. A few people (rightfully so in my opinion) think he has stepped over a few lines with his policies, fine. But this article is just an excuse to grind an ax with the president and seriously undermines the integreity of the encyclopedia. The users who voted keep here need to think long and hard about what constitutes principled secondary source creation. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 17:05, July 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This article conforms to NPOV in that it is a list of documentable and notable individuals who have called for Bush to be impeached, and documentable and notable organizations (that at least clear the GNAA standard) which are actively involved in calling for his impeachment.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> There exists a movement to impeach President Bush. Are we to remain silent on it? The article is noteworthy and current. If it strays outside the line of NPOV occasionally it should be cleaned up, not deleted.

<li>""Strong Keep"" - Whether one agrees with the movement or not, the fact is that it exists. The article has been altered to remove any political commentary and simply enumerates the possible charges and the proponents of them. These are facts. If Wikipedia is to have any integrity at all, it can't delete true articles because someone objects to the politics behind the movement. Hundreds of thousands of signatures have been collected, Congressional inquiries are being conducted, and there is a special prosecutor investigating the Plame Case. It would be an egregious omission to ignore an ongoing political event. Morgaine Swann 12:27, July 29, 2005 <i>....added at 04:28 (and a few minutes later) 29 July 2005 by 66.82.9.62</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This would make a good link from the baseball article under "Also See." Frequently, information is easier to digest if it's broken into short pieces. This article could be a useful teaching aid for a little league coach and can easily be printed on 1 page in its current format. Someone obviously put some thought into it and as is stated above, it's not available elsewhere (e.g., under <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>. <a href="../../../-/a/s/User%7E-asx-.html" title="User:-asx-">-asx-</a> 05:40, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> IMO it's a handy list to have (otherwise I wouldn't have added to it). I've made a couple attempts to "fix" the article, to address some (arguable) inaccuracies with regard to baseball scoring.

<dd>So if I wrote an article titled X ways to play guitar, and put in the list such things as cutting off the strings and sawing the neck in two, you would find that relevant and useful? This is an encyclopedia we're writing here; we should not consciously include bogus information. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikreykja_795a.html" title="User talk:Vikreykja">→</a><i><a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikreykja_0ecb.html" title="User:Vikreykja">Vik&#160;Reykja</a></i> 03:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a poor analogy and is beside the point. "Bogus information" is a reason to fix not delete. Since baseball has certain rules that are famoulsly complex and difficult to understand (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Infield_fly.html" title="Infield fly">infield fly</a> anyone?) this type of article has heightened utility, even if it's difficult to find the right place for it. Maybe that place is not Wikipedia, but this is exactly the kind of thing that can (and probably does) appear as a sidebar in a baseball reference book. It qualifies as trivia in some sense, and therefore should not IMO redirect straight to the main article--a reader who wanted an information on such a specific sub-topic within baseball would probably not learn anything from the main article.William L.

<li>You could save everyone the trouble by not nominating reasonable stubs for deletion. By now it should be obvious that school articles automatically survive VfD. Pburka 17:13, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"By now it should be obvious that school articles automatically survive VfD." <b>Comment</b>. There obviously isn't any consensus with school articles - they must be dealt with case by case. So how is nominating a one-line stub article for deletion unreasonable? And no, I don't stick around VfD the whole day long like inclusionists. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 17:59, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll explain it, and you won't find it inexplicable. Creating one-line stubs <i>is</i> irresponsible, given that stubs give little or no information about the subject itself and is much more liable to be deleted. Especially when the creator clearly can improve on it, is just pure lazy, and would need a nudge or two to do so. Some stubs stick around like ugly ducklings for years without anyone capable of doing anything to it. Not that one doesn't want to, we can't because schools are inherently local-based. Creators start them then abandons them, going on to create hundreds and thousands of stubs and sub-stubs. I would call that irresponsible. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 17:59, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional comments</b>. Changed everything I wrote from "stub" to "substub". A stub is defined as 3 to 10 sentences in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a>. This (an original one-liner) doesn't even qualify. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 18:07, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li>"The location and name of a school district, the name of one of its schools, and the location of its website is perfectly adequate, giving as it does all the resources needed to expand the article." I find it very amusing indeed. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don't you think "falsely claim" and "this were true" is something of an oxymoron? How can I "falsely claim" something that were true? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:21, July 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please don't equivocate. Is it true or not that some stubs lie for years without anyone extending them? So how is this "claim" false? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:52, July 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not equivocating. On the contrary, I am clarifying, for you, the structure of the argument which you misread as an oxymoron. It is not oxymoronic. When someone says "Even if gas was free I'd still ride my bike" he or she is not denying the cost of gas, but expanding the argument to preclude debate about points that don't matter. In this case, Tony is saying that he doesn't believe your statement about stubs, but that particular disagreement has no bearing on his opinion in this vote, so convincing him about how long stubs lie around won't change his mind. I agree with Tony that the length of time a stub lies around is immaterial, so I don't really have an interest in researching your claim. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:12, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

I would call that "abandon". Of course Wikipedians have a responsibility towards what they write in the article; they are expected to provide accurate information and act in responsible manner without trolling etc. I agree with the word "rights", not the word "responsibilities".

<li>If I may, I would like to call for apologies for claiming 1) I propagate falsehood; and 2) that I take some vendetta deletions against inclusionists. I find such "inclusionist" attitude irksome to the utmost. Get a grip, this is my first school deletion article in more than half a year. I also find it repugnant that I'm classed as a deletionist just because I put an original one-liner on for deletion. For goodness sake, please don't bring in political alliances into Wikipedia.

<li>Please then post them somewhere where people know of them. At least one recently-made admin has been admonished, by school inclusionists, for a speedy delete. And then there's the "please don't bite newcomers rule". If there is <i>really</i> a change in Wikipedians' perception of school articles, why don't you simply solicit for a vote, then make it a <i>de jure</i> rule? School inclusionists have been known to sit around VfD waiting to snap, voting against any school articles, so I don't think it demonstrates that the community view at large has changed, rather, that "school inclusionists" simply made a more cohesive effort at obliterating school VfD. A <i>much better</i> idea will be to improve the standard of school articles.</li>

<li>As an outside party I should point out that <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> is <i>ideally</i> (not always) undertaken both under consensus by the voters <i>and</i> by an outside party, or failing that someone from that person's side of the camp. This was not the case here. Myself, I might have paraphrased some of these comments (rather than completely deleting), but it's not like they're any bloodier than the other harsh words school Vfds seem to collect. As it is this unfortunate altercation seems to have driven poor Tony away (he's systematically deleted his comments). In future I strongly advise that you ask a random (and uninvolved) admin, or post on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28assistance%29_e548.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)">Wikipedia:Village pump (assistance)</a> if you want a RPA carried out. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:31, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A well-written, one-line article on every school on the planet would be a worthy goal. Mandel, please don't take it so personally. It's normal on Wikipedia for determined power blocs to get their way. I daresay you'll live to see the day that deletionists once more delete all schools for no good reason.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> pending cruft reduction (read on), else <b>Merge</b> or <b>Categorise</b>. Please look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gwinnett_County_Public_Schools&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19491193" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gwinnett_County_Public_Schools&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19491193" rel="nofollow">this old revision</a>. THIS is what I want from the article. Yes. When a school has an article, add its name and a link to the list. If it doesn't, DON'T. A list of 100+ unlinked names is as pointless to the reader as listing the chapters in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>, as it tells me <i>nothing</i>. Either link them, or write a stub beneath each, <b>or remove them entirely</b>. I can almost feel the Schoolwatch spittle on my neck as I write this...&#160;:) ...but it's not like I said delete--but wait, I did, I said remove the lists of indiscriminate names. I'm all for including stubs of notable schools, and for merging non-notable ones into lists together, but listing school names does not strike me as very useful to the reader; as it is they could easily overlook that one lonely link way in the middle of the page and think the page was devoid of links. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:31, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't believe this could be done, either. Not on one page, anyway.

(<a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOpen_source_software_0cff.html" title="Category:Open source software">Category:Open source software</a>?). This would be much like <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a>'s suggestion above, except for using the category namespace instead of the main namespace.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li>You clearly didn't actually read the history of the Wiktionary article. The very first version of that article, with the prominent comment "Transwiki of page&#160;:en:Langer", is almost word-for-word identical to the Wikipedia article. That is, of course, because the Wiktionary article is the Wikipedia article transwikied, as that edit comment says. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:56, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment'</i> The above statement is completely false; I'm shocked and repelled to see that repeated falsehoods are being used here to defend the deletion of this article.

<li>The only falsehood here is that that hyperlink is to the first version of the Wiktionary article. Follow that link, and click on the "Older revision" hyperlink (that is right there at the top) several times, to find the <i>actual</i> first version of the article, which you will find to be, as I said, almost word-for-word identical to the Wikipedia one. I find it dismaying to see an editor pointing to the wrong version of the article, incorrectly labelling it as the first version when it is quite obviously (from reading the page or the article history) not, and then claiming to be "shocked and repelled" at supposed falsehoods on the parts of many other editors. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:21, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article history has been manipulated in order to include an earlier version than was previously present on Wiktionary. I am not impressed. That's very naughty, you know. Please do not repeat utterly false accusations in defence of your own patently false claims. Please avoid resort to subterfuges like this. I'd also like to point out that the current version of the Wiktionary article is clearly inadequate in function when compared to the Wikipedia article that a number of people are still, perversely, trying to delete from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:04, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only person who has manipulated <i>any</i> article history here has been <i>you</i>, as per the deletion log (given below) where you undeleted the article several times. No-one else has undeleted any article history, either on Wiktionary or Wikipedia. Yet again, you accuse everyone else of doing what in fact <i>only you</i> have been doing. Your campaign of accusations of "falsehoods", "naughtiness", and "subterfuge" on the part of other editors is beginning <i>itself</i> to resemble naughtiness, subterfuge, and disingenuousness; and smacks of assuming bad faith on the parts of all of the rest of us. It also insults the intelligence of everyone here, who can quite easily read the deletion logs and the article histories themselves and find that this article <i>was</i> transwikied, <i>was</i> deleted, and that the first version of the article on Wiktionary <i>is</i> almost word-for-word identical to the Wikipedia article that you undeleted here. Please stop asserting falsehoods that we can all easily look up in the logs and histories and find to be false (or indeed just follow the hyperlinks that you give and find to be false), and please stop accusing everyone else of doing various things that in fact only you yourself have actually done here.
<p>And if you can improve the Wiktionary article, do so. Please stop complaining that it's inadequate. Wiktionary is a wiki, too, and {{sofixit}} applies equally as much there as here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:22:42, 2005-07-25 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems like a good encyclopedia article. No good reason to delete has been given.

<ul>
<li>The closure as a speedy delete was quite proper. The article text that was improperly restored on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">07-22</a> had gone through VFD and had been deleted in 2004, and had not gone through VFU and gained a consensus to undelete. Even without CSD criterion A5 applying (which it does — I've double-checked that the author information was properly transferred.), CSD criterion G4 applies. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:21, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again you falsely represent the deletion of a transwiki'd article (the context is late last year) as "quite proper." Absolutely not. Repeating a false claim umpteen times won't make it true. You describe the restoration on July 22 as improper. False again. Why do you repeat these patent falsehoods? A5 could not possibly apply since the article was VfD'd some time ago and at the time the current version was created A5 did not exist. You then falsely invoke G4: "A substantially identical copy, by any title, of an article that was deleted according to the deletion policy". Since there was no deletion policy applying at the time and no VfD result for delete is on record, again you're piling falsehood upon falsehood, for reasons I find inexplicable. What, precisely, is it that offends you about this article? I'm utterly flummoxed. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:18, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just like the Wikipedia article history, the Wiktionary article history, and the deletion log, which all show what you assert to be the case to be false, the VFD discussion is <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Langer_0517.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Langer">right there</a>, too.
<p><i>Repeating a false claim umpteen times won't make it true.</i> — Indeed. So please stop doing so. We can all see, right there in the deletion log and the article history, your undeletion of the VFDed, transwikied, and (way back in in 2004) deleted version of the article, and we can all see that it is identical to the first version of the Wiktionary article. And we can all see that Wikipedia had a deletion policy in 2004, too, and that the statement that "there was no deletion policy applying at the time" is also false. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:33:00, 2005-07-25 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. as can be seen from the more recent deletions, increasingly indefensible reasons for deletion have been invoked to justify further wrongful speedy deletions after the article has been restored. It's been claimed that this is a "disguised personal attack" (it obviously isn't), the recreation of an article previously correctly deleted as a result of a VfD which it isn't). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:33, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The content was properly deleted, as per VFD consensus, all the way back in 2004. It was re-created and deleted several times since, as the log shows. It was <i>the undeletion</i> of it that was "improper" and "wrongful". That undeletion should have been done through <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Repeating a falsehood does not make it true. You simply repeat the false claim that the article was deleted as a result of a VfD. It was not. The VfD result was transwiki. The transwikied article bears no resemblance to the article we're discussing. This VfD discussion would be considerably more brief if I didn't have to continually correct you on simple matters of verifiable fact. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Once again: The first version of the transwikied article is almost word-for-word identical with the article that you undeleted. If you want to "continually correct" people "on simple matters of verifiable fact", please make sure that you actually have a leg to stand upon before you attempt to do so. In this case, it's pretty easy to verify that you're asserting falsehoods. The deletion log is right there for all to see, and shows the article being deleted several times, and you (and <i>only you</i>) undeleting it. The Wikipedia article history is there for all to see, and shows its deletion after VFD and transwiki (on or after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">12-06</a>), the various re-creations of the article from scratch beginning on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">02-02</a>, and your subsequent reversion on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">07-22</a> to the VFDed version from 2004 that you had undeleted 2 minutes earlier that same day.

<dd>Ok, I never meant to sound like that. True that you could put an article for every different type of slang out there and that’s not what WP is about. I was trying to put across the point that the term itself is more than just a dictionary entry or piece of slang in Cork. It a term that makes us distinct from other counties in Ireland. It’s a cultural entry about Cork people and how they use it. I think it deserves a bit more than a wikitionary entry as it has been used in songs and is the subject of many books, and these books are not just on slang. I never meant to sound like you gotta vote for us or whatever, I’ll accept the decision whatever it is, but isn't this the second time its up for debate? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarranc_8a3c.html" title="User:Darranc">Ablaze</a> 11:19, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First, I'm appalled that you should think that what makes Cork distinct from other counties is a slang term for penis... I wonder how many natives of Cork would agree with you. If it's true, then I'm glad that my roots are in Limerick.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, yes, it has been discussed before, and the vote was to transfer the article to Wiktionary as it wasn't suitable for Wikipedia. It was then recreated out of process, and an admin has insisted on recreating it despite near-universal consensus that it should have either stayed deleted or been put through the normal Requests for undeletion procedure. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:09, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is one of many things that is associated with cork. If you asked any Irish Person about the term Langer, what county would they think of? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarranc_8a3c.html" title="User:Darranc">Ablaze</a>
<dl>
<dd>That's not the point, though — a term might be associated particularly with one group without its being particularly significant, much less definitive of that group. I suspect that in the attempt to defend this article you're grossly exaggerating the significance of this one little bit of vulgarity. (And I have asked Irish friends and relatives, and none of them knew what I was talking about.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:32, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I’m not exaggerating the significance of the term at all. If you read the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langer.html" title="Langer">article</a> you will see that the term got country wide recognition last summer with the song. So much so, i found it strange that friends from Dublin and Mayo were using the phrase in a less harsh meaning, like we use it down in Cork. The word has meanings alright to be vulgar, but also used in every day between friends (as it says in the article). I'm just saying what i know is true. Your friends must of been on holidays last summer!&#160;:o) <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarranc_8a3c.html" title="User:Darranc">Ablaze</a> 13:45, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If I understand things correctly the sequence of events is thus. The page is put on VfD and the result is transwiki and delete. It is transwikied, and it is deleted. The page is undeleted, and this appears to be out of proccess, so it was deleted again as a recreation (ad nauseum). This second VfD was brought about to end the deletion war (although I suppose maybe a VFU should have been brought about). Therefore, in line with the original decision to delete, this is my vote. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 16:04, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speedy delete: Let me explain why, lest folks think that I'm just responding to the putative ambiguity of policy. The new material here is, IMO, not sufficient. There has been an attempt to make this into an article. I readily grant that. However, although the article <i>says</i> that the story of the word is complex, there are no complexities given. There's no philology at all. It's just "this word has many meanings." Well, duh. Most regional sexual slang does. There is a great deal of wheel spinning and smoke generating, but when you boil this down, all you get is, "It means X, Y, Z, and it's regional." I.e. it's still lexical and not philological. <i>Patruriunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:14, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: For the record, I think there is no ambiguity about the transwiki policy. After transwiki, an article is deleted. This is not spelled out, per our law gamers, because it isn't needed. One criterion for speedy delete has always been "duplicate material." If something exists on one of our projects, we speedy delete from the other project, where it doesn't belong. Thus, no need to say, "And after you transwiki it, you delete it." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I dont think its just regional. True that it did originate in Cork but since the song, the remix and the word of mouth around the country, For example, I was at Oxyegen a few weeks ago and the amount of people (not from cork) that i heard using the word was really suprising. The term has a grip on the whole country. I also dont think that you could compromise by adding info on the song etc as it doesn't belong in a Wiktionary.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarranc_8a3c.html" title="User:Darranc">Ablaze</a> 18:58, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: The song information would not belong in the Wiktionary. However, it does not make this non-lexical. Personally, I'd say, rather, that the effect of the song is null at this point, as it's quite a bit too early to determine if it has caused a real spread of the term or just a pop-culture reference that will fade in a few weeks. However, were we to assume that it <i>is</i> an important fact <i>and</i> one in need of explication (because it's confusing people), the Wiktionary will answer the meaning of the term, and the song, if it's really that popular and important, would be a fit subject for an article. Personally, I don't think so, though, and I think the song is, at this point, just extranneous. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:12, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You can pretty much sum up anybody and add "Big deal" on the end and give the illusion that they don't matter. Tony Sirico-- a criminal who happens to be on a TV show. Big deal.

You're disregarding the fact that TAS is signed to a major label and that this guy was involved in one of its members being arrested and tried for a felony-- and yes, THAT is a big deal.

<li><b>Comment</b> (written before reading DNicholls). The title implies that the article is about the construction of subjectivity in Schubert's music, whereas actually it is about Susan McClary's theories of subjectivity in his music. Therefore the title is misleading, and if the article survuives its Vfd the title <b>must</b> be changed in order not to deliberately mislead the reader. I disagree about notability, but would be happy to see the article merged into <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_McClary_fb71.html" title="Susan McClary">Susan McClary</a> as this is about her theories of Schubert but pretends to be about Schubert himself, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:32, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The <i>very first sentence</i> of the article is: "Constructions of Subjectivity in Schubert's Music" was originally a presentation...". Who, exactly, is this article going to mislead? People from Mars? Should I campaign to rename the article <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare_In_Love_6453.html" title="Shakespeare In Love">Shakespeare In Love</a> because it is really about the movie, but its title will mislead readers into believing it's about the Bard's love life? Your claim that the article "pretends to be about Schubert himself" is not supported by even the most cursory reading. Nearly every paragraph indicates that it is paraphrasing from McClary's article ("She begins..." "She then compares..." "Before closing her essay..." There's one paragraph that could probably use such a tag before it. This should have been fixed with a simple edit. A VfD is utterly and completely inappropriate here, and you should have known better. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:44, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I say, as I strive to keep my personal feelings out of it, finding as I do McClary to be one of the most shrill, offensive, and destructive voices in the world of contemporary musicology: but this essay is extremely notable in the field, indeed infamous. It may not have risen to quite the level of the "Recapitulation of the first movement of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony is a metaphorical act of rape!" controversy, but it's up there. At any rate, it's keep-worthy. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:36, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no boasting, just facts. If you actually haven't even checked the site, the numbers are plain to see. Doesn't matter how many hits or not this gets the fact is it has long surpassed many of its larger rival communities such as JediMindTrick which had much more hits which no longer even exists. By you defining this page as non-notable internet trivia you should try looking at some other wiki articles sometimes. July 25, 2005</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No more vaporware that Duke Nukem Forever, as mentioned by Idont Havaname. The game receives enough attention from the gaming media to be notable. WP is not a crystal ball, that's quite true, but there's enough attention being given to this game <i>now</i> that it doesn't have to be in order to rate an article. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 19:09, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

No less notable than other vaporware such as <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>. It'd be one thing if there was nothing ever shown on this or hardly any information, but that's not the case. The article contains no speculation, but rather official information released from the developers/publishers. Does not qualify for crystal ball. Please read that section better. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 20:33, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is constantly in the PC gaming news, then reliable, verifiable, independent PC gaming news sources should be cited in the article. <b>Currently they are not.</b> I might be inclined to change my vote below if someone provides evidence, <b>other than their own assertions,</b> that this game is in fact getting attention in the gaming media. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:18, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> (vote changed, see below)</s> as advertising <b>unless</b> someone provides good source citations showing that the game is in fact receiving wide attention in PC gaming circles. In any case the article should not discuss the game as if it existed and its characteristics were known. If we are to have an article about it at all, it should discuss it as notable vaporware and represent the game characteristics as speculative. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. This is <b>not</b> the 2012 Olympic games or an undiscovered chemical element with predictable characteristics or the next transit of Venus.

<li>Here are the three latest entries I got when searching "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." at BluesNews: <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=postmessage&amp;boardid=1&amp;id=0&amp;threadid=58784" class="external text" title="http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=postmessage&amp;boardid=1&amp;id=0&amp;threadid=58784" rel="nofollow">July 23, 2005</a>, <a href="http://bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=58377" class="external text" title="http://bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=58377" rel="nofollow">July 08, 2005</a> and <a href="http://bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=57052" class="external text" title="http://bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=57052" rel="nofollow">May 18, 2005</a>. It should also be noted that the term "vaporware" is both degarotaty and <i>speculative</i>, and therefore unecyclopedic. Factually games are only "released", "in development" or "chancelled". As user K1Bond007 noted, "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball" policy does not ably to this article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Merciful_d0f7.html" title="User:The Merciful">The Merciful</a> 11:14, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've added some more ext links to the article, as well as a section about its status (or not) as vaporware and a paragraph near the top with information about its AI that its developers released earlier this year. Also worth noting is that out of the 2 million + results Google gives for "Stalker", the game's site is first, and the image results shown on the web search both appear to be screenshots from that game. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:20, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good enough, <b>Keep</b> in present form and hope for improvement. There are places where the article needs to cite sources instead of simply weaseling: "The game is expected to have a non-linear storyline and feature gameplay elements such as trading and two-way communication with NPCs. The game is described as including some role-playing and economic elements." Expected by whom? Why? What's the authority for this information? Until recently you could have said "the next release of Windows is expected to include the WinFX file system" because Microsoft's glossy marketing blurbs said it would, but that appears to have been an empty promise and putting them in an article would have amounted to accepting Microsoft marketing's point of view. NPOV requires the adoption of at least certain degree of skepticism regarding companies' claims about futures. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:54, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, currently one of the most anticipated video games in the industry. Even if it is <i>never</i> released (which is a possibility), it attracted a larger share of attention than a lot of games that were actually released.

<p>This is an overly broad list, which leads to significant incompleteness in each subcategory. Many more narrowly defined lists of Catholics exist - see <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a>. Should be deleted as a list of loosely associated topics, or made a redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a> or some other such article. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 17:58, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The list should be modified, but I'm not for deletion. As I said on the Talk page- it's about definition. Catholics are people once baptized in the Catholic Church who have not explicitely "crossed over" into some other faith. They may have become atheists or indifferent, but- this doesnt matter. Btw- was Luther a "Lutheran"&#160;? Or Marx a "marxist"&#160;? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 18:15, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Use category instead. It's a controversial issue anyway, as a lot of people are Roman Catholic but aren't practicing. Even <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> is allegedly, theoretically one, but he obviously doesn't practice. Not to mention the category is potentially huge, and would probably have to be broken up into "American Catholics," etc. -<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">newkai</a> | <a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewkai_0287.html" title="User talk:Newkai">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newkai_916c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newkai">contribs</a> 18:22, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Personally, I think any excuse to delete this list will be attempted! Why is that I wonder? It's not a "controversial" issue either. I have no problems with lists of Methodists and Baptists, Jews and Muslims. But if anyone dares to make a comprehensive list of Catholics the world's is somehow threatened!? I'm all for breaking up the list so that some of the bigger sub-sections can be their own pages.

We can create an article for any subcategory on this list that does not already have one, but many subcategories already have their own article (so we are duplicating effort here). <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 18:40, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seems redundant with the cateogry and all, and open to anyone throwing their name in the list, particularly as, unlike some other lists, no one is famous just for being a Catholic. I think the same goes for other religion lists.

<li><b>Delete</b> this and also the categories, all of which are completely absurd. There are more than one billion catholics in the world, and that does not even include dead people. A large proportion of biography articles would have to be linked there and also be put into those categories.

(rms125a@hotmail.com) Addendum to previous message: I think that it would be best to simply place a moratorium on any new additions or edits to the "List of Roman Catholics", so that a division by category can be arranged. I did not realize that space would be such an issue for Wikipedia--as a near-computer illiterate, I thought cyberspace was unlimited, but I see there is a problem, so as of 12:01 A.M. (7/25/05), a MORATORIUM should be installed prohibiting any new additions, deletions, edits, etc., only permitting viewing. Thanks for your attention!! Robert Sieger (rms125a@hotmail.com)</p>

<li>A moratorium is not necessary.

<dd>If I may give Mr. Sieger a piece of advice, I wouldn't recommend using Wikipedia as a "back up" or a personal storehouse for information (in fact the comments above nearly made me vote delete based upon the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">no original research</a> rule based upon the impression I got). Anything posted here can be deleted, altered, vandalized, or what have you at any time, and Wikipedia itself has a habit of becoming inaccessible with annoying regularity. If there is any research or information in any article that you've created that you really don't want to lose, I suggest making a back-up of it to either your hard drive or a printed hardcopy ASAP. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Having read the "delete answers", I've came to a unanimous (hehheh..) conclusion: the list <b>must be kept</b>. Arguments for deletion go something like this: <i>yeah, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html" title="List of Buddhists">List of Buddhists</a>, .., too.</i>. It won't happen. These list will not be deleted. So- <b>either all or not a single one</b>. Since the former option is out of question- the RCC list must stay (albet radically modified in not a few features). Since I was the one who has been, initially, the most suspicious about the RCC list, I can ask with some authority: why is this list here at all&#160;? <b>Not accompanied by other fellow lists</b>&#160;?

<li>I'm having difficulty figuring out what encyclopedic purpose the list serves. Is it so that someone writing an article on the Church could use it as a source for "oh, and X, Y, &amp; Z are famous Catholics"? Aside from that (which could easily be handled through the category) I don't see a purpose for it.

<p>To all concerned--I did put Bobby Fischer in as a misfit by mistake because I forgot that the issue was the religion (and he is not Catholic, although he IS a MISFIT) of the individual not the character; also I realized my mistake with Krasniqi and deleted it, but it was on my mind and I am planning to email the Attorney General and whoever else I can think of regarding this Florin Krasniqi who has been an arms trafficker for the past DECADE and it is not a secret that he wants to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its remaining Serbs; this so bothered me that I posted him, but then realized that he is a Muslim and deleted it.

<dd>I think it is fairly obvious that this list will not be deleted. <b>But</b>- the point is how to arrange it&#160;? I guess it cannot stay in this form, so, to avoid possible "mammothing", it would be good to break it into a few lists. Just- I don't see how. If a division would be along national lines (Spanish, US, Dutch,..), it just creates more confusion. If it's vocational/professional (writers, scientists, politicians,..)- the naming is problematic (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a> was an author who was, techically, a Catholic. But, he was not a "Catholic author".). I'd say the list has to be divided.

<li><b>Keep and break</b>. It's obviously not unmaintainable, as people have been maintaining it—it's hard to patrol for vandals and self-promoters, yes, but the alternative seems POV-ish. If there are lists of Lutherans, Jews, Muslims, and others, and the Catholic list is deleted, it seems as if Catholicism is the "default" religion here, and the other lists are deviations from it. While I have an opinion on this, I don't think it ought to be asserted as fact.&#160;:.) Breaking it up will ease patrolling the pages.

<li>I understand your article -- but instead of nonesense it now is the classic argument over school deletionism or keepinimism <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 22:45, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Granted. I am in most cases a mergist, but on primary and secondary schools I am a deletionist, absent something quite unusual, i don't think such schools are notable enough to warrent inclusion. No one ever said this was patent nonsense, or at least I never did. The annon user says "content is low" but what notable coneten could there <b>ever</b> be for such an article? <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 22:58, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I said it was nonesense, it was just a dead media link and no context. Nothing is notable in the normal encyclopedic sense, but argument I follow is NPOV information makes it worthwhile.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm wondering why Wikipedia keeps a special category for software mascots if you cannot insert a software mascot in it. What about deleting the two entries about non-existent, non-significant, ugly Microsoft mascots (which are to be considered as easter-eggs more than mascots)? If you want so, I will move the article about the mascot in the Kat page (if you don't delete it), but I think that you have to rethink the policies ruling that category. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcappuccio_2ea2.html" title="User:Rcappuccio">Rcappuccio</a> 13:29, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This project has been dead for over a year and the project home page has been shut down. Notability was somewhat arguable before, but at this point it appears that Kat will likely be a historical footnote in the development of Strigi. Additionally the article was written by the author of the software, which is a no-no in the first place. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott.wheeler_fe46.html" title="User:Scott.wheeler">Scott.wheeler</a> 12:46, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to clarify, I'd argue that it's border-line on notability and I'd say the same with Strigi. i.e. the nomination wasn't because it's dead, but because I think it's below the threshold for notability and being dead isn't going to become more notable. Strigi will likely at some point be notable, but it would be a bit odd for me to suggest the creation of another article that also wouldn't meet the notability requirements to merge Kat into. &#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott.wheeler_fe46.html" title="User:Scott.wheeler">Scott.wheeler</a> 21:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, first, the claim that Darwin is the geratest scientist of all time is dubious, to put it mildly. Secondly, even if he were, that's not a good enough reason to include articles on matters unrelated to his science (even if his desperate detractors try to insinuate that it's related). Thirdly, there are articles on <i>everything' in the peer-reviewd literature (for various reasons, into which this isn't the place to go). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>I appreciate duncharris's assistance with me in regards to Wikipedia technical matters. I also appreciate his comment about me acting in good faith and behaving in a civil manner. I would like to say that I enjoy doing historical/medical/psychology research. This is why I found the Darwin illness issue interesting.</p>
<p>Now I don't think there can be an denying that I based my material solely on the medical and history of Darwin (vis a vis quotes of Darwin which I gave in full context). I also used the reported scientific consensus vis a vis Britain's prestigious Academy of science the Royal Society. Personally, I find JAMA, British Medical Journal, Royal Society, American Journal of Medicine, and Dr. Colp to be excellent sources and very informative. I also quoted the saltationist (punctuated equilbrium) Richard Milner. I also gave excellent sources regarding the etiology of panic disorder vis a vis studies. So far, nobody has said why my research exactly was errant.</p>
<p><br />
Below is some of my medical sources categorized by the source they came from:</p>
<p><b>Darwin's sickness as reported in The American Journal of Medicine</b></p>
<p>According to the article "The Illness of Charles Darwin" by William B. Bean in the September 1978 publication of the American Journal of Medicine rarely did a day go by where Darwin did not have in "many degrees of severity and many combinations" the following medical symptoms: nausea, severe vomiting, flatulence, alimentary canal pain, various forms of eruption of the skin, and nervous exhaustion.</p>
<p>Dr. Bean also noted the following symptoms obtained from a Darwin letter:</p>
<p>"My nervous system began to be so affected so that my hands trembled and my head was often swimming".</p>
<p>Dr. Bean quotes from another Darwin letter the following symptoms:</p>
<p>"involuntary twitching of the muscle...fainting feeling - black spots before the eyes."</p>
<p>Dr. Bean wrote in his article that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a> suffered from <b>"psychoneurosis provoked and exaggerated by his evolutionary ideas".</b> Dr. Bean also wrote that his Darwin's wife, Emma, greatly disapproved of his evolutionist ideas and "This, facismile of public reaction, must have kept lively his anxiety and torment."</p>
<p>Lastly, some have claimed that Darwin got Chagas disease in South America. Dr. Bean dismisses the diagnosis of Chagras disease for Darwin's illness which has been attributed for Darwin's illness and due to the following reasons: no other member of the Beagle crew had symptoms of Chagras disease, "infection with T cruzi occurs not from a bite but contamination of a bite with excreta" and Darwin had "numerous partial exacerbations and remissions that would be unusual in the case of Chagras disease".</p>
<p><br />
<b>Psychic Causation And a Royal Society Article</b></p>
<p>The Royal Society is the independent scientific academy of the UK. It should be noted that in the abstract for the January 1997 article, Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, D. A. B. Young, "Darwin's illness and systemic lupus erythematosus" (for the full article see: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11618781&amp;dopt=Citation" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11618781&amp;dopt=Citation" rel="nofollow">Notes Rec R Soc Lond. 1997 Jan;51(1):77-86</a>) it states that today the psychogenic view of Darwin's sickness "holds the field" . Also, the abstract stated that D. A. B. Young noted subsequent to AW Woodruff's work showing that Darwin did not likely have chagas disease, the chagas view finds little support. <b>Even the leading proponent of Chagas disease, Dr. Saul Adler, stated that Darwin may have suffered both from chagas diseas and from "an innate or acquired neurosis" (see subsequent discussion of Chagas disease).</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Darwin's sickness as reported in Journal of the American Medical Association</b></p>
<p>In the article "Charles Darwin and Panic Disorder" by Thomas J. Barloon, MD and Russel Noyes, Jr. MD published in the January 8, 1997 Journal of the American Medical Association the following maladies of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a> which by in large were not mentioned above were given and they occured as sudden and discrete attacks: "palpitations, shortness of breathe ("air fatigues" ), light headedness ("head swimming" ), trembling, crying, dying sensations, abdominal distress, and depersonalization ("treading on air and vision"). These attacks were many and Darwin in a letter wrote that "Constant attacks....makes life and intolerable bother and stops all work". Dr. Barloon and Dr. Noye conclude that Darwin's medical symptoms point to panic disorder and agoraphobia. One of the reasons given for a psychiatric diagnosis was that "variable intensity of symptoms and chronic, prolonged course without physical deterioration also indicate that his illness was psychiatric."</p>
<p>However, Ralph Colp Jr. MD, a physician and psychiatrist, who studied the matter Darwin's sickness for 18 years and authored the book "To Be an Invalid: The Illness of Charles Darwin" and is definitely one of leading experts of Darwin's sickness, if not the leading expert, due to his medical and psychological training and exhaustive research doesn't believe in the above diagnosis of agoraphobia (Dr. Bean cited above describes Dr. Colp's book in the following manner, "His painstaking work in seeking out every possible source comes close to yielding the complete biography of an invalid's illnness") .</p>
<p>In a letter to the editor published in the April 23/30 1997 edition of JAMA entitled Ralph Colp Jr. MD, noted that "It has been observed that when Darwin "was a member of the Council of the Royal Society in 1855-1856, he attended meetings on 16 occassions," and that he away from home about 2000 days" between 1842 and his death in 1882." Dr. Colp stated that the above behavior shows that Darwin was merely balancing work and leisure and the diagnosis of agoraphobia does not fit diagnosis of agoraphobia for Darwin.</p>
<p>Dr. Colp also noted that "it is possible" that Darwin gastrointestinal symptoms were caused contracting Chagras disease. Dr. Colp states regarding the possible Chagas disease, "The disorder was first active and then became inactive, permanently injuring the parasympathetic nerves of his stomach and making it more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation and hence more sensitive to the "psychosomatic impact of his anxieties." An organic impairment best explains the lifelong chronicity of many of his abdominal complaints"</p>
<p>Dr. Colp concludes his letter by saying:</p>
<p>"<b>In summary, I believe that Darwin's illness consisted of panic disorder (without agoraphobia), psychosomatic skin disorder, and possibly Chagras disease of the stomach." It should be noted earlier Dr. Colp noted that Darwin had facial eczema that often was caused by controversies over his evolutionist ideas. Dr. Colp also wrote that as far as he can determine "skin afflictions are not among the many somatic complaints that comprise panic disorder".</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Darwin's sickness and the British Medical Journal</b></p>
<p>Dr. A. W. Woodruff, a British expert on tropical tropical diseases dismissed the chagas hypothesis for Darwin's illness.</p>
<p>I cite the following paper from Carolyn Douglas at Purdue University entitled <a href="http://omni.cc.purdue.edu/~sbenning/el102c/Darwin.html" class="external text" title="http://omni.cc.purdue.edu/~sbenning/el102c/Darwin.html" rel="nofollow">"Changing Theories of Darwin's Illness":</a></p>
<p>"Dr. A. W. Woodruff, a British expert on tropical diseases, questioned Adler's diagnosis. He pointed out that many of Darwin's symptoms (heart palpitations, undue fatigue, and trembling fingers) appeared before Darwin sailed on the Beagle, and that when they recurred after his return, they were associated not with physical strain (as would have been expected with Chagas's disease) <b>but with "mental stress."</b> He also pointed out that no other member of the Beagle crew suffered from Chagas's symptoms, and he questioned the accuracy of Professor Adler's statistics about the high rate of infection with Chagas's disease in the province of Mendoza, where Darwin was attacked by the "black bug" (745- 50). Woodruff's diagnosis of Darwin's illness was "an anxiety state with obsessive features and psychosomatic manifestations" (749). After reading Woodruff's article, Professor Adler continued to believe in the theory of Chagas's disease, but he pointed out the possibility that Darwin suffered both from it and from "an innate or acquired neurosis" (Journal 1250). The "black bug" theory therefore lies in limbo, and even its chief proponent did not argue that it excluded psychological causation of some of Darwin's symptoms." For those who are interested in further investigation here are some a journal articles: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2109737&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2109737&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">Woodruff AW, Darwin's illness, Israel Journal of Medical Sciences 1990 Mar;26(3):163-4</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=14248443&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=14248443&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">Woodruff, A.W. 'Darwin's health in relation to his voyage to South America', British 'Medical Journal, 1, 747-8, 1965</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Darwin and the diagnosis of panic disorder and agoraphobia</b></p>
<p><b>According to Barloon and Noyes as a young man, Darwin had "episodes of abdominal distress, especially in stressful situations". In addition, Barloon and Noyes stated that like many people with panic disorder, he had a "premorbid vulnerability" which in his youth was referred to as "sensitivity to stress of criticism in his youth."</b> According to the American Psychology Association, panic disorder usually appears in the teens or in early adulthoood and there does seem to be association with potentially stressful life transitions. It should be also noted that panic disorder has been noticed in clinical setting that the histories of panic disorder patients often include some type of separation from a person who is emotionally important to them. This may be significant as Darwin's mother died at the age of eight and he then boarded at Shrewsbury Grammar School. On the other hand, it has been said that Darwin had a happy childhood overall and was encouraged by his siblings. Bowlby noted that separation anxiety may help cause the develpment panic disorder in adulthood. Psychoanalyst Dr. Rankine Good and Edward J. Rempf described Darwin's father as tyrannical and it will be subsequently discussed as to why this description of Darwin's father was given. This may be important because Bowlby suggested, due to clinical observation, that agoraphobic patients frequently describe parents as dominant, controlling, critical, frightening, rejecting, or overprotective (However, not every element of his observations were subsequently confirmed in studies). Several authors found that parents of agoraphobic and panic patients often provided less emotional warmth and tend to be more rejecting.</p>
<p>Also, in regards to the cause of panic disorder it is currently thought to be psychobiological in origin. For example, historically panic disorder was often triggered in war time. It is well known that Darwin was not the aggressive/assertive type and that Huxley was "Darwin's bulldog". This may related to a study by Chambless and Mason saying that regardless of gender, the less masculine in trait a person afflicted with panic disorder is, the more likely they are to use avoidance (social withdrawal) as a coping mechanism . Individuals who have a more masculine traits often turn to external coping strategies (for example, alcohol). Dr. Bean wrote that while Darwin had great confidence, at the same time he was: neurotic, became nervous when his routine was altered, and was upset by a holiday, trip, or unexpected visitor. Barloon and Noyes cite Darwin remarking "we [Darwin and his Emma] have up all parties, for they agree with neither of us".</p>
<p>It is important to note that one of the reasons given by authors Barloon and Noye for their diagnosis panic disorder and agoraphobia was that "variable intensity of symptoms and chronic, prolonged course without physical deterioration also indicate that his illness was psychiatric." However, Ralph Colp Jr., an American <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">physician</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatrist.html" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>, who studied the matter of Darwin's sickness for 18 years and authored the book <i>To Be an Invalid: The Illness of Charles Darwin</i> doesn't believe in a diagnosis of agoraphobia, because, despite that fact that Darwin loathed meetings, when Darwin was a member of the Council of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> from 1855-1856, he dutifuly attended meetings on 16 occasions, and was away from home about 2,000 days between 1842 and his death in 1882. At the same time, Barloon and Noyes state that only infrequently did Darwin leave home and usually accompanied by his wife. Barloon and Noyes then cite a letter declining a invitation and Darwin saying "I have long found it impossible to visit anywhere; the novelty and excitement would annhilate me". Perhaps, the best solution to Colp and Barloon and Noyes differing analysis is that Darwin merely became less socially active. However, perhaps Darwin's possible social withdrawal was due to his sickness being physically debilitating.</p>

<dd>The thanks and hard work are to be welcomed. I appreciate that a lot has gone into pulling together sources for interesting aspects of Darwin's illness, however a lot of hard work is needed to strip this down to a concise and clear encyclopaedic article. The Psychic causation section needs to be drastically pruned, and given that the chagas disease diagnosis was an earlier theory, could perhaps be moved further back. Also, while references are good they break the flow of the argument and reduce clarity, so linking to footnote references would be a good change.

<p>Some anonymous editor put this up for speedy deletion and while I don't think it fits that criteria I am not sure it is notable. I looked at the ubernet site and everything and I can't tell whether this article is self-promotion or what. In any case it is not notable as it is just a small community of audio-likers. It's not nearly as as well known as hydrogenaudio.org or the like and I fail to see any reason why it's encyclopedic. Ubernet which is a redirect page to this should also suffer the same outcome as this article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 22:18, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, I put the article up, it could certainly use some fleshing out. Their website is not that infomative, but my friend tells me that the network is fairly large. I beleive one of the requirements to join is to rip a certain number of cds according to their specifications. I find the idea interesting, and would hope that people that know more could add to the article, but I shall let the community decide if it belongs here.

<li>Ubernet is smaller than most direct connect hubs and the only thing it has going for it is that people don't know much about it. Which, seems to be against what is encyclopedic. I mean, the only source is their site and what users or people who have heard from users would have to say. Which seems a little odd because it can't be more than hearsay at that point. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 17:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - every non-fiction book can be controversial to <i>somebody</i> for reasons of morality, religion, politics, what have you. Not to mention that many people use the term "controversial" to say, in effect, "I do not like this and you should not either". Otherwise the page should include the reason <i>who</i> considers the stated book controversial and <i>why</i>. The reason that scientists debate about the merits of some book does not necessarily make it controversial. Now the page labels certain books controversial (including Copernicus' <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Revolutionibus_Orbium_Coelestium_66ff.html" title="De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium">De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium</a>, displaying clear POV - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 10:37, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The list is poorly defined, but it is interesting. Most of the older books clearly belong on the list because they were important to a paradigm shift of some sort. The problem is with the newer books, anything written in the last half century at least should have it's place on the list justified in some way. For example, Michael Moore's books are more inflammatory than controversial, and shouldn't normally make the list. However, if you add a sentence under the books name such as "This book was dropped by HarperCollins post 9/11 and was only printed after a letter writing campaign by librarians who accused the publisher of censorship", the entry becomes at the same time justified and more informative to the reader. This would be easy to do for most of the books that truly belong on the list, and at the very least this strategy should be tried before the list is deleted. --AAMiller 12:59, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the least bad option. Redirecting to <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a> seems to imply that they are equal and will lead to ridicule by mathematicians, and deleting confuses people that type 3.14 and want to find information on pi. The convention that numbers in titles refer to dates holds only for integers (see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a>). -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 15:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Best is it if we are not ridiculed by mathematician <i>and</i> we are able to help users less than skilled in maths. I think we achieve this if we keep the article with a text like "3.14 is often used as an approximation for <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a>". -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 21:21, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But it someone types "3.14" in search, they're probably looking for information on <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a>.
