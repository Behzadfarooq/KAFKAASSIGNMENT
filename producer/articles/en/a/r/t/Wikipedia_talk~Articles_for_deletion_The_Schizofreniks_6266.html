Is it my previous experince that you feel is unnecasary or I I need a seperate page for that? I feel our compnay deserves to be here as an information available for people to learn from.

<p>Yes I know I'm Niki. I agree with your conflict terms as I didn't know this to begin with. I didn't mean to come on here and write stuff about myself but I wanted to really give some background to The Schizofreniks. Just delete the page if it's not right.

<p>I can't quite understand that if my page I have written has so many criteria it does not meet, why it isn't put under speedy or proposed deletion? In reading the articles written about 'Articles for deletion' process that would indicate this piece may be able to be reworded so that it isn't deleted. Why didn't it just get deleted quick if it's so bad or is it normal practise to 'put down' the topics that are put forward if they do not conform to your criteria? Thanks ps. Is there any constructive advice from any one at all on this matter as this is a genuine question? (RecordLabel)</p>

<p>Do you have anything at all to say??? Your put downs are getting very boring. In fact I read some of your conversations with other people and you don't seem a very popular person. Quite arrogant and a bit of a jobsworth aren't we?? I came on here to contribute and you have done nothing but make biting remarks which are against wikipedia policy aren't they. You seem well versed in this so you should know. RecordLabel 17:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC) Ps. I enjoyed your articles about many obscure and relatively unknown people.</p>
<p>I have also deicded to withdraw my contribution and have made what I feel are appropriate edits. When the wikipedia people get around to reading this can you make a note that Irishguy is a complete A******e. You have some of my work( 7 pieces in fact) which must be considered notable. I am no longer interested in contributing due t the nature of this user's attacks at my work. I currently work with many leading black music artists in the UK but this user has put me completely off contributing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by RecordLabel (<a href="../../../r/e/c/User_talk%7ERecordLabel_32d5.html" title="User talk:RecordLabel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RecordLabel_786f.html" title="Special:Contributions/RecordLabel">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I will take it you have nothing to say constructive. You have also put my page on slow deletion so that you can relish in aggrovating me by directly putting down my work with biting comments. And you have at all levels avoided my questions for you to be helpful. Your page says it been vandalized 112 times. Why is that I wonder??? You must be someone great in here by bullying people. That's a very notable achievement. Hahaha Irishguy has made notable contributions. RecordLabel 17:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't avoided your questions. I asked which 7 songs you refered to which you claimed would illustrate notability. You refuse to name them. Claims of notability must be sourced with verfiable references. Simply claiming that you are responsible for 7 notable songs without actually naming those songs...well, that just isn't enough. Anyone can make a claim. As for my user page being vandalized, if you look at who did the vandalizing, they were all known vandals and not contributing editors who suddenly decided to vandalize my page. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 18:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate you returning my comments and not jumping in only to add fuel to the fire which obviously isn't the case now as your acting in good faith. I was tempted to alter your work but I thought to myself very quikly that this isn't right because you have made a lot of effort learning about wikipedia and what is acceptable. You mentioned multiple cases of vandalizism but I'm wondering what? You must always assume other editors are acting on 'good faith'. Wikipedia does have a policy of conflict of interest however it doesn't completely outlaw it. They even describe what you must try to avoid when you are writing about yourself which suggests in some cases it must be ok. I resent the comment 'Upstart' as I have worked very hard at what I do and put every minute of every day into my career of music. I used the term that I have done business with each pop stars because it was easier than getting into the fact that I had written published songs with most of them and the others I had rented out a studio which I was managing when a director of a company. Which means I was at the top of the chain so I can claim credit for all of those.RecordLabel 18:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have found something that might help to prove notability under the company one. These are 2 links which show evidence of multiple media features of the company.</p>

<p>The first is from The London Paper website which is a net version of a story that was printed by a paper which went out to millions of Londoners. This is the story that first stirred up trouble about Sony banning us.</p>
<p>The second is in wikipedia which is what lead me here and although the article needs citations it is in fact an acurate article and still publicises us from what I consider another trusted source. Please give my your views on how these might help our company have notability. I would appreciate your polite critisicms of these. Thanks RecordLabel 20:31, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The London Paper reference is a good start. The problem is, you aren't the primary subject. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leona_Lewis_a8ac.html" title="Leona Lewis">Leona Lewis</a> is.

<p>On the conflicts issue there's not a lot I can do about that now because you learn things the hard way so I can't really comment on that other that yes I'm guilty of it BUT I have still tried my best to just give basic facts without being biased. I know they will probably delete but I know this now and I don't blame you Irish for pointing that out because you are right about this, I cannot deny that. I still want to learn what makes a good article though in regards to the actual info. RecordLabel 20:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've had a look at the music notability list and my argument would be that The Schizofreniks are not listed as a musician or anything under that notability section but as a 'company' of which the press coverage may swing the notability issue. I do however make references to members of the team including myself but I have given valid references to people that I have worked with and I could give you the links to some of my work on here. I'm only mentioned on The Schizofreniks article though because of my company duties which means we should still be subject to the company notabilty factors only. Can you give me your views on this to please Irish?? RecordLabel 20:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right, I've had a look and I propose this:</p>
<p>Our music company The Schizofreniks has been subject to the same media coverage sources on the music notability section. As an individual I can also add some additional notability background as a composer:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelle_Bryan" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelle_Bryan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelle_Bryan</a> Solo 1999 Two Hearts (Higher Than Heaven B-Side)</p>
<p>This was one of 2 tracks co-written with Kelle and also co-produced by myself. It was released as a B-side and charted at no.14 in 1999. It was under Mercury records. This is metioned in name at the trusted source of Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeyz" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeyz" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeyz</a> • 1999 "Why?" (Burger King promo single) • 2000 "More Than One Night" Featuring Lemar (Harmony track) These again are 2 tracks co-written by myself for The honeyz and one was featured on an album which never made the shops and the other was released as a burgerking promo single. The artwork for this is also on thier page on the trusted source of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I also have the original versions on my previous work page on our site and even have the original master tapes in my cupboard for verification.</p>
<p>2 of these tracks have been heard by numerous people through major company release.</p>
<p>Will this cover the Music notabilty sectionas a composer and also as music press coverage which is current and also names our company?? Would this help or do the sources leave questions? Please give me your polite critisicms. RecordLabel 21:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just read your earlier statement that Wikipedia cannot be referenced as a source so I'm hoping that whoever put together the info for the past projects I mentioned had a good source because I only have audio proof and the actual recordings at my home. RecordLabel 21:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem is that as a record label we are never the primary subject. Although our release is, which in fact is a reflection on our company. Under the company notability our products come under the same rule of media coverage. As a record label our products are ultimately what define us and the label is merely a stamp we put on it. Is this a valid argument?RecordLabel 21:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
