<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:31, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Solicitation is never a good idea. Besides, though I am not Atheist, I can simply look up a bunch of Atheist people in Wikipedia and solicit them to vote to delete this article. Wiggins behaves the exact same way as you do, and the edits on that account are mostly only about this article and other articles related to Jason Gastrich. Pretty blatant, eh? I would have already filed a RfC, but the paperwork is too tedious. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 06:54, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The accusations that <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> is a diploma mill are being debated. However, if you read the talk page for the entry, you will see that the university clearly doesn't meet the criteria for a diploma mill (e.g. it has a campus and on-campus students/teachers/courses, founded in 1973, has 1100+ students, has lenghty degree and writing requirements, requires lengthy dissertations and theses, etc.). The only criteria it does fulfill is that it's unaccredited, but many Christian institutions elect to avoid governmental accreditation and there is no evidence that LBU tried for it and didn't get it. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 18:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, in the US the government does not accredit schools; private organizations do that. Thankfully. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those aren't the criteria for a diploma mill. A diploma mill confers "earned" degrees for nonexistent <i>or grossly deficient</i> accademic work. Lack of accreditation creates a strong presumption that a school is a mill, and I've seen nothing from you to rebut that. You misrepresent the nature of accreditation: there is no "governmental accreditation", only private agencies recognized as legit by the government, one of which is explicitly Christian (and agencies <i>not</i> recognized, like the one that "accredits" LBU). <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 20:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With all due respect, you haven't read what I wrote and what others have written. I took the 10 well-recognized criteria and showed that LBU only met 1.5/10. I also wrote above things that are opposite a diploma mill's standards. Plus, I've given my personal experience regarding the numbers of years it has taken to earn my degrees from LBU. I wrote much (or all) of this at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. So, with all due respect, if you close your eyes, you can see nothing quite clearly. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 22:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As a matter of fact, I have read it. There's no 1.5 about it. Claiming bogus accreditation isn't half a criteria, it's the whole thing. And as was already pointed out to you, the two are the <i>main point</i>. You've ignored that in favor of the false precision of repeating 1.5, when it's not a matter of numbers but rigor. Likewise, it can take as long as a real degree but without academic rigor it's still a diploma mill. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 00:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LBU doesn't "claim bogus accreditation." No, it isn't the whole thing. If it was, the list would be absurd and invalid. Furthermore, who is to say that it's the main point?

<li>RoyBoy already pointed out the idiocy of Gastrich's claims about LBU and his "score" with respect to a list that he picked (out of many that could have been picked). RoyBoy was quite right to point out that the it was not an all-or-nothing proposition with respect to the list, but Gastrich just can't seem to get it. Draw your own conclusions. LBU does not teach research skills, investigatory skills, nor critical thinking skills. It has exceptionally lax standards, in practice and is sub-standard as an educational institution. Gastrich's own alleged "rebuttal" to the <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible_bd5a.html" title="Skeptic's Annotated Bible">Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a> is actually a good example, since it served as the basis for his "Master of Arts" from the school and, according to Gastrich, also served as the basis for his "doctorate." I'll be looking over the alleged "thesis" and "dissertation" when I'm in that part of the country, come April, but if what I have seen thus far is any indication, given Gastrich's rather superficial thinking skills and almost non-existent research skills, demonstrated thus far, I don't expect to be surprised. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 07:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The accusations that <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> is a diploma mill are being debated. However, if you read the talk page for the entry, you will see that the university clearly doesn't meet the criteria for a diploma mill (e.g. it has a campus and on-campus students/teachers/courses, founded in 1973, has 1100+ students, has lenghty degree and writing requirements, requires lengthy dissertations and theses, etc.). The only criteria it does fulfill is that it's unaccredited, but many Christian institutions elect to avoid governmental accreditation and there is no evidence that LBU tried for it and didn't get it. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 18:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, in the US the government does not accredit schools; private organizations do that. Thankfully. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those aren't the criteria for a diploma mill. A diploma mill confers "earned" degrees for nonexistent <i>or grossly deficient</i> accademic work. Lack of accreditation creates a strong presumption that a school is a mill, and I've seen nothing from you to rebut that. You misrepresent the nature of accreditation: there is no "governmental accreditation", only private agencies recognized as legit by the government, one of which is explicitly Christian (and agencies <i>not</i> recognized, like the one that "accredits" LBU). <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 20:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With all due respect, you haven't read what I wrote and what others have written. I took the 10 well-recognized criteria and showed that LBU only met 1.5/10. I also wrote above things that are opposite a diploma mill's standards. Plus, I've given my personal experience regarding the numbers of years it has taken to earn my degrees from LBU. I wrote much (or all) of this at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>].

<dd>As a matter of fact, I have read it. There's no 1.5 about it. Claiming bogus accreditation isn't half a criteria, it's the whole thing. And as was already pointed out to you, the two are the <i>main point</i>. You've ignored that in favor of the false precision of repeating 1.5, when it's not a matter of numbers but rigor. Likewise, it can take as long as a real degree but without academic rigor it's still a diploma mill. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 00:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LBU doesn't "claim bogus accreditation." No, it isn't the whole thing. If it was, the list would be absurd and invalid. Furthermore, who is to say that it's the main point?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The accusations that <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a> is a diploma mill are being debated. However, if you read the talk page for the entry, you will see that the university clearly doesn't meet the criteria for a diploma mill (e.g. it has a campus and on-campus students/teachers/courses, founded in 1973, has 1100+ students, has lenghty degree and writing requirements, requires lengthy dissertations and theses, etc.). The only criteria it does fulfill is that it's unaccredited, but many Christian institutions elect to avoid governmental accreditation and there is no evidence that LBU tried for it and didn't get it. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 18:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, in the US the government does not accredit schools; private organizations do that. Thankfully. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those aren't the criteria for a diploma mill. A diploma mill confers "earned" degrees for nonexistent <i>or grossly deficient</i> accademic work. Lack of accreditation creates a strong presumption that a school is a mill, and I've seen nothing from you to rebut that. You misrepresent the nature of accreditation: there is no "governmental accreditation", only private agencies recognized as legit by the government, one of which is explicitly Christian (and agencies <i>not</i> recognized, like the one that "accredits" LBU). <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 20:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With all due respect, you haven't read what I wrote and what others have written. I took the 10 well-recognized criteria and showed that LBU only met 1.5/10. I also wrote above things that are opposite a diploma mill's standards. Plus, I've given my personal experience regarding the numbers of years it has taken to earn my degrees from LBU. I wrote much (or all) of this at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#An_administrator_says.2C_it.27s_.22a_weasle_term.22" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>].

<dd>As a matter of fact, I have read it. There's no 1.5 about it. Claiming bogus accreditation isn't half a criteria, it's the whole thing. And as was already pointed out to you, the two are the <i>main point</i>. You've ignored that in favor of the false precision of repeating 1.5, when it's not a matter of numbers but rigor. Likewise, it can take as long as a real degree but without academic rigor it's still a diploma mill. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 00:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LBU doesn't "claim bogus accreditation." No, it isn't the whole thing. If it was, the list would be absurd and invalid. Furthermore, who is to say that it's the main point?

<li>RoyBoy already pointed out the idiocy of Gastrich's claims about LBU and his "score" with respect to a list that he picked (out of many that could have been picked). RoyBoy was quite right to point out that the it was not an all-or-nothing proposition with respect to the list, but Gastrich just can't seem to get it. Draw your own conclusions. LBU does not teach research skills, investigatory skills, nor critical thinking skills. It has exceptionally lax standards, in practice and is sub-standard as an educational institution. Gastrich's own alleged "rebuttal" to the <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible_bd5a.html" title="Skeptic's Annotated Bible">Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a> is actually a good example, since it served as the basis for his "Master of Arts" from the school and, according to Gastrich, also served as the basis for his "doctorate." I'll be looking over the alleged "thesis" and "dissertation" when I'm in that part of the country, come April, but if what I have seen thus far is any indication, given Gastrich's rather superficial thinking skills and almost non-existent research skills, demonstrated thus far, I don't expect to be surprised. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 07:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I find two things interesting about Gastrich's use of "WWJD.'" The first is that Gastrich has been asked this many times with respect to things that he writes or his own acts, and the reference above is the only direct response that I've ever seen. The second is that it's also interesting that, in light of his actions, he's been asked that a couple of times, hasn't answered, and now copy-cats the question to someone else. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 06:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>All I've seen from Levicoff is someone posting an alleged quote of his on Usenet. While on his "sabbatical" job hunt, Horn is supposed to be getting his book from the library. Maybe he can scan a page that mentions LBU. If he could, then we'd <b>finally have one somewhat reputable source calling LBU a diploma mill.</b> Until that time, we have zero. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 06:14, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This borders on paranoia "<i>unbelievers also edit there and they actively try to silence Christian input and revert our contributions</i>". First, I suspect that not all people voting to "<i>revert Christian input</i>" are "<i>unbelievers</i>". I challenge Jason Gastrich to offer evidence for a single case of "<i>Christian input</i>", that is both notable and NPOV, being successfully reverted by unbelievers. I have only seen non-notable edits and POV edits from Christians being reverted. This is not a conspiracy since we all know that the "<i>unbleievers</i>" who post POV and non notable contributions are also reverted.

<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion.

These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> I got this email to. And I'm here because of it. But I can make up my own mind about these things. I'm insulted by the implication that just because I was led here by this email, someone I can't distinguish or discern. I CAN. I won't vote automatically to keep these articles but I'm really questioning the objectivity of both sides here. Equating a campaining email like this with vote stacking, ballot box stuffing, etc. does not follow. He's simply fishing for support and there is not a damn thing wrong with that. Now, I'm not saying that the author is not biased or that he does not have a POV. Its obvious he does and its obvious what it is. But CLEARLY, many of the people who are voting to delete here HAVE a POV and it is EQUALLY OBVIOUS. The question for me is, can we verify this article, is the list a useful research tool, and can it be made to confirm to the NPOV requirements of the wiki. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 16:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>there's obviously a lot of emotion on both sides and for me, that's a red flag for bias and personal involvement. Maybe both sides need to take a step back from the computer screen and evaluate their positions and statements on this. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 16:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can't have it both ways though. When the "Wiki4Christ" or whatever club goes out and solicits votes it's "campaigning". But if I were to go out and solicit votes for deletion I would get accused by Jason Gastrich and others of being some sort of evil atheist censorship cabal. I find the hypocrisy in this AfD alarming. And if you'll look below you'll see that meat puppetry is starting to have some success ... look at those various keep votes from users with hardly any edits. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 23:18, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see campaining for the delete side as a bad thing either. And I'm seeing a lot of hypocrisy on both sides. You know, both sides are adopting a "holier than the other guy" the "other side is evil" stance. Can't you see it?

<li>I've noticed no actions taken by the so-called deletionist 'side' that compare with vote-stacking, meatpuppetry, personal attacks, and above all, the attempt to divide Wikipedia into martyred Christians and the atheist <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_Is_No_Cabal_17da.html" title="There Is No Cabal">cabal</a>. There is absolutely nothing wrong with nominating an article for deletion that doesn't actually contravene policy in good faith, as some people are trying to make out; that is what AfD is for, so editors can nominate articles they think aren't acceptable and leave it to others to decide. Making a fuss just because something is nominated, almost before people have even begun to vote, shows either a) lack of knowledge of the deletion process or b) lack of confidence in the ability of the article to survive outside scrutiny. I know the only thing worse than making sides is picking one, but really, there is no need to try to be even-handed just for the sake of it here. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 16:48, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The fact is, you couldn't. Most aren't notable at all, and most (like 99%) notable Baptists have nothing to do with the place. As for LBU being a starting point for the history of baptist thinking, I'm insulted. I mean that seriously. You think <i>that's</i> all we've managed to come up with?</p>

<dd>I think fundamentalists are weird and really misguided but I really think that you're overreacting. The university is not a diploma mill. I get advertistments from diploma mills and this one isn't of the same genre. It is simply non-accredited and their is precedent for institutions avoiding government accreditation because of the restrictions that come with that. Now would I hire a graduate from this school? no. but that doesn't mean the school isn't notable. If it has thousands of graduates and it graduates go on to publish stuff, its notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the rest of the people on the page, clearly most of them probably don't deserve to be on the page and really the page should me merged with something else -- not enough content. But I think the data deserves to be here regardless of how questionable the tactics of the author are and I really think that those of you pushing so hard to remove this data are as biased as the author of the articles. You are just biased in another way. The problem here is your particular bias carries with it the aura of objectivity (cause your defending accreditation and all the other "holy above holy" academic stuff) but its not. Its bias pure and simple.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>nothing is lost by leaving a portion of this data here (merging). Just note the university is not state accredited (and any other qualifiers you want to add) and let the readers decide for themselves. Its ridiculous to try and purge the wiktionary of all this stuff. Fact is, fundamentalism is a big deal in the US and it should be represented in this WIKI.</dd>

<dd>oh, and I <b>abstain</b> from voting. I hope that gives at least one person severe chestpains tonight.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 04:25, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was thinking to as I lay in bed, being non-accredited is irrelevant here. If we really want to judge this university fairly, we should call a few other baptist type universities and ask them what they think of this university. This way we can assess the school using a rubric that includes the relevant constituency. Of course, I don't think that doing this make the university respectible. I'd expect to find a lot of bias in such an institution and I wouldn't be inserting it into any mainstream flows. But at least we would honor the constituency which the institution purports to represent and not engage argumentation which, to many baptists, must appear quite insulting.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I've said enough. what am I doing typing this late on a saturday night when I have better things to do???!?!?

<li>Comment: How can you justify putting something that is still under discussion and something that hasn't gone beyond the status of "suspected" at the top of the page?

<dd>You're absolutely right. It was all done to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 00:45, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "warning" template {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-newbies_e41c.html" title="Template:Afd-newbies">afd-newbies</a>}} is used to resist the power of campaigning. While you, Jason, refuse to admit that you were "campaigning," you released obvious implicit statements that you wish the readers of your "copy and paste" comments to "vote" to keep the article. The boilerplate template, if seen by the target of your "campaigning," might be persuaded to abstain from voting. It is a fair tactic against the party using campaigning without soliciting votes ourselves. Likewise, if we ever decide to solicit votes (we never will), the message will undermine our campaign as well. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 05:38, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you read AfD a bit, you'll see that template is very frequently used in situations where lots of new users or non-frequenters of AfD show up. Such people often are a little unclear on what AfD is all about, and the template and others like it are used to clarify the rules about sockpuppets, that AfD contributions aren't really votes, etc. It's not some piece of trickery cooked up to deny Gastrich a win, it's just a standard tool in the arsenal of an AfD. There's no conspiracy at work here. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 21:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The final tally was 42 delete, 18 keep, 11 merge. I discounted 8 votes (7K/1D) for being either from newbies or not having real reasons (e.g., "it exists" -- my big toe exists but it doesn't deserve an article). Even if I had kept them, we'd have 43–25, or 63% delete. Also note that most merge votes were "merge or delete." This really should be a merge IMHO, which should satisfy the inclusionist bloc who don't want to see the content deleted. Really, we're talking 44Kb for a list of people? The vote stacking also really disturbs me. I noticed that a number of the people in the inclusionist bloc all voted on the same AfD discussions, all right in a row, which strongly implies they were here only because of their wikiphilosophy (still, I didn't discount their votes). <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 18:32, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</div>
