<ul>
<li>My mistake, it was BriBrick that removed the nomination to delete. As we can see from this user's above comments, he/she does have some sort of connection to the WMFO radio station. <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Cfrydj, I challenge you to dispute the objectivity of the Fire It Up page. It is written in third person and is linked to multiple other wikipedia sources. The page could be expanded upon by numerous editors in the listening region. The show has been written about in "The Tufts Daily," "The Stonehill Summit," and has been associated with multiple sporting events involving actual Division II and III university athletic teams. The Fire It Up page is not some cryptic babble, and it certainly IS noteable. Erroneous on both counts.Fireitup 21:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not disputing the objectivity of the Fire It Up page. I am disputing its notability. It also contains no reliable sources. I am not sure what makes you say that it is "linked to multiple other wikipedia sources". The article does contain links to other Wikipedia articles, but no other Wikipedia articles contain links to it. I am afraid a campus radio station that has been written about by campus newspapers does not qualify as notable.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So throughout the lengthy history of Wikipedia, whenever articles didn't have links to them, does that mean they were automatically not notable? I am sure it takes time to build such links. If a college newspaper isn't notable, then why are there wikis for college newspapers? Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein</a> is an entry for a gentleman who has affiliation with WMFO, as you asked, as well as college newspapers. In accordance with the notability clause you cite, this page would be deleted as well. And I'm sure a great many other pages would be. Taking edits "by the book" would devoid wikipedia of a resounding amount of valuable information. I simply ask that my entry be spared from what seems to be an argument so editors CAN link to it. Fireitup 21:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At no point have I said that this article should be deleted because of a lack of links to it. I was only refuting your above claim that it was notable because of nonexistent links. Mr. Silverstein is an award-winning columnist. The fact that he gives commentary on "The Ari G Show" does nothing for the notability of either the "Dante and The Brick" or "Fire It Up with The Spinners" shows.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sir, while suggesting the Fire It Up page should be deleted, you used the statement "but no other Wikipedia articles contain links to it," therefore you used the argument that the article should be deleted based on a lack of links. Also, if you intend to use Mr. Silverstein's notability as an award-winng columnist as a a juxtaposition to the Fire It Up page, it should be noted that the award he received does not have a wikipedia page. Thus, his merit as an "award-winning columnist" is moot.Fireitup 21:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid that you are missing the point entirely. In each successive comment, all I have been doing is showing how your arguments in favour of the notability of the article are irrelevant. The only reason I added the Fire It Up page was because of its lack of notability. I only mentioned the lack of links to the article in response to your claim that those links existed. Check the order of the comments, and you will see that this is the case. I also only refered to Mr. Silverstein in response to your claim that his connection with WMFO somehow gave the article on the Fire It Up radio show some notability, which is not the case. I hope that the misunderstandings are settled now. <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I respectuflly reply that I have only been trying to engage you in a bttle of logic. See, my refutations have only surfaced to refute your refutations. Let's put it this way: I feel you are wasting your time trying to delete the Fire It Up article. It would not have been deleted had this discussion not occured. I am going to try to edit the article to match it to the specifications upon which you insist. In the meantime I would appreciate that you remove the nomination for deletion. Thank you, 71.233.255.131 22:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC) <b>Only edits are to this page. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 18:46, 14 September 2006 (UTC)"""</b>
<ul>
<li>That decision is up to the Wikipedia community now, to be decided by consensus. So far, anybody not personally connected to either of the two radio shows has voted for it to be deleted. I'm not sure how you will edit the article to make the radio show have some notability, I'm curious to see the end result.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 22:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, when you think of it, the editor of the Fire It Up page and the editor of the Dante and the Brick page have no personal connection through edits to each other's pages, thus each page has one vote for undeletion. The opposition consists of you and two Holy Cross students, who clearly have a bias against Boston College, Tufts University, Stonehill College, the Dante and the Brick show, blegs, Joe Mauer, all of it. That's just the way it works here. That is clearly unfair. Thus we stand even, one vote to one, in terms of unbiased voters.Fireitup 22:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What you have also failed to take into consideration are the notability of the guests which appear on Dante and The Brick each and every week. Prof. Chow from Tufts University is an award-winning computer scientist, his work has appeared on Oreilly.net as well as published in various industry periodicals. Mohammad Jahed Dirkalurka is an innovative thinker, who would call out anyone trying to destroy this page as a devil. Bitch Slap Guy is a man of brains and braun, after Katie Couric is done at CBS, it will be him bringing you the news. And needless to say, The Olse &amp; Harry Carey, longtime friends who enjoy each others company as well as each others humor. The Olse is a drunk Irishman, and Harry has been dead for 8 years, but both contribute to this fine show, whose Wikipedia page you are going to delete. And why is that, because you didn't get the job at the mall as the security guard with the big ugly sombrero, so you did the next best thing, make yourself God of wikipedia, where you can control what is notable. F Wikipedia, Dante and The Brick and Fire It Up will Live Forever!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I disassociate myself from the racial profiling displayed in the last article, but do note the scientific achievements of one Mr. Chow. He is a notable fellow, a man of letters, a man of foresight.Fireitup 22:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Mr. Chow is a man of foresight, and with that being said, he wants to ask, have you ever done it in the butt?</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Local radio shows are not necessarily notable, and this one certainly isn't. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 22:52, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are right, local shows are not notable until they become syndicated and POOP all over your radios, just like Dante and The Brick as well as Fire It Up will be doing very soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you think about it, the world is a better place today, not because these pages will soon be deleted, but because many more people are now aware of WMFO "The MoFO", and will undoubtedly be tuning into both of these fine programs to hear what kind of shananigans happen then.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Do Not Delete</b> I feel people are making a mistake, such as the "My Alt Account" gentleman, by not addressing each show proposed for deletion separately. We do not now if he finds Fire It Up or Dante and the Brick to be the non-notable show. I do agree with the later commenter who believes this discussion is spreading the gospel of WMFO, just as a wiki page for Marlboro cigarettes informs people about cigarettes. Thus these pages must be notable.Fireitup 23:02, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would suggest <b>not deleting</b> these pages. I think if they were properly re-worked, they would be useful to wikipedia users. This looks to me like an argument over semantics and number of google hits. I think a well-written article on an actual subject, such as a radio show, should stand on its own. It exists over the broadcast airwaves, for sure. And personally, I like to listen to Fire It Up.</dd>

<dd>This is not a matter of semantics, but of notability requirements for <i>an encyclopedia</i>. There are many, many programs on the airways that are not sufficiently notable to have encyclopedia articles. Google hits are one way of rating notability. There are others-- no evidence for the subject meeting those criteria has been provided in "keep" arguments. Perhaps the creator of the article can turn his talents to constructively editing other articles. The deletion of this article will not in any way stop you from listening to Fire It UP. Cheers and happy editing. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 18:29, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't have any other talent except the talent of great radio. Needless to say, I won't be editing any wikipedia entries for fear that six or seven random people jump down my throat about content and notability.Fireitup 22:14, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This may be my first response or comment posted on wikipedia, but I was searching through for shows on WMFO on wiki and I came across Dante and the Brick and the Fire it Up programs. I respect what Dante and the Brick do, I believe they are a fresh face to the usual stale talk/music that is WMFO weekdays. As for the Fire it Up program, they talk some damn good sports regarding the Boston area. These guys have talent and people should catch on to the popularity. Check out their website at fireitup.bravehost.com, you'll see that their show is significant and has a following. There, that's my concerns, if you have a problem with that, then stop being a friggin policeman of the internet and get a life. Go worry about something else.JHA30 06:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To answer each objection to this page in turn: 1. It is not an advertisement. Neither WMFO nor the personalities in question will in any way profit from the inclusion of this article in Wikipedia. 2. The information is verifiable. The WMFO website notes the show and time slot and information about the shows exist in student publications which are archived. The show's prior episode may be reviewed at the station website. 3. The entry is notable. The show originally in question, Dante and the Brick, and the show incorporated by the "geek patrol", Fire it Up, are or were broadcast over a large geographic area with at least the potential to reach a large number of listeners. Both can be listened to from around the world through itunes and the WMFO website. It is uncontested that WMFO is notable, therefore the flagship shows carried should be considered notable as well. 4. The show is "encyclopedia notable". This phrase must be read as applicable to Wikipedia rather than less inclusive encyclopedias. This article provides only verifiable facts regarding a single unambiguous subject. It provides a definition of a radio program that is useful to anyone searching for this information. 5. It is not a "vanity" post. Neither personality's proper name is given and the actual broadcast likely reaches a significant number of listeners regardless of this entry. 6. There is little possibility of misdirecting a reader. There is no competing 'Dante and the Brick' entry and users searching for "Dante" or "The Brick" will realize it is not the information they sought upon cursory examination of the article if not at the search screen. Finally the consequences of deletion far outweigh the consequences of allowing the information to remain. The availability of information about this program is notable and useful to listeners, potential listeners, and any other information seeker. Dante and the Brick offers a unique type of talk radio in its market and Fire It Up offers a unique perspective on boston sports. The Boston talk and sports radio markets are both significant and crowded. The low probability of misdirection shows that there is virtually no consequence to allowing the entry to remain. For these reasons this post should not be deleted. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> JourneyRocks - 23:31, 17 September 2006 UTC: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></p>

<li>Hi. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> does not apply to talk page comments. No insult is indended, but this is <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">a process to determine community consensus</a>. Although we hope new editors become part of the community, most newcomers who start in these discussions turn out to be <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single-purpose accounts</a>. We still listen carefully to the arguments and evidence provided by new users, but the closing admin may weight community members more heavily than temporary visitors. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 16:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A couple questions...so first, a community member's (EDITOR'S) input is considered "more heavily" than regular users of the website? So apparently those who visit wikipedia daily but don't bother to edit pages aren't important. That is a major insult to the user base. I don't have figures, but I'd venture that less than 1% of wikipedia visitors actually edit pages. Therefore, if someone is so passionate about the inclusion of an entry that they create said "single-purpose" account, just so they can join in a debate, it means nothing? That's a slap in the face of the user base. Let this be said, those of you who have entered this dialogue, coming up with cryptic phraseology in bold face type to dismiss community statements seriously lack a funny bone. Why not engage in a lighthearted, spirited debate about these articles? Because it's a waste of time for these "editor" types. Fine, whatever, I give up, you can delete to your heart's content. But seriously, grab a sense of humor or SOMETHING or you will never, ever get laid.24.147.151.4 02:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi. The readers are of course important; they are why we do this. But there are many concerns to be balanced, and until you've spent some time here, they aren't all obvious. We generally welcome contributions from single-purpose accounts (and many, many people with no accounts at all). It's just that in AfDs we find that special-purpose accounts generally have a purpose other than building a good encyclopedia. Sorry if we seem cryptic or stuffy here, but with about 1000 AfDs a week on Wikipedia, the responses that seem novel and entertaining to you are regrettably familiar to us. If you spend some time working on articles where you don't have a strong personal interest you'll discover that there's plenty of fun being had.
