<li><b>Keep</b>, of course. Easy for me to say that, since I wrote it. In this article, I was merely trying to describe a phenomenon: the fact that the term "North Slavic" is used for three different phenomena - the grouping of East and West Slavic together under the header "North Slavic" (you don't believe me? Google for it), the fact that there are scientists who believe a North Slavic branch does exist, or has existed (I'll look for sources), and a group of conlangs based on that last premise. As for the conlangs: I agree that the languages mentioned there are not notable enough to warrant articles on their own (viz. wikipedia.pl, which has individual articles about no less than six of them!). We've had many discussions already about merging articles like that into one, and in this case I simply decided to do that in advance. While the languages mentioned may not be notable enough on their own, they certainly are as a group. That has nothing to do with "wikipedia being a vehicle for their promotion". BTW, the languages in question are all <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">artlangs</a>, so there's really nothing to promote here. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 08:55, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am very well aware of that tradition. I am also very well aware of the fact that notability is by no means a commonly accepted criterion. But like I said, I do personally believe that it should be a factor. And therefore, I have explicitly <b>not</b> created articles about individual languages, nor do I intend to. But as a conlang subgroup, ánd as a scientific phenomenon (albeit a slightly marginal one) it most certainly has a certain amount a notability. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 10:04, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am terribly sorry but the traditions on nl: differ greatly from en: .

<li><b>Keep</b> - The term North Slavic is definitely used sometimes to combine West and East Slavic (as opposed to South Slavic).

<p>I am surprized why people keep ignoring that the main issue with wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I am not at all against fringe theories here, but the more obscure subject is covered, the better it must be referenced.</p>
<p>We have plenty of trolls here to invent nations and languages. For example not long time ago <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Ruthenian_language_05f8.html" title="Black Ruthenian language">Black Ruthenian language</a> was created several times. (and BTW the waves of this hoax are still on net; e.g. at a website that sells cars: <a href="http://www.carluvers.com/cars/Black_Ruthenian_language" class="external text" title="http://www.carluvers.com/cars/Black_Ruthenian_language" rel="nofollow">Black_Ruthenian_language</a>). I suggest you to take a look at it and see that this one was written with love and care, much better that the article we are discussing.</p>
<p>Threfore rather than poking at my ignorance you better provide solid references. I tried to search web, but the traces of the term (in non-toy usage) were very weak to convince me in its notability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:03, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am surprized that, when searching the web, you didn't find <a href="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art208e.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art208e.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art066e.pdf" rel="nofollow">this publication</a> by prof. Kortlandt, who does use the term North Slavic. Kortlandt can hardly be viewed as a marginal reference. The former reference was on the first google page when I searched for "North Slavic". <a href="../../../x/y/b/User%7EXyboi_c5a6.html" title="User:Xyboi">Xyboi</a> 20:17, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, Kortlandt is one of the sources I had in mind. And here's another reference (regarding the use of "North Slavic" vs. for "East ánd West Slavic" vs. "South Slavic"):</dd>
<dd><b>Bernard Comrie &amp; Greville G. Corbett, <i>The Slavonic languages</i></b> (London, 1993), p. 75, pp. 115-119 and several other places in the same book. An authoritative source, if I may say so.</dd>
<dd>The existence of the North Slavic constructed languages is obvious enough and needs not to be proven here. If the many references on the web are not good enough for you, the article written by Prof. Tilman Berger definitely should be!</dd>
<dd>As for the alledged North Slavic background of the Novgorod dialect: I know there are sources for that too, but I can't recall them offhand now. I'll look into that.</dd>
<dd>Satisfied now? Instead of displaying such a condescending attitude, you might as well have asked these questions <b>before</b> issuing a VFD against the article. I'm not exactly a newbie in wikiland, but let me tell you this: if this is the way potentially prolific new wikipedians are normally dealt with after they write their first or second article, there's a huge chance you'll lose them forever! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 20:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My "condescending attitude" is in my nomination: "insufficiently notable linguistic exercise. Wikipedia is not a vehicle of its popularization" and related to toy-languages. It is a modern development, played on web. Still, miserable visibility hence notability. The actual linguistic discussion is secondary importance here. If this article survives, it must be renamed into Constructed North Slavic languages. If there was a serious theory about "real" N-Slavic langs, it must be presented under <b>this</b> title, with proper references, for verification. Kortlan's use of the term proves nothing; for all I saw, it is just a matter of convenience. In any case, this if way far from mainstream. As for my attitude, we live in real world. There are muggers and killers and trolls, and me. As you see, nothing terrible happened. Your opinion prevailed. No need to panic. I am not going to fight tooth and claw. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:21, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, Mikkalai, I'm not trying to popularise anything; I notice a certain phenomenon and I try to describe it, that's all. If you don't care for "toy-languages", that's fine. So leave people alone who do. As far as I am concerned, constructed languages are an art form just like any other art form.</dd>
<dd>Next: first you claim nothing of what's written can be proven and ask for references, then you get your references, and next you say that "the actual linguistic discussion is of secondary importance". Now, have I missed something?</dd>
<dd>About renaming the article: no. North Slavic languages are an existing phenomenon, whether you like it or not. And there are two different meanings for it, both given in the article, plus the constructed languages that are based on the premise of one of those. I see no reason for splitting it in two (or three) until the size of the article would demand it. And FYI: Kortlandt is one of the best-esteemed authorities in the field.</dd>

<dd>"And at last": the sentence read "... trolls and <b>me</b>", i.e., I was putting myself in this list not you, hinting that you must deal with these phenomena without panic.

<dd>Sorry, I haven't said a word about your ignorance. But to be very honest, I am <b>very</b> unpleasantly surprised about the unfriendly tone of this discussion. Anyway, <i>schwamm drüber</i>. How do you want those references placed in the article? References to the very existence of a phenomenon surely shouldn't be placed in the "external links" section? Frankly, instead of complaining, I don't understand why you don't place those footnotes yourself, if you care so much for them.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I voted keep above already. I'd like to inject some cites, but it's hard to know where to fit them in this flamewar. However: this article could use a little fixup, yes. North Slavic is somewhat tenuous as a language family; it's more often considered an areal pheonomenon, or a dialect continuum including East and West Slavic. I agree the article could stand some more depth and some better sourcing. To me that indicates the article should be improved, not deleted. Some links, though (via google): <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/events/abstracts/rappaport/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/events/abstracts/rappaport/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ku.edu/~slavic/bss99-greenbergm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ku.edu/~slavic/bss99-greenbergm.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and</li>

<dd>North Slavic is a real linguistic concept. It's not particularly obscure. Comrie, Timberlake, Hult, Rappaport, and Tommola are all well-known and respected academic linguists with substantial publication records, not hobbyists or amateurs. I repeat, if Mikka thinks that the conlangs aspect of this article is bogus, he should edit the page or take his case to the talk page, not try to do this via AfD. And yes, the vitriolic tone of this discussion has been surprising.

<dd>Thank you. Honestly, I <i>do</i> agree with you that the article could do with some more depth. I sincerely hope that people more knowledgeable than me will take care of that, because unlike some others here, I am not a real expert in the field, merely a well-informed amateur. But I'm still not sure you to go about the "cite your sources" thingy. It appears to me that a footnote would be inappropriate if the book(s) in question only prove that a certain word is indeed used in a certain meaning. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 06:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Vozgian is a great article possibility. Unlike some of the constructed languages that get written about here, this is one I've actually heard of.
