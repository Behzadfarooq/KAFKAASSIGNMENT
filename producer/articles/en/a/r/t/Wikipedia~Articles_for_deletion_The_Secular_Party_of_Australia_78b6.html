<p>As far as I can tell, this is a non-notable minor Australian party. I was going to nominate the article for speedy deletion, but I think that's stretching the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> to their limits. Proposed deletion is a no go because at least someone will probably object to the listing. So here is the AfD reasoning ...</p>
<p>The party appears to get only <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">61 google hits</a>, but not counting repeated hits the party only gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">21 google hits</a>, many of which are either wikipedia-related or blogs. It cannot have participated in any major elections because of its age, but I could only find <a href="http://theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18213274%255E12272,00.html" class="external text" title="http://theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18213274%255E12272,00.html" rel="nofollow">one minor media mention</a>, where it appeared to conduct a single survey. The party is far from notable now, and appears not to have made an impact on the Australian political scene. I sympathise with many of its views, but I believe it does not deserve a wikipedia article ... yet. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 11:10, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that advertisements for the party's policies appeared in Prime Time last year offers it some significance to escape deletion <a href="http://aliasfrequencies.org/son/2005/05/13/dont-let-the-church-govern-australia/" class="external autonumber" title="http://aliasfrequencies.org/son/2005/05/13/dont-let-the-church-govern-australia/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELefty_on_campus_b4f2.html" title="User:Lefty on campus">Lefty on campus</a> 08:12, 12 March 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have recently been asked to support this party and I do not. While I support its views, I think these have to be worked through with the larger parties. I do not have an axe to grind here. This is a very new Party. The article is clear and concise. Lets give it a chance. If the Party turns out to be a dud, then we can delete it later. Meanwhile, some people might want to learn something about it and this article does that. I suspect it will get more Google hits as the year progresses but whether it will grow as a Party I do not know. It might well be a notable Party by the end of the year. Why waste the effort that someone has put into this article? --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:23, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Appears to be very new tiny party. Not every group of people who label themselves a party is automatically notable. Wikipedia shouldn't have articles just in case the subject becomes notable. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 12:53, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. At least for now, it is nn. I was able to find one mention of the party in an editorial in the <i>Australian</i>:"Last year, Sydney activist John Goldbaum paid for a series of TV commercials on the theme Keep Religion Out of Politics. Now he's formed the Secular Party of Australia." Perhaps once the movement starts and fields some candidates it will be wiki-worthy. But for now, it's nn.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Party may be small and it may not yet have got traction, but the issues it raises are very notable right now in Australia and readers of WP may well want to know what this Party stands for even if, like me, they chose to follow these issues in other ways. Give it a bit of time. It is usefull information. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The Australian Electoral Commission maintains a register of Australian political parties - these guys are not on it. <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/who/party_reg/registered/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/who/party_reg/registered/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. A search of an Australian and New Zealand database came up with nothing about this party at all. To my knowledge, these guys have not stood candidates for anything. This article gives no evidence of activity other than outlining the number of Australians who don't have any religious beliefs. These guys are unverifiable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What is the process of starting a political party in Australia? Do you need some number of signatures or members? Or can anyone just declare "I'm a party", or just file some paperwork? How many members does this party have?

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I vote to keep because a politicial party is as much a state of mind as it is a legal entity. In Australia, in order to become a political party recognised under law, you have to jump through many hoops but that even if not recognised by law that doesn't make them any less of a political party under a democracy. Anyone can set up a party, there is just a system of registration available to those who wish to seek it. If they do, they get benefits like money for election funding and their party name can be printed along side their candidates name. Are they notable enough&#160;? That's where Xtra's point comes in probably, they may be a very lame wing of the Humanist Society in NSW but they are probably inherently notable. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 00:58, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
