<p>A Formula One driver who never qualified for a race and didn't even register a time in the one race he tried to quallify for - non-notable Robertsteadman 21:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this wasn't his only race by any means - just his only Championship Grand Prix. That's the problem with a lot of these articles - they suggest that a driver only raced in F1, which is never the reality. AFB almost certainly took part in other Grand Prix and many other types of race as well. It's just a matter of finding out what else he did. He would never have made it as far as a Championship Grand Prix without achieving at least a reasonable amount elsewhere. We need someone with some time to exapnd the article, not delete it. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 21:32, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the article has existed for well over a year - there's been plenty of time and there seems to be no other info available - back then some "rickh kids" simply bought their way to car seats.... maybe he didn't do anything else.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Easily fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s criteria for sportspeople. A Google search of "Azdrubal Fontes Bayardo" brings up less than 10 unique results; of these, half are from WP and mirrors, and the other half list his name and nothing more. Thus, there is no verifiable information about him, so even if he did race in other circuits, there's no way he was notable enough (or, if he was, no way to prove it) to merit inclusion in WP. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, after just a minute or two on Google, I have found several things about him, such as the fact that he won the first race at El Pinar in Montevideo, in a Maserati 4CLT-Chevrolet. His middle name was Esteban, he apparently died just recently on July 9, and his nickname was Pocho. Just skipping over some South American sites, I can see a few results for him. When you Google, you do clearly have to bear in mind that people's names can be mispelt, particularly in this guy's case - and his surname 'Fontes' is often mistaken for a middle name. Rather than making assumptions about his career that you weren't able to confirm, leave this article for a while so that it can be expanded. I have flagged it on the Project page, so someone (or I can do it myself when I have time) will come and put some flesh on the bones. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's had over a year, but there are a lot of driver articles out there that need work, and as you have seen, Fontes Bayardo isn't the easiest to research. I know you're just gagging to delete it, but rest assured there is more information out there if you know how to look for it properly. In order to defeat the fatwa on this article, I will attempt to expand it today. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 17:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Well, you'd better start deleting the other dozens and dozens of similarly notable or non-notable racing drivers then. What has made you judge Fontes Bayardo to be non-notable? There's nothing in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which suggests he's non-notable, having competed in motor racing at the highest level in South America during the 1950s. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 19:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree -there is much to delete on WP because some fanatics have added it but these articles do not meet notability levels - I'm sure their mums are proud but that's about it. Robertsteadman 19:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Instead of being flippant, why don't you actually explain why you have decided that Fontes Bayardo is not notable? He has won Formula 1 races in South America - he is notable. I see that college football players who haven't actually played for their team are notable - is this some kind of bad joke? <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 19:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I appreciate that to non-followers of motorsport, Bayardo may seem too obscure but I'm afraid that not being able to appreciate the importance of his exploits shouldn't be a reason for deleting the article. The South American racing scene at the time was thriving and was almost as important as the European scene. A driver who did well in the South American formulae therefore cannot be ignored simply because he was a 'rich kid' or because he doesn't appear in a lot of english language websites. Personally I find wikipedia is enjoyable BECAUSE of articles like this which educate and inform, instead of the usual tittle tattle about obscure local 'celebrities' that others deem worthy of gracing the internet. I do agree however that the article ought to be expanded a little more.Type-R 00:16, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> At least as notable as the many NCAA athletes that pass SPORTS_BIO due to wikipedia's pro-US-college sports bias. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have expanded this article a little more, to include AFB's two race wins at the highest level of South American motor racing. This alone is enough to merit his inclusion. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 12:10, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Measurements of "notability" by things like Google are practically irrelevant here. An American football player could be 'linked' to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> and suddenly there are 1000s of articles about him on the internet. Had Bayardo been racing today, there would most likely be 100s of articles on the internet about him too. This does not make him less notable, just because the internet was not around at that time for thousands of amateur experts or news writers to write about his latest performance. Winning the aforementioned races is huge compared to the notability claims of <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movellan.html" title="Movellan">a Doctor Who villain</a> who appeared in one series, or <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerrea_Gilbert_4789.html" title="Kerrea Gilbert">a footballer who made 2 appearances for Arsenal and then went out on loan</a>, but these produce <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=Pxy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=Movellan+%2B%22Doctor+Who%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=Pxy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=Movellan+%2B%22Doctor+Who%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">2,900</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=pIe&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Kerrea+Gilbert%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=pIe&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Kerrea+Gilbert%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">46,200</a> Google hits respectively. Deleting this article would be showing blatant bias to those living in the time of the internet, where the slightest newsworthy piece of information produces dozens and dozens of webpages.

<li><b>Keep</b> Any idea how few Uruguayan drivers made it even this close to F1?! Uruguay being one of the poorer relations in the South American motor racing scene. A scene which stands in a similar relationship to Europe as it does in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> (no, I don't normally call it that, but I'm guessing that link is at least unambiguous!) - i.e. pretty important. Albinomonkey also makes an excellent point regarding 'Internet bias'. I also note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is explicitly <b>not</b> policy. I wouldn't personally have an objection to some of these drivers being grouped into larger articles though - Uruguyan Racing Drivers if anyone wants to put the work in on the redirects, but I know some others have different views on that. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 18:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
