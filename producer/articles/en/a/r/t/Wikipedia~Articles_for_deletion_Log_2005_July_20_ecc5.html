Right now, this tiny amount of content could be in a more general article (e.g. one on recent asteroids or on one of the asteroids he discovered). This is not an article. It's a couple of facts.

<p>And I have no problem not making it a redirect but just merging relevant material and deleting. I am not arguing that scally should get the same treatment because Ireland is a separate country. We have already deleted Charver and Charva on the basis that they are other words for Chav, and it should be the same for Ned, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may interest you to know that England and Scotland are also separate countries; They just happen to be part of the same state. Charver and chavra are obviously derivatives of chav and do not deserve separate entries.

<li>That's an argument that doesn't work. Consider <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This argument relies on a false analogy. "Gasoline" and "petrol" are synonyms: two words used to refer to the same concepts, albeit in different dialects.

<li>It's best not to. This is not supposed to be a dictionary article about a word, but an encyclopaedia article about a type of people. For a dictionary of slang, see Wiktionary, which has a <i>long</i> list of these regional slang words. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chav" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:chav">Wiktionary:chav</a> and what it links to.)
<p>The discussion on whether or not to merge is not a linguistic one, as several editors above have erroneously painted it, but a sociological one. We don't have separate articles where the titles are merely synonyms for the same person/place/concept/event; nor do we have separate articles where it is simply the case that different countries have different words for the same things. (Witness <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>/<a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28fruit%29.html" title="Squash (fruit)">squash</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrow_%28vegetable%29.html" title="Marrow (vegetable)">marrow</a>, and so forth.) This is an encyclopaedia, with one article per concept, not a dictionary with one article per word. The important question to answer is not about the words at all, but is whether the two concepts are in fact the same. That's (a) a discussion that belongs on the talk pages not here (since merger of <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> doesn't involve deleting anything) and (b) a question that can only be answered properly by citing sources on the subjects of these concepts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, citing sources is exactly what is almost <i>never</i> done in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townie.html" title="Townie">townie</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">bogan</a>, gogan, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies_%28people%29.html" title="Westies (people)">westies</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral_%28subculture%29.html" title="Feral (subculture)">feral</a>, and their ilk. The articles are perennial original research magnets. (Witness as an example the edit wars over what vehicles certain stereotypes own and drive, and the lack of cited sources on <i>all</i> sides of those disagreements.) These discussions have been, too, with editors using "I am English", "I am from Newcastle", "Xe is not Scottish", and so forth as the <i>sole</i> bases for their arguments — bald assertions that that add no weight at all to the arguments that they supposedly support. I encourage both editors who assert that neds and chavs are the same and editors who assert that neds and chavs are different, to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:48, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Personally I think the definition of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>, at least as given in the Wikipedia article, is much less precise, and also that article is subject to a factual accuracy dispute at the present time. That dispute, for me, is enough for me to support keeping the articles separate for now. The term Chav, as used in England, is much more wide-ranging than ned, being used to label anyone who is alleged to demonstrate poor taste in their choice of clothing, motor vehicle or lifestyle, even if that person of royal blood (Prince Harry). OTOH, "Ned" is a much more precisely defined term, covering mainly teenagers who are almost exclusively working class. English teens with a similar lifestyle are only one part of the amorphous Chav grouping. If the Chav article is improved then I <i>might</i> support a merge, but not at the present time. -- <a href="../../../r/u/g/User%7ERugxulo_c2ad.html" title="User:Rugxulo">Rugxulo</a> 22:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Actually I followed the strong suggestion to merge and redirect, and got reverted, which is why we are here. So I did it for the rather obvious reason that that is what was suggetsed in th elast Vfd. Your comment aqbout my overturning the decision is false and makes no sense.

<li><b>Keep</b> and recognise <b>charva</b> as a totally different thing too. How do you reopen these deletion votes? I never got a say on the last one.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;We have already deleted Charver and Charva on the basis that they are other words for Chav, and it should be the same for Ned,&lt;&lt;= BS. Charva is totally different, I suppose in southner terms it is a mixture of a chav and a hoodie (though it does mean more then this). They are certainly not 100% chavs. Charvas also predate chavs by a decade or over, you have only started hearing about chavs this century but charvas have been a common part of the NE for as long as I can remember. &gt;&gt;Charver and chavra are obviously derivatives of chav and do not deserve separate entries. The same cannot be said of ned, which is of completely different origin. -&lt;&lt; Again total rubbish. Chav is the derivative of charva, chav is a more mainstream, non-criminal popularization of charva culture with far heavier american aspects mixed in. Just as Scotland has its own culture north east England also has its own culture equally distinct from that of the south. The petrol argument doesn't work. It could apply if we were talking about western petrol and that totally different stuff they used to have in eastern Europe though for petrol/gasaline, two words for the same thing. Definatly not.-Josquius</p>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> <b>(The title should possibly be edited however)</b> The basis for the deletion vote is invalid, this article has nothing to do with Macedonian Albanian Muslims. The article is about the community of Slavs whose ancestors converted to Islam. They are ethnically unrelated to Albanians and by the way not all Albanians in Macedonia or Albania are Muslims. There is no reason to delete this information about a unique community in Macedonia, what I would suggest to avoid confusion and for the sake of clarification is that the article title be altered.. <b>instead of simply Macedonian Muslims</b>, I would change the title to Slavic Macedonian Muslims or Macedonian Muslims (LOCAL NAME) with one of the indigenous names for the group in parentheses. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHaraald_ffd1.html" title="User:Haraald">Haraald</a> 10:39, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No they are not a distinct group of people. Macedonian Muslims are unique from other Macedonians in their religion. However, the percentage of Slavic Macedonians who arent Christian is extremely small. Even if the end decision is to keep, this page should be renamed <b>Slavic Macedonian Muslims</b> as Macedonian Muslims would imply all citizens of either the region or the Republic.

<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a free webhosting provider. This page proposes an entire wikigames-subproject. It's bad enough that we tolerate these things in the sandbox. Games can be played on <a href="http://games.wikicities.com/" class="external free" title="http://games.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">http://games.wikicities.com/</a> which has specific wikigame-extensions; even if such a project was actually to be proposed as part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> (whose mission is to distribute <i>free knowledge</i> and which is funded by donations given by people who expect that we use their money as such), it would belong on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_new_projects" class="extiw" title="m:Proposals_for_new_projects">m:Proposals for new projects</a>, not in the Wikipedia: namespace of the English Wikipedia. Note that there's also an edit war on this page with SDSUPinoy preferring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikigames&amp;oldid=19196556" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikigames&amp;oldid=19196556" rel="nofollow">this version</a>. The page also nicely demonstrates the problem with wikigames; it was created by a user who has been doing nothing but playing and creating them, not ever contributing to the actual encyclopedia. It is often alleged that games on Wikipedia reduce wikistress. Given the record so far, I have doubts about that. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 02:28, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. SDSUPinoy's version is misleading in suggesting this forms a demonstration wiki, which it does not. The page only serves to promote games that were previously "hidden" in the sandbox. This gives too much credibility to a set of pages that ought to have been deleted, and gives the impression that anyone can set up a test wiki within Wikipedia, over-riding the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_new_projects" class="extiw" title="m:Proposals_for_new_projects">proposals for new projects policy</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:33, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a vanity page about my uncle. However, neither he nor I wrote it. I found this on accident and he had no idea as to its existence. There is also inaccurate information the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> If neither you nor Michael Sutton himself (nor anyone else in the family) wrote it, it's not really a vanity article. Do any of the accurate things in the article establish his notability? If you could correct the inaccuracies first, then Wikipedians could better decide whether they think he's notable enough for an article. It's also possible someone has conflated two Michael Suttons, finding some things out about your uncle and other things about the other guy, and thought they were the same person. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 06:41, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I won't bother with fixing the inaccuracies. I'm really not interested in doing so even if I had the correct information; it was my uncle who said the stuff was inaccurate so he's in a better position than I am to fix it. It's funny you mention the two Michael Suttons thing because that is how the whole thing started in the first place. I was demonstrating to my grandmother (she is not familiar with computers) that there are multiple Michael Suttons on the internet via Google. And we were shocked when this page showed up. I've been on Wikipedia for a while and never saw this page (well it was created last month). But yeah, all this is very strange. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris</a> 08:48, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think if you change the word "By" (in the title and some of the sub-sections) to the word "OF" this article makes alot more sense. The author seems to be writing in terms of persecution OF Muslims. I read the article and much of its information seems to be covered in the blue links I followed. Perhaps some of this material should be <b>Re-Directed</b> or <b>Merged</b> with the existing material. I think an <b>edit</b> would help this page. A historical record of the persecution of any population certainly warrants notable topic status, and the tone of this one seems largely historical rather than an opinion piece. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 07:50, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is already a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Muslims_79ae.html" title="Persecution of Muslims">Persecution of Muslims</a> article, this page is yet another opportunity for Germen to spread his anti-muslim propaganda (he's already created numerous pester pages that have all been deleted through lengthy VfD). I see no reason not to cover the same subject matter in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article. Also I'm not sure that religious persecution can be used in this sense: when I hear the term I generally think of people being persecuted for their religion, not people being persecuted because of religion. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 09:07, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

Failing to see this difference is symptomatic for <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">user:Axon</a>.

<li>To say that ONLY the Koran makes statements like 5:51 is a generalization and is not accurate. What did Jesus mean when he said "If you are not with me, then you are against me"? Have you read of the Israelite's campaigns against their neighbors?

<li>Fine. I admit I was too lazy to look the verse up, but my paraphrase isn't that far off and the context seems the same. The point of both 5:51 and Jesus' statement is that there is only one way to salvation and, frankly, I don't see the problem with 5:51 in that it reserves the punishment of sinners to Allah. Not one of the three religions is innocent of bloodshed and if you have articles about Christian and Jewish attrocities, then you are obligated to examine Islam as well. If there ever were Christian, Jewish, or Muslem attrocities against other religions (and there certainly were), you are obligated to to examine them. The "Persecution by..." series seems legitimate. If the content of the articles needs cleaned up, then clean them up, but I don't see how you can justify deleting them just because someone might get offended by them.--<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 19:36, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> For the same reasons as I gave, for deleting "Religious persecution by Jews." I will jus copypast those reasons here: "The name of the article is not encyclopedic. Something like: "Religious persecution in Israel" could get an entry, but for sure not this. It is simply a generalization of an ethnic group, and the support of a POV, the POV being that, an ethnic group is more than a social construct, all this, in the articles name alone. I think there should be appropriate rules here in Wikipedia, on what is an encyclopedic entry, this will spare us all the trouble of having to vote the deletion of articles that should not exist in the first place. This sort of article will only get answered by similar articles(I just hope they don't already exist), which the subject, and probably the aim, will be generalization. There is a distinction between directly criticizing a group of people, and criticizing an aspect... If I write an article like: "Religious persecution under king David's reign" or something such, I could write an encyclopedic article. I could of course, as well, write something like: "Religious persecution under Judaism." While this seems to be about the same thing as the article voted for deletion, it is not. In the same token, I could write an article, like; "Religious persecution under Islam." This will be an encyclopedic name, but not: "Religious persecutions by Muslims," or even more direct: "Religious persecution by Arabs" (I'm making the comparison, because being a "Jew," is not only being part of a religion, but as includes the ethnic group.) But I could write: "Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes." It is permitted to write about an aspect, or a system, etc. but not to generalize directly. Guilt by association is simply not encyclopedic. One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization. Having said all this, I think that the problem is not only with the name, but what the name could permit to write in the article, in this cases. We can not write with such a subject(the name of the article/subject), a real NPOV article, so it will be unwiki, and it's existence will inevitably lead to failure." <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 20:23, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Change vote: Keep, but change the name of the article:</b> This article is much more worked around than the other, and a name like: "Religious persecution under Islamic rules" would rightly fit the content of the article. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 21:19, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>You say: <i>One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization</i>, but you suggest that <i>Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes</i> would be a valid title, which is inconsistent because the latter title is also a generalisation. You fail to give a reason why such generalisations should be avoided. Obviously, the article with a title like <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> does not imply that all muslims persecute all the time, merely that at some point in time group(s) was(were) persecuted by Muslims in a manner which warrants an encyclopedic article. Quite frankly, I don't understand the point you are trying to make I suspect that there is none. -<a href="../../../d/v/_/User%7EDv_9a01.html" title="User:Dv">Dv</a> 20:45, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with you, but I don't think this article (or the other 2) has much potential, as the title alone assumes Muslims (or Jews or Christians) are monolithic in their (mis)behavior.

<li>The historical fact itself is not POV, it's the way it's framed. Articles titled "religious persecution *of* (fill in group here)" are okay, but "religious persecution *by* (fill in group here)" carries an implicit implication that Muslims, Jews, or Christians as a whole are responsible for persecution (as opposed to individuals who may also happen to be Muslims, Jews, or Christians), or that there is something systemic in the religions that leads to them persecuting others. That's implicitly promoting a POV against all three religions. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 23:54, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>

<dd>German, how do we know whether the reasons are religious? How would you define the examples above? In one case it was a group of Christians slaughtering Jews for the crime of being Jews, but it was not explicitly religiously motivated. In the next case, it was a lone crazy Jew who killed Muslims because of their religion, but did not represent a wider religious group. In the final case, Islamists were attacking others for religious reasons, but it is not clear whether the attack was persecution or not. The issue is that these articles seem destined to turn into a dumping ground for a list of everything that anyone of that religious affiliation has ever done wrong. Until someone defines the article series better, and what religious persecution is (as opposed to nationalist persecution, etc.), I would strongly urge to delete. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:29, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>GoodOldPolonius, I think it is not so difficult to find that out. If the perpetrators of persecution cite religious sources and religious reasons and those reasons are supported by theological evidence, we safely can assume it is religious persecution. Exactly because of that reason I added a section "Theological justification for/against persecution" in order to make this clear. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 07:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That begs the question - lots of people appeal to religious motives, others do not cite religious reasons, but their actions are clearly religiously motivated. And what "religious persection" is remains anyone's guess.

<dd>Difficult indeed, Goodoldpolonius. Because people consider a religion to be their supreme frame of reference, it would be more logical for someone to attribute non-religious violence to religion than the opposite (unless it is all part of a propaganda war, in which it would be opposite in order to prevent defamation of the own religion). It is quite impossible to look into the perpetrators brain, so we have just their words and actions available as a reference. And the validity of the religious motives they gave.</dd>

<li>Christians killing a Jew for being a Jew per se are not acting per religious reasons, as there are no reasons in the Bible to kill Jews, except for the supposed responsability of the Jews for the crucifixion of Christ. This, however, contradicts the Christian dogma that Jesus died for all sins, including the sins of the Jewish perpetrators and the fact that according to the canonical <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a> Jesus asked for forgiveness for the ones who persecuted him. It can be cited as a (misguided) religious motivation, however.</li>
<li>The lone Jew who kills Muslims because of their religion can act because of religious reasons or not, I do not know enough about Talmud and other contemporary Jewish writings. The <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenach.html" title="Tenach">Tenach</a> does not mention Islam, so cannot be used as a source for anti-Muslim violence. Only when Muslims are considered to be enemies of the people of Israel (as some right-wing Zionist groups do) there exists a religious reason for killing them as far as I understand Judaism.</li>
<li>The Sharm el-Sheikh attacks are partially motivated by religious reasons because of the suicide bomber element. A secular terrorist will attribute more value to hios life and will not expect a reward by God for his act (thus will choose another method of terrorism, like remote-control), while a religiously miotivated terrorist will and therefore prefers suicide as a sure means for achieving Paradise. There are some theories, however, that the harsh treatment by the <a href="../../../m/u/k/Mukhabarat.html" title="Mukhabarat">Mukhabarat</a> of Sinai Bedouins has motivated the killers. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 09:14, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Now you have me truly baffled (leaving aside the Jews killed Jesus bit which seems to be in your first response). Christian persecutions of a group is not religious persecutions unless the source documents of Christianity demand that that group be persecuted? So attacks on witches are religious persecution because of the commandment against witches, but the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel_against_Jews_e798.html" title="Blood libel against Jews">blood libels</a> are not, because there is no commandment to persecute Jews? I am not even sure what your definition is, but it seems to require at the very least knowing the motivation of the persecution (which is often unclear) and a universal interpretation of each religion (which is not possible). Motivations for persecutions against other religions are usually multicausal, so how would you decide what is religiously motivated and what is not? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 15:37, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Right, you summarize it well. Note, however, that everything which violates the Highest Commandment as per Jesus, is in violation of Christian teachings. So persecuting witches is wrong, but Christianity commands them to be banned from a church or other religious group of Christians. However, agreed to some extent: religiously motivated persecution can still be a violation of the teachings of that religion. The persecution then results from a twisted interpretation of the religion. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 12:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - this should be dealt with by Religious persecution by Mu'tazilites, or by early Hanafis or whatever group... as SlimVirgin said it's a POV magnet and there is no persecution by Muslims as a whole entity, but different groups and schools of thought have persecuted different things, there is no doubt in that. I would have no problem if this was a disambig page called Religious persecution by Muslim groups that linked to persecution by sects, that seems reasonable because at that level this can be dealt with in a way that is sane and not blanketing saying Qur'an quotes for and against persecution. Because, it is obvious that different groups have interpretted those verses differently. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 16:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Gren, according to what you say, there seems to be a lot of confusion between Muslims themselves whether persecution is allowed or not and which incarnations of persecution are allowed or recommended. So, exposing the reasons why Muslims persecute others and what is the textual evidence which allows or contradicts persecution seems to be of encyclopedic interest. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 16:32, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no Islamic ruling on persecution different Muslims have interpretted it in different ways. Also it is impossible to tell teh difference between political / power / and religious motivations. While I have no problem reporting what motivations can be cited for a Muslim group's persecution of another I think that what you want is exactly why this article should not stand as it does now. There is no answer that will give you the magical key to why some Muslims do what they do. And citing the Qur'an without references because an editor feels they justify persecution is original research... and that is precisely what is to be avoided. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 16:48, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Zaphod, I created this page so that I could provide some evidence to my claims regarding being a polyglot because many people on the list have not done so. Sorry if I am causing you trouble. I am new at this. I tried moving my page without success. Would it help if I got somebody else to write a short bio on me? What if I just included my name and the languages that I speak thus eliminating all of my background information? Please advise.</p>
<p><b>If anyone has any advice on how to maintain "notable" credibility while reducing the "vanity" feel of my biography I would be grateful for any feedback.</b></p>
<p><br />
I would like to thank <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zaphod_Beeblebrox_11a1.html" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> for his contribution for he brings up some valid points regarding the recent publishing of my biography. I can understand some of the reasons why he feels that my biography published in Wikipedia's notable polyglots listing may appear as a vanity page: it is self authored, it is about a living person, it is not about a sports/entertainment celebrity, nor is it about an author who has been published in printed media with readerships greater than 5000 people.</p>
<p><br />
However, I believe that I fulfill three criteria for "notable" status discussed in your online encyclopaedia. The main criteria I used justifying the publishing of my self authored boigraphy is the following:</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>"1. Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field."</b></i></p>
<p><br />
My "notable" achievement which fulfills the above criteria is the following:</p>
<p>I am a professional linguist who speaks, reads, and understands 30 languages 8 of which have been tested via a series of <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_State_Department_f4b7.html" title="US State Department">US State Department</a> <a href="../../../d/l/p/DLPT_3a37.html" title="DLPT">DLPT</a> exams (Defense Language Proficiency Test). Therefore, according to your encyclopaedia provided that all of the polyglot language claims are factual I would be the 3rd ranked living <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperpolyglot.html" title="Hyperpolyglot">hyperpolyglot</a> as well as the 10th ranked <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperpolyglot.html" title="Hyperpolyglot">hyperpolyglot</a> in recorded history.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/l/p/DLPT_3a37.html" title="DLPT">DLPT</a> is available only for a limited number of languages. However, practically all remaining languages I am proficient in not available for testing are hybrids involving languages where I have already documented <a href="../../../d/l/p/DLPT_3a37.html" title="DLPT">DLPT</a> proficiency. The <a href="../../../d/l/p/DLPT_3a37.html" title="DLPT">DLPT</a> is administered by the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Department_of_Defense_9887.html" title="US Department of Defense">US Department of Defense</a> and records can be requested by contacting the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Language_Institute_1e13.html" title="Defense Language Institute">Defense Language Institute</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterey.html" title="Monterey">Monterey</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.</p>
<p><br />
The second criteria I used justifying the publishing of my "notable" self authored biography is the following:</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>"2. Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events "</b></i></p>
<p><br />
There are two events in my career as a technologist and entrepreneur that were witnessed by tens of thousands of people. The first is my video chat session with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> during the launch of his book "Business at the Speed of Thought" on March 31, 1999. This event was witnessed by a worldwide audience well into the millions. Video clips of this video chat session are available on my personal web site. The second was the press release distributed around the world when the 67 country localized online recruiting database I own and operate (iDonovan) was recognized as for having the widest global presence withinin the online recruiting industry. This can be verified via a variety of non-affiliated independent business news sites by searching for "idonovan" on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<i><b>3. The third criteria I believe I fulfill is the "<a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> Test":</b></i></p>
<p><br />
"Edgardo Donovan" and my shortened name "Eddie Donovan" return 208 and 1,840 hits on Google respectively. It would be wrong to attribute these hits soley to my personal home page "EddieDonovan" (376 hits on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>). A significant portion of my apparant popularity on the web are due to two on-line business ventures I have managed over the years: NETworldwide (628 hits on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>) and iDonovan (5,640 hits on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>).</p>
<p>I realize that having listed my academic credentials as well as precise details regarding my professional background may seem as an attempt to market my persona. I did so because I feel that those experiences have contributed greatly to my linguistic accomplishments. Those details can be easily verified for those interested in doing so.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

<dd>No, you are not a professional linguist. A linguist is a person engaged in the scientific study of human language. As a <i>real</i> linguist, and for the three billionth time, I want to make plain to you and all other DLI graduates - since DLI graduates as a group seem to have the most trouble with this concept - that the word <i>linguist</i> does not mean what the DOD means when it says it wants a <i>linguist</i>. A person whose marketable skills are their knowledge of various languages is, depending on the role they fulfil, an interpreter, a translator, a language expert, or in the US Army's case, occasionally a professional <s>torturer</s>interrogator. None of those job categories overlaps with being a linguist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And no, from the list of languages you know, your language skills are probably quite good but not really remarkable. You claim to have some knowledge of 24 largely cognate romance dialects, one of which appears to be effectively a native language, and a minimal knowledge of German and a close Alemannic dialect. I think I might be able to pass a basic State Dept competency exam in 24 fairly similar romance dialects - State is not renowned for high standards - and I know I could in at least three Germanic languages, and all I did was waste my youth smoking pot on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau_Mont-Royal_6dfc.html" title="Plateau Mont-Royal">Plateau</a>. I suspect a lot of people who do translation here could claim the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, the "world record" aspect of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_noted_polyglots.html" title="List of noted polyglots">List of noted polyglots</a> bothers me a great deal, since these counts of languages measure nothing at all unless the level of competence, and the degree of similarity between dialects, is taken into account. I can probably figure out where the bathroom is in over a dozen languages, but I can hold down a job in two, maybe three. You claim DLPT level 3 competency in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. I imagine that means you are only genuinely fluent - in the sense of being able to handle colloquial language in all contexts - in only those four languages (plus, I presume, English). That's no small feat, but these four languages are quite closely related and I know a fair number of people able to handle themselves in all four plus English.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Farsi knowledge is different (although going from there to the closely related Dari and Pashtu languages is less so), but I imagine that's what you paid DLI's enormous fees to learn. Still, it's a 2+ level, less than the romance languages you name. By itself, that is not noteworthy.</dd>

<p>Response to R. fiend 14:56, 20 July 2005 (UTC) - Thank you for your feedback. I did not imply that every Google entry under "Eddie Donovan" was mine. I clearly stated that entries under "EddieDonovan" were mine. The latter would bring up entries only for my personal web page. What did you mean by "rant"? Were you implying that the facts I used to support my case are not factual? If so, what can evidence can you present to support such a thesis?</p>
<p>Response to Consumed Crustacean | Talk | 15:12, July 20, 2005 (UTC) and Several Times 15:16, 20 July 2005 (UTC) - Thank you for your feedback. You both bring up valid points. If it is an act of vanity to write about myself or to list evidence backing up my accomplishments how can I avoid doing so if I wish to publish evidence to back up my claims? I thought about getting somebody else to write a blurb on me. I could also omit everything except my name, languages I claim various levels of proficiency in, and the university where my DLPT scores are consoldiated into a single transcript. Are there any precedents involving a similar debate on this encyclopaedia? How were they resolved?</p>
<p>Response to Diderot 15:51, 20 July 2005 (UTC) - Thank you for your having taken the time to write such lengthy feedback. Here is an American-English definition of the word linguist I found earlier today:</p>
<p>lin·guist ( P ) Pronunciation Key (lnggwst) n. A person who speaks several languages fluently. A specialist in linguistics.</p>
<hr />
<p>[Latin lingua, language; see dgh- in Indo-European Roots + -ist.] [Download Now or Buy the Book] Source: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition Copyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. All rights reserved.</p>
<p><br />
Here is a British-English definition of the word linguist I found earlier today:</p>
<p>linguist</p>
<pre>
 • noun 1 a person skilled in foreign languages. 2 a person who studies linguistics. 
</pre>
<pre>
 — ORIGIN from Latin lingua ‘language’.
</pre>
<p>Perform another search of the Compact Oxford English Dictionary</p>
<p>Just so there is no more confusion here is another definition from Webster:</p>
<p>Main Entry: lin·guist Pronunciation: 'li[ng]-gwist Function: noun Etymology: Latin lingua language, tongue 1 : a person accomplished in languages; especially : one who speaks several languages 2 : a person who specializes in linguistics</p>
<p>Whether a person is skilled, accomplished, or has varying degrees in of proficiency in a variety of languages the definitions above clearly prove that the term linguist is not restricted soley to academics who study and teach linguistics for a living. Therefore, the DOD is not wrong in adding the term to certain job titles that require expertise in foreign languages. For the record, I am a professional linguist within the DOD. If you do not agree take it up with the DOD, the Oxford dictionary, and Webster's dictionary.</p>
<p>I find it strange that the other DLI graduates that you have communicated with in the past have never called your attention to the above definitions. Perhaps they were initimidated by the mystique of your intellectual occupation or your overall knowledge of linguistics. Who knows? In any event, I think that it would be intellectually honest on your part to email all those you have lectured on why they are not linguists and set the record straight. Do many of your colleagues share this same bias against those who choose to learn and use languages as opposed to studying linguistics? Do you think this could be some type of superiority complex? I do not think there is a need for any side to nurture inferiority/superiority complexes vis-a-vis one another. One must be able to accept that people who study and teach linguistics for a living will usually be better at understanding the dynamics, structure, and history of a language whereas those who make use of language for a living can be expected to be better at their craft than the former.</p>
<p>While I do not expect all feedback to be on topic I did not appreciate the torturer accusation you extended to me and other DLI alumni. I do not agree with that characterization and would appreciate it that your political prejudices be reserved for other areas within the public domain.</p>
<p>I also do not see where how the payment of my schooling at DLI has anything to do with discussing the notable or non-notable status of my accomplishment. Perhaps you reserve a deep bias against those who did not work themselves through school or perhaps the other way around depending on convenience. Regardless, it is irrelevant to the discussion.</p>
<p>It is a valid point if you think that my language ability is less notable because my 30 languages which are all official languages in varying parts of the world represent 3 language groups with closely related languages and dialects within them. However, your predictions on how you think you would do on tests that I have already taken are not valid excuses for you to belittle my linguistic ability. Take all the tests I have taken and if you do as well or better than me then you can tell the world on this encyclopadia how non notable BOTH OUR linguistic abilities are.</p>
<p>If we are to set up an accomplished polyglot ranking we must accept that we will not be able to scientifically determine the "most notable" polyglot simply because the difficulty in language learning is subjective according to target languages and domestic culture. Furthermore, it is difficult to adhere to a reliable standard in testing proficiency. This is especially difficult to do with those who have long been deceased. I posted my DLPT score so to offer a starting point for a dialogue that could lead to more reliable scrutiny. You, like many others, complain that you do not like the hit parade approach devoid of any objective evaluation methodology and yet instead of welcoming testing methodologies such as the DLPT, crude as they may be, you prefer to belittle them preferring to stick to the conventional methodology of guesswork while deferring to a person's fame and prestige in areas often not related to languages.</p>
<p>I appreciate your trying to put my declared proficiency into context. Actually, with the exception of Romanian and Moldovan I speak most of my romance languages at a quasi-native level. The DLPT is a flawed test which only tests up to 3 level. But it is better than nothing especially in an area, as you correctly pointed out, where there is no standard to measure ability in using a language to communicate. I cannot hold a corporate management job in the Germanic and Persian languages. However, holding a corporate management job in 10+ languages is an impossible standard to measure oneself against. Even Mezzofanti as well as many Popes would have had a problem with that. ;-)</p>
<p>Response to Asbestos | Talk 15:54, 20 July 2005 (UTC) - You bring up a valid point. I have not ever seeked to interest newspapers regarding my accomplishment. I doubt I would be able to generate very strong interest even if I tried. I never thought that the media has a burning desire to write about living linguists who speak many languages unless they are politicans, entertainment stars, or sports celebrities. Generally knowing a lot of languages will not get you that much fame. Ziad Fazah, for example, appeared in Brazil's variety show Fantastico a few times which spurred a handful of articles. However, eventually the buzz died down. Many of the Google hits (431) for himself are attributable to the notable polyglot page off of this encyclopaedia. The search for "Kenneth Hale" linguist brings up only 463 entries. That is not that much when considering a lifetime of publishing linguistics papers into the public domain with the backing and prestige of many prominent universities such as MIT. Regardless, I will note any press attention I get in the future and/or if I delve into an academic career that involves lots of publishing may be able to garner the necesary prestige to satisfy types as yourself. Do you know of any associations, councils, or publications to whom I could ask to evaluate my abilities thereby starting the PR process you alluded to?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Userfy</b> this pumped-up CV. Vanity in both the Wikipedia &amp; dictionary sense.

<p>I asked for feedback and I got it. Thank you. Although, some of the responses were personal criticisms launched under the cover of anonymity of a username handle I have enjoyed the debate for the most part. Just because I do not agree with certain issues with some people does not require that I or they should feel alienated. A healthy debate is a great way to prevent a stagnant group-think mentality.</p>
<p>Here is what I have been able to sum up thanks to this discussion:</p>
<p>1) Unfair as it may seem, recognition of linguistic ability hinges upon celebrity status often not related to languages. It is silly for me to think that I can in anyway change the centuries old dynamic of this field. This notable polyglot list being the only one of its kind in the world along with the absence of internationally recognized polygot awards is a testament to this cultural filtration phenomenon.</p>
<p>2) In order to become included in the notable polyglot directory I must get external recognition beyond test scores. I doubt that I will be able to do this with journalists for the reasons I discussed above. Perhaps by becoming more involved with people in the linguistics field a la Kenneth Hale I may be able to count on them for references once they have verified my actual language abilities.</p>
<p>3) To gain the respect of some of my critics it may help to learn additional non-Indo European languages such as Russian and Mandarin to the point where I can begin to understand other lesser practiced languages or dialects within their sphere of influence. This would emulate the methodology I have used in learning Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>4) To ensure that my language abilities be recognized for posterity it would be imperative for me to become a famous politician, actor, author, or musician. If anyone has any advice on proven methodology towards achieving celebrity status in any of the aforementioned ways I am all ears. ;-)</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing to making Wikipedia possible.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<dd>You seem to misunderstand what "original research" is. In Wikipedia terms, it means a theory or other such text that has not been extensively peer-reviewed.

<dd>All I see when I do a search for <b>Moving Dimensions Theory</b> is postings to USENET (and responses that involve the word "crank") and web fora operated by the theory's supporters. The claims are difficult to parse and intermixed with a lot of bitching about the "physics bureaucracy", and I see at least one fallacy of definition. I'm not a physicist (although I sometimes play one on TV) but I see very little that qualifes as an explanation, just a lot of <i>ergo</i>s and <i>thus</i>es. Basic rule: <b>Science is what scientists can get published in a decent peer-reviewed journal</b>. Popper is probably spinning in his grave at that assertion (thereby proving action at a distance), but for better or worse, that's the only real policy you'll see widely applied in the definition of science, and it's the one Wikipedia should stick to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If, however, the author is trying to get the theory categorised as a crank hypothesis, I'm willing to run with it, if and only if it has a <b>print publication record</b> - not just websites and USENET posts - and if the article is clear and accurately reflects mainstream physics' opinion of it. Having a paper publication record is enough of a sign of commitment on the part of the theory's supporters that the theory may be worthy of a place as "notable pseudoscience".</dd>

<p><br />
It seems that the main reason for deleting the Moving Dimensions Theory entry has nothing to do with the scientific integrity of the theory, but only with the notion that it has not yet been accepted by the postmodern science community which prefers mythologies such as String Theory--a theory that lacks postulates, laws, and experimentally-verified equations.</p>
<p>MDT is brand new. It is an original theory. Laughter and vilification are to be expected, along with ad-hominen attacks.</p>
<p>MDT is being submitted to journals. But that could take years for publication.</p>
<p>MDT will open new opportunities for young physicists with its simple postulate: The fourth dimension is expanding relative to the three spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Albert Einstein said, "The mere formulation of a problem is far more often essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science."</p>
<p>Thus MDT offers an important advance.</p>
<p>Moving Dimensions Theory is an affront to postmodern sensibilities because it asks big questions--questions which have long ago been abandonded by the regimented, bureaucratized academy, which is funded not by innovation but by conformity. Moving Dimensions Theory provides a simple postulate that answers the following questions: Why is the speed of light constant in all frames? Why are light and energy quantized? How can matter display both wave and particle properties? Why are there non-local effects in quantum mechanics? Why does time stop at the speed of light? How come a photon does not age? Why are inertial mass and gravitational mass the same thing? Why do moving bodies exhibit length contraction? Why are mass and energy equivalent? Why does time’s arrow point in the direction it points in? Why do photons appear as spherically-symmetric wavefronts traveling at the velocity c? Why is there a minus sign in the following metric? x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2=s^2 What deeper reality underlies Einstein’s postulates of relativity? What deeper reality underlies Newton’s laws? What underlies the laws of Inertia? Why entropy? What is the geometry of motion--the prime mover of all motion? Why have Einstein, Godel, Wheller, Penrose, Hawking, and Barbour all stated that we need a new approach to time, and what might that approach be?</p>
<p>"If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it." --Albert Einstein</p>
<p>Dr. Elliot McGucken is a trained physicist who has won several awards, both for research and teaching. He studied with John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton University where he graduated cum laude. He went on to receive a Ph.D. in physics. But Moving Dimensions Theory does not need Dr. McGucken--it stands on its own two feet, upon the shoulders of giants, bolstered by logic, reason, and physics.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to argue against Moving Dimensions Theory with ad-hominem attacks, neither Dr. McGucken nor Moving Dimensions Theory will take it personally. But the theory is real physics--not pseudo physics nor "crank physics." It is new, but that does not make it wrong. If you refute it, or argue against it, do it with logic and reason, not with angst, vituperation, slander, ad-homimen attacks, name-calling, nor hearsay. Please--we must always maintain the highest level of cordiality and respect for fellow scientists and philosophers, so as to foster the advancement of knowledge.</p>
<p>"And if everybody says that you are wrong, then you are one step ahead. But there is one situation which is better still, when everyone begins to laugh about you, then you know you are two steps ahead." --Albert Szent-Gyorgi--Winner of the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>The fate of Moving Dimensions Theory is in the hands of the jury. The jury sentenced Socrates to death and abandoned Jesus to the cross.</p>
<p>But the ideas of both, based in logic and reason, withstood the test of time, and both are enshrined in the Princeton Chapel in stained glass--the chapel Einstein walked by every day on his way to Palmer Hall--the Princeton that accepted him and his theories when they were reviled, impugned, and denied by professors in Germany--the Germany that was back then considered to be the world's leader of scientific innovation. Einstein was called a crank and worse.</p>
<p>Though at first rejected, castigated, and impugned, the Truth has a way of winning over time.</p>
<p>So shall it be with Moving Dimensions Theory.</p>
<p>"An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: What does happen is that the opponents gradually die out." --Max Planck</p>

<dd>If you will forgive me for saying so, Wikipedia is not a jury. We are, by our very nature, reactive, not proactive. If a topic becomes widely accepted (or even known), we will write about it. And that's write <i>about</i> it, not write it.

<p>Actually no scientific theory can ever be proven.</p>
<p>Moving Dimensions Theory is a new theory. The general rules of wikipedia are appreciated, and this discussion demonstrates how thoroughly revolutionary MDT is. May it serve as one more record.</p>

Your theories are worthless until reviewed by those in the field.

<p>This new VfD is for an unrelated reason, as I judge the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a> to be original research and as such violating the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. This list tries to avoid the POV problems and endless struggles which would plague a "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cults.html" title="List of cults">List of cults</a>" (but accept a redirect from there). Only the solution found by the authors of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a> has a massive <i>Original Research</i> problem. The authors are doing their own research which of the zillions of possible sources in mass media are ignored, or put in one three categories of varying degrees of consensus. To make matters worse the authors are also attempting own research, which word in languages other than English should be considered equivalent to "cult". (Unfortunately they ignore the question of the different meanings of "cult" itself, but this is not central to VfD).</p>

<li>Well, firstly, "original research" does not mean and has never meant "the very act of doing research." One might as well ask of <i>any</i> Wikipedia article, "if it is not a copyvio of some existing article on a subject, how is it not 'original research'?" Second of all, why <i>should</i> it be noted which Wikipedians voted on this VfD in response to my letting them know the vote was going on? It almost sounds as if you're suggesting that there is something untoward in doing so, but the only policy or guideline I know which discourages such things applies to notifying <b>non-Wikipedians</b> of a VfD and encouraging them to come and vote. I'm not aware of anything that suggests it's a wrong thing to notify interested Wikipedians of a vote that may affect them.

<li>One of the article in the "Cult" template is Cult checklists which covers exactly that topic. However, if we were to use one of those checklists to decide on our own if a group was a cult then <b>that</b> would be original research. Like any good NPOV article, we are not making assertions of our own but instead are sourcing every opinion. Should we eschew sources and make determinations on our own logic?

<li>You keep pursuing the argument of "if it sourced, it is NPOV". But it is not so. A controversial subject (and don't tell me that this is <i>not</i> one of these...), needs to represent all sides of a controversy in a balanced manner to attain NPOV. The groups listed here does not have a recourse to present <i>their</i> POV in the matter. This list is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacklist.html" title="Blacklist">blacklist</a> in camouflage and deserves to be deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 04:08, July 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, Jossi. For purposes of NPOV, it <i>is</i> important, and in fact, the guiding principles of Wikipedia specify, that both sides of the controversy <i>should</i> be represented. The question is, though, when both sides of a controversy about a group <i>are</i> covered in the most logical place -- i.e. in the group's own entry -- is it a violation of NPOV to <i>acknowledge</i> the fact of the controversy in any other place? Because that's what this article is about, about <i>acknowledging</i> these controversies. You've been telling everyone that no, this article goes farther, this article presents the "anti-cult" POV, and <i>only</i> the anti-cult POV, and my question for you is "where?" <i>Where</i> is this article presenting the dissection of doctrines with a critical eye? the testimonies of those harmed and degraded by the group? the secret documents seized by law enforcement and brought out at trials? The answer is, nowhere. The list says "This is the group; these are the sources that raise the issue; you must follow the link if you want to know the arguments on either side of the issue." The list simply <i>does not contain</i> the "anti-cult" POV you are arguing that it presents out of proportion to any other view -- <i>except</i> to the degree that that POV is acknowledged as <i>existing</i> in order to acknowledge the <i>existence</i> of a controversy. And you seem to be arguing that even that much <i>acknowledgement</i> of the <i>existence</i> of a POV that says "this group is a cult" is automatically so damaging an NPOV violation that we must burn the article with fire. How come you've never shown so much concern about, say, whether a group is called a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_group.html" title="Hate group">hate group</a> or not? Have you been as fervent in your belief there that an accusation against a group cannot be <i>allowed to exist</i> within a Wikipedia article, unless the opposite POV is presented right then and there, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&amp;diff=8482670&amp;oldid=8480078" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&amp;diff=8482670&amp;oldid=8480078" rel="nofollow">when it's not a group you approve of as the target</a>? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:10, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just read the criteria established for including a group in the list, for an example of the extent to which this article resorts to original research. Highlights are mine: <i>Groups are arranged by the "width of consensus" of the sources: sources aligned with <b>widest consensus</b> are first, sources aligned with <b>decreasing consensus</b> follow, and sources that are aligned with only a <b>very narrow consensus</b> in their use of the term "cult" are last.

<li>I don't think it's neccessary to be a cult to be included on a list of purported cults, however your last point (on blacklists) has made me reconsider my vote. Even the MILS report (a horribly biased anti-religion piece) views the term "cult" as overly perjorative, and IMHO it's unfair to list organizations with huge memberships (mormons, adventists, jws, etc) on this list.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The restriction on "no original research" is not a bright line. Almost every article involves the exercise of editorial judgement to some extent. When the list seems to be useful, seems to represent a reasonable consensus judgement, and where the items are either noncontroversial or where the interplay of editorial give-and-take has created a reasonably neutral point of view, I think they can be kept. If someone wanted to argue that lists should be <i>formally</i> declared to be held to a looser standard than articles, and should accordingly carry a warning that they represent Wikipedian consensus judgement rather than verifiable fact, I'd go along. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:52, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't see anywhere in the article any conflicting views. Aum Shinkiryo doesn't provide cites that say it's <i>not</i> a cult, and I'll hazard it doesn't call itself one. To cover the conflicting views would essentially be a "List of organisation that are sometime called cults and sometimes not called cults", and then to present a battle-of-the-googles or something. Which, to me at any rate, doesn't impart much encyclopedic information. I suspect that many of these organisations appear on various countries' "restricted organisations" (or whatever) list; a collection along those lines under a relevant title <i>might</i> not be POV and I suspect already exists, somewhere. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:20, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did read it, and I'll grant you all of the above - but my point is that if a journalist has called something a cult that in itself is pretty meaningless. All users of the word mean different (derogatory) things by it - 'one man's sect is another man's denomination'. An article listing religious groups called 'cult' might list them all.

This article goes <i>farther</i> than most Wikipedia articles do to <i>avoid</i> any NPOV problems coming from editors' undiscussed, undisclosed decisions about which sources are worthy of mention and why by <i>discussing</i> it and <i>disclosing</i> it and putting that information <i>into the article</i>. To pretend we have to destroy this article to satisfy NPOV is to willfully misread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and what it says about <i>not</i> letting NPOV spill over into false balance where <i>no</i> judgements may be made about sources. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:01, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

Can we say than group XYZ is not considered a cult by the governments of Italy, Canda, Spain, Greece, Venezuela, etc.? It does not make sense.

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge. Early Christianity, in all its various sects, was considered a cult for centuries until its endorsement by Constantine. After the definition of Christian orthodoxy, many long established Christian viewpoints were considered heretical cults. All emerging Protestant denominations were considered heretical cults by the Roman Catholic church - and the later movements (i.e. Quakers and Puritans) by the mainline Protestant churches as well. Almost all religious movements begin as a "cult" - a movement based on the charismatic appeal of one individual. So where in history should the article start? The sources for the article are very recent and reflect modern perspectives and prejudices (which are usually based on old ideas lurking in the mist). Although an interesting, and exhausting effort, I would have to vote to delete. But incorporating the sources -- and the reasons the sources assert these movements are cults -- into existing articles could be useful. Controversial and edgy, perhaps, but useful. This would allow counterpoints and sources to be presented. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 06:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> article strikes me as odd, with its introductory paragraph about "cult" in what is now a less-used sense, and its continuation with "Definitions of 'cult'" whose concluding paragraph reads "However, in common usage, 'cult' has a very negative connotation, and is generally applied to a group in order to criticize it." (Perhaps to criticize. Or perhaps simply to describe the unpleasant reality of the organization in a terse and immediately understandable way.) If "cult" indeed usually meant something like "locally unusual or unorthodox religious group", it would indeed be meaningless, but since it (I think) usually means a (pseudo-/quasi-) organization that has a fairly well recognized number of traits, a list seems, if not useful, then potentially useful. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:13, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <s>I don't think that this list is original research.</s> On second thought I agree with Pjacobi that this may veers off into original research if we use each and every (fringe) source.

If the question <i>which media and government labels which organization</i> a cult (<i>in which meaning of the word "cult"</i>, preferably) is an area of active research on scholarly base, and results of this research can be quoted, then there would be no problem with putting up a list.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Pjacobi, it sounds like what you are saying is that this article would avoid the "original research" problem you think you see if we simply included every single accusation ever from any source at all no matter how fringe -- that way we'd be doing no "original research" in trying to determine which claims have any credibility or notability, which is the objection you raised. The prohibition on "original research" is <i>just that</i> -- a prohibition on <i>original</i> research. Looking at what others before you have said on the subject isn't original research, it's just research. Weighing the significance of what others have said on the subject by factors such as credibility and notability doesn't make it original research, either, just still plain research. As I've said, if we start misclassifying the sourcing of articles and the weighing of sources as "original research" there's little on Wikipedia we <i>won't</i> have to delete. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:42, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: That would be correct -- <i>if</i> it were true that saying something is a "cult" is "never [anything] more" than namecalling. While many people like to claim exactly that as if it were true, all it takes to prove it untrue is to look at <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_checklist.html" title="Cult checklist">cult checklist</a>. These are professionals in government and in academia who are clearly using the word and the concept in an attempt to predict and to understand, not to namecall. You may not <i>agree</i> with their theories, and that's fine. You may have the POV that every scholar who ever entertained the notion that the theoretical construct of "cult" ever had any value has their head up their backside -- and that's a legitimate POV. But to claim that no allegation that a group is a cult can <i>ever</i> be more than namecalling, and to call for deletion of this article based on that opinion, is to ask Wikipedia to <i>endorse</i> your POV above all those others.

<dd>The cult checklists — plural — are subjective, vague and contradictory. The cult checklists are not specific enough to objectively include some groups while excluding more mainstream ones. It is namecalling and an ideological weapon, not science.
<dl>
<dd>As I've said before, you are completely entitled to your opinion that the science involved is bad. However, if you are claiming that there is <i>no</i> science involved, and that the word only exists so that purported experts can dress up namecalling -- would you care to explain why said purported namecallers would try to define criteria that could then be used to <i>exclude</i> groups from said namecalling? The intent is clearly more than namecalling. Your POV may be that that intent can never be realized, that there is something inherent in the word "cult" that prevents it from ever being used to designate a legitimate sociological concept. But don't expect that Wikipedia has to endorse your POV. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:02, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After looking at the list more closely, I am disgusted. Harmless groups like the Hare Krishnas, Christian Scientists, and Sathya Sai Baba are not distinguished from groups of murderers like Al Qaeda and the Manson Family.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I have been observing this discussion from the sidelines, and what I see is that editors are missing the <b>fact</b> that this is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical.html" title="Ethical">ethical</a>, and deeply <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal.html" title="Personal">personal</a> discussion, not a POV vs. NPOV, blacklisting/namecalling, original researrch or the like. This is all about the politics of the countercult/anti-cult (a very unlikely coalition of new leftists, evangelical Christian fundamentalists, and skeptics) vs. the politics of the moderate religious, the academia, and some open minded libertarians, are at the core. These politics are unlikely to disappear precisely because of the political act's ability to polarize issues, to disguise aspects of those issues which do not serve the various poles or positions. A huge amount of intellectual energy has been spent on defining (or more correctly, <i>attempting</i> to define) the word "cult". This discussion being yet another one in that cacophony of voices, is not unique or any different. Then, of course, there are the no less powerful arguments fueled by a deep personal agenda: apostates vs. new religions, rightist vs. leftists, and the wide gamut of strong opinions stirring the pot of any discussion about beliefs, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">freedom</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. If one is to judge the related articles on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cults.html" title="Cults">cults</a>, cult apologists, and the like, one will find the <i>same</i> political divide as in this discussion, and the same editors at each side of the battlefield. It will be interesting to see if Wikipedia and its NPOV policy can move from utopia to reality: Accepting the politics involved will be a honest first step. The outcome of debates like this one, and the dismissal or acceptance of articles like this one into the Wikipedia fold, will undoubtedly shape the future and relevance of this encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User%7E38.119.107.70.html" title="User:38.119.107.70">38.119.107.70</a> 03:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. This is an encyclopedic <i>topic</i> of general interest. The <i>article</i> may have to be renamed and/or reworded, but that is beside the point. Fact is, the word "cult" gets used (not by us, but demonstrably by others), and the question of who uses it to describe which organizations is inherently interesting. One may think that the article title is POV, but that only warrants a call for improvement, not deletion. There are many articles with seemingly POV titles (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_that_are_considered_the_greatest.html" title="List of countries that are considered the greatest">list of countries that are considered the greatest</a>) and neutral, factual contents. This particular list clearly strives for accuracy and includes relevant disclaimers as well as a definition of its scope. That's more than can be said about other lists on controversial topics. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 19:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: We are not comparing like with like. Read <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_that_are_considered_the_greatest.html" title="List of countries that are considered the greatest">list of countries that are considered the greatest</a> - it actually deals in verifiable and notable facts. So, in a manner does this article, but the fact that some journalist once called a certain group a cult, although verifiable, is n<b>ot notable</b>. There are so many definitions of 'cult' that anything might have been meant, and different things will have been meant, on each occaasion. To gather these disparate references together to create a list - creates a meaningless list. We might as well have a 'list of organizations at one time called bizzare' --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:54, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. POV.<br />
Edit. Add: So-called "rivalries" are mainly for the fans. MLB players are usually professional enough to keep their cool and just play the game, while the fans can get out of hand. There are no "official" listings of MLB rivalries. Some of the "rivalries" listed in that "article" are not even in the same division or league. The rivalries are from a fan's point of view. Much of the "rivalries" posted in Wikipedia were made by an anonymous user. The following articles <b>dumped the rivals</b> section that were once part of the articles:<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>, I do not see any POV at all. Plus, though MLB may not "official" sanction it, the fans are into it and sometimes, the rivialries will have an occasion fight or two.

<li>While I think there is certainly room for a list of (and articles on) the major Major League rivalries, I can't really be too sure of everything in this article, as I'm unfamiliar with it and most of the links are red. I'm also not sure if it's best to put the long standing rivalries alongside a single series. Nor do I know what the Bill Buckner Rivalry is, or what could be in such an article that isn't already covered at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Buckner_98a5.html" title="Bill Buckner">Bill Buckner</a>.

<li>The "Bill Buckner" rivalry is Mets/Red Sox, in reference to the '86 World Series and his famous blooper. It isn't so widely used, but it is immediately recognizable to any fan of the two teams. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:53, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, I wouldn't classify Red Sox/Mets as a Major League rivalry, particularly as both have a common enemy in the Yankees, which seems to trump all other rivalries. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:12, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of the rivalries were created by the fans, some were drum up by the press. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 04:23, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rivalries like "Bill Buckner" exist mainly to give the sports press something to ruminate over when these two teams happen to meet. That said, many fans care deeply about the '86 WS (and similar past meetings), so the notion of a rivalry isn't inappropriate -- it is just a lesser-known rivalry. I assume "Major League" refers to the sport, Major League Baseball, and not to the magnitude of the rivalry. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:13, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am part of a provincial league held in Montreal, Canada called "Montreal Warhammer 40,000k League. This is a character that was created for a computer simulation that represented the lowest level opponent. The character was never intended to be detailed to this extent but it seems a hapless fan of the character has fleshed out some of his finer details. Although, it seems a little crewd, this article is part of a series of articles of the same nature although the others are not detailed nor characterized to the same extent. It is my understanding that the organizers are using wikipedia to create an easily accessible online encyclopedia for their gamers. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 21:37, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Perpetual stub about a single song (as information about it is covered on the movie page). As it stands is only an opinion and some of the most obscure trivia one could ever dream of.

<ul>
<li>The difference between the songs is that "Over the Rainbow" is a famous song in its own right <i>independent</i> of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. It won an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>, became <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Garland_f81b.html" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>'s signiture song, and has been covered and used in many contexts independent of the film. "We're Off to See the Wizard", on the other hand, because it is so specific to the film itself, is only used in direct, allusional, or parodical reference to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. You'll never hear someone sing "We're Off to See the Wizard" at a talent show and expect to make an impact (unless they're staging an act or medley that includes other <i>Oz</i> songs). For the same purpouse, "<a href="../../../a/_/w/A_Whole_New_World_b30b.html" title="A Whole New World">A Whole New World</a>" from <i><a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin_%281992_film%29.html" title="Aladdin (1992 film)">Aladdin</a></i> deserves its own article (it was a #1 pop hit, and later became a popular wedding song), but "Prince Ali" and "Arabian Nights" do not. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 14:34, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, The Smogon.com community, both the web site and online forum, serves as the primary location for discussion between the most skilled online battlers from all the major and most influential competitive battling communities such as GameFAQs and Azure Heights, and between aspiring battlers for whom Smogon.com has become their primary resource concerning the metagames of all three generations. While Phroziac probably means well, if he/she were more familiar with the community/communities he/she would realize that there is no question about the significance of Smogon among competitive battlers.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just another Boy Scout Troop.

<ul>
<li>Each local council numbers its troops separately; there would have been other Troop 7's in other states and maybe even in other parts of the same state. By the way, I should have said that 43,984 troops is just the number of troops in the USA; Scouting exists in something like 160 countries. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:18, July 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's speedyable if you don't consider that being President of a JCR (i.e. head of a body with about 1,000 members) is a "remotely plausible" claim to notability.

<li><b>Weakest possible keep</b>. Liberal Democrat candidates for British parliament are encyclopedic, even if they have slightly naughty-sounding consistituency names (Tooting, since you asked).

<li>In fairness, some 640 people managed it, one for each Constituency. In the Lib Dems' case, about 580 of them then lost. This is unverifiable owing to my anonymity, but <i>I</i> have stood for election for the same party (to a local council) and lost; they just rang me up and said "we're short of a candidate in this seat which we're gonna lose anyway, but want people to be able to vote for us. Fancy doing nothing at all, apart from signing on the dotted line?". So I did. And I lost, and remain non-notable. Parliament's not the same as a local council, but the selection process isn't quite as rigorous as it might be, epsecially in the unwinnable seats. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 17:22, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The only thing Google brings up when you search for "Sashanan" is the GF mod and sites were he has been a member - Delete this useless entry</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basically a joke insult page about a well-known Gamefaqs poster. No value whatsoever.204.60.63.109 21:33, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Totally without any basis in fact. Just a joke entry designed to be very mean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As funny as it is, it's indeed a joke page that's made up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I propose we preserve this page as a example of "How to design well-made joke articles."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I propose that, although there may very well be a "famous" GameFAQs user (if such thing exists) who is aware of the myth, that a definition of such a myth is not inherently "insulting" to anyone who uses this, online. The name is also used (derived from the original Dutch mythology) in Quest for Glory 2, which presumably explains the provenance of the name on such a site. It is hardly appropriate if, for example, someone who uses "Mr Punch" as a username online should complain to Wikipedia about the appalling level of violence associated with such a name, on this site. The value of this article, too, is to educate those who have no idea of such a folklore figure, which seems to number in the threes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree with the sentiment that the article should be preserved to educate those who don't know the Dutch mythology. Just because it's some "famous GameFAQs user" took the name Sashanan doesn't mean that the article should be deleted. For instance, "<a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu.html" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a>" is a mythological god that many users on message boards take for a username. <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu.html" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a> isn't necessarily a favorable god since he has been rumored to be a "devourer of souls." If someone complained from another internet message board saying that the article on <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu.html" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a> should be removed because it portrays them in a negative light, I highly doubt the artcle would be removed. This is because, just like Sashanan, <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu.html" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a> is a character rooted in mythology and perhaps the user that chose that name should have thought more into it before doing so. In conclusion, I believe that this article should remain on Wikipedia, regardless of whether some "GameFAQs" user took the name without knowing its full meaning. Thank you.</li>

<li>Delete- No value as an article. No sources are cited, and the latter paragraphs make it apparent it's a joke.<a href="../../../t/o/f/User%7EToffile_98ee.html" title="User:Toffile">Toffile</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Delete - There is <b>no such mythological figure, dutch or otherwise</b>. Those arguments would be fantastic if there were actually any root in reality of the entry. Instead, it is a well-written but completely fallacious article. None of the statements about Dutch mythology have any basis in history. They are just handily written to be a malicious jab at an individual.</li>

<li>Just because a myth is not well-known ("no such mythological figure") doesn't seem like a very good reason to erase it from Wikipedia. Surely the purpose of such a site as this is to educate and inform, even about even mythic figures? Even those who exist through fairy-tales, passed down by word of mouth ("have any basis in history"). It seems unfortunate that such oral history and culture should be erased from existence, merely because it isn't "written down".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oral history and culture are important to be sure. However, this particular "legend" is not oral history or culture in the traditional sense. It is not old. It hasn't been passed down through generations. It is merely a product of a clever mind and its desemination is a disservice to the users of the site and a black mark on the idea of wiki journalism. The fact that without any substantiation or documentation purely fanciful and incorrect information is allowed to be posted without review is a serious cause for concern for the idea of a wiki fact site. Just because something isn't written down doesn't mean that there is no substantiation. Other oral histories, myths and fairy tales are documented through cultural studies - not necessarily written down by those continuing the oral tradition. Just because you claim that something has basis in historic mythology doesn't mean that it actually has it.</li>

<li>It may not be as widely known, or as photographed (it is considered impossible to capture his image using conventional photography) as the Loch Ness monster ("It is not old. It hasn't been passed down through generations") or such myths which have a more factual basis, but raising awareness of such myths seems to be of value to our culture, rather than something which is worthy of censure. The Yeti, Sasquatch etc are not considered worthy of Wiki-deletion, merely because they may, or may not, resemble many users of the internet. ("In fact, even the image is just a photoshopped picture of the mod") Without being able to compare the two, has it ever occurred to you that the person in question may have knowingly named himself after the legendary beast; perhaps because he was aware of any similarities between himself and the creature? Complaining that myths have a fantastic, almost mythic quality (!) seems as silly as complaining about use of photoshop when handling photos. Sashanan</li>

<ul>
<li>("an elaborate hoax") Aren't Bigfoot et al considered in precisely such a way? These myths are not considered worthy of deletion, merely because many people are aware of the myth. It seems a pity to delete less widely-known myths, simply because they are not quite so well known. Hopefully, Wikipedia exists to inform people about things which may not necessarily be part of common currency?

<li>I Googled the name "Sashanan." Know what I got? Nothing, and I mean <i>nothing</i> but hits referring back to the GameFAQs user. Same results Googling "Sashanan myth." No mythological info whatsoever. However, I'm keeping an open mind. If you can point me to a legitimate website stating that Sashanan is indeed part of Dutch mythology, I will gladly and immediately change my vote and offer my sincerest apologies for accusing you of a hoax. You're right about one thing: This site does exist to inform of things that are not widely known yet remain notable. A mythological creature with a long history is more than worthy of inclusion, even though it may be nearly unknown outside its area of origin. - Lucky 6.9 19:54, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not only does there have to be an actual "Sashanan" in Dutch mythology for this to be an appropriate entry, there needs to be a correlation between the description listed in the entry and a scholarly definition. As this description is tailored exactly to the individual user on GameFAQs, I highly doubt that such a correlation exists. At the very least this is a highly inaccurate description and at the worst, it is libelous. Certainly the link to the "blog" contains libelous material including a despicable phone conversation between a member of "LUELinks" and the father of the GameFAQs user Sashanan. I don't know what forms of censure are available on wikipedia but I feel that the author of this article should be subject to the most severe possible. Not only is this article likely false, but it is written in such a way that because of its excellent construction and brave exposition of "facts" it manages to fool some people and maintain a false guise of legitimacy. 132.239.153.57 20:15, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>("If you can point me to a legitimate website stating that Sashanan is indeed part of Dutch mythology") Is Wikipedia not a legitimate site? It's a pity that to be considered legitimate for certain Wikipedians, something must be universally known. These clear, demonstrable facts are clearly what makes such figures as Bigfoot so worthy of their entries. ("At the very least this is a highly inaccurate description and at the worst, it is libelous") It would be diffiicult to libel a mythic figure. It is probably causing the supreme court nightmares, with the potential claims from Bigfoot, Yeti, the Loch Ness monster ("I've been defamed in this Scottish lake for years! I don't even like haggis!") etc in the works. ("brave exposition of "facts") The entry contains few, if any facts. It deals with mythology, the perception of truth, which has little primacy - merely accounts from those who (perhaps) claim that their version of the myth is more correct. If someone uses their imagination to overcome child abuse, which is what these stories most likely are, then who are we to deny them such mythic crutches? ("I Googled the name Sashanan") It would be interesting if you disputed the accuracy for the Wikipedia entry for "God", on grounds that nobody has been able to contact, or has seen, him directly, and that his website and email address are not available through search engines such as google. Sashanan</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>("Is Wikipedia not a legitimate site?") That is riduculous. You can't assert that your entry is real by referring to your entry for corroboration. You can't pick yourself up in a bucket by pulling on the handles. Further, you state at one point that there are "clear, demonstrable facts" yet later mention that the entry contains "few if any facts." Which is it? 24.165.29.82 05:18, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>For all interested parties: <b>the name "Sashanan" was created by Sierra, Inc.</b>, a computer software company, in the early 1990s. The character Sashanan first appeared in one of the sequels to the "Quest for Glory" video game series. This is the origin of the name, not any mythology. Feel free to contact Sierra, or any current holder of Sierra's intellectual properties, for all the corraboration you might need. 68.47.80.157 05:27, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(<i>"by referring to your entry for corroboration"</i>) The poster concerned asked for a "legitimate" site where Sashanan was defined. Is this not such a site? I have no idea whether this is corroborative, or not. But I have many sources available which will lend some, small credence to this myth. If you accept that this is even possible to do? (<i>"This is the origin of the name"</i>) I am uncertain whether such companies will admit to hijacking such myths. But it seems as if you accept that this myth has currency outside of a GameFAQs user, which seems to be the central complaint in this thread. (<i>"you state at one point that there are "clear, demonstrable facts"</i>) If you look at the entry, you will be able to see that I refer (in an entirely non-ironic way) to the "clear, demonstrable facts" surrounding such myths as Bigfoot, the Yeti and the Loch Ness monster. Doubtless you'd agree that such non-existent facts are what make them worthy of a Wikipedia entry? Some entries on Wikipedia have no basis in any actual, demonstrable reality. Yet they still exist. It seems curious that you'd seek to deny this entry its existence, based on its supposed fantasticness. Sashanan 16:28, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>("If you look at the entry, you will be able to see that I refer (in an entirely non-ironic way) to the "clear, demonstrable facts" surrounding such myths as Bigfoot, the Yeti and the Loch Ness monster") Your entry also implied that there are similar "clear, demonstrable facts" available for the "Sashanan myth." I assert that there are none other than the ones you or your cronies invent. 24.165.29.82 21:21, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(<i>"Your entry also implied that there are similar "clear, demonstrable facts" available for the Sashanan myth"</i>) My entries have never mentioned any such thing, and have always maintained that there are few demonstrable truths in the make-up of made-up, mythic beasts, it is one reason why they have such a name. As far as having "cronies" goes, this is something you've produced from your <i>own</i> imagination. I am writing a book about the mythology <i>"Lesser known fables - Aesop to Ziethor"</i> of less well known folk figures, such as the Sashanan, and many of my sources will be available to view; once I receive permission, and approval of the translations etc. I hope these will be enough to corroborate what I believe to be an interesting myth, which has already seen quite some interest - judging from the responses to this thread. And that Wikipedians will allow some, small licence to explore areas of the human experience outside of the mainstream, since most of the things that happen on the fringes are quite fascinating in their own way. Few would seek to deny the entries on such subjects as UFOs, merely because they are mentioned in quite so many computer game sites and such. Sashanan 11:14, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I will kindly ask that you drop this charade. You know as well as I do that there is no such myth. The fact is: Sashanan is the name used by <b>a GameFAQs moderator, who happens to be Dutch</b>. This "myth" is simply part of a series of attacks on him that started on the GameFAQs boards approximately one month ago, and has clearly extended beyond them. The characteristics of the so-called "mythological figure" stem from some particularly nasty rumors that were a part of these attacks. <i>Thus, this article has no basis in reality.</i> Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is that user's first edit...and I find myself in total agreement. Let's end this ASAP. "Fudge-packing" and "pedophilia" scream that this is an attack page. - Lucky 6.9 20:58, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>"The fact is:"</i>) This entry has no connection to anything except the myth concerned. Far from being connected to some anonymous user of some other, anonymous website, it seems that the myth has enough currency outside of itself to have been used as a pseudonym. It seems that you have already had a confession that the name was derived from a software company - who, in turn, derived the name from the myth honestly outlined here. Why you'd think that someone naming their account after a mythic figure is so difficult to believe would require quite an explanation. It would be impossible to connect someone, for example, who chooses to use the username "God" to any actual deity of this name. Although it would be an equally impressive to hear of such an individual attempting to delete the entry for "God" on Wikipedia, by claiming that he'd been insulted by such a comparison. Which he first made himself, by naming something as substantial as a pseudononymous account after a mythic figure. The purpose of Wikipedia is presumably to help educate people still? I can only apologise if my paltry words are not up to such a task. Sashanan 22:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You make the assertion that the software company took the name from the "myth" without any basis. Your arguments are wasting the time of people and your stated cause to have this remain is mendacious. The difference between "God" and "Sashanan" is that there are actually other people who have heard of god in the context of a deity whereas "Sashanan" is solely the creation of a game company and subsequently the name taken by the user of a website. Not a myth. 132.239.153.57 23:18, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(<i>"the software company took the name from the "myth" without any basis"</i>) You accept, then, that the individual you mention was not the originator of the name? I agree with you, though, that the name is widely know - and in the public domain. This is purely because of the mythic connections, which seem to be well known to those who have invested some time in researching such myths, at least. ("your stated cause to have this remain is mendacious") My aim is to educate those who have yet to hear of such a myth, which is hopefully something that Wikipedia still encourages. Particularly since (as this thread demonstrates) there are still some people who have yet to hear about the origins of such myths. It is a pity that you seek to deny everyone on this site the chance to educate themselves about something which you confess isn't very widely known. (<i>"there are actually other people who have heard of god"</i>) Well, I can't complain that the provenance of god is so widespread. It is a pity that Wikipedia, via you, seeks to deny anyone the means to educate themselves about the origins of the Sashanan. Just because something is not widely appreciated, like such realistic figures as Santa Claus, does not make it any less worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Perhaps I have more faith that topics which appear on the fringes are equally worthy of attention, but it would not be a great surprise to find that such pages are considered a waste of Wikipedia space. It's a pity, so far as the breadth of human understanding is concerned, however. Perhaps when Microsoft own this site, the generic entries will make everyone far more happy. Sashanan</li>

The additions have expanded the original entry, providing readers with more substance and some background about the origins and developments to the myth. I can only hope that providing information is still considered as a "positive" contribution to Wikipedia, even if the myth is not yet widespread enough to be readily accepted by everyone?

<ul>
<li>(<i>"a clear indicator as to the article's true purpose"</i>) The article's true purpose is to provide some information about a mythic figure. (<i>"Utter nonsense"</i>) It seems of slightly questionable merit to complain that mythic figures do not tally exactly with your own, earnest outlook on life. These myths are rarely meant to be cosy tales. The stories seem designed both to challenge our values and act as a warning to children. In this respect, the Sashanan seems to fulfil the needs which such myths are founded on. (<i>"on GameFAQs moderator Sashanan"</i>) Although there have been complaints that someone has used the name on a computer games site, they seem almost arbitrary ones. It is hardly Wikipedia's concern, whether users of external sites use such usernames, even more fantastic that there are any complaints about the myths that are the basis of such names. (<i>"Let's end this ASAP. "Fudge-packing" and "pedophilia" scream that this is an attack"</i>) Similarly, complaining that confectionary (Hansel and Gretel) or paedophilia (Red Riding Hood) should dare to be mentioned in relation to yet another mythic figure seems like a unique grievance. The myth existed long before the internet was invented and will hopefully last until Microsoft's internet XP is released. In the meantime, I have provided a typical account of a confrontation with the Sashanan on the discussion page, and am prepared to use similar quotes from my book (as sources) once it is published.

<ul>
<li>Recommended: <b>keep</b>. A user on an external site using the name of this mythic beast pseudononymously seems like one of the most incredible reasons to delete an article that has ever been produced. Fortunately for my delicate sensibilities, it doesn't offend me to be linked with my own research. (<i>"the IP is registered to a UK internet provider"</i>) It seems like a sensible precaution to prohibit anyone who dares to exist in the UK from contributing to this site. It ensures that well-researched, and "well-written" articles have little chance of appearing on these pages. It will be a pity, although exacting and appropriate, to have entries for such insignificant persons as Shakespeare, TE Lawrence and Churchill deleted. (<i>"I notice that you dodged my point about the "blog""</i>) It's fortunate for us, that few facts escape your attention. Luckily, the blog makes up part of the developing mythology, and has already been put into context by the article. Most, and perhaps all, myths which exist to frighten us will eventually, and perhaps always have been, a source of this kind of questionable, black humour; as earlier references to Punch and Judy make clear. It seems as if (even for no other reason) that these blogs are a way to reiterate and expand the mythology, since it is little known, outside (and seemingly inside) the Netherlands. Although it is yet another source which exists to expand on the ancient myth - and put it into a modern context. I prefer to think of it as being a modern variant of the oral tradition which such myths are founded on; or the way these myths are developed, in part, because of gossip. A pity, so far as I am concerned at least, that this is considered so worthy of censorship. It would be interesting to have your opinion on the bare-faced, wholly factual truth contained in such pages as <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_ness_monster.html" title="Loch ness monster">Loch ness monster</a>, however?

<ul>
<li>I find it rather amusing that you continue to simply dance around all the points brought up. It is quite clear that you are only trying to mislead. To make things perfectly clear, the "blog" page not only contains links to the LiveJournal site of the GameFAQs user Sashanan, but down near the bottom are multiple entries about being a GameFAQs moderator. It is quite foolish to claim that it is anything other than a series of insults.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(<i>"to simply dance around all the points brought up"</i>) I have attempted to address each and every concern which has been raised in connection to the mythology surrounding the Sashanan. Most of these concerns seem to be centred around an anonymous user of a computer games site, who named himself after the mythic beast. It is unfortunate that so many people feel that he has somehow insulted himself, by linking to the mythic creature so explicitly. There has already been a confession that this user was not the originator of the name and that it appears in many other sources. I have simply tried to expand on the actual origins of such myths. It's a pity that my attempts to educate people about such subjects is met with the resistance shown here. Why do you find it so difficult to open your mind to something outside of the everyday and the black and white? (<i>"To make things perfectly clear, the "blog" page not only contains links to the LiveJournal site of the GameFAQs user Sashanan"</i>) There have been no links made to any blogs produced by a user named Sashanan whatsoever, by myself. Since I have not been able to find such a blog, online. I have, however, received explicit permission to link to the blog used in the entry. Can you explain why you'd have a problem with expanding the myth, and putting it into a modern context for internet users - which is the point of such links? (<i>"Oh, and keep the anti-Bush rhetoric to yourself"</i>) Wikipedia makes it clear that you might find "terse, gruff, and abrupt" language and "that it is about the article, not about you" in discussions about deleted entries. It's nothing personal, you understand. Unless you happen to be the President concerned? Insofar as your own abusive efforts go, I would refer you here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">"I, for one, am tired of my intelligence being insulted"</a> I hope that you will see that it is intelligent users who should appreciate such entries, and be delighted that Wikipedia still welcomes those open-minded enough to encourage the development of such imaginative myths.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>It seems that you have proven my point completely. Anyone who visits the supposed "blog" will see the links to GF user Sashanan's LiveJournal, in plain view, at the top of the page. Furthermore, you neglect to explain the direct references to GameFAQs in the entries near the bottom of the page, in addition to the URL itself. (CJayC is the founder of GameFAQs.) There is no concern at all with any "mythology" at all, simply an attack. It has been shown quite clearly throughout the course of this discussion that there is <b>no Sashanan myth</b>, yet you continue to defend this collection of lies and personal attacks with convoluted replies that give no real information.</li>

"Sashanan", unless you can give a vaild link to a reputable source <b>outside of Wikipedia</b> that comments on "the Sashanan" (known web page, ISBN or title for a book, etc.), then I may assert that this page falls under the category of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original Research</a> and is thus disallowed by Wikipedia policy.

<li>(<i>"will see the links to GF user Sashanan's LiveJournal"</i>) No such link exists, so far as I am aware. (<i>"Furthermore, you neglect to explain the direct references to GameFAQs in the entries near the bottom of the page"</i>) No such references exist in the current entry, so far as I am aware. (<i>"There is no concern at all with any "mythology" at all"</i>) There is a great deal of concern with the mythology of such a figure, since this is what the article is all about. (<i>"unless you can give a valid link to a reputable source outside of Wikipedia"</i>) I have given a number of published sources, if you accept that a blog can be cited as such. Ditto to the videogame. If these are not acceptable, then my own research will be published soon - and it doesn't seem too presumptuous to give Wikipedians the chance to stay ahead of the traditional print media. I've always considered that the number of news stories which appear on the front pages of this site demonstrate that Wikipedia is more than the dry, dusty encyclopedia that some users would prefer it to be. (<i>"ISBN or title for a book, etc"</i>) CNash, you've already stated that the name appears in "the pages of European Mythological Gods and Goddesses" and that "this is in fact a true mythological figure", which sounds like you've already verified for yourself that the myth exists. And in what sounds like an authoritative tome, too. Sashanan 08:12, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Claiming to have not seen the links or the references mentioned indicates that you either have not even read the "blog" page, or are simply lying. Meanwhile, you also appear to have ignored the links posted by CNash. The "blog" is not a reputable source of information, and more importantly, it makes no assertions regarding a "mythological figure" whatsoever. Referencing the videogame is also pointless, as you cannot prove that its creators derived the name Sashanan from your supposed "myth." And even if you are writing a book on the subject that has yet to be published, this still falls under the category of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original Research</a> as CNash has stated.

<li>As I have mentioned before, changing someone's personal comments after they've written them is puerile and pathetic. This argument is going nowhere; you're a common troll, and continuing to argue the point is futile. The vote tally is against you; I suggest that we wait for arbitration. <a href="../../../c/n/a/User%7ECNash_5311.html" title="User:CNash">CNash</a> 21:01, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Nice work editing the "blog" page to include an entry on your "mythology." Directly below all of the blatant GameFAQs references you claim you can not see. Also, nice work removing the most obvious link to Sashanan's LJ. This work only serves to show that it is worthless as an information source. Let's do as CNash suggests, and simply wait. 64.252.220.25 23:46, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>(<i>"This argument is going nowhere"</i>) It seems as if the argument, if not the silly, sock puppet tally, is going against you. Your main concern seems to be the feelings of some anonymous user of some computer games site, who has named themselves after the myth I have been careless enough to have outlined. Why this should be cause for censorship is a mystery to me. I was delighted to have discovered, after seeing the original entry, that someone else had heard about the Sashanan myth and I have merely tried to expand on the entry - and provide some further background information. These efforts to make Wikipedia a more exhaustive source of information have been deemed not good enough, seemingly because they go some small way in confirming the existence of the myth. Which is deemed "puerile" and "well-written" amongst other things. (<i>"As I have mentioned before, changing someone's personal comments after they've written them is puerile and pathetic"</i>) All of the editing that <i>I've</i> done should be obvious, not least from my unique linguistic style. I can only assume that you have changed your mind since you originally posted your comments, for reasons best explained by yourself, to yourself. I have remained consistent in trying to preserve an interesting myth, and I have not changed the comments of anyone whatsoever. (<i>"Also, nice work removing the most obvious link to Sashanan's LJ"</i>) As far as I am aware, no such link exists on the blog. Or has ever existed. I can vaguely recall there being a few links to some other blank pages a while ago, but they seem to have disappeared - possibly because of their irrelevance? You would be better off asking the person who maintains the blog, who might be able to provide you with some other facts about the mythology? But feel free to provide a link to this other non-mythic blog, you mentioned, if you believe it is relevant in any way? Sashanan 17:59, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-existent term; basically nonsense. On 2005-06-12 01:26:36 Fawcett5 stopped it being a speedy with <i>Doesn't fit the definition of patent nonense</i>... she may be right; but its close.

<li><b>keep</b> - Without taking a position on the ultimate validity of the theory, it does look like it is a recognized term in academic circles.

<dd>Hmm, I admit the link you found exists. The problem is that the science is pretty dubious <i>The high temperatures of the nuclear fireballs could destroy the ozone gas of the middle stratosphere.</i> doesn't seem likely, and none of the refs you've found support it. (<a href="http://www.dtc.army.mil/tts/1997/proceed/abarnes/sld012.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dtc.army.mil/tts/1997/proceed/abarnes/sld012.htm" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> just mentions the phrase - no more; <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Pubs/Ecofablesdocs/Climatechangesinger.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Pubs/Ecofablesdocs/Climatechangesinger.htm" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> says <i>nuclear winter was really nuclear summer</i> and no more - what does this mean?

<dd>I found only two references to nuclear summer: <a href="http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=1504248&amp;q=&amp;uid=1183800&amp;setcookie=yes" class="external autonumber" title="http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=1504248&amp;q=&amp;uid=1183800&amp;setcookie=yes" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=e05db1c1b02c44f69bd3a60842088dfe&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,6,8;journal,59,69;linkingpublicationresults,1:403391,1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=e05db1c1b02c44f69bd3a60842088dfe&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,6,8;journal,59,69;linkingpublicationresults,1:403391,1" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>. This suggests that it is a small subject, but could be an altternative or a later stage of <i>nuclear winter</i> scenarios. In the light of this material, I come to roughly the same conclusion as the remaining people, except that I think the scenario does not yet have sufficient backing evidence or paper trail to stand as an independent encyclopedia entry. Therefore I suggest <b>merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_winter.html" title="Nuclear winter">nuclear winter</a>. Another reason for my vote is that most of the references, such as those given by <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a>, actually show that there is somewhat of a controversy over nuclear winter/summer. So the nuclear winter article needs to have a para describing nuclear summer. But if that is done, then there is not much more left to say in the article on nuclear summer. Of course, if there is sufficient new information, then I would revise my stand (once more). --<a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBambaiah_bac4.html" title="User:Bambaiah">Bambaiah</a> 12:54, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but expand. I've heard of this as an opposite viewpoint to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_winter.html" title="Nuclear winter">nuclear winter</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I apologise in advance for the moderately long message, but I really don't understand why this is even up for deletion. I see three reasons stated: advertising, vanity, and "non-notability." Advertising I find listed on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> page, and I quote: "Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style." Looking over the article, I can not find anything that is not written in such an unbiased and objective style. I only find the word "fun" occurring in two places, one referring to the "Fun Pack" addon and the other as quoted: "Gamelets are too small to charge for, but still offer up some fun," which does not really break the objective style, and no other "promotional" language is found anywhere. As for the constant linking, that was added in unasked-for by someone other than the original author and has since been removed. On these grounds, I challenge the accusations of advertising. Vanity I find on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity_page</a> page. I quote from near the beginning: "Usually, vanity authors write about themselves, their significant others, or their school teachers. While an article about a little-known company, say, should not automatically be taken as a vanity page, it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner or employee of or an investor in the company..." The original author of this article, drgamer (unless I am extremely mistaken) is none of these, and benefits nothing from having this article. The only other place I see where it can even be misconstrued as "vanity" is in the staff section, which I think is, in fact, pertinent. On these grounds, I challenge the accusations of vanity. And finally "non-notability," by which I assume you mean non-importance. Importance is discussed on the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a> page, and I quote: "An article is important and deserving of inclusion in Wikipedia if any one of the following holds true: 1. there is clear proof that a reasonable number of people (eg. more than 500 people worldwide) are or were concurrently interested in the subject..." There are currently over 500 users signed up at the Hamumu forums. Considering that Mike Hommel makes a living from making his games and hasn't starved yet, I conclude that his business far outstrips a mere 500 customers. Thus I would conclude that this article fulfills Wikipedia's official policy regarding importance.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not the author of the article, but I am the owner of the website. That alone pretty much makes it not vanity! I'm a well-known developer in the indie community, and I see no reason why my company should not be referenced on the Wikipedia as should any others well-known in that large space. My game <a href="../../../s/p/i/SPISPOPD_a3b4.html" title="SPISPOPD">SPISPOPD</a> has had a Wikipedia page for a long time (note: I also didn't make that page, though I made some edits), and it would make sense to have a page for the developer of it as well, given the linky nature of the wikipedia. I think this is of benefit to people who are using Wikipedia for what it is - an encyclopedia of information. If anyone has a desire to see it sounding less like advertising (it sounds unbiased to me!), they are certainly welcome to make edits. I wouldn't have any problem with chopping the Staff section down - talking about the cats sounds like vanity, but certainly no reason to toss the page. 63.16.208.227 14:36, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I sincerely hope you are not implying that the fact that it is being supported by people who have little to no other Wikipedia activity yet somehow negates the value of the arguments presented.

<li>Let's see the discussion was going fine: delete, delete, delete, keep (by the author, it's customary), delete, and then on the same day, within four hours of each other <i>three keeps</i> from accounts which were just created and then all happen to make their first edits voting on VFD, with remarkably similar arguments. I'll try to assume good faith that you are not all sockpuppets, but remember, "Anonymous and new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their votes may be discounted." I would close the discussion and delete it right now if I wasn't already the nominator. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:12, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see how that would be suspicious, but I merely ask that the arguments presented not be discarded without being even momentarily considered.

<li>You don't see a <i>single</i> good argument? Well I haven't seen any good claims to notability. Try to defend the Alexa ranking (<i>445,076</i>), if you can.

<ul>
<li>I apologize, I had never seen the guidelines page before. So that makes one good argument. Although I recommend you look at what Mike Hommel said again, including: "I'm a well-known developer in the indie community, and I see no reason why my company should not be referenced on the Wikipedia as should any others well-known in that large space." <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogdude_c3a1.html" title="User:Frogdude">Frogdude</a> 22:31, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure you <i>are</i> Mike Hommel. All four of you, including the creator of the article. Or else how did you happen upon an article about your company here when you appear to be an amateur here in the exact weeklong period that the article is up for deletion. Don't play dumb. Also, where do you get off saying Mike Hommel "makes a living" from this game and "hasn't starved," and that "there are currently over 500 users" if you are not him? How are you in a position to speak intelligently of such things if you are only some dipassionate Wikipedian voting on an article, and not the same person as the rest of the keep voters? And still <i>all</i> of your contributions have been only to this page. How can I conclude otherwise? --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:56, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
