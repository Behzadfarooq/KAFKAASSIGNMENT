<p>If this composer is notable, he probably needs to be merged with an article regarding the projects he worked with.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, not notable. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:02, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I just rewrote the article to a brief {{Composer-stub}}, adding a brief "Selected filmography" and a link to this person's entry in IMDB.com. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 08:10, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep: Alas, I'm not fond of it, but there are some folks who argue, very well, that film and television composers are composers. Once upon a time, people dismissed Morricone's music, and now he's recognized as a great. I hope music classes don't earnestly study the oeuvre of Mike Post <i>et al.</i> in the future, but this composer wrote theme songs for several shows, and that's a remarkable achievement. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Geogre. I wonder if he feels the same way about game score composers. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:09, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not at all. 8 tone bleep music is not a composition. There is a difference between a composer and a hack. When composers are sought for games, perhaps, but not when twitch fans simply believe their passtime to be OMG important like, because there is also a difference between the solipcism of adolescents and the criticism of adults. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:36, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think you've played many recent video games, maybe you also haven't read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:27, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe that's why I don't write articles about blip scores, I think they're fancruft. It's a possibility anyway. Otherwise, what you've got is not a "videogame composer," but a composer. Free yourself from the console. If a guy can't stand as a composer, he can't stand as a videogame composer, either. The reason for Ed Kalehoff's inclusion is that film and TV composers are being considered as composers, not as people who satisfy tube addicts. It doesn't matter what I or you think of the quality: are these composers the subject of study? If you have evidence that a SuperMario composer is being studied in Juliard, then bright that forward, please. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:38, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He actually is a very well-known composer of TV themes. The article is a little bad and could use a revision and expansion. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcfly85_4985.html" title="User:Mcfly85">Mcfly85</a> 17:41, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Someone who is more knowlegeable should add more information about him. He is a very prolific television composer. Would you dismiss <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lalo_Schifrin_e59a.html" title="Lalo Schifrin">Lalo Schifrin</a> as a television composer, since he did lots of TV work? How about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Williams_e0e5.html" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> who did oodles of TV work? The article does need to be expanded, maybe that would make you happy?!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Composer of lots and lots of TV music. <a href="../../../t/r/b/User%7ETrbleClef_9ee5.html" title="User:TrbleClef">TrbleClef</a> 20:32, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Kalehoff has written enough music for game shows alone to deserve his own entry. Some of the stuff he has written is iconic, like the cues and theme he wrote for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a>. As someone else here said, would you dismiss John Williams because he did a lot of TV work? I think not. The person who marked this for deletion, seems to be biased for some reason against Kalehoff.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my post in <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Prior_84f4.html" title="User talk:Ryan Prior">User talk:Ryan Prior</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In your opinion what defines "not widely recognized"? <a href="../../../e/d/d/Edd_Kalehoff_6ee7.html" title="Edd Kalehoff">Edd Kalehoff</a> has written some of the most widely recognized music in the United States including the very recognizable and iconic theme to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a> (along with other cues for the show). He has composed music for several television game shows and is well known for that. However, Kalehoff's contributions to music are not limited to television, he is well known within the music industry (especially in New York) as one of the best synth/keyboard players around and has done some innovative things with it, although you would most likely dismiss that since <i>you</i> never heard of him (or at least act as if you do).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now isn't the whole point of an encyclopedia to look information up? If you just <a href="../../../r/t/f/RTFM_dd93.html" title="RTFM">RTFM</a> you would see that the Edd Kalehoff article is just a stub worthy of expansion!</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone put this in for me and I should have wrote that here to start off with. I think the person who proposed the article for deletion may not understand the concept of looking up information. To them I say: I have looked at your track record you seem to advocate deleting a lot of articles that would be better off expanded. Are you some sort of <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorak_%28slang%29.html" title="Anorak (slang)">anorak</a> who just has a limited field of knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
From the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_Music_Incorporated_f75d.html" title="Broadcast Music Incorporated">Broadcast Music Incorporated</a> [<a href="http://bmi.com" class="external text" title="http://bmi.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>"BMI TV, film, theater and classical composers are equally successful. BMI legends such as Mike Post of "NYPD Blue," fame or Ed Kalehoff, who wrote the opening for "Monday Night Football," Charlie Fox, who penned numerous TV hits, including "Happy Days," and WG Snuffy Walden, whose first big theme was for "ThirtySomething" are a small sample of the composers represented by BMI."</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Now on a website geared to his peers they call him a legend and mention hime in the same sentence as three major composers, I think it would be bloody foolish not to include hime here. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpotteddogsdotorg_56c5.html" title="User:Spotteddogsdotorg">Spotteddogsdotorg</a> 17:22, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The person who thought the Edd Kalehoff article is worthy of deletion seems not to meet any of the qualifications for deletion, but instead meets all the qualifications for expansion.<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyvonmeistersinger_a2d9.html" title="User:Tobyvonmeistersinger">Tobyvonmeistersinger</a> 13:01, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He seems to be a very prolific composer who is recognized by his peers as a legend as the poster above mentions, and so what most of his work is in TV. I didn't know that he did the music for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a>, his bio linked the two and now I know something new. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 15:45, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
