<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I came to wikipedia when I heard the news to understand fully the significance. At a later date it may be appropriate to merge with an article about PDPC or Freenode, but at this time it is a useful and relevant page, and should be expanded, rather than deleted. His contribution goes beyond the creation of Freenode, because of the secondary effects of freenodes existence.--<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatscratch_6778.html" title="User:Catscratch">CatS</a> 12:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> His death was widely reported, that's enough for. If people search for him, I want them to come here for the information, and not somewhere else. If the creators of the other channels get the same attention that he did, they should get articles too. If the article on PDPC doesn't link to him, it should.

<li>Dying doesn't grant notability; my great-grandmother isn't in Wikipedia. He was only given attention for dying and asking people for donations for Freenode. Name something he contributed to computing other than Freenode. That's what this AfD is about, not "if we're top of the list in Google". --<b><a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJed_S_f122.html" title="User:Jed S">JS</a></b><a href="../../../j/e/d/User_talk%7EJed_S_5fa5.html" title="User talk:Jed S"><font size="-2">talk</font></a> 23:47, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Was the death of your great-grandmother reported in the media (geek-media, whatever)? His death was reported on many, many sites. He sure got a lot of attention for someone that wasn't notable at all. That's enough for me. As an aside, (and note: this isn't my real argument at all, just an aside. If this was just anyone, I wouldn't use this argument for his bio being kept, but since he was notable...), do we have to follow policy so damned ridgidly? Come on, the guy just died, lets show him some respect from people who really respected him. We don't have to be cold, calculating policy/process machines all the time. Lets be a little human, for once. <a href="../../../o/s/k/User%7EOskar_Sigvardsson_905b.html" title="User:Oskar Sigvardsson">Oskar</a> 23:58, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with you whole-heartedly on being sensitive. But a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rob_Levin_5c4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rob Levin">previous AfD</a> disagrees. I'm sorry, this was deleted and came back after his death. That's the core of the issue. Yes, my great-grandmother's death was reported on the AP wire in Oregon and on the station I worked at when she died. She would fail WP:BIO too. --<b><a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJed_S_f122.html" title="User:Jed S">JS</a></b><a href="../../../j/e/d/User_talk%7EJed_S_5fa5.html" title="User talk:Jed S"><font size="-2">talk</font></a> 00:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>History suggests otherwise - many people have been considered more notable after their deaths than before them. Take Shakespeare. During his life, a small number of people were aware of his work and his existence, after his death, his plays were published by those who knew him, and the resulting effect on the English language is considerable.

<li><b>Delete</b> personally I wish this hadn't come to an AfD, but whatever.

<li><b>Keep</b> Owning one of the largest IRC networks is quite noteable. Because of his death, many people would like to know who he was and what he did.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, there are other cases where similar occurrences don't have an entry in Wikipedia. But that's not a valid reason to delete this one; you have to start somewhere. As time goes by, lesser and lesser well known people will be mentioned in Wikipedia. This article has gathered a lot of attention and probably a number of links (I was pointed to it via IRC, for example). Removing it would serve no useful purpose. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroogle_7bb0.html" title="User:Groogle">Groogle</a> 01:08, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge/Redirect</b> into the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-Directed_Projects_Center_ac13.html" title="Peer-Directed Projects Center">PDPC</a> page. As was stated above, only reason for re-creating ("resurrecting" is a bit of a loaded word in this context) seems to have been Levin's passing, which while unfortunate, does not necessitate some form of memorializing by "letting him have" a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">P</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">ruvianLlama</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">spit</a>)</small></sup> 01:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The main reason given for the previous deletion was misinterpreting Rob's self-deprecation as a declaration he was non-notable. Surely even the coldest rule-following deletionist can see that this is a non sequitur - I'm sure you'd vehemently oppose anyone self-claiming notability after all. That Rob's daily successful battle with trolls, spammers and rule-exploiters to keep freenode a place for civilised discourse online should be commemorated by this kind of pettifogging is ironic indeed. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Marks_8699.html" title="User:Kevin Marks">Kevin Marks</a> 01:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/Redirect</b>...His death being "widely reported" doesn't make him notable. Deaths of soldiers in Iraq are reported by much more mainstream news sources but they certainly aren't notable enough for a Wikipedia page. Owning an IRC network that a few thousand people use isn't notable enough for Wikipedia, as we correctly determined during the first AfD.

<li><b>El k33p0</b>, circumstances have changed significantly since the last AFD, and I do think it is now a service to our readers to talk about Rob Levin.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I just searched wiki wanting to know who he was, after seeing simply a mention of condolence to his family on Gentoo Linux's main page. It was useful to me. More generally, I have to agree that the fact the other network creators don't have entries is hardly a logical reason to delete here. Just points out articles that need written. If that line of reasoning is somewhere in policy, I'm glad it hasn't been around since the start... We'd never have had a first article. I can just see it now: "Foo is a thing. Nothing else has an article. Ergo Foo shouldn't have an article." Highly useful line of reasoning there. Hatchetfish 05:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Rob was somewhat famous in IRC circles, and should be noteable by the wikipedia. I'd support an expansion of the page. Gibbie99 06:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge/Redirect</b> into the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-Directed_Projects_Center_ac13.html" title="Peer-Directed Projects Center">PDPC</a> page. PDPC is relatively well-known, but outside of that network, Rob Levin really isn't. His death was tragic for certain, but Wikipedia can't become a list of obituaries for niche tech celebrities. A mention of who Rob Levin was and what he did for PDPC would be appropriate on the PDPC page itself, but the event is not notable or historically significant enough at this time for its own entry on Wiki. If PDPC winds up collapsing in on itself due to the loss of Levin, I would consider re-evaluating my position, but I don't see that happening. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Parnell_0923.html" title="User:Dan Parnell">Lumbergh</a> 06:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Always be wary if the subject asks for deletion, that's my guess. In this case, I guess he was just too modest. =) That said, Levin was probably well-enough known in IRC and open source circles in general to warrant an article of his own. Not a <i>hugely</i> influential person, but one whose name tends to stick in mind. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Levin made Freenode, I think that's notable, right?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Rob Levin, as well as the rest of past/present Freenode staff, put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into making Freenode what it is today. It has been said that he hasn't done much (if anything) for the Free/Open Source Software communities, which I would like to contest: the birth of OPN (now Freenode) gave many many projects a place where they could comminicate and collaborate <b>in real-time</b>, and of course a place where users and developers alike could converge. If that's not a significant contribution, I don't know what is... - beu 11:12, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> for ridiculousness. If that's not process-oriented enough, keep per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Restore redirect. Subject individually, without any offence meant, isn't notable for dying in a car crash - we don't have articles on every victim of car accidents - and subject himself noted that he probably shouldn't have an article (see first nom). – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 10:33, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He was notable for his hard work, and various issues involving freedom, collaboration with FSF, etc.. Ultimately,the only way to judge what is or is not notable is if enough people interested. The very fact that people created this page and are voting for 'keep' points to the need to keep this. If his untimely death did contribute to the interest in this page, so be it. What matters is that enough people are interested.-- [User:deego]]</li>
