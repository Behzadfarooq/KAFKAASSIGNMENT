<ul>
<li>The article presents itself as a first-hand report, and does not identify a source for the report other than itself, which is what matters, regardless of the nationality of the editor who wrote the text. Another issue, which is verifiability -- articles on Wikipedia need to cite sources; Wikipedia's not the place to put original research, essays, etc -- any major point of views mentioned ultimately need a a source, and things like firsthand reports have a problem here, as well. Wikipedia's role is to document the notable points of view, not to form or describe new opinions about subjects written about in articles, but this article cites no source for the description given, only a stray link to score numbers. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 22:39, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, that link entirely verifies the entire article. It may not be clear to someone who doesn't understand exactly how cricket works, but that isn't our fault. The information is true, the information is verifiable. It is even going to be merged soon. Are you going to continue to ignore that fact? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 22:42, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It is verified by the scorecard - they scored 282 runs in the space of 45 overs - which, FYI, is a fairly high score in cricket. Glamorgan then scored much slower, and lost a wicket, hence the commanding position. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 05:35, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It's true. It's verifiable. It's going to be merged into a bigger article soon enough. What are people's issues with these pages? As for the neutrality thing, anyone is allowed to place their comments on an AfD nomination. It just happens that many of these nominations have happened before, so cricket fans on Wikipedia are used to coming together to deal with this kind of stuff. Neutrality is quite clearly not an issue. If users were neutral, after all, they wouldn't have an opinion to keep or to delete! (I jest, by the way—I know you meant that the above users are biased.) What harm does keeping this article do? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 18:38, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, they will get merged, and soon. That isn't, by the way, as a consequence of AfD decisions, rather because <i>that was always what was going to happen</i>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 19:48, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why, as a matter of fact I have, and if you have read my comment in the other AfD, I have no idea, beyond a personal attack, why you would believe my position is "ignorant". What no one has convinced me of is why Wikipedia should contain reports of daily ordinary sports events in general, or that English league cricket match results are notable in specific, <i>regardless</i> of whether they are in their own articles, merged into a big article, or whatever.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We have discussed this before and agreed keep each time. Remember that this article is part of a series about the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a>. Effectively <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WP:Cricket</a> is creating an almanack that will, in time, exceed <i>Wisden</i> in depth (though probably not renown). It's an excellent source that I use myself for checking on the season. Series of articles such as this are good for Wikipedia - and isn't that what we're all here for - improving WP? <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:11, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Disturbing to say the least. If WP:Cricket wants to be taken seriously, I suggest you first lobby for some sort of cricket clause in the official policy. Doing it this way is not improving WP; it's creating an internal CricketPedia without establishing a reasonable consensus. We have <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiCities_b967.html" title="WikiCities">WikiCities</a> for those sort of things. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 20:49, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nonsense. One of WP's strongest points (and one of the reasons for its great success) is its willingness to accept all information. Consider how we're a great resource for Pokemon information, and info on Star Trek. There's even a Klingon WP! This sort of in depth info is what makes WP great. If you don't want to read this section, that's fine - but it's useful info for those who do want to read it, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:57, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Jon is quite right. I also would note that WikiCities would not allow a wiki that covers area that Wikipedia could also cover. Your two points: <i>creating an internal CricketPedia without establishing a reasonable consensus</i> see <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>; <i>I suggest you first lobby for some sort of cricket clause in the official policy</i> oh come on.
