<li>Sure, I can certainly understand why we appear to lack notableness (the journal is new and lacks content, so, yeah, it is not notable in that regard) but when sociologists see what is developing and examine the editorial advisory board it is more than notable; it is a real powerhouse; it's not that we just have some famous people on board (I know that fame is not notability around here) but tnys.org represents a major convergence of established and emerging intellectuals that rivals anything of its kind. tnys.org is administrated out of a single campus but that's just the administrative unit.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I totally understand why we look like candidates for deletion and, if that's the decision, so be it. Just keep in mind that when a sociologist examines tnys.org it's pretty darned impressive. Thanks. tnys</dd>

<li>TNYS has the makings of what could very well evolve into a respectable journal. And when that happens, Wikipedia should list it. I also see no reason why it can’t be listed now as an organization created with the purpose of creating a journal. My only point is that Wikipedia needs to differentiate between The New York Sociologist published by the New York Sociological Association and TNYS published by Cortland State College. I think Tikiwont’s disambiguation page does just that and I appreciate the effort. I’ll create copy for the NYSSA page. As to how NYSSA and Cortland work out the same title problem, that is not Wikipedia’s concern, so long as we find a way to make the existence of the two efforts clear. The fact still stands that NYSSA is a statewide organization of sociologists that counts among its members, Cortland State College sociology faculty, NYSSA has been holding conferences for 53 years, NYSSA has been developing a journal since 2005 when calls for papers went out, and NYSSA published a peer reviewed journal in 2006. That journal is online. There is no reason to delete an entry referencing it. I suggest two pages: one with “NYSSA” in parenthesis and one with “SUNY Cortland” in parenthesis if the consensus is to not delete that listing. NBeat 02:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)NBeat</li>

<dd>Your point is understandable, but unfortunately wikipedia has explicit policy that says you can't have an article about something that is not notable (or in existance) but <i>might</i> become notable (or exist) in the future.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete both</b>. The The new york sociologist / TNYS (Cortland State College) journal <i>really does</i> have a very impressive advisory board, but has not yet achieved enough notability in its own right. Not surprising since it hasn't launched yet. The The New York Sociologist (NYSSA) journal article is not dissimilar, having only just launched. That there is no <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Sociological_Association_8272.html" title="New York State Sociological Association">New York State Sociological Association</a> article speaks volumes. -- <a href="../../../z/z/u/User%7EZzuuzz_ab5e.html" title="User:Zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a><sup><a href="../../../z/z/u/User_talk%7EZzuuzz_d9bf.html" title="User talk:Zzuuzz">(talk)</a></sup> 21:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually there was, but the author created the page with the NYSSA abbreviation in the title. It's now at the correct page. I take the organization's 50-year history as some sort of notability assertion, but other than that the organisation is also borderline notable. AfD'ing it is left as an exercise to anyone interested. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 00:26, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>weak delete</b> but the key issue for me, is that the journal is <i>not yet published,</i> and acccording to its web site, does not have the first issue scheduled <i>until 2008</i> (as is said in the above discussion) I don't think we have any basis just yet for entering it. From what I've seen here, we wouldn't include any media that far in advance of publication, with no idea yet of what is to be actually included. It's good that you are starting to establish its web presence, but even librarians do not usually think seriously about a journal until it has at least a table of contents for the first issue. Come back then--as I think everyone above has said. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
