<li><b>Delete</b>. Not every judge is notable--there are tens of thousands of people who have served as a judge in the U.S. in one capacity or another. Has this judge worked on even <i>one</i> high-profile, notable case? No, there is no evidence given of that. True, he was college roommates with someone who now holds high public office, but the only way that would ever be notable would be if the judge owes his position to his friendship with the senator, which no one has so far suggested. The person who created the article has already admitted that the only reason he created it is because it's about his dad and he's proud of him. That's a nice sentiment, but it doesn't create notability. Furthermore, Tparker393's outbursts and violations of Wikipedia civility standards further damage his case through emotionalism, when he would be better off assembling and presenting independently verifiable <i>evidence</i> of his father's notability, if any indeed exists. --Stan 4.246.120.153 20:18, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to give an idea of proportion: The ratio of circuit court judges to citizens in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfax_County%2C_Virginia_71ab.html" title="Fairfax County, Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a> is one judge for 55,000 people. A similar ratio is found in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_County%2C_Virginia_2940.html" title="Prince William County, Virginia">Prince William County, Virginia</a> – 5 circuit court judges for 280,000 people, or 1:56,000. Extrapolating that to a nationwide population of 300 million, that would be about 5,400 judges of comparable notability. So, Stan is right that there have been tens of thousands of judges of comparable notability in the entire history of the U.S. However, it is worth considering that the U.S. population was only 150 million as late as <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, and was only 76 million on <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>. See <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/urpop0090.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/urpop0090.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. So, it may not be in the high tens of thousands. And, I am not sure that anyone is contemplating writing an article about all of them. I think this is a borderline case as the article stands now. Perhaps more facts to establish notability will emerge. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 01:32, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>LOL. Yes, by all means, let's get a grip on a sense of proportion here. According to the Fairfox County website <a href="http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/police/animal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/police/animal.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, there is one <b>dog catcher</b> per every 41,304 county residents (950,000 divided by 23). Who wants to volunteer to write a Wikipedia article for each one of those dog catchers, mmmm? That's 23 "animal control officers" for us to research. Let's track down all of their sons and invite them to write articles about their dads or moms. Bear in mind that the animal control field requires years of study and preparation, that the officers' kids are very proud of them, and that at least some of those dog catchers must have once been friends with somebody more important than they are, perhaps even a U.S. Senator. --Stan 4.246.120.153 03:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The dog catcher analogy is poor, unless your dogcatcher authors legal opinions that are used as binding precedent to clarify and define laws and policies that you live under. My dogcatcher does no such thing, so he's not nearly as notable. How many similar articles might be written is conjecture, and conjecture is poor criteria for deciding the merit of any individual article. Compare and contrast this to all the minor candidates from obscure political parties for Congress/Parliament and Executive positions that have articles here: it seems that to run for a Legislative or Executive office and fail is more notable than to actually hold office in the Judiciary. If before I saw this VfD, I were seeking an unbiased view of the Circuit Court judges in my jurisdiction, I would have checked the official government page first, but Wikipedia for a second, NPOV opinion. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 03:39, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Au contraire, the dog-catcher analogy is entirely apt. If a judge is notable because he serves 55,000 people within a certain county, then a dog catcher who serves a population of 43,000 within that same county is within the same range of notability. Furthermore, judges are liable to have their decisions overturned by higher authority. Almost always, the dog catcher has the final word. Whether we are judging judges or judging dog catchers, we must ascertain whether the individual is notable <i>within his field</i>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpo_Marx_34e0.html" title="Harpo Marx">Harpo Marx</a>, for instance, will always be more notable for <i>playing</i> a dog catcher in <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_Soup_1582.html" title="Duck Soup">Duck Soup</a> than Jeffrey W. Parker has ever been notable as a judge in real life. One must come to <i>understand</i> the essentials of notability. The Judge Parker who was the 1904 Democratic nominee for President is notable because, like Harpo playing a dog catcher, he was playing a notable role on a wide stage. According to what has been presented so far, the Judge Parker under discussion here (Jeffrey W. of Fairfax Co. VA) is very important in one small room in Virginia, but has done nothing that makes him especially notable among the 10,000+ people in US history who have been judges. Judge Parker needs to do something <b>big</b>, and he has only a few hours left to do it in. A high-profile case. The solution to the world's biggest crossword puzzle. A cameo on the Howard Stern Show. Something. And fast. C.W.MerchantC W Merchant 20:03, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Having an opinion is one thing but don't be a jerk- I'm certain that judges on any level go through more schooling and make more critical decisions than dog catchers.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 "delete" votes (one anonymous user discounted), 4 "keep" votes (one probable troll discounted), 1 "transwiki" and 2 "redirect". The transwiki vote also has to be discounted because it would create copyright problems. Despite it's week on VfD and a number of edits to the article, it has even less content than when it started and yet all the edits make sense. I can't find a better version to revert to. 9 to 6 is a clear majority to delete but does not reach the level of concensus necessary. The decision defaults to "keep" for now.</p>
<p>Because of the negligible content, I am going to exercise my authority as an ordinary editor to turn the article into a redirect. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:16, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And futher more, I would like to add, that both the articles that ESkog has mainly contributed to, appear to be about sports arenas.

From looking at what I might consider a "model" high school entry, I think a great deal of the article may need to be removed, such as the list of faculty or the detailed descriptions of clubs which could be listed under thousands of high schools. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 02:25, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Move</b> - I agree with Peter Ellis. If this article is to be kept, it needs to be moved to a more specific article title. It may be located in a larger and more politically significant Albany, but it's still ultimately just a high school, so its location does not afford this article superior right to the article name over Albany SHS in WA. Also, although the Western Australian school is named "Albany <i>Senior</i> High School", it is common practice in these parts to just refer to these schools as "Albany High". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 15:59, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</s> Edit: I see the page has now been moved to a more appropriate title. <b>Keep</b>. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 16:08, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Part of the problem here is the presumption that there is consensus that "non-notability" is sufficient grounds for deletion. Deletionists toss around "non-notable" as if it meant something. Some don't even bother with that and shorten it to "NN". Let's be clear: no such consensus exists. See <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Jimbo Wales' view on notability</a>, as expressed in the poll where notability failed to become an accepted reason for deletion.

<li>No, there's no consensus, but notability is often the sole reason given for a deletion vote here on Vfd, so it's become pseudo-policy.

<dd>Conversely, what role *exactly* will an article about this school play on Wikipedia? Will it be a fascinating and detailed article, will it cover interesting things that non-Georgians want to read... or could one use speedy methods like Search and Replace to turn it into an article about any of dozens of other similar schools?</dd>
<dd>You say the school is not very significant to me; that is true, BUT the schools in my town are also insignificant to me. Are they interesting to me? Yes, quite. Would I expect to find them in an encyclopedia? No, because the vast, vast, VAST majority called the Outside World don't give a ****. Things that seem great to you are useless to others.</dd>
<dd>That is the key, really, who are we writing Wikipedia for, the entire world or selective groups? Is it supposed to be collective consciousness or "schools and streets and clubs in townnamehere" with selective readerships for each cloister? "oh, the whole world of course!" you quickly reply. But who is interested in a school outside of their state/province/country? Probably very few, unless it's Colombine or similar.</dd>
<dd>As with my work at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>, I'd be blissfully happy if we could have things like High Schools in Georgia with subsections for each one. On their own they are entirely non-notable to all but an extremely select few (i.e., those in direct contact with them) but when put together can become an interesting look at high-school education in Georgia as a whole. THAT would be interesting. WP pages that are virtually NPOV equivalents of enrollment handouts for parents aren't.</dd>
<dd>Please understand me when I say this isn't favouritism, that even my *own* educational institutions are completely and utterly unworthy of individual articles here. It does not matter how near and dear they are to me and others, but what the outside world knows of them, or cares of them. That is not to say you shouldn't seek to learn things you don't know (as I am increasingly doing thanks to Vfds) but... yeah... pretty much all I'm saying has been voiced before on every ****ing Schoolwatch topic to date.</dd>
<dd>We have rules about notability of books, websites, bands, people, fictional characters, songs, etc., but nothing about schools. As yet anyway. Well, there's BEEFSTEW but that doesn't necessarily help and isn't "carved on a bronze plaque" yet. This Vfd should be an open-and-shut case with people assessing it based on their own opinion and the guidelines. As it is, every one of them dissolves into an "ethical" battle between "Schoolwatch fanboys" and "deletionist cronies". Now, if you'll excuse me, I have vanity pages to cull. THOSE at least don't have hangers-on... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 07:01, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"No, there's no consensus, but notability is often the sole reason given for a deletion vote here on Vfd, so it's become pseudo-policy." So, because deletionists throw "non-notable" around as if it meant something, then it's a pseudo-policy? That would make it, in my opinion, a pseudo-argument, i.e., not a real one. Sorry, mob-rule doesn't work here.</dd>
<dd>"the vast, vast, VAST majority called the Outside World don't give a ****. Things that seem great to you are useless to others." I can assure you that Pokemon doesn't interest me in the least. I paid some attention to it while my nieces and nephews were into it, but now that they're all over the age of 9, it is too uncool for them. But hey, if it interests you, then why not include it on Wikipedia? My area of interest is not American high schools, but minor canadian political parties and politicians. It is great that there is a space like Wikipedia for those of us with that obscure interest -- which is not just uncool for 9-year-olds, it is uncool for people of all ages -- to share information.</dd>
<dd>"Is it supposed to be collective consciousness or "schools and streets and clubs in townnamehere" with selective readerships for each cloister?" With over 500,000 articles in the English version alone, Wikipedia is not going to be a summary of the most important collected knowledge, but a vast compendium of information that its editors want to write about. Endless articles on Pokemon, or even omnibus articles as you propose, do not, in my opinion, form a part of the collective consciousness. Pokemon will be gone in 10 years or so.</dd>
<dd>BEEFSTEW "isn't "carved on a bronze plaque" yet" - I don't think you carve bronze plaques, you engrave them. (Forgive my pendantry. It is an affliction.)</dd>
<dd>"As it is, every one of them dissolves into an "ethical" battle between "Schoolwatch fanboys" and "deletionist cronies"" Right you are. I think the best solution is for each side to retreat to their own corners -- let the schoolnuts have their articles, I can go back to my obscure Canadian political stuff, and you can have yours about Pokemon and whatever else strikes your fancy. There are lots of good reasons to delete: vanity, unverifiability, original research, etc. I see no need to add the controversial and inherently POV "non-notability". <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:57, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gibberish like this is an embarassment to Wikipedia. Over 1000 Google hits for the name, but none seems to be both verifiable and notable. One hit co-lists the name along with <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carole_King_e70e.html" title="Carole King">Carole King</a> as the #18 greatest songwriter of all time - but then there's no <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">allmusic.com</a> page for this name, which raises my suspicion meter.

<li>DO NOT DELETE. SHWI is a useful newsgroup, and the new article actually gives accurate information about the forum. I'm still a little unsure of how all this works, but I orginally made the mistake of putting up the FAQ, but have now fixed it and written a short encyclopedic entry to it. SHWI is an interesting group that reminds me in a lot of ways of pre-WWI Vienna coffee houses. We've had lots of interesting folks from Profs to assistant govenors of islands discussing on our group. I think it is a very important part of alternate history, and that anyone interested in that subject would gain something by knowledge about SHWI. -anon</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> a number of searches come up with that term - and I only removed it to a new article because it seemed the target of selective "editing," for some of the same reasons above.

<dd>My apologies for keeping the explanation so short for this nomination, I will try to make up for it by elaborating a bit more now: The IMDB entry lists in great detail an impressive number of mostly miniscule achievements (production assistant, web site designer, etc. for what seem to be NN movies). Thus, I suspect the IMDB entry is vanity. On top of that, the biography in WP which <i>also</i> reads like vanity is lifted verbatim off IMDB, so we have a copyvio on top of it (I only noticed that right now, hence no copyvio tag). <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 08:28, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I believe it was the first one <i>called</i> a Christian Union, and started that distinctive movement, which has now mostly eclipsed the earlier student movements it replaced.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The current content is a mere dictionary definition which has already been successfully transwiki'd to Wiktionary.

<li><b>No vote</b> at the moment. If we keep, does it follow that we'd have to allow similar lists for other instruments? It would be bizarrely unuseful to have a List of songs featuring drums, since that would be really close to every song ever; however, cowbells are much less common and therefore remarkable (in other words, notable). On the other hand, <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowbell.html" title="Cowbell">cowbells</a> are indeed a part of <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_go.html" title="Go go">go go</a> music, and, according to our articles, are also common in Latin and West African music, so I bet there's a large number of songs (even if it were restricted to recorded popular music) that could, theoretically, be on this list too. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:55, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A list like this is only useful if it's limited in some way, so if every <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_go.html" title="Go go">go go</a> song has them, it should just mention that fact and maybe one or two salient examples. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:00, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - but the name has to be changed. the word FEATURING implies that it is the main feature of the song - like the game, featuring 50 cent - or nelly, featuring tim mcgraw. i suggest <i>List of songs containing cowbells</i> or something like that. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 20:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Granted, as the creator of the list I am biased, but I thought it relevant in, as is mentioned above, the various styles of music to which the instrument has been applied. I find the "domino threat" of list of songs with drums or list of songs with guitar to be a little over-the-top. Those instruments are so integral to popular music that it would be more realistic (though still, overall, unrealistic) to make a list of songs lacking drums or list of songs lacking guitar. The cowbell remains, however, an instrument suitably rare enough in the medium of popular music to warrant a list on Wikipedia; even if that list is not ever going to be fully comprehensive. We must not forget that Wikipedia is a free source for people who find other encyclopedias, online or off-, to be lacking in some way. <b>If this list would help just one student at a conservatory</b> write a paper on the use of such an a-melodic instrument as the cowbell, <b>without hindering anyone who would not have such an interest -- then keep it</b>. I would not, however, be opposed to a <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowbell.html" title="Cowbell">Cowbell</a>, in principle; I fear, though, that this list would make that entry unwieldy and would still be scrapped in the future. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBennmorland_d1be.html" title="User:Bennmorland">Benn M.</a> 16:31, 2005 May 16 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article as it stands has improved marginally although it is still worthy of deletion. The first paragraph referring to fundamentalism and citing Rich Lang, a Seattle pastor who is not notable enough in its own right to make Wikipedia is irrelevant to the rest of the article and any credible attempt to address the topic. I will repeat that a worthwhile article on this topic will address people like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> and Tiso (not Tito).

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I moved the following argument from my post on the discussion page, with minor changes/updates:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) The term gets a huge number of search engine hits (see: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Christian+fascism%22=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Christian+fascism%22=Search" rel="nofollow">link to search for term "Christian Fascists" as an exact match</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) The Christian Right Wing has fascist elements (e.g., the Ku Klux Klan, the Westboro Baptist Church, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson). These are not fascists in the epithet use of the word; one definition of fascist is "a person who is dictatorial or has extreme right-wing views". As fascism is "a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism" and more the point of this discussion, “a political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government”, and the examples mentioned before are fascists by that definition (as judged by their actions and statements), and all are Christians, the term is legitimate, and not solely an epithet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Epithet vs. Legitimate Term: One example of a word that is both legitimate and an epithet: liberal. Conservatives use this word as an epithet to inspire their base. Should we delete the liberal article as well? How about redneck, which is also both a legitimate term (often used by those it describes in a positive way) and an epithet? And let us not forget nigger, which possibly the gravest insult a white person can call a black person…but a word used over and over again in rap music, performed mostly by blacks. It’s both a legitimate term, and an epithet; should we delete that article as well?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) If the term is legitimate, and not solely an epithet, the article is legitimate. If the article is legitimate, it should not be deleted. At most, it might be redirected/absorbed into <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Fascism_4c3d.html" title="Neo-Fascism">Neo-Fascism</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_Fascism_49ea.html" title="Clerical Fascism">Clerical Fascism</a> (or all three), a move I would agree with more than a pure deletion. <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">Weirdoactor</a> 13:50, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So now Weirdo has switching from arguing that this article should stay because he thinks I'm religious to that it should stay because there are insecure people out there to call people like Pat Robertson fascists although, like has been made clear earlier, they are clearly not fascists. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 18:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Let's be clear and honest, Itake: it is YOU who have switched arguments, from "POV" to "the term is misleading". I've never made the argument that the article should stay because a) I think you are religious (your obvious bias is my issue, not your religion), or b) "insecure people out there to call people like Pat Robertson fascists" (sic) (this is, ironically, a POV, yours to be exact, and it merely proves my point of bias). My argument for keeping the article is very clearly stated above. Should you need assistance understanding my argument, feel free to ask me specific questions regarding the points I've made, or answer those points. And please refrain from freestyle interpretation of my statements to fit your agenda.

<dd>Honesty? I don't think non-religious people like you know the meaning of that term. Did I ever say the sole reason for its deletion was that the term is misleading? No, I didn't think so either. You, you have no points. Its just one long rant on that the article should stay because some people use the term "Christian fascist" to describe people like Pat Robertson. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 19:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
