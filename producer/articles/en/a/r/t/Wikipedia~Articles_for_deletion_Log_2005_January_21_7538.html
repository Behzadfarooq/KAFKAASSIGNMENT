<li>We can't merge and delete, it violates the GFDL.

<li>Delete: As this has already been merged with the main article (by me) it makes no sense for it to continue to exist. However I say this with the understanding that this pages content is an integral part of a <i>comprehensive</i> article on Loop Quantum gravity. As such this content should not be removed latter. Finally as for working with the "other editors of loop quantum gravity" by the very nature of this site that could be anyone on the internet. HFarmer 2:45 CST</li>

<li>Seems like an attempt at adding some color to a small town. I merged the info, and this name will <i>never</i> be searched for, I think, so it needs to be deleted.

<li>Merge/redirect or keep. "Will never be searched for" is _not_ a listed reason for deleting a redirect, and a "potentially useful page history" is a reason for keeping one.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, I see the point of the neologism.

Indeed some moral teaching from this book are actually good, common sens ( as in other religions, philosophies...) <b>but</b> the catch... It's all too relative. Good/bad/moral are not absolute concepts. As <i>absolut truth</i> concept is not either.

<li><b>Speedy</b>. test page, vanity, who knows. Either way, it provides a bit too much idntifying information about name, and geographical location if it is all accurate. At least there is no phone number and sddress, but considering that he has mentioned the name of dear ol' Dad, some psycho stalking net-freak could track this kid down. When will kids learn? The Net just can't be trusted to be safe. Perhaps wikipedia needs a policy dealing with the issue of minors and personally identifying information? i.e.: qualifies for expedient deletion? There are too many laws in too many countries to know wether Wikipedia could be held to any liability should something as I describe here come to pass... Picture the headlines: "Child Abducted after Posting Name and Address on Wikipedia." It's scary just to think about. I know in my school, and many others, the publication of your or another minors personally identifiable information will get you booted off the school network for a year. I'm the sysadmin...

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 5 clear deletes and 3 keeps (one too ambiguous to interpret). Reading through the two articles, I concur that this is a fork in an attempt to avoid the resolution of the controversy on the main <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_quantum_gravity.html" title="Loop quantum gravity">Loop quantum gravity</a> page. That said, I believe the history may be worth preserving as the participants continue to work toward the resolution of the dispute.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Despite 4 delete votes to 2 keep votes, I am strongly influenced by the PhD dissertation that <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> found at <a href="http://edocs.tu-berlin.de/diss/2002/schaefer_silke.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://edocs.tu-berlin.de/diss/2002/schaefer_silke.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. It verifies that a person of <i>similar</i> name was in fact an Oberaufseherin. However, almost none of the other facts asserted in the current article are verifiable. Since the name (and therefore the title of the article) are also incorrect, the clean-up would require a complete rewrite of the article. I am going to exercise my discretion to delete this incarnation of the article and remove the references found by "what links here". I am, however, going to keep the article's Talk page so that future editor/authors can use the findings there to craft the <i>right</i> article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:41, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I wonder if this is somebody's attempt at libel. There is, of course, also a famous designer named Anne Klein. In any case, it should be deleted as unverified unless evidence arises to the contrary.

<li>Comment: There are a couple of things that concern me here. I think we need better verification than has been provided so far. The article says she was never tried for war crimes, I think as phrased that's an unacceptable slur implying that she might have been guilty of them without needing to justify the claim, or providing any chance to defend it. Several of the articles in Category:Personnel of Nazi concentration camps have similar problems. See also Talk:Klein Plaubel.

<li>weak <b>Delete</b>; I also smell something fishy here; the name 'Klein-Plaubel' would be the nowaday policy of (re-)naming a woman after her marriage if she wished to keep her name. For 'normal' people marrying in or around 1910/1920/1930 in Germany (depending on which birth date would be correct), this double-naming would have been virtually impossible to achieve. It could be a try to discredit the researcher mentioned above and on the talk page <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 14:10, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. This person is real. "Anna Friederike Mathilde Klein born Plaubel". Right the errors and change the title "Klein Plaubel" by "Anna Klein".</li>

<p>Neologism. The article claims it is such, and even says who invented it (perhaps the article's creator?). Lots of google hits, but those that aren't pages for neologisms seem to be foreign language sites, where "igry" is, I guess, a real word. This neologism seems like it might be more likely to catch on than most, but until it does we're not here to promote it. I don't know what Wiktionary does about neologisms, but it belongs more with them than with us. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:28, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Neologism. <b>Not in significant real use.</b> When it is in the dictionary, I will accept that the word actually <i>has</i> been introduced into the language, and at that point it will merit an article.

<li>I'd say <b>keep</b> though this needs a lot of cleanup and expansion. Like MLKJr (and possibly MLKJr's brother), she was assasinated.

Behind every notable person there is at least one or more "unsung" persons who influenced them enormously... a parent or relative, a teacher, a mentor. But the point is, these folks are unsung and not notable in their own right. We don't have an article on Albert Einstein's high school physics teacher, or whatnot. Having said that, people are bending the rules for reasons of sentiment, and there's nothing horribly wrong with that I suppose, as long as somebody gets busy and makes this article much more presentable. I presume the Keep voters from MLK Sr. will step up to the plate once again? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 21:12, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you might be right that some folks might vote keep here because of sentiment, but surely it is worth noting that she <b>was</b> assasinated. Also, as I stated in my defence of the MLKSr article, MLKJr is the subject of a HUGE number of school reports by children, and thus things relating to him should be considered more carefully than, say, an article about an article about Richard Dawson's mother or something similarly obscure. In other words, MLKJr is the subject of a lot of research, Wikipedia is a research tool. Therefore, the more the merrier. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:29, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, being the mother of someone notable does not IMO make that person notable on those grounds alone.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Votes to keep and delete were evenly split. The article itself is a very short description of name and its origins. By past convention, such articles are generally moved to Wiktionary unless there is a specific reason to retain them - usually as a disambiguation page for multiple notable persons by that name.

<p>Since the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> process does not destroy history, it does not require full VfD concensus to move an article into the transwiki queue.

<li><b>Keep</b> If I had my way, every film ever made and released would get an article. Of course, I know that not everyone agrees with me on this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. A few minutes research with Google shows this is a true classic, and verifies Starblind's comment about the racism tie-in (which, while regretable, does add to the historic interest). There is no doubt that, as it stands, it's a disaster of an article, but the subject is important, so it's got potential.
