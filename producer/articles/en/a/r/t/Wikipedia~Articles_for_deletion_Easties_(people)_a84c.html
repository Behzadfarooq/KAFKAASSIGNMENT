<p>Propose deletion of this 'article'. As a sydneysider, this looks mostly like some sort of joke; much of it certainly isnt enyclopedic. Such concerns have been raised by many on the article's talk page. The majority of the material cannnot be verified and is POV. Failing deletion, all this subject warrants is a short stub length comment. <a href="../../../j/m/o/User%7EJmount_2263.html" title="User:Jmount">Rafy</a> 20:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree. This sort of article - where the central definition is loose and unverified - always attracts casual editors who go in and describe, in exaggerated manner and at length, their favourite sketch comedy <i>trashy woman</i> stereotyped character. The external references listed in the article do not corroborate much, or any, of the article content. If it stays, the article <i>can not</i> contain a long list of characteristics; any characterteristic defined in the article must be backed-up by an external source <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:13, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a protologism with no sources given.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator and Capitalistroadster. The Westies article needs cleaning up, but not deletion - "westie" is listed in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macquarie_Dictionary_57a6.html" title="Macquarie Dictionary">Macquarie Dictionary</a>. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 13:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as it has been verified. Obviously some people dislike the existance of such terms and are fighting to delete it for their own purposes, but I believe the sources quoted are solid and just the Macquarie Dictionary is behind the times doesn't mean it deserves deletion. If you object to the characterisations as being unencyclopedic, you are welcome to alter it. I also agree with the Westies term not being deleted for the same reasons.mattabat 16:23, 12 August 2006 (AEST)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is over 20,000 mentions of the term on the Internet and it has references. It is a real term and deserves an article. (Could do with a clean up)--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 09:08, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I assume you did a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">google search</a>. None of the results returned refer to the meaning or context of the term 'eastie' as meant by the wikipedia article in question. In fact the only relevant site in the results that displays this meaning of eastie, is the wiki article. So i'm not quite sure how your point is valid? Furthermore, if we narrow the search down to <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" rel="nofollow">Australian sites only</a> We get a mere ~1500. Most results refer to 'eastie' in a different meaning, and those results that are relevant appear on message boards and forums. The first point in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is 'Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.' There are almost no reputable sources around that verify the claims made in the article. Also suggest a reading of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms</a> <a href="../../../j/m/o/User%7EJmount_2263.html" title="User:Jmount">Rafy</a> 13:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is good evidence that is this term in regular usage <b>for some time</b>.

<dd>Again, i ask you to read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms</a>. You'll find that in the end it is irrelevant how prevalant the word's usage is. The article relies on original research. (Bookie's blog, the term in radar etc, are not adequate references)</dd>
<dd><i>An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that use the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material</i></dd>

<dd>Do you realise that you are putting an argument for the deletion of Westies.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The issue is that neither of these articles have any complimentary comments in them. Both Westies and Easties only contain derogatory remarks. This is a NPOV issue.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I does not surprise me so many want to delete it. The problem is that in the future with more common usage the Easties article will be resurrected even if it is deleted now. There are other terms such as Northies that are coming into more common use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We need to delete both of these articles now to put an end to this. As long as Westies exists it gives reason for other articles such as Easties and Northies. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 06:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The article has a notable reference from <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></b> magazine <a href="http://radar.smh.com.au/archives/2005/01/you_are_where_y.html" class="external text" title="http://radar.smh.com.au/archives/2005/01/you_are_where_y.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Radar</b></a>.</li>
<li>It not a neologism or recently coined as the age of the reference shows.</li>
<li>The article needs to be rewritten in neutral prose.</li>
<li>There has been <b>no consensus</b> which I think is a great pity.</li>

<li>The case of neologisms does not apply as Easties and Westies were created within a month of each other and have existed for some considerable time. The references show usage of both terms for quite some time.</li>
<li>The terms can be seen as equivalent and possibility opposite phrases so keeping one whilst deleting the other is not tenable.</li>
<li>The article is in need of a cleanup and neutral prose.</li>
<li>There has been strong arguments for both keeping and deleting the article. <b>No consensus</b> has been reached.</li>
