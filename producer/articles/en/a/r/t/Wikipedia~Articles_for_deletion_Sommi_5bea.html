<p>The result was <b>Speedy delete</b> - a combination of incoherence/nonsense claims , attack (a6) note the references to "clit and tit", totally unsourced allegations of womanizing, tawdriness, etc, and also notability (a7) is somewhat asserted but not very clearly. Is bordering on a vandalism page. And finally, it was going to get deleted anyway by overwhleming consensus. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 05:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Originally deleted as a speedy and reposted; I re-nominated it as a speedy, but after considering author's argument on the talk page, I decided it's not actually a speedy candidate. In any case, I still think it should be deleted. Author compares sommi to <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emil_Christensen_f8dc.html" title="Emil Christensen">Emil Christensen</a>, but has not actually provided any outside sources which the latter has.

<p>"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States."<br />
Sommi has played in a fully professional league, named the Electronic Sports World Cup, as well as the CPL <a href="http://www.thecpl.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.thecpl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecpl.com/</a>, Cyberalthete Professional League. He has participated in the highest level of e-sports, online and at various lan competitions.<br />
"Above is user's first contribution to Wikipedia." How is that in anyway relevent? It's actually sommi, and he's making a fair, and calm comment.<br />
"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." - Sommi has appeared in various Counter-Strike movies including "AusLegacy 2006", "PIL Season 1 (pantheon invite league)", each with countless thousands of downloads. If you require a link, I will find you it.<br />
"Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" - As already stated, sommi has achieved renown or notoriety in his field of expertise.<br /></p>

<p>Alt Account, i'm sorry if i did delete your comment, the page was laggy for me, perhaps your comment didn't update for me? I'm not sure, i didn't mean to delete anything. Furthermore, all i did to the comments was add their ip to the show you that they are separate users from across the country. I asked them personally to give me their ip from www.whatismyip.com and i added the ip on the end as some of them weren't fimliar as to how to add comments properly.</p>
<p>Also, I hope you all consider "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.
