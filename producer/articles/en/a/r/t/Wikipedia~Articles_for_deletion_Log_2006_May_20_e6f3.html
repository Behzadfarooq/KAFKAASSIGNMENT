<li><s><b>Weak delete</b> (or <b>merge and redirect</b>) per Doc.</s> <b>Keep</b> I've become convinced of the notability of the phrase; Raphael adduces another notable phrase for which we'd all agree an article is not appropriate, but the two are distinct inasmuch <i>military presence</i> could never be more than dicdef (or, in any case, could simply be explicative as to the use of the phrase) whilst the locution here is notable for certain connotations and in view of its tropish currency. A merge might be in order (to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Islam_ca75.html" title="Criticisms of Islam">Criticisms of Islam</a>, most probably), but I think the unique history of the term and the dueling meanings ascribed to it would better be described in a stand-alone article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:31, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not necessarily true, that <i>military presence</i> only qualifies as dicdef. There's a lot of material one could write about different kinds of <i>military presence</i> (military presence in the home country, military presence in a war, military presence in occupation. Examples like Syrian military presence in Lebanon, US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc.) The same applies to the phrase "go to war" (9,980,000 google hits): <i>"Well, I hope we don't have to go to war, but if we go to war, we will disarm Iraq."</i> GW Bush on the March 6, 2003 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030306-8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030306-8.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <s>Or what about "military action" (9,750,000 google hits)?

<p>She is the wife of the ambassador in DC of a small country, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> (7 million people). The article contains mostly gossip about bad relations between Mrs. Ayalon and Embassy/personal staff referenced by one single article in an Israeli newspaper. Nothing noteworthy for an encyclopedia, only for a tabloid.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to add that for Israel the notable spouses have so far been only spouses of presidents and of prime ministers. Mrs. Ayalon is much less than that. I stumbled into this article several times because I try to clean up the Israeli people root. The whereabouts of the Ayalon family seems to have been the interest of a sole contributor. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 21:33, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>One phrase about the ambassador's spouse and one phrase about a media report on her bad relations with the staff with the ref of this article is no problem.

<p>This was proposed for deletion, and I contest deletion. This is a real series of porn films. It may not be to everyone's liking, but that's no reason to delete it. I like Vike 03:06, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> No notability whatsoever. Googling the term brings up only 5 total hits, and 3 of those are MySpace. People on Google user groups do not count as "reliable" independent reviewers. Just because the films are real does not mean they inherently deserve a place on Wikipedia (see also: some indie films, almost all student films, many porn films). As far as your comment on the article's talk page, Vike (and this is not to be argumentative, only to present another opinion), you're absolutely correct: "Notability is subjective and it isn't an official deletion policy." With that said, it's obvious that these films are not notable. In addition, while there is no official deletion policy for notability, lacking it is grounds for deletion. Otherwise, I could create an article with the content "I have ten fingers," and then argue that it should stay on WP because it's true. I respect the effort you put into your articles (and for bringing the pages to AfD as opposed to just taking down a deletion tag, which the vast majority of editors would), but I don't feel this one needs to exist. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:32, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b>:Hello...I wrote the article. First of all, I do not agree that it should be deleted on the basis of it not being different than the average camp (with the "traditions" section, I think I make it quite clear what makes it unique, as basically every summer camp is unique and has its own unique traditions). However, in writing the article there was one wikipedia rule that I did overlook which was original research. A good deal of the article was culled from my own experiences working there, which I'm sure you guys suspected. I'm not familiar with the intracacies of the rule and if exceptions are made, but I really don't know how to cite some of the information. Some parts like the history could be easily cited to the website but other than that, I don't know.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanyaRomulus_e057.html" title="User:DanyaRomulus">DanyaRomulus</a> 19:37, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; although the article does not assert it, the phrase "giant sucking sound" continues to be applied to modern situations in all kinds of publications; just Google it.

As <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_slogans_82db.html" title="Category:Political slogans">Category:Political slogans</a> goes, this slogan runs with the best of them in notability.<br />

April 1, 2004, an op-ed piece: "I hadn't been to Mexico since 1996, so it definitely caught my ear when I started to hear two non-Spanish words on this trip that I'd never heard here before: "China" and "India." Mexicans are increasingly aware that these two countries are running off with jobs and markets that Mexicans once thought they owned. You have to feel sorry for the Mexicans: they are hearing 'the giant sucking sound' in stereo these days -- from China in one ear and India in the other."

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because the article isn't yet extensive, I am sure there is much that could be written upon the impact of Chabad upon Jewish students on campus. Its existence on 85 campuses in the USA likely means that it has an impact on an enormous number of people. In Australia where Chabad's influence is not direct, the Jewish population is small, and students commute rather than board at universities, Chabad's influence on campus is even significant. The fact that the organisation is not always known by its full name as a Foundation does not mean that it is a non-notable entity. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 10:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, I've been there. You find a whole category of articles with the same problem, and therefore the same solution. Is it better to space out the AfDs over several weeks, to pick them off one by one and hope no one notices? Or do you nominate them all at once and hope that your peers assume good faith?

<li>I found some sources that suggest this is a legitimate proposal in reviewing the links provided at the end. However they may not be reliable ones, as SPUI points out. The author needs to give reliable sources for the material in there, or this article should be userified but <b>Keep</b> pending verification.

<li>That's the one. But the article is too well written to just up and delete. Hence my view that time should be given to find other sources, and if they do not exist, then delete.

He is the originator of a Hasidic dynasty which has an article, but I think you'll find that two centuries after his life, his books are available for purchase online: <a href="http://shopping.msn.com/results/shp/?bCatID=9595&amp;av=12-4561707" class="external autonumber" title="http://shopping.msn.com/results/shp/?bCatID=9595&amp;av=12-4561707" rel="nofollow">[28]</a><a href="http://nehora.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=740&amp;CFID=7307&amp;CFTOKEN=469619" class="external autonumber" title="http://nehora.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=740&amp;CFID=7307&amp;CFTOKEN=469619" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.

<li>It may be hard to find direct references online: Frustratingly, those who are generally involved in the Zidichover Rebbe's works will not use the internet. Offline, there should be books on hasidism that should mention the Zidichov dynasty, but I'm not sure where or in what language. As is traditional in Judaism, a famous rabbi may be referred to by the name of his major work. To this extent <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+Ateres+Tzvi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+Ateres+Tzvi" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> gives us reference to people that have cited him in making responsa, and a story about him. By the nature of clerical and religious modesty, one is unlikely to have enormous amounts written on their life, but will have references to his teachings. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:39, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

He has a long article in the <i><a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a></i> <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=103&amp;letter=B&amp;search=maggid" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=103&amp;letter=B&amp;search=maggid" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>I'll clarify my comment, which was not meant to suggest that anything that is over at Memory Alpha has no place on Wikipedia. Rather, although this might meet Memory Alpha's standards for Star Trek-related notability, a ship whose name appears once on screen in a list, and is mentioned in passing several times in dialog, does not meet Wikipedia's. As <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> has said, there is a Memory Alpha for this material. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and its function is not to collate information that is difficult to find in Google searches. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 09:57, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there's an error here. I'm the creator of the entry on David Shapiro the poet. Is it possible you meant that the user you refer to created the disambiguation entry and some confusion followed. Shapiro the poet would certainly seem in my understanding to easily merit significance more than sufficient for inclusion, having been published by major New York publishers, eg, Dutton, Holt Rinehart, Random House, in addition to small presses, NEA and NEH recognition, etc. <a href="../../../f/u/c/User%7EFucyfre_c139.html" title="User:Fucyfre">Fucyfre</a> 11:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>I'm new at Wikipedia, so correct me if I'm in error as to proper process, but as there seems acknowledgemet that the entry for David Shapiro, poet, meets criteria, I'll remove the deletion tag. <a href="../../../f/u/c/User%7EFucyfre_c139.html" title="User:Fucyfre">Fucyfre</a> 14:14, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to keep the poet and to eliminate the rabbi. The economist info looks like a stub though. Could be expanded or eliminated?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep all</b> The economist seems to enough Ghits to establish notability, poet seems to be notable, so obviously disambig page stays too. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 15:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> – Both. The economist would seem, from University of Chicago publication alone to meet notability criterion, and the entry for the poet (which I created) I've addressed above. If there's consensus, might it be appropriate to remove the tag? <a href="../../../f/u/c/User%7EFucyfre_c139.html" title="User:Fucyfre">Fucyfre</a> 01:49, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't. If you can expand, please do.

<li>Okay, <b>keep</b>, this is fine of course. - You come across a disambiguation for a fairly recent band, whose article contains little more than a link to the track list of their only album, which then features a homepage link and a mention that a bonus track is released on iTunes.

<dd>There are some 15-20 nonnotable bands in the past 24 hours of the deletion log. No, not even 30 seconds—and it personally would've taken me much longer to find out.

<li><b>Comment</b> After reading the rewrite I will agree that it is a lot better article but I'm not sure it is notable in the same way other notable streets are bar the two literatry references. Are these references unique, were they made expecting the reader to recognise the street. Are there a significant number of people who haven't been to the street who will of heard of it. <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 14:29, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpages_22af.html#Allowed_uses" title="Wikipedia:Subpages">Wikipedia:Subpages#Allowed uses</a> is a guideline. Regarding the difference between a guideline and policy is, as quoted on that page, "<i>Although it may be advisable to follow it, it is not policy. When editing this page, please ensure that your revision reflects consensus.</i>". The Canada editors did not ignore the MOS guideline. Consultation was done with the MOS guidance in perspective, and decided that in this specific case, it was best not to follow it. The reason for this is two-fold. One is that there is a large amount of references, which in combination with the footnotes would make the bottom of the text very long. Secondly, the references are divided up into the sections they back up, so that the interested reader can find what they are looking for easily. This would however, make the table of contents on the first page overly long and complicated, so the decision was to place it in a subpage. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:11, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two things: / does not make a subpage in the article space. Thus this is simply a very oddly named page in the article namespace. This page, on its own, does not have any encyclopedic content. It can <i>only</i> be used as being part of the Canada article. The TOC being too long is not a reason to have a separate page; simply use&#160;; in front of headings instead of ===. Making the article too long is also not a valid concern since <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> clearly makes a distinction between prose and non-prose content when talking about accepted article length. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a>
<ul>
<li>When I say too long, I'm not referring to the 32kb limit, I'm talking about the the electronic length of the page on a screen; the bottom of the text of the page becomes confusing and unreabable; generallly bad web style; webpages and HTML have been successful on the net because information has been able to be kept but not made unreadable. The information which is encyclopedic (references) is being kept one click away for accessibility of all the references and the footnotes. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:24, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That can be fixed by allowing reference sections to be collapsible like TOCs or simply change the MOS so that references are always the <i>last</i> section in articles. In other words, this is a technical problem that requires a technical solution. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 12:43, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You misunderstand. All the references are still in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> article.

<li>My opinion on references on seperate pages has changed somewhat. I strongly support going through an article, dividing it up into statements, then attempting to specifically verify each and every one of them, as a means of making sure of the accuracy of our articles, identifing useful references, and providing guidance on statements that may be unverifable. As this is a wiki, we should put the results of this type of work somewhere, so other people can help out with it. Where such material is placed is not something I feel strongly about. It could be at {{ARITCLENAME}}/References, Talk:{{ARTICLENAME}}/References, Wikipedia:Detailed Referencing/{{ARTICLENAME}}, or most anywhere else. The page in question here is not such a thing; it's a list of references (which is great!). I have no particular opinion on where it is located.

<dd>Well, now we have heard five arguments for deletion. 1: Vanity; 2: 1<sup>1/2</sup>; 3: Originality; 4: Notability; 5: Not all published articles deserve a WP article. Let's look at them one by one. Argument 1 was withdrawn. Argument 2 has nothing to do with the case but merely documents that Steven is motivated by personal reasons. Argument 3 was withdrawn by Steven himself in the note above. Argument 4 seems to be refuted by the comments on the talk page; some people did read the article with interest. Argument 5 tells nothing about whether this very article deserves a WP article. Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, my learned friend may be angry, but his case is weak. <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a> 06:41, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I can assess the source: it's an uncited talk, and it doesn't avoid original research. It's also non-notable, because only one person has ever written about the concept; furthermore, I see no actual interest on Talk:Ordinal fraction, and even if there were, that wouldn't establish notability. Finally, since that one person is you, yes, it's vanity. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 07:05, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Refutation to <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a>. As far as I can tell, argument 1 has not been withdrawn; Steven Johnson's comment suggests to me that he thinks the article <i>does</i> meet the vanity criteria. My reading of Steven's comment on argument 3 is that the question of originality (whether the article violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) is still open (not yet established). Argument 4 is also not refuted - interest does not equal notability, no matter what notation you use. Arguments 2 and 5 appears to me to be the only one you have got correct. Finally, Steven speaks only for himself, not for any of the other commenters (except where they say "per Steven Johnson"). Are you able to give <i>any</i> references for papers (in peer-reviewed journals) that cite your 1990 conference paper? These would lend more weight to your arguments for notability than anything else so far. To date I have seen no reason to change my delete vote. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 12:25, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bo, you don't help your case by making personal attacks and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments that anyone can see through. My consistent point has been that a concept/neologism published only in a single never-cited conference paper from 16 years ago is non-notable, and that this is a <i>sufficient</i> criterion for deletion. You have yet to address this. The fact that it is apparently a vanity article (which I never conceded) is additional motivation for deletion, but is not <i>necessary</i> and so I don't emphasize it. I, myself, never used the original-research argument—it may be true, but I think it's not worth arguing when the notability argument is so strong. I pointed out your repeated original-notation offenses simply to provide background and to speak to your credibility, and not as an argument <i>per se</i> about this particular article. The comment about not even all refereed journal papers being notable enough for WP was simply to pre-emptively address the specious argument that being published <i>anywhere</i> somehow qualifies a thing as notable. From above, I can tell that all of this was clear to everyone else, but I wanted to answer for myself. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>Dear Steven. I am not making personal attacks or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments. I think you are. I am merely reading what you wrote: "This appears to be a non-notable <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a> created by <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">User:Bo Jacoby</a> to promote a nonstandard notation of his own invention". In extention to 'non-notable', which is by now your only remaining argument, you called it vanity, and you argued ad hominem ("I came across this article" &amp;c). Now taking up your sole remaining argument: "a concept/neologism published only in a single never-cited conference paper from 16 years ago is non-notable". What is the WP definition of 'non-notable'? I know that there must be a reference, and so there is. I did not know the requirement that the reference had to be cited; where in the WP policy do I read that? Nor did I know that the reference cannot be 16 years old; where do I read that? I suppose that this piece of information ("from 16 years ago") is not really relevant to your argument. If it is, please document it; if it is not, please omit it. Then you have this subtle distinction between saying and not saying something: "not <i>necessary</i> and so I don't emphasize it". It is not clear to me what you mean by writing something without emphasizing it. I suppose it means that it should have been omitted. So all that remains of your argument is that the 1990-paper has not been cited. That, I think, is true: I know of no citation in a peer-reviewed paper. It was reviewed and accepted prior to the conference by the conference committee. It has been discussed in not peer-reviewed papers, and I have talked to people who have read it, and I have mailed with people who have read my WP article. When you show me the WP policy that un-cited papers do not count, then you are free to delete the article. I think that you are mad at me, for reasons that has nothing to do with the ordinal fraction article, and you act accordingly. You are not checking every WP article for uncited references, which would otherwise be the case. <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a> 10:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anonymous user attempted to nominate this article for deletion; I'm completing the nomination. The subject is described as an Australian state legislator, but the one-sentence article contains minimal information, and the subject is apparently not currently in the legislature. Googling produces some information about a musical conductor of the same name but nothing about a politician by that name. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I only started the list 15 hours ago! The reason I started the list is that the official site doesn't list all the conventions - they only maintain a rolling calendar. A list of topics and speakers, as well as the number and type of convention is part of the history of KCC and demonstrates its health/weakness over the years. I would think a list such as this would be a valuable part of the encyclopedia's coverage of this important part of Sydney evangelicalism.

<p>This had the transwiki tag on it, but ... there are no definitions on it. Almost the entire thing is redlinked and should be delinked if this is kept, but I don't see the purpose of this list. It really looks like listcruft. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 16:20, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The redlinking probably shouldn't be taken into account for deletion; the creator of the article just seems not to have known that Chinese characters are on Wiktionary, not WP. Compare for example <a href="../../../k/y/%C5%8D/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji.html" title="Kyōiku kanji">Kyōiku kanji</a> or <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiandai_Hanyu_changyong_zibiao_0085.html" title="Xiandai Hanyu changyong zibiao">Xiandai Hanyu changyong zibiao</a> in which the characters are active Wiktionary links. That, at least, is easily fixed. —<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero_Gravitas_e670.html" title="User:Zero Gravitas">Zero Gravi</a><b><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero_Gravitas_f48c.html" title="User talk:Zero Gravitas">t</a></b><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero_Gravitas_e670.html" title="User:Zero Gravitas">as</a> 20:39, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I generally don't think that Chinese characters ought to become titles of articles in the English namespace.

<dd>OK, if there are no set criteria, how can one decide whether or not a label is notable? I would say that it would have to go by their artists - Frog Pocket, Reverbaphon and Christ. are all listed at AMG, "Frog Pocket" , a phrase with no other known meaning, has significant GHits, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Frog+Pocket%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Frog+Pocket%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ..html" title="Christ.">Christ.</a> survived AfD as it was felt notability had been satisfied following a clean-up, Reverbaphon, again with no other known meaning, does well on Google <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Reverbaphon&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=120&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Reverbaphon&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=120&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> and Greenbank has too many other meanings and usages for a Google search to have value. It is very much a niche label - all artists are Scottish and all create electronic music. In that small pond, they are a well-known big fish. Question is, is that pond too small to ever satisfy notability? <i>On balance</i>, I'm saying <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 22:02, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. I take the position that that "pond" is too small to satisfy notability. Of course, there are no guidelines on establishing what that size should be, but Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy and does not require set guidelines on everything to establish notability. I do, however, understand your objections very well. Keep in mind that you may also chose to place an abstain rather than a keep so that you can go on record for a new guideline.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:20, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<b>Keep</b>. Hello, I am Steven and I manage Benbecula Records. I have never posted anything to Wikipedia before and so my apologies for the sudden interest. Obviously this topic is of importance to the label and so here I am. My two cents. Benbecula Records has been running since 1999 and in many respects is one of the longest running electronica / experimental labels in the world, considering the hundreds that have emerged over the last three or four years. I appreciate that Scotland may be viewed as a small pond, with regard to population and land mass, but I feel that is where the smallness ends. Benbecula is a hugely influential label with a dedicated fan base, paid subscribers and with dozens and dozens of positive reviews across the printed and electronic press. The label has gained massive respect from national and worldwide radio, the most prolific being the late great John Peel. Within Scotland, Benbecula is viewed as a massive influence on others who decided to start labels and make music over the last five years. Benbecula is an innovator that easily outperforms its peers via modern music that pushes the envelope and entertains, rather than, in my view, offer self-indulgent, meaningless compositions. Furthermore, Benbecula sets itself apart from many of its peers (which incidentally still have pages on Wikipedia) by offering a discography that has stood the test of time musically. Our artists individually may not be MTV material just yet but as a whole our output is powerful and far reaching. Lastly, I fully respect the regulations that govern Wikipedia, and will not be in the slightest bit put out if the deletion does occur. Wikipedia has done us some great service, as we receive many referrals each month from your site, testament to the fact that people are interested and click to learn more. However I would not be doing my job if the opportunity was not taken. Long live Wikipedia and thanks to all for listening.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - thanks for posting Steven; as a Scotsman, I was more than aware of Benbecula's reputation and, as I've noted, on balance, I think the label's position is strong enough to merit a keep. The article needs cleaned up and expanded to bring in more critical appraisal from reputable sources because, on local knowledge, I'm fully aware that what you're saying as regards Benbecula's position is entirely true. What we need is to find it written down somewhere. I also think that Frog Pocket meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and I'm going to do an article accordingly, although I may not be able to do this until the weekend. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 21:29, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In the absence of an adequate explaination from Gpscholar, one can only guess. As a nationally-known radio personality, Fernandes seems amply notable. There's reasonable citation in the article, and a cursory google confirms the hypothesis she is a real person and not a hoax or vanity addition. There's no indication that the article is a copyvio. It doesn't seem to be OR or fancruft or irrevocably biased.

<p>A term (a neologism, one might say) which the article claims enjoys "considerable international currency", but for which (as a common noun) I can find no evidence whatever (it's used in plenty of tradenames, but that's not the subject or claim of the article).

<p>Wikipedia is not a directory of film/culture appearances - i.e. an ImDB for technology. The article claims that "the aircraft has been a popular subject in television shows, films, video games, and other media". However, a cameo appearance in one scene does not mean it was "the subject" of the show. <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_ad49.html" title="Top Gun">Top Gun</a> was about the Tomcat, or at least featured it prominently. <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Worlds_a459.html" title="War of the Worlds">War of the Worlds</a> did not feature the station wagon that Tom Cruise drove, the 737 that crashed, or the many pieces of hardware that appeared. Similarly for games where the A-10 appeared in a cut-scene. What, are we to start a list of Hummer H1 appearances in pop culture and list every game and movie it's appeared in?</p>
<p>Regarding video game appearances, they fail the guidelies established by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_page_content_894f.html#Popular_culture" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/page content">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Aircraft/page_content#Popular_culture</a> and discussed <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_Archive_9_826f.html#Popular_Culture" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft Archive 9">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Aircraft_Archive_9#Popular_Culture</a>. Namely, that no attempt should be made to document every appearance, but only significant ones relevant to the aircraft. As a large number of military hardware is typically used in RTS games, its appearance is not particularly significant nor insightful to the game. Nor are arcade simulations with little faithfulness to the actual aircraft (e.g. Ace Combat). Furthermore, since the link between fictional versions is often speculative (e.g. Transformers), it fails under OR.</p>
<p>The only redeemable piece of the current article is the list of simulations - the only pop culture in this case that did indeed <b>feature</b> the A-10.</p>
<p>The A-10 was the main feature in several flight sims: A-10 Tank Killer (1989/90), A-10 Attack! (1995), A-10 Cuba! (1996), Silent Thunder: A-10 Tank Killer II (1996), and Lock On: Modern Air Combat (2003),</p>
<p>That piece only should be <b>Smerged</b> into <a href="../../../a/-/1/A-10_Thunderbolt_II_4496.html" title="A-10 Thunderbolt II">A-10 Thunderbolt II</a> and the article summarily <b>Deleted</b> <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 21:45, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please remember that the GFDL prevents us from doing "merge and delete", as doing so would destroy the history of the merged content, which would in turn make the merged article a copyvio.

<li>Finlay, please. That's wrong. It is perfectly feasible to perform a GFDL-compliant merge and delete by merging histories, and the method for doing so is spelled out at [Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves]. It is strongly discouraged because it is a lot of work for the closing sysop, but I cannot figure out how the myth that it is impossible, or forbidden by the GFDL, arose. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Supersquishify and merge</b>. It's reasonable for the A-10 article to contain mentions if it in popular culture, but in general these need be little more than wikilinks. We solve the same problem in <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html#Area_51_in_popular_culture" title="Area 51">Area 51#Area 51 in popular culture</a> (which has <i>far</i> more popular culture references) without letting it monopolise the article. One lesson that article teaches is that if you remove pop culture articles, well meaning folks will just add them back in. So mention them briefly in the main article, and point out to those who would expand each reference that said expansion belongs in the relevant pop-culture article, and not in the A-10 article. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 22:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did consider the same idea for <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>, but I feared it'd eventually boomerang. This AfD, which is far from novel, is really the inevitable destination of such "sin-bin" articles. I think the "managed sin-bin" approach in Area 51 has worked well, and overwhelmingly new users just add another one or two word entry to the list; most take the hint from the pattern and don't add a whole paragraph. I'd guess A51 is more prone to pop-cult stuff than A-10 (it seems to be in many more games), and roughly it needs modest gardening every two months or so. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 00:28, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why delete it? Some people may have questions on what some moves do. Besides, you don't see people deleting Super Mario, and God knows how long that's been around. Don't hate on Ryu and Ken's moveset. And I don't say this because I wrote one of these pages. I say it because I'm actually contributing useful knowledge. In any case, you're talking Street Fighter 1, which was simple, unlike masterpieces like Street Fighter 3/Alpha. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slammenhousa (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlammenhousa_9b26.html" title="User talk:Slammenhousa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slammenhousa_f5d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slammenhousa">contribs</a>).</small>

And you're wrong. Wikipedia is not a strategy guide. You go to GameFAQs to find out how to use moves like Shoryuken; the information is not notable enough for an all-purpose encyclopedia. Worse, the articles as they were before I edited them were extremely badly written and chock full of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>, mostly related to the whole "Goutetsu-ryu Ansatsuken" debacle. After editing out all the crufty nonsense, there's really not enough information that warrants an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I could easily comment on this. If Wikipedia's not a strategy guide, then how come there's a whole mess on video game characters having THEIR own web pages? Super Mario, Sonic...MEGAMAN! Geez, we might as well just give the ghosts off Pac-Man their own page. What I'm trying to say here is that SOME people actually do care about what some moves do. And how the things done are done. GameFAQs won't ALWAYS give an explanation, ya know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And Street Fighter 3 is highly regarded as one of the best Street Fighter games of all time. 3rd Strike is rated 2nd on the FAQ pages of the Arcade section of GameFAQs, and most of the reviews were positive. Therefore, any person would disagree with you on the debate of SF3's playability because more people like it than dislike it.</p>
<p>In any case, this is rather irrelevant. My point is, a lot of video game moves have their own sections. And yet you only strive to delete these. For what reason?--Slammenhousa 15:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah. No comment on the SF3 debate (parries suck&#160;;). Anyway, my point still stands.

<li><b>Comment</b> So because no one's made an article this level deep in another video game series, we should take it away from here?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The hadoken has become notable even outside the Street Fighter games, so it's reasonable for it to have a separate article. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 23:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Absolutely Keep. All three of the articles. The Hadou-Ken, ShoryuKen, and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku are pop culture. The Fireball, Dragon Punch, and Hurricane kick are staples in fighting games. And virtually any gamer alive knows about them one way or another. I'm not able to verify one way or another whether or not the information given in these articles is fan created, but I do know that there is a lot of information available closer to the source (Japan) that has not and probably will not ever be released officially here. How many Final Fantasy items are never released in the US. They don't believe there is a viable market here and more than likely wouldn't send it over here anyway. The point is I can't perfectly verify all of the information but I can't discount it either. Leave them up. They have viable info. I personally have owned every Street Fighter Strategy guide and most of the official art books that have been released stateside foremost on that list is the Eternal Challenge book and the content of these articles is in line with what is found there. Shun Goku Satsu and Satsui no Hadou being more recent additions to the franchise are a little more debatable but even they are relavent as they are pieces of the characters. Shun Goku Satsu has been parodied and copied all over the game world and Satsu no Hadou is one of Street Fighter's two takes on the Light side and Dark Side of the force (the other being Psycho Power and Soul Power). Perhaps it should be added to a pop culture references to Star Wars article or something. At the least the last two should be merged with Akuma and Ryu. Honestly Shun Goku Satsu and Satsui no Hadou should've been integrated with Goutetsu-Ryu Ansatsuken which would've made sense and made the article more substantial negating any need to delete it. But I've said my peace, please leave these articles be. Rayfire 19:42, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This list has been around for a long time and is stable. It has been contributed to by Canadians from various regions. I like how it is broadly representative of Canadian culture. I'm sure that must be good. It would be a shame to see it go.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm really not trying to "delete" this article as such; I am trying to find a way to make a similar version of it work in relation to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. I respect the fact that the article is stable and has been around a long time, but I think it needs to be examined by a broader contingent of Wikipedia on this issue. The only way that I could think of to do that was to bring it here. I expect that some changes to the article's name and introductory context would be sufficient to bring it in line. (Also, I think there is an implied WP:Wikipedia-is-not-for-nation-building.) <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 22:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some of those people- <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>- are blatantly not Canadian. And WTF is Rene Levesque doing on this list?

<li>The description of Levesque- "integrity, intelligence and resolute commitment to democratic means".

<li>Alexander Graham Bell grew up in Canada, lived there more than anywhere else, maintained a residence in Nova Scotia all his life (that was his favourite place on earth), and died there. As for <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levesque.html" title="Levesque">Levesque</a>: Check it out. Intelligent? No Question. Democratic? Easy to see that he championed democratic means and counselled his people to abide by the results of the referendum. He was most certainly a hero. In any case, if you don't like a particular entry, edit it for pete's sake. Oh, and as for <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a>, that too is subjective. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 23:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, this AfD isn't the place for these kinds of debates, but if this article exists for the purpose of that kind of POV pushing it needs to get zapped. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Cæsar is turn’d to hear</a></small> 23:54, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was one of the first articles I ever created, back in December 2004. As to why I created it in the first place, I'm not so sure. Maybe a lecturer briefly mentioned the group in one of the classes. I don't remember. Maybe I was testing the system. Maybe I wanted to add disinformation, who knows? However, looking back 17 months later at it, it could well be included among my "nihilartikels" that got me kicked off the Wikipedia for a while earlier on in the saison.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article asserts lots of history, but no importance at all. And then there's this comment, posted on the talk page by the user who voted "keep" above, and who does not understand that nobody on WP "owns" articles: "This article is maintained by Sushicrowd media personnel. Any drastic changes to this article with false pretenses without the discretion of Sushicrowd.com is considered vandalism." Thus, the article is not just non-notable, but vanity. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article in Sushicrowd is indeed historically accurate as it is compiled by Sushicrowd's staff and administrator. Sushicrowd is an established media label and contains current and project media worthy of notability. Some AfD nominations may be due to an attack on Sushicrowd. Sephihakubi

<p>Not really encyclopedic. The main contest article can easily note who the favourites were - A comprehensive listing isn't needed.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I'd settle for a partial merging into one of the Eurovision song contest articles. Why?
<ul>
<li>The information is useful, because it provides a source from which what actually happened may be compared with what was expected to happen. A similar thing can be seen in the appearance of entensive poll information on election articles.</li>
<li>It isn't really original research. On the policy page it is stated that "an edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments". Done well, this table should offer easily verifiable information, and if properly justified in its source selection, can not be accused of advancing a biased opinion. Bookmakers are reputable sources information on pre-competition expectations, because it impacts their business directly if they mess up.</li>
<li>The betting exchange comment does not apply, because this information is being offered after the competition, where it can no longer change.</li>
<li>While perhaps uninteresting to american readers, to UK readers, the Eurovision contest was a major media event - this information isn't cruft. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 17:35, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The only one who would find this interesting is indeed a bettor. I'll list why I think it should be deleted:
<ul>
<li>Pro: 'valuable' information for bettors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       'valuable' information to predict the winners and perhaps give a temporary ranking
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Cons: Statisticly speaking, the bookmakers have 'lost' the battle. They only managed to predict</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
        the winner 2 times out of 5. And I like to see some references for that.
        Secondly: the bookmakers are out for the money. They don't care who wins, they just want to 
        earn profit. If a lot of people think that Greece will win, they will set a lower odd for  
        them, but that doesn't make Greece a winner. The odds could be wrong, because the 'market'   
        thinks someone else will win.
        Thirdly: why do we need such a page? It could encourage betting and some people will think 
        that the bookmakers are "accurate". And what does it have to do with Eurovision? Predicting 
        the winner? <b>If bookmakers are so 'smart' in predicting the winner, how come they always </b>
        make a profit?<b> Shouldn't they be bankrupt if they were always right? Come on! Delete it... </b>
        BETTING IS WRONG!
</pre>
<p>And making average of bets? How can you make an average between odds!!!!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Disagree. These are martial arts related to CKD. Some of these were developed by co-founders of CKD.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Samc1, you probably meant to vote to keep the page...Your point, even if it were true, does not address any of the material points listed by Bacmac as reasons for deletion. As for your point - including the CKD website, the websites listed above, Master Koo's website, and articles about CKD in martial arts magazines, I have never seen a reference that makes the claim that CKD (The art of Kwang Jo Choi) was developed / co-founded by anyone other than Kwang Jo Choi. If you can find one, please share the reference. Also, it is good form to sign your votes / comments. - <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazydaisy_a2a0.html" title="User:Lazydaisy">Lazydaisy</a> 17:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete. They are not organisations, with the exception of Dynamic Self defence which has a few schools in the UK, but is very small in numbers. Dale Miller 17:32, 23 May 2006 (UTC) Oh and not even CKD's biggest critic, roger Koo lists anyone other than Kwang Choi as the founder of CKD. There are no co-founders.</p>
