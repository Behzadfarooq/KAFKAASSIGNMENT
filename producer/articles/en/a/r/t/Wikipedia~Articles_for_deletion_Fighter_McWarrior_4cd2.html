<li><b>Delete</b> I have expanded this AfD to include all four of the 8-Bit Theater main characters. The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_8-Bit_Theater_c900.html" title="Characters of 8-Bit Theater">Characters of 8-Bit Theater</a> article has been ballooning for quite some time, and apparently has spilled over into these new articles. That wasn't the proper response. The characters article should have been pared down instead. We're writing encyclopedia articles here, not Cliff's Notes. I can't think of any instance where an individual webconic character merits its own article. (Yes, we have a few, but I plan on merging all of them into their parent articles in the near future). –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 15:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not entirely opposed to two separate 8-Bit Theater characters articles — one for the light warriors and the other for minor characters — but I'd prefer it if the contributors of the Characters article instead exercise some discipline. Contrary to what you may think, an exhaustive article covering fine details is <i>not</i> ideal. Unless you're already a fan, just reading an article like that is a real slog, let alone trying to keep it proofread, verifiable, and appropriate in tone. If an article can <i>only</i> be managed by dedicated fans, it is not useful. For once, notability is not a concern, but there certainly is an issue about respecting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 11:15, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suppose we should also delete all single-charachter articles from all other fiction as well? No says I!

<li><b>Keep</b> If we expect internet publications such as Wikipedia to become a respected medium alongside print media, then we should follow that same ideal with internet publications such as webcomics. If a manga series can have seperate pages for main characters even when the series itself is not that popular, than a popular webcomic such as 8 Bit Theatre that has defined so much of Final Fantasy fan culture deserves the same treatment. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 144.131.235.58 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.131.235.58_a33a.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.131.235.58">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete, Delete, Delete</b> - Throw them back into their character articles and trim them up. The fact that the article on the mage is longer than the article on <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyx_Vance_fbdb.html" title="Alyx Vance">Alyx Vance</a>, is not a fault of the Alyx Vance article. It is the fault of editors putting in every bit of stupid trivia there is into the mage article. Noting what every character has done throughout their sprite tenure at the comic is not for an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am transwikiing these to the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/8-Bit_Theater" class="external text" title="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/8-Bit_Theater" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Wiki</a>, and you can access these pages from there if you'd like. So far, Fighter and Black Mage have been transwikied, and I plan to work with the others later.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How can you say that? Yes, the Beano and Street Fighter have had an impact. But if you're going to claim that a webcomic wont have the same impact purely because it's a webcomic, then why on earth are you contributing to the web-based Wikipedia?<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimson_Shadow_fe6b.html" title="User:Crimson Shadow">Crimson Shadow</a> 18:55, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
