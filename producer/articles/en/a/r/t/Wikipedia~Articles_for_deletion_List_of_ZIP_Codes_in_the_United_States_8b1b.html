<p>There are, near as I can tell, nearly 42,000 ZIP Codes in the US, plus however many APO/FPO ZIP Codes there are for overseas postings. I question the point, purpose, and/or expenditure of resources for such a list. This appears to have been considered for deletion last April, but I can't find any archive of the discussion: I hope I'm not reinventing the wheel here.</p>
<p>See also the sublists for the states on the same page, which also deserve the axe.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> a description of the organizational scheme and the neat map are already in the actually encyclopedic <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip_code.html" title="Zip code">Zip code</a> article that this list links from.</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Not useful unless they're correct, which is unlikely to remain true, and complete, which they aren't. Zip codes change at the rate of two or three per year per three-digit area; even postal workers (which I was for a few years) have a hard time remembering them. A listing by three-digit prefixes would at least be maintainable, and would probably fit onto a single page besides. The need for full five- and nine-digit zip lookups can be satisfied by <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp" class="external text" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp" rel="nofollow">a link to the USPS</a>. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 07:41, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. So you wish to delete its subpages too, am I correct? I think these lists are useful within wikipedia, and something that people might actually look up.

<ul>
<li><i>So you wish to delete its subpages too?</i> Of course. They're equally as useless as the main list. And how exactly are these lists useful? "Hmm, I wonder where ZIP Code 94595 is? I know! I'll look it up on Wikipedia!" And the map? It's the one from <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_Code_3179.html" title="ZIP Code">ZIP Code</a>, so it's not going anywhere if this list bites the dust. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:31, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the idea of keeping it as a fairly harmless way for people to find Wikipedia? There *must* be a lot of people who have searched for zip codes on google or something, and found the article. I'd like to see it completly cross-indexed with the town/city pages, by the way. Yes, I do have something of an interest in these; I created the Wyoming zip codes page. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 09:04, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except that Google automatically returns a map of the zip code as its first entry when you search for a zip code. Trying to spam search engines (or even appearing to try to do so) isn't what Wikipedia is about...and it's not particularly difficult to run across us on Gooogle anyway. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 14:58, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So perhaps that's a poor example. But what about keeping it with the idea of cross-indexing it with all of the town pages? <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 07:52, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip_code.html" title="Zip code">zip code</a> article offers enough lookup functions in its external links. Besides, it would set a horrible precedent. If we keep this, people will start zip code lists for every single country in the world.

<li>Ah, but I think it would be great to have postal codes for other countries as well; especially since those might be harder to find. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 10:20, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Such lists would be as equally as useless as this one. And how exactly would a non-US <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postal_code.html" title="Postal code">postal code</a> list be useful?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia isn't the United States Postal Service, and the USPS keeps zip code info updated more accurately and rapidly than we can hope to.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Ah, I see some people are just determined to get rid of this list. Just an FYI—it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=1524610&amp;oldid=1523018" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=1524610&amp;oldid=1523018" rel="nofollow">was already listed on VfD</a> in the past, and was kept (even though it contained much less information than it does now). As for moving it to WikiSource, I am afraid this is not going to work as the list was in fact moved here <b>from</b> WikiSource in the past. Then, as for the usefulness of the list—I fail to comprehend how it is <b>not</b> useful. I, in fact, thought of Wikipedia first when I needed to look a ZIP code up (a while ago), and I like this layout much better than whatever USPS can offer. Plus, when complete, the list is invaluable to those who need, for example, to know all of the ZIP codes in, say, a state. Good luck trying to find such a list on the USPS site. USPS works fine for one-time queries, but not when you need to get ZIP codes in bulk. Finally, as for keeping the list current, this is the same issue that can be applied to virtually any information that can be updated. I can take care of all Iowa ZIP codes, and undoubtedly there will be a person (or several) to keep the lists of codes for other states as well. To me, just because some of the sub-pages are incomplete is not a good enough reason to delete them (you wouldn't delete all of the exisiting stubs solely on the basis of their "incompleteness", would you). Sorry about the long rant, but I like this list and find it useful.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus europeaus)</a> 15:08, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does anyone have a copy of the old VfD discussion? The question was raised back in 2003—many of the arguments (or Wikipedia itself) may have evolved significantly since then. (I don't think Google returned maps of zip codes back then, for example.) Finding bulk zip codes doesn't seem particularly difficult—Googling for <i>zip codes iowa</i> returns this site <a href="http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/zip_codes/IA.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/zip_codes/IA.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as the third hit. You can sort by city name or zip number, and there are pages there for all U.S. states. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 16:33, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with googled bulk codes is that they are awfully outdated and incorrect. I am not saying that the lists we have in Wikipedia at this point of time are perfect, but at least we are striving to improve and update them. The sites you can dig up in google are not.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus europeaus)</a> 17:02, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, for the original nominator's reasons. Look, people, I work for Claritas, a data house which works closely with the US Census Bureau. Census geographies change once a decade, unless a new county is formed or dissolved, but ZIP codes and their boundaries can change whenever an individual postmaster says so, anytime during any year. This list's information is neither permanent nor easily maintainable, and I don't think there's anything sufficiently encyclopedic about the topic that we need to include it. Even 90210 (used in the title of a TV series) or the ZIP code of midtown Washington, DC don't meet the notability bar for my tastes. The same applies to postal codes from elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:52, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Might as well <b>delete</b> it. Maybe a shorter equivalent list, such as a List of USPS sectional centers and the regions they service, would be more acceptable here, as USPS sectional centers are denoted by just the first three digits of a ZIP code, meaning there are only a maximum of 1000 such entities, making the list much more manageable, and such information would be hard to search for on the Internet, even though it is possible to do so and it would, arguably, not count as original research. <font color="#BA0000">Denelson83</font> 02:43, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> the main article into <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_code_da42.html" title="ZIP code">ZIP code</a>, but <b>delete</b> all sub-pages. However, if someone were to change the list to only list the first three digits rather than each and every ZIP code, I'd vote to <b>keep</b> that. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 03:00, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I retract the incomplete part, it seems to be much less bad than it was previously and than I assumed it still was based on a quick glance.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is the correct level to record this information (cf. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Postal_district_993d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Postal district">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Postal district</a>). Why is it unmaintainable? If we have allowed the massive (and useless) <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> series, then this is perfectly admissable. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 09:31, 2005 Mar 5 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If someone had suggested to START this list, I'm not sure it would be worth the effort. But considering it is essentially complete and all that has to happen now is maintenance, it seems like a perfectly good resource of information. I find it very suiting that while attempting to find the best alternative to the wikipedia article in question, RickK above referenced a mirrored version of the same article-- I think that's saying something, don't you? As for why it should be deleted-- several above have claimed it is not unmaintainable, and this list does not match any of the points listed on "what wikipedia is not" as linked in the original complaint. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> has nothing on this really, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> has consensus for listing ALL geography and ALL demography items; while the article in question matches neither, it is somewhat a combination of the two, and so prior consensus seems to support keeping this article as well. --<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanchuck_4aca.html" title="User:Vanchuck">Vanchuck</a> 10:05, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I used it to find the ZIP codes for my city that I didn't know already, that I inserted into its article. I find it as a necessity. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 10:07, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete.</b> It would be nice to have a single list of all postcodes/zip codes/whatever. I just don't think Wikipedia is the right place for such a list. Miss Pippa 10:13, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's very convenient to have such lists, and Wikipedia is a very convenient place to keep them. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 13:58, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I also see no downside to providing the information on Wikipedia. Some people might find it useful or interesting, and if some people don't, they don't have to read it. Wikipedia has all kinds of lists of things, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities.html" title="List of cities">list of cities</a>. If there is a list of cities, why not a list of zip codes? If someone put up an article with a list of all phone book entries in the entire world, then I can understand deleting it, but I don't think a list of zip codes is necessarily too large of a list. I do suggest perhaps putting up a warning, that the information may not be up to date, and listing the date the page was last updated. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 05:47, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's nice to have a list like that. If it isn't updated, then the article should state so explicitly. <a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthereal_9441.html" title="User:Ethereal">Ethereal</a> 05:53, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: After the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7ELists_of_postal_and_ZIP_codes_of_the_world_Delete_2793.html" title="Talk:Lists of postal and ZIP codes of the world/Delete">first VfD discussion</a> (Oct 2003), this was moved to Wikisource. The decision was challenged and rediscussed on the same page (Nov 2003). It was proposed a (third?) time in March 2004. See <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7EDo_lists_of_postal_codes_belong_on_Wikipedia__bee9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Do lists of postal codes belong on Wikipedia?">Wikipedia talk:Do lists of postal codes belong on Wikipedia?</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The downside is the considerable difficulty and labor cost involved in keeping these articles <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and safe from subtle vandalism. If there were no easily available alternative, I would argue to keep, but there are many resources available (which we already have links to) that answer the same questions. As <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> noted in the nomination, the only new information is the organizational scheme and the map - both of which are already in the main <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip_code.html" title="Zip code">Zip code</a> article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:20, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please <b>Keep</b> (it somewhere). It's nice to know that such a list exists to be found somewhere in cyberspace.
