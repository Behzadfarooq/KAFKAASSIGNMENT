<li><b>Comment</b> To your first sentence- absolutely not. The claim that "practically all schools are notable because by their very nature, they have a reason for existing that differentiates them from other schools, hence they have notability for filling that niche" is simply a long drawn out way of asserting that all schools are notable. The "niche" that these schools fill is no different than the different niches that corner stores and individual firehouses fulfill. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:06, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think individual firehouses <i>should</i> be automatically notable, actually. All towns are notable, and firehouses and schools are integrally connected to their town's governments in a way that banks and stores obviously aren't. But even without petitioning for a blanket notability for schools, it's still true that most schools can make a claim of notability, except maybe brand new schools that haven't existed long enough yet to generate verifiable sources for itself. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 03:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we all agree that all schools, firehouses and corner stores are "notable", but this particular school is apparently one of just seven schools participating in a Unesco pilot program on health issues in a third world nation - what could be more significant than that? The fact that a supreme court chief justice started his journey here is just icing on the cake. In short, qualifies for inclusion (and we do not decide on the basis of google hits). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe what Edgecution means is that this school is not notable since schools are not inherently notable and he finds the only notability claim in this case, the presence of a single notable alumnus, does not persuade him to consider the school to be notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:07, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't have a clue what you mean by the "only notability claim" nor could I define "notability claim". However, to set the record straight, this 80-year old school is part of a pilot Unesco program and has educated, among others, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. That is what we are here to discuss, not philosophical blah blah about firehouses, corner stores or other inherently unrelated issues such as opinions on the inherent worth of this or that. Apparently the inherent sarcasm in the first part of my initial comment was not evident; I hope it is now. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it IS Wikipedia policy that all towns are notable, even if they're the tiniest spot-in-the-road village. Therefore, it stands to reason that any given town's municipal functions are notable: public schools, courthouses, government buildings, firehouses, etc. This would not include banks, hospitals, stores, businesses, etc. which are <i>not</i> municipal functions. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 14:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Either the FRESH program can be covered in the UNESCO article, or if it is sufficently notable itself, the FRESH program might justify its own article, in which case such an article would belong in <a href="../../../u/n/e/Category%7EUNESCO_77d2.html" title="Category:UNESCO">Category:UNESCO</a> or possibly also <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_Health_Organization_647e.html" title="Category:World Health Organization">Category:World Health Organization</a>.

<li>That is one way of looking at it. The other is that the school's participation in the program should be covered in an article on the school.

<dd>To illustrate my point more concisely, consider any university of considerable age such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>- it is one of the most notable schools still in existence, but the notability is a virtue imbued by the many great people that have done work there, and its many and broad contributions to culture, society, and academic life. That it is the oldest university still around is incidental to its notability; that is to say that it's a neat fact but it is only trappings and not to do with substance at all; that is how I justify saying that the age of a school can only ever be incidental to its notability. To stress, old schools very often are notable, but that is only by way of their achievements and staff's characteristics. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 15:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think this is simply a misunderstanding of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is</a> on the part of a new editor. In the essay it states the author planned to post this on Wikipedia (making it likely not a copyvio as the poster can reasonably be assumed to be the author). I've tried to explain this on the author's talk page. Calton is right, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Quimby_964a.html" title="Harriet Quimby">Harriet Quimby</a> could use some help and this editor might be the right person to do it once they understand the system here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I seriously believe this article on <b>Daheshism</b> and the article on <b>Dr. Dahesh</b> <b><i>should not be deleted</i></b>, but instead should be saved, and improved with citations, footnotes..etc. The man has quite an impressive legacy in Lebanon and beyond. In NYC there is a museum that houses his art collection, (Dahesh Museum of Art), and there is also a publishing company named after him (the Daheshist Publishing Company) located in the Newsweek building on Columbus Circle, so far they've printed and published over 100 books by and about Dr. Dahesh, and they also publish a fine bilingual (Arabic-English) periodical called Dahesh Voice. That magazine has several contributors with an impressive literary backgrounds, from professors at Ivy league universities to poets and thinkers and cultural figures from around the Middle East and beyond. I personally have known Dr. Dahesh for many years, and read his inspiring books, and believe he has a message worth reading about. <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibranmajdalany_298f.html" title="User:Gibranmajdalany">GibranM</a> 19:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>I can see no immediate reason to delete this entry</b>. I would suggest a more thorough exploration of the resources listed within the article before reaching any definitive conclusions. I am familiar with several publications listed on the bookstore website that address the existing content from several informed perspectives, including nationally recognized newspaper journals and journalists in Lebanon. Granted Wikipedia is not a proper forum to address the truth claim of principles or beliefs, there is ample evidence to suggest that the general principles and beliefs espoused by Dr. Dahesh are as listed, that a museum and several literary works exist in his name, and that there is a large documented population of individuals who claim to have witnessed events listed, irrespective of the question of personal credibility. --WillH 24:11 28 November 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anything based on "personal credibility" has to be removed as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 13:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I understand original research as such: "Articles may not contain any unpublished arguments, ideas, data, or theories; or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published arguments, ideas, data, or theories that serves to advance a position." There is again a large documented and published population of individuals who claim to have witnessed events listed. I understand the documentation of such claims to be the issue at stake, not the claims themselves. For example, that "Thousands of people (Daheshists, Christians, Druze, Muslims, Jews, Zoroastrians, Agnostics,etc.) claim to have witnessed many miracles performed by Dr. Dahesh" is a fact well documented, and I would encourage those interested to investigate the resources listed. Whether or not in the end one chooses to believe their testimony is not a subject of interest for the article, nor should it be. This primarily is what I intended "the question of personal credibility" to mean. Does that make any sense? --WillH 28 November 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I find this topic quite fascinating and would like to research it further. I would urge Wikipedia to <b>save and merge</b> both articles on Dr. Dahesh and Daheshism <a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmd206_c6ff.html" title="User:Dmmd206">Dmmd206</a>.</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. To explain the decision, the consensus was clearly to merge to <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_George_W._Bush_9d5e.html" title="Criticism of George W. Bush">Criticism of George W. Bush</a></i>, with the secondary consensus to delete. However, as the article in question is essentially a list, with no particular content <i>to</i> merge, a merge is not warranted. To merge this content to the <i>Criticism of George W.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't see the need for a redirect. It's not a likely search term, and in fact the title (<b>on</b> the media?) isn't even standard English. How likely is it that anyone is going to be searching for an article with this title rather than "Criticism of George W Bush"? In fact, I think anyone reading that article for the first time who isn't familiar with wikipedia conventions is going to come across it via the George W Bush article. A redirect is not necessary. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 15:26, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does not appear to have been a notable air crash. 15 people perished when a Britannia Bristol 301 crashed near Bristol due to mechanical failure. Did not appear to have resulted in any action by the authorities. Gsearches with the words 'Britannia' 'Bristol' '301' 'crash' did not give any meaningful results irrespective of where the double quotes were put: All hits were from wiki or wiki mirrors, except 2 links to databases specifically dedicated to air-crashes.

<li>Hmm... interesting essay but I do think it is fair to look and compare the article which is being discussed with other articles on similar subjects. Some consistency is fair because a reader might wonder "why do you not have an article on this, when you have an article on that?" Now, on AFD there is some precedent on aviation incidents, but generally the ones I have seen deleted are either those on crashes that involved a small general aviation aircraft, or those which are about emergency landings and other incidents where the plane and passengers were not in any real danger. In fact, incidents involving large aircraft which were in grave peril are frequently quite notable, even if the outcome was nonfatal. In this case we have an article on a large aircraft disaster with as many as 15 fatalities, and I think the only reason there is not more internet coverage on it is that it happened a long time before the internet was conceived. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a feeling that accidents to commercial aircraft (as opposed to incidents, which are minor events where nobody dies and the aircraft is not substantially damaged) are inherently notable. Also, the first accident involving a specific model, any terrorist attacks, accidents that have a significant impact on any field (air traffic control, design, manufacturing standards, etc.), or historically significant accidents are usually considered notable. An accident that caused four deaths may be notable if it makes a major airline sell off part of its fleet, for instance. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 23:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in general for aircrashes with many civilian casualties (those <i>always</i> get a lot of contemporary media attention). Keep in particular this one since it seems to be verifiably notable even with Google, as evidenced by the links given above (certainly the Aviations safety one), and this 60 minute documentary made about it by 1st Take<a href="http://www.1st-take.com/product.asp?numRecordPosition=4&amp;P_ID=122&amp;strPageHistory=cat&amp;strKeywords=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=71" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1st-take.com/product.asp?numRecordPosition=4&amp;P_ID=122&amp;strPageHistory=cat&amp;strKeywords=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=71" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. There was an article about it in issue 63 (summer 1995) of the magazine"Propliner"<a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/mags/uk/propliner.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/mags/uk/propliner.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but I am not able to check the actual contents (perhaps someone else will be able to do this).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; precedence is important, and major airplane crashes with more than a dozen or so fatalities are rare and noted (by the magazine article noted by the person above, for example), hence notable.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 17:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable because: a) it was the first accident of the Britannia (generally, first accidents of commercial aircraft models are considered notable); b) the probable cause of the accident prompted changes in how a manufacturer handled quality control; and c) the accident was another nail in the coffin for the Bristol Aeroplane Company, which shortly after the Britannia crash ended up being forced into a merger. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 23:23, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per all above.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. It's patently unclear, after all this procedural bureaucracy, that "Spanish Gibraltarian" is a neutral term. AfD does have a responsibility to eliminate POV forks when they come down the pike, and I see no reason not to confirm the findings of the previous debate. However, the most important problem is that there is no assertion of notability nor proof that this particular sub-group has played an important role of the history of Gibraltar since the British occupation. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article gives three definitions. The first, which comprises the first three paragraphs, is the part that is a recreation of the "original inhabitants" article for which a consensus to delete was established, and appears to have been created primarily to promote a probably-not-notable organisation of Spanish families who claim descent from the people who left Gibraltar rather than submit to British rule. This appears all to be covered already in the San Roque article.<br />
The second and third, which I believe are new, again appear either to duplicate material in other articles, or to consist of original and unreliable research (in Britain it is <i>not</i> common to use the term "Spanish Gibraltarian" at all, and one citation from 1890 -- claimed here as the first, though without any evidence either way -- hardly counters that fact).<br />
Basically, appears to be a POV fork combining existing information that's already covered better in other articles, and with a very rare term used for the title (&lt;100 Google hits for "spanish gibraltarian", many of which are for things like "the Spanish/Gibraltarian border"). Propose that the author would better spend his efforts working with other Wikipedians to improve the existing articles. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> - inherently POV title - no such thing as Spanish Gibraltarians - you're either one or the other, as Gibraltar is not in Spain.

<li><b>Strong Keep'</b>: Its only just been undeleted. It is NPOV, has valid references and is no less valid than an article on Irish Americans, Asian British or Moroccan Spaniards.... The history of Spaniards in Gibraltar, is of interest in wikipedia, as is the history of Maltese, Sephardic or Genoese Gibraltarians. These communities are also worthy of an article.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 17:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article gives its references clearly and apparently only offers as its mandate the various meanings and usages of this ethnic identification term. The article almost certainly has NPOV issues (made clear by this discussion if nothing else) but secondary source references and limited mandate seem to show it is neither OR nor a hoax...so any problems are an issue for article editors to work out, not AfD. Regarding arguments above that "edit wars are inevitable" I'd only say we shouldn't delete decently researched articles because problems MAY happen in the future. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:22, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is a POV bent to it and I never like that. I always say that means the content should be changed, not the article deleted. I understand this is a passionate issue in Gibraltar (having been there, I've discussed it with locals), but this was a historic part of Gibraltar, even under British rule and that can't be ignored. This reminds me of the article <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zimbabwe_41d4.html" title="Whites in Zimbabwe">Whites in Zimbabwe</a>. That segment has heavily dissipated over the years and even if it totally disappears, the subject still would be relevant even for historical reasons. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So far it seems the vote is split roughly 50/50. Anyone has any constructive criticisms of the article (i.e. changing stuff which may be POV)? I certainly can find nothing. I erased all the stuff about the behaviour of the British during the occupation precisely to keep it neutral and non-partisan.... I guess the main question to ask is the following: Would an article on Maltese Gibraltarians be opposed by those who want to delete this article? If not.

<li><b>Delete</b> This isn't a vote, as I pointed out to User:Burgas00 (who is the original author of this article) in the comments made in the original nomination Originary Inhabitants of Gibraltar. User:Burgas00 renamed/moved this article after several delete recommendations had been made to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Gibraltarians_45ee.html" title="Spanish Gibraltarians">Spanish Gibraltarians</a> and this avoided the deletion as onlt the re-direct was deleted at closure of the AfD process. Now that this article has been nominated, I suppose we can expect to see this kind of tactic again. So, all that said, what are my reasons for deletion? I recommended deletion previously, as the original article was misleading, heavily POV and in places wrong. This article has become what we can now see, which is still POV (and making a POV fork), the facts are disputed, and the topic is about a very minor and not notable segment of Gibraltrian inhabitants who decided not to leave Gibraltar after British conquest who (more than 250 years later) still consider themselves Spanish and the "Heirs of Gibraltar". If there is anything of note in this article it belongs in the main Gibraltar articles, NOT on it's own page. Delete this and whatever else User:Burgas00 decides to rename the article as next. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 23:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The Spanish occupation of Gibraltar is already covered elsewhere. <i>Gibraltarian</i> is a present-day term describing the people born in and of Gibraltar. They are British, not Spanish, by birthright and NOT Spanish. Proof? Gibraltar is British territory, not Spanish territory .This article promotes the +wishful+ Spanish POV which denies Gibraltarians exist as a distinct people and should be removed. (Unregd. user)</li>

<dd>Agreed. I think your motives were fine. You saw a paltry article on a failed candidate. I'd just agree with the above that when an article is on a failed candidate in DR of Congo their paltriness may be because of systematic issues. If Clifton Truman Daniel ran for President as an independent, and received only 0.4% of the vote, he would most likely have an article rather than be a red-link. That he was a minor candidate wouldn't make his run non-notable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:52, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entire thing smacks of a hoax. The whole premise is suspect: why would a student try to get a professor's attention -- make that, a professor who was visiting the university to give a talk -- by repeatedly calling his <i>first name</i> during a presentation? Google has one hit for this, which is this article. I was at UBC in March 2006, and there was no coverage of this in the student media. The article has no references, and I highly doubt that the Georgia Straight would have covered something so trivial. Anyway, a search on the Straight's website returns exactly no hits for "Bhamra" or "Bhamra Fiasco." How this avoided detection for so long, I don't know. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 08:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point well understood, however... "Wikipedia isn't a publisher of first instance. It isn't here to promote new things and spread new knowledge; it's here to collect, condense, and summarize what has already been promoted - and what has passed certain tests. Most encyclopedias are written this way. If you find yourself arguing that your Wikipedia article is necessary because no one else has written about your new invention yet, you're breaking the original research rule."</dd>
<dd>This has been previously published as a thesis, promoted and accepted by a scholastic committee, and was inserted to collect as part of list of colloquial terms and their history. Colloquialisms are covered as legitimate and because they are not part of a classical tradition does not disclude them from reality, or else pop culture and folk tradition would be disallowed.

<dd>That's all swell, but the phrase has to establish <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> to be included. Zero ghits pretty much establishes non-notability, also see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Even if the word had notability, as a colloquialism, it probably ought to go into <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> as a definition, not in the encyclopedia. The fact that the word is part of collection of obscure colloquialisms used in a school would seem to reinforce the <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> argument to delete, albeit on a higher scholastic plane than that argument is typically used in. IOW, the standard applies whether it's made up in grad school and written in a thesis, or made up in kindergarten and written in crayon. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I disagree with the speedy deletion nomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that the article is worthy of discussion for inclustion/exclusion, but by adding the "speedy" deletion, you eliminate a significant amount of the time for other authors on the subject to weigh in and work on the article enough to meet the requirements for inclusion to wikipedia. IMHO</p>
<p>I also belive that deleting this article contradicts the effort to "...an attempt to build a comprehensive and detailed guide to webcomics on Wikipedia. " Timmccloud 13:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am working on references to prove notability of the article. However I do have a real job, and research like this takes time. I request a suspension of the speedy deletion for at least 2 weeks, while I work with the author and other sources to refine the article.</li>

<ul>
<li>Why did this get deleted?? We were working on the content, providing valueable infomrmation to make it meet the noteworthyness of wikipedia!!

<li>Your own policy states "Articles listed here are debated for up to five days, after which the deletion process proceeds based on Wikipedia community consensus" It's been a total of 5 hours - that's not FIVE DAYS.

<li>Thank you Proto. The speedy tagging was not my idea, it was MER-C and BradBeattie who added that tag. I tried to remove it, but they put it back, so I figured I had to leave it. The author is working on trying to comply with the copyright restrictions on images so I hope to upload the image a thrid time with an appropriate permission.

<li>This is a notable article, because it presents some facets of the current MMORPG culture in a humourous way, and funny to people who are not into these games too.

<li><b>Comment</b>, This is from Gianna Masetti, the author of the comic in question. I didn't write the article on Wikipedia (it's the work of readers) and didn't mind either way if it was deleted or not because I am happy to abide to Wikipedia's self-policing by its users - if the entry about my work breaks any rules, then it shouldn't be here. However it seems to me that this objectivity doesn't really exist - after reading that "Comixpedia reviews and WCCAs are trivial", I checked several articles that were created or edited by Dragonfiend (who made that statement) - and their only references (and therefore claims to presence on Wikipedia, according to the notability rules) are sites like Comixpedia and WCCA. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding on my part, but I don't see how these sites can be trivial in my case and non-trivial in the case of the entries written by Dragonfiend - forgive me if I feel insulted.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi Gianna, I certainly don't mean to insult you. Which articles were you looking at before you made your comment that several articles I've created and/or edited have their only references as sites like Comixpedia and those Web Cartoonist Awards? Check the references of the webcomics related articles I've created, including <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Kim_Ganter_e571.html" title="Amy Kim Ganter">Amy Kim Ganter</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dicebox.html" title="Dicebox">Dicebox</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Weing_d1db.html" title="Drew Weing">Drew Weing</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Yang_da30.html" title="Gene Yang">Gene Yang</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lea_Hernandez_4b9f.html" title="Lea Hernandez">Lea Hernandez</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphrog.html" title="Metaphrog">Metaphrog</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowhere_Girl_6b3f.html" title="Nowhere Girl">Nowhere Girl</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raina_Telgemeier_2673.html" title="Raina Telgemeier">Raina Telgemeier</a>, <a href="../../../s/v/e/Svetlana_Chmakova_a22c.html" title="Svetlana Chmakova">Svetlana Chmakova</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hart_%28comics%29_e61b.html" title="Tom Hart (comics)">Tom Hart (comics)</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>. I don't think I've ever created a stub article that didn't have a reference section with multiple non-trivial sources.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If you list also pages where you did minor edits I stand corrected. It was an entry that you had edited which had Webcomic Examiner reviews and WCCA as references. An entry that you created (you will know which one but I won't name it because I don't want to start witch hunts resulting in the deletion of more webcomic articles), has as notability references just one paragraph on The Village Voice lamenting an omission of it from some previous article and a review on the Daily Oklahoman. Now, the D.O. may be a daily newspaper, but how are Comixpedia, a news website specifically dedicated to webcomics, or the WCCA, more trivial or less reputable than D.O. where webcomics are concerned?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Large, developed, sourced and accurate. There are some issues with tone of voice, but those can be overcome. If notability is the concern, do I need to refer to the dreaded <a href="../../../k/i/t/WP%7EKIT_4e1f.html" title="WP:KIT">Pokémon test</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not a hoax but a fairly well known concept in occultism dating back at least to the 19th century. Google yields 40,000 hits for either the spelling "egregore" or "egregore". According to the more coherent sources, the concept of egregore developed in the interpretation of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Book of Enoch</a>. A number of historically prominent occultists have written about it, including <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliphas_Levi_d613.html" title="Eliphas Levi">Eliphas Levi</a>.

<li><b>Coment</b> - I reworked the article to make better use of references and to exclude some of the more contentious material. The result is more of an outline than a proper article, so I have tagged it as a stub. In making these edits, I found the article for <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori.html" title="Grigori">grigori</a> -- which is another transliteration of the word that became egregor/egregore, and describes a distinct but related tradition. I still believe this article should be kept on its own. However, I could live with a redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori.html" title="Grigori">grigori</a> with a merge of the contents of this article. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 19:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't remember who said "But it's not toilet paper either." Obscurity is not the issue, verifiability is.

<dd>Too true. However, I think we have two separate questions. Is the subject encyclopedic? Yes. Does this particular article need a thorough going over? Absolutely.

<li><b>Comment</b>: WP:BOLLOCKS might apply if Gaetan Delaforgem was the only source of this concept. But it has already been demonstrated that it's not the case. The fact that Delaforgem has only published one Google-indexed paper has absolutely no bearing on the validity of "Egregore" as a subject -- although it does make him a less than desirable reference. There's consensus that this article needs cleanup and better references, but WP:BOLLOCKS does not apply. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 15:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> This likely is an actual term used in esotericism - at least somebody took the time to write an equally vague German-language Wikipedia article about it. But it doesn't look too widely-used or notable based on the sparse and maybe not exactly reliable sources that are provided. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article needs additional (non-internet) sources, but it is well written, informative and interesting. At worst, the article should be moved to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleOldMe_333b.html" title="User:LittleOldMe">LittleOldMe</a> 18:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There is no solid reason to remove this article. It is an open, free and decent exchange of information on a concept that is not invented out of nowhere but has been on for quite some time now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept is also not new, similar to Tulpa in Tibetan mysticism and has been used in numerous works of fiction as well (See Tupla entry).</p>
<p>In fact this is a good platform for any scientific results through publications to add their results on this subject, viewing from an unbiased, open scietific mind.</p>
<p>Therefore this article should stay on the page and not be deleted.</p>

<p>This is a contested speedy deletion. Appears to be a self-created biography, but author claims to be notable. A quick search of Google turns up nothing, as does a less quick search of Lexis Nexis, but it's possible that there's been work in trade publications which such searches wouldn't reveal. If this gets kept it will need major wikification for tone and structure. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 14:29, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Isn't a local emmy par for the course for a local anchor?

<ul>
<li><b>response</b> - That he's a news-anchor for a major network affiliate in a major market is my primary point (even on the panel in the Lieberman-Lamont debate). The only NBC-30 source supported part is the 2 Emmys. As I can't find records of local Emmys in that part of the country, for now I'll let that part of your argument stand (although I personally <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and have no reason to think that NBC-30 is lying). But even with no Emmys, he's still notable. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:11, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Re:</b> "<i>I have no reason to think that NBC-30 is lying</i>" -- I agree with you, but the point of demanding outside sources is, in general, to address concerns of notability, not just verifiability. In Gerry Brooks's case, if nobody other than his employer has taken note of his getting an emmy, then his getting an emmy is not genuinely notable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Per strictly following WP policy, I'll agree with you on that Emmy point. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:39, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(edit conflict) As for being a news anchor for a major network affiliate in a major market and being on the Senate debate panel -- again, those aren't valid claims to notability unless outside sources have made a nontrivial note of them (e.g. the New York Times runs a story headlined "GERRY BROOKS, HOSTING U.S. SENATE DEBATE, MAKES A BIG SPLASH") but I certainly wouldn't <i>expect</i> any outside sources to make such a non-trivial note of that, and my expectation seems to be backed up by the fact that no one can find non-trivial sources on him, even at the local level. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that him just being on the panel of that debate is one of the points that makes him notable. There doesn't need to be a headline story on that statement, just a confirmation citation that the statement is correct and a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> (in this case, the Washington Post) has provided that. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Yes, the Washington Post transcript of the debate certainly provides confirmation. And I don't know why you removed the emmy material from the article -- I thought we agreed that the NBC-30 website is a reliable source. The problem with both of these sources is that they don't show that Gerry Brooks is <i>notable</i> -- the WP transcript because it's trivial (with respect to Brooks) and the NBC-30 site because it's not an outside source. (2) Now, you seem to be arguing that his being a news anchor for an NBC affiliate and his having been on that panel confer automatic, inherent notability regardless of whether outside sources have taken non-trivial note. You're certainly entitled to your opinion there, but I would argue against us Wikipedians arguing that anything is inherently notable. It's much easier just to use the outside-sources criterion -- that way we don't have to argue in the abstract about whether this attribute or that attribute (being an anchor for example) makes someone notable -- we rely on the publishers of outside sources to make that hard judgment for us. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:18, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Now, you seem to be arguing that his being a news anchor for an NBC affiliate and his having been on that panel confer automatic, inherent notability regardless of whether outside sources have taken non-trivial note." ...Bingo... If no outside sources establishing notability of this person exist, I'd still vote keep. I think network affiliate television anchor persons in large markets are inherently notable. That's my opinion and I never claimed otherwise. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 01:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't work well by grouping CKV surnames by pronuciation, in this case, Wikipedia currently groups "李", "黎", "理", "里", and etc in a single article. This is a bad idea. Since these surnames are totally different, and no relations among them except its romanization. This is say Chinese surnames. But the same surname "李" (and many others) also found in Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore, and they have the same origin and written form, but different pronuciations and romanizations in different countries (unfortunately!), so don't you think it makes far better sense to group all "李"s, not "Li"s in a single article? <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 23:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My objections aren't to this. My objection is simply that this is a limitation of the system. Since use of diacritics <i>and</i> non-latin characters in main article titles (ie non-redirects) are strongly discouraged (because of certain limitations of the English-language keyboard and older systems which don't render Chinese characters without additional software; this matters less with redirects, but is a problem for the main article), there's no way to have an article with the title mentioned, without it being very messy. Non-latin characters are discouraged in non-signature usernames for this reason as well. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I see. But use Chinese character in title is the most effictive way to disambiguate for surnames. In China, when people ask someone for their surnames, he/she will answers the question like: <i>"Lǐ", and the "Lǐ" with 木 at top and 子 at bottom.</i>, so you see, this is way too long to suitable for disambiguation titles. Second, it is the page creator's business to name the title, other readers and editors can safely ignore the Chinese characters in title, and read or edit the article without any inconvenience. <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a> 01:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I encountered this problem with creating the <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a> article. Luckily the other surnames pronounced Yuan are very minor so they could be dealt with in a footnote. In the case of Li, this cannot be done, as the surname 黎 is statiscally important enough to warrant its own section at the very least. However, I don't think that creating separate articles using Chinese characters is a solution. As has already been stated, it is an unlikely search time, and the use of non-Latin scripts is discouraged on Wikipedia. Also, the title looks decidely clumsy. In the end, we have to accept that this is an English language encyclopedia. Its articles necessarily take the perspective of the English language, even when dealing with Chinese concepts. Inserting Chinese characters as a reference tool parallel to the English is one thing, but it is quite another to use Chinese characters as meaningful entities by themselves. This runs the risk of shifting this English encylopedia to a foreign language one. I think we can only try to explain and differentiate Chinese surnames within the article itself. <a href="../../../y/e/u/User%7EYeu_Ninje_bda4.html" title="User:Yeu Ninje">Yeu Ninje</a> 13:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>few keyboards are so equipped. But let's put that to one side for a moment. I completely understand where <a href="../../../y/a/o/User%7EYao_Ziyuan_1354.html" title="User:Yao Ziyuan">Yao Ziyuan</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">Deadkid dk</a> are coming from. They are approaching the problem from a Chinese linguistic angle, whereas in fact we need an English linguistic solution. To occidentals, they are not radically different: it hardly matters whether a "Li" is "李", "黎", "理", "里", the starting point is still an 'L' and an 'i' on the keyboard. They are no doubt at that page to learn more about the distinctions, and perhaps the subtleties of the pronunciation, so it is convenient (indeed essential) to group them together. Furthermore, the average person searching English wikipedia is probably as incapable of recognising the different chinese characters, or correcly use the accents which make up the 4 pinyin tones, as I am incapable of deciphering arabic writing. So when trying to move this debate forward, I would suggest that the above editors considered how they would respond when faced with navigation pages based on, say, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">arabic script</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">sanskrit</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:42, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying best to make my solution workable to average English users. My solution: (1) Title style: <i>Pinyin (Chinese character) (surname)</i>, pinyin is readable for English reader, Chinese character here for removal of ambiguities, <i>(surname)</i> tells average users what Pinyin here mean if he/she has no background knowledge of Chinese names. (2) A user do <b>not</b> have to know Chinese characters: The characters is in bracket only for disambiguation purpose, readers and editors can safely ignore it and reading or editing the article, use what Chinese text in bracket is page creator's business. I'm trying my best for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, since pinyin is PRC stuff, but the surnames might be used in several different East Asian countries.

<li><b>The fact:</b> completely different surnames might have exactly the same pronunciation and romanization, but on the other hand, many same surnames of China origin have found and extensively used in other East Asian countries with different pronunciations and romanizations. Chinese character to Roman is not a relation of one-to-one or one-to-more, but more-to-more. The relation is too complex to figure out what the surname actually be only by its romanizations. There is no way to organize each surname under one single article title unless we use Chinese characters in title to disambiguate (only for disambiguation purpose). I'm propose to use "Pinyin (Chinese) (surname)" form of title for surname articles, this can be read and edit (but not create) by both people who can or cannot speak Chinese, no matter if he/she has installed Chinese font.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I can see the fundamental difference between the "Keep" camp and the "Merge" camp: If you think of this as "an article about the <i>surname 'Li' in English</i>", then the "different" <i>Li</i>s should be in the same article. But, if you think of this as "an article or articles about the <i>various East Asian surnames</i>, which <i>can</i> be written as "Li" in English, then they should be kept separate. Obviously, coming from a Chinese cultural background I see things from the latter p.o.v., whereas I would guess that editors from a non-East Asian background would see things from the former p.o.v. So I guess the question we are really asking is, what are we trying to write an article on: the "English" word (surname) <i>Li</i>? or the underlying Asian names that "Li" represents? If the former, merge. If the latter, separate. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 08:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The thing that have puzzled me most in this discussion is the fact that people who wish to keep the article, take the Chinese language as the norm and then tries to fix whatever is "lacking" in the English language. The fundamental problem is that no two languages correspond one to one, and we should not try to impose the logic of one language on another. I want to stress that this is a two way street: my experience is that editors on other language versions of Wikipedia (such as Chinese) are sensitive to impositions of foreign language logic on their language - and we should be equally sensitive here at English Wikipedia. I am not saying that languages don't change and that Wikipedia should not reflect that. But this is not the place to reinvent language and for want of a better norm we should stick to the norm "in Rome do as Romans" do, or 入乡随俗 as we say in Chinese.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It doesn't matter that the chinese character has many meanings - we only care about the meaning that applies in this particular case. This is no different from someone with an English name that can be pronounced in many ways and have different meanings. Suppose someone was called 'Tom Bow' - Bow can be something that shoots an arrow or the front part of a ship - and it can be pronounced in two different ways and spelled 'Bough' and sound the same. We don't care because it's just a name. The fact that the same kinds of ambiguity exists in chinese isn't a reason to start making things even more confusing for English readers. Pick whichever meaning applies and put it in brackets after the name if disambiguation is necessary - explaining the differences in detail inside the article. Putting a symbol that it utterly incomprehensible to almost all of our readers quite simply doesn't help in any way - in fact it makes matters worse because we can't read it aloud OR type it. The precedent this would set for other articles would be unbearable. If we allow this, then shouldn't the article on Aristotle be called Ἀριστοτέλης instead because 'Aristotle' is only an approximate spelling based on the latin alphabet? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 05:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's not a fair comparison at all. The various "Li" surnames are actually written differently *and* pronounced differently in Chinese. When properly transliterated, whether via Pinyin or W-G, many of them look different. All they have in common is that, when transliterated in English, they are commonly written the same way.</dd>
<dd>It would be analogous to, say, there being two towns, one called <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes%2C_Greece_2264.html" title="Thebes, Greece">Θήβα</a> and the other called <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes%2C_Egypt_aa8c.html" title="Thebes, Egypt">niwt</a></i>, but which are both called "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes.html" title="Thebes">Thebes</a>" in English. Yet, we keep them on different pages because <i>they are different things</i>.</dd>
<dd>The distinguishing feature of the present debate from the Thebes situation is that we have no effective way to technically disambiguate the various surnames that correspond to "Li".</dd>
<dd>And, as I have said before, IMO the fundamental question is whether we are having an article about the English transliteration "Li" per se, or the underlying Asian surnames which are represented by it.

<dd>So call the article Li (surname pronounced as XXX) where 'XXX' is whatever most accurately approximates the correct pronunciation using the English/Latin character set. There must be <b>some</b> means to disambiguate these articles without resorting to a useless and incomprehensible (to most of our readers) symbol. I simply do not believe that you couldn't (with a little imagination and subject matter expertise) come up with some means to state the differences between these surnames without resorting to a chinese character. Remember, I'm only talking about the title of the article. I have no problem whatever with appropriate use of the chinese character in the body of the article or in the body of the disambiguation page for 'Li'. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:02, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The problem which underlies our discussion is the structure of the language. Chinese is words are all monosyllabic with 4 tones (mandarin only), and there may be a number of homonyms for each tone. I had proposed the Li 1/2/3/4 elsewhere as a partial solution to the issue, as chinese scholars are familiar with the notation which represents the tones in mandarin. However, the simple fact is that it cannot be suitably disambiguated without either chinese characters or the use of extremely long descriptions like "Li" with 'mu' at top and 'zi' at bottom, in which case I vote for the latter. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - here is Jimbo's take, straight from his talk page:</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>First, a rant, and then some limited support for your proposal.&#160;:)<br />
<br />
I am deeply, deeply opposed to the use of ALL non-English characters in the titles of articles in English Wikipedia in most cases. This is already a horrible problem in such cases as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a>. Look closely at that... it contains the character "ł", which is not an English character. Therefore, it is wrong as a title for an article in the English Wikipedia. Because of the nature of English as a mongrel language with no official academy or spelling rules, there can be rare exceptions where some special non-English characters are extremely well known as part of a proper name. I accept this. So be it. But this is not license to play it deuces-wild and dispense with the entire English spelling system.<br />
<br />
The correct name of Munich, in English, is Munich. This despite the fact that it could be written as the Germans write it: München, or perhaps even Anglicized as Muenchen. The correct English name for the capital of Japan is Tokyo. It would be deeply wrong to write that "The capital of 日本 is 東京." It would be also wrong to say "The capital of Nippon is Tōkyō... or any other variant. <i>In English</i> the name is "Tokyo".<br />
<br />
Now, having given that rant, I find that I must take what might seem to some a contradictory position. In the case you are considering... purely for disambiguation purposes, the subject of the page is, in a sense, the character itself. I find this to be an interesting proposal, and I promise not to blow a gasket about it. It is not for me to decide of course.<br />
<br />
(And notice that although I think the community has made a deeply wrong decision in the case of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a>, I keep mostly quiet about that, too.)<br />

<li><b>My comment from Jimbo's talk page</b> - Jimbo, I am one of the participants in the debate whether to use Chinese characters in page names and I would like to thank you for your input. However, I think it is wrong to draw a parallel between the use of diacritics in Latin-based names and Chinese characters.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First, it is hard to draw the line where diacritics should be considered non-English or not. Not long ago, it was considered proper English to write: coöperation, reënactment, rôle and archæology, etc.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, in case diacritics are used, it is very easy to create disambiguation pages that will lead the user to the "correct" page. Type <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Lem_1bd3.html" title="Stanislaw Lem">Stanislaw Lem</a> and you get directed to the same page.</dd>
<dd>However, when it comes to the use of Chinese characters in page names, we are potentially raising a barrier to many users, at least as long as we can assume the majority of English Wikipedia's cannot type Chinese. If we set a precent for this, there is nothing that prevents us from creating pages with Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Cyrillic texts, which may make parts of Wikipedia inaccessible for many users.</dd>
<dd>Just my two cents.</dd>

<li><b>Keep; Merge</b> other articles into this one. I just now searched for 李, and now I find here that my search is seen as an "unlikely" one for English speakers. I would note that if popularity of search terms is a determinant of inclusion within this reference site, then a great many more of these 1.5 million English articles are also unlikely to be searched, and need to be deleted along with this one. I was hoping to search for people across the East-Asian spectrum who shared the same surname as the first Korean president, Rhee Syngman. With due deference to Jimbo Wales' xenocentrist and somewhat insulting view that "all foreign place names must be rendered in English" (as if the native languages simply did not exist at all, or were all on their way to extinction, or at any rate were unlearnable to us daft, monolingual English-speakers), it feels kind of tedious for me to complete my search here without resorting to a direct search of the 李 character. I do see some merit in restricting foreign language characters in titles, but I also see that total anglicization of every other language puts up a serious barrier between users like me, who actually set foot outside of their own country, and languages that really exist and are used in this world. This is an English encyclopedia, yes, but encyclopedic topics do not only exist within English-speaking countries, and I would prefer to have the privilege of being able to connect with ideas in other languages without muting them with romanization. Frankly, it makes me feel like an idiot to not be able to search for 李, and it makes me want to turn to other sources. Now, there is certainly a lot of duplication with this surname, but this 李 article here is the most complete so far, at least for my present search, including lists of both Korean and Chinese prominent bearers of the name. The other articles should be merged into this, preceded by a disambiguation page connecting me with the article, Lee (Korean name). It might be best to simply put the 李 title on that disambiguation page. Retaining the diacritic is immaterial... I wouldn't even see the need to put any romanization on a 李 disambiguation page.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It may have eluded you that there are other language versions of Wikipedia and that many articles are interlinked. That is the beauty of Wikipedia as a whole. However, it seems that rather than improving Wikipedia in their native languages, many Wikipedians prefer to write articles in English Wikipedia. No problem in and by itseld, but the end result is that the linguistic hegemony of English is perpetuated by many people who are opposed to it. I use Chinese Wikipedia on a daily basis, and occasionally contribute to it, but I'm often struck by the fact that it is so small - it turned 100 000 articles only recently! --<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 23:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, it really boils down to what we rename the page since it is clearly unfeasible to have a Chinese character in the page title. After some thinking, I propose using <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Family_Surnames_916b.html" title="Hundred Family Surnames">Hundred Family Surnames</a> to disambiguate the names to achieve a standardized and one-to-one translation of surnames. For example, 李 would be Li (4th surname in Hundred Family Surnames). This is better than the "take the meaning" approach since meaning don't really apply in the case of surnames, and Li (surname that means plum tree) or Li (surname that means to stand) looks pretty ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 03:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yet Another Web Neologism. From the article: <i>The term "Library 2.0" was coined by Michael Casey on his blog</i>. Says it all, really. A neologism coined by a blogger and used by bloggers, not notable <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 16:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm unfamilar with this topic, but looking at the extensive references the term "Library 2.0" appears in the title of articles in both Library Journal and School Library Journal (among the other web or blog references) and appears to be a known academic concept, not a neoligism. I'd say this should be kept unless proof of a lack of notability could be shown, or other proof that this is some sort of odd fringe concept. Notability isn't based on where a term originates, but where it ends up. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You mean only the experts on libraries use the term?

<dd>I have to say, "the term is used only in Library-related publications, and on the web" as an argument for deleting, er, an article on the use of online systems by libraries... is, um, conceptually flawed. I can't stand all these Foobar 2.0 names, but the concept is out there and we're saddled with the phrase. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 00:47, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I never liked "Web 2.0" and "Library 2.0" is even worse. However, the term has quite a bit of traction in publications already, and I won't support the deletion of an article just because I find its name silly, the concept fuzzy, or its origin too bloggy.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This entry should be kept as it has garnered so much attention, not only in the library community. Students are writing papers on it, library schools are dedicating full semester classes to it, entire conferences are built around it, and the theories are well grounded. It's very real, the subject of much discussion, and should stay in Wikipedia. Steven M. Cohen - 16:30, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This entry should be kept! The term has been used for over a year in the library community. It has been morphing into a description of new ways to think in the library community - different ways of putting the customer first, new ways of serving a library's community, and new ways to even think about librarians and training. Also - if this term is removed, I'd say that Office 2.0, another wikipedia entry, should be removed too - since they're both offshoots of the term web 2.0. David Lee King(UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While "Library 2.0" began as a bloggy term, its recent popularity in the field of Library Science has helped clarify its meaning and now has an academic "life of its own." This is an incredibly useful concept for those trying to communicate the changes in library technology. Is the name silly? Sure, but so is the Klingon language. Is the concept fuzzy? A little, but Wittgenstein made part of his career clarifying concepts such as "family resemblance" and this is no different. It's origin may be bloggy, but how is this different from the origin of many words from other technologies? It's not just a bloggy term anymore. I don't think the "origin police" should go after concepts solely because of a less-than-high-falutin origin.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - After a year of discourse via the Biblioblogosphere, the term has found its way into library-related professisonal journals <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html" class="external free" title="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6365200.html</a>, into library school courses and workshops/symposia/conferences. Also, Casey &amp; Savistinuk's book "Library 2.0" will be published in early 2007 by Information Today, thus making the wikipedia entry a useful resource for readers looking to find out more and trace the term's history.*</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I find it bizarre that "Library 2.0" is up for deletion, the wikipedia's criteria of 'reliable sources' seems to be established. Surely discussions on the merit of the concept should be within the article not cause the deletion of the article!(Surely there is no need to address Lurker's comments on "only in Library-related publications" ...)*</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - If professional librarians are discussing and addressing this in their professional literature (and they definitely are!) then why would wikipedia feel it needs to be deleted. Are not librarians the best ones to decide what is worth discussing wrt library terms?24.36.176.71 02:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Why would "Library 2.0" be deleted if "Office 2.0" or even "Web 2.0" aren't? Isn't "Web 2.0" just as much of a neologism as "Library 2.0"? And why would a neologism be deleted anyway, especially if it's being used professionally with quite a bit of frequency? Joshua M. Neff</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I hate the term. But the very fact that there is a debate around the issue means that that debate should be vocalized. The article should spell out completely the criticisms of the term and let the reader decide <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchabot_6d70.html" title="User:Schabot">Schabot</a> 16:04, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I wrote probably the most widely-read discussion of the term (and the thing), cited in the links, and I may be identified (wrongly) as a leading opponent. While I may not be enthusiastic about the term as it's sometimes used, it's absolutely prominent, not only on blogs but within librarianship/library science in general. If this isn't noteworthy enough for Wikipedia, there must be at least a quarter-million better candidates for deletion. (Walt Crawford)Waltc 20:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable. While it could be seen as 'original research', it should be seen as an attempt to evolve existing libraries. Thus, it is NOT new but a use of new technology in the same context. Given that context, the Wikipedia falls into the same category - an 'unproven' technology which is based on the evolution of pre-existing technologies. By this logic, those who are calling for this article to be deleted might just want to save us all a lot of trouble and flag the Wikipedia itself for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 17:19, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I support the other arguments that have been made to keep this entry. Information professionals are currently discussing how Web 2.0 will apply specifically to libraries, for example: how to add tagging to catalogues. We use the term Library 2.0 to apply to Web 2.0 concepts that apply specifically to library issues. Many of our colleagues who are thus far unfamiliar with the term may be referring to Wikipedia to find out what it means. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnie_Crosby_cbcc.html" title="User:Connie Crosby">Connie Crosby</a> 17:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -The topic, although named poorly, is an important current trend among libraries around the world. -Annonymous</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This topic is in big discussions, in blogs, journals and in libraries themselves, even here in Australia. It is important to libraries and library staff that information like that provided by Wikipedia, continues to be freely and easily available.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -814,000 hits from a search of Google, including many of the significant print and online publications in the information sciences? Not everyone agrees with it, for sure, but the term is acting as a valuable focus in thinking about the ways in which library services evolve. -Paul Miller 24 November 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Although the term Library 2.0 may not be ideal, what is behind it is an important movement. Sarah Houghton has defined L2 as "…making your library’s space (virtual and physical) more interactive, collaborative, and driven by community needs…The basic drive is to get people back into the library by making the library relevant to what they want and need in their daily lives…to make the library a destination and not an afterthought." Because of its importance to the library community, I believe that this entry on Library 2.0 (L2) should remain in Wikipedia. - Jill Hurst-Wahl, Nov. 24, 2006.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Here are 7 published articles, 4 of them in peer-reviewed Library Studies journals, that have the term in their titles:

<li><b>Keep</b> - I would most certainly say keep this. Though it is a relatively new term, and who knows if it will indeed stick around for the long term, it does seem that many don't yet know exactly what it means and this is a good place for such information to be found and explained. Whyfor 14:15, 25 November 2006 (UTC) Whyfor</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - All terms are neologisms when they're established; this term has grown beyond its youth. For the reasons above, I recommend this be a "keep." I've presented internationally on Library 2.0 (to special librarians in South Africa) and they invited me specifically to explain and elaborate concepts that had already well permeated our culture. Kgschneider 15:49, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The fact that some users are unregistered doesn't detract from their evidence. The fact is that the concept is widely discussed in a profession. The original reason, that it's used by bloggers, has been proved false.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Library 2.0 can be found or has been used in professional literature, conference programs, classes in graduate school, Masters or PhD papers, etc. It involves a evolution the libraries are all facing and will greatly change library services in the future.Bcgray 07:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It seems pretty irrelevant to me whether people like the use of the "2.0" suffix or whether its use is just a fad. The fact is that the term is clearly in use right now, its use is causing debate, and that debate will leave a legacy irrespective of whether the term remains in current usage or not. It therefore deserves an entry. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypowe11_c8b1.html" title="User:Andypowe11">Andypowe11</a> 07:54, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> – Although the suitability of the "2.0" suffix for Library is just as debatable as the plethora of other 2.0s out there, its impact on the world wide community that are the custodians of the worlds information has moved well beyond its use as a label. Library 2.0 has become the central theme around which a debate/learning exercise, about the way Librarians and Librarianship need to evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities provided by the evolution of web/Internet technologies over recent years, has formed. There are many Librarians whishing to understand more about Library 2.0 – this page is an ideal starting point and should be retained. Richard.wallis 09:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Neologism or not, the mere fact that this term is used in library literature, as well as lectures, talks, and at conferences means that it has entered the vocabulary of the field. For that reason alone, it needs to be documented to explain to future generations what the term means. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosboot_ad7c.html" title="User:Kosboot">kosboot</a> 14:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Keep with reservations. The <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia policy on neologisms</a> reads
<blockquote>
<p>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from reliable sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term.</p>

Since the 2.0s were all born as manifestos, people write <em>about</em> the term before they ever <i>use</i> the term. Still, it's everywhere in the literature... --Otterfan 19:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Non-issue, really. It's pretty clear that some people grate at the 2.0 thing. Seem to feel it's vacuous bandwagon jargon. Some justification for this, I suppose. As others point out there is a settling in period for new words/terminology. However, any amount of reading in the area of Library Information Science/Technology will confirm this to be a useful term.--Charles Bolding 19:36, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This debate has been referred to in at least a couple of library blogs see <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/11/library_20_wiki.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/11/library_20_wiki.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> so I have added the not a vote template. I think that we should welcome professional librarians and people with a library science background. Otterfan's point about the need for reliable sources is a pertinent one and I note that there are references cited at the bottom.

<li>'<b>Keep'</b> - Agreeing here with many of the above arguments to keep; although the term causes my teeth to grind, it is all over the relevant literature and a recurring topic at conferences and mini-conferences alike. This article provides valuable access points for those (such as MLS students or trustees) wishing to understand current library technical jargon. Granted it is a neologism, but it is also a key term for understanding the current debate about technological integration and innovations in the field of library and information sciences and, indeed, within libraries themselves. Many of the articles cited above by the contributors to this discussion will confirm. Disturbingly, I heard someone throw out the term "Library 3.0" the other day, so I'm sure we will eventually argue about deleting that future article as well!&#160;:P trireme 04:36, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another shopping mall article. No notability at all, its just a bloody shopping centre.

<li>Not at the moment, as it will take time to go through them all and see if any come close to fulfilling notability criteria.

<li>Very few shopping mall articles would pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as far as I can see, but some may warrant inclusion in articles about places under WP:Local. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 17:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You aren't applying WP:CORP properly. To determine that something fails to satisfy WP:CORP requires <i>doing research</i>, to <i>look</i> for the existence of multiple non-trivial published works on the subject at hand. Unless you have researched every shopping mall in the world, you cannot support the statement that you have just made. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article doesn't already contain information that satisfies <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, I don't think it's up to editors to do research to look for it. Then <i>nothing</i> would ever get done, and Wikipedia would be flooded with articles about non-entities. (Oh, wait. It already is.) It's not about whether the subject of any given article is notable, it's about whether the article <i>asserts</i> this notability and has the verifiability to back it up. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:23, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. Assertions of notability only apply to speedy deletion. This is AFD. One of the very reasons for having AFD discussions is for multiple editors to research and double check the verifiability and the notability of articles. If an editor isn't doing the research, xe is not actually positively contributing to AFD. <i>Everyone</i> here should be doing the research. The idea that "nothing would get done" if all editors are actively doing the research and citing and evaluating what they all find is obviously false. Indeed, on the contrary quite a lot would get done. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:57, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Not of any encyclopedic interest. I would not consider a mall unless it was newsworthy on at least a statewide scale.

It appears that the primary WP:CORP criterion is satisfied. There's plenty of content in those sources that isn't yet in the article, in part because the article has been badly written, using only corporate autobiographies as its sources. But that's a simple matter of cleanup and expansion using the abovementioned sources. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually they don't. It's much the best if they are, since it improves the article and prevents this question from arising again, but it isn't a requirement for keeping the article.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Let's see. An article in a local business paper with the title "Knollwood Mall expands T.J. Maxx, adds new fitness center" is hardly an example of newsworthiness. The others include a website devoted to defunct malls, a local history website and an advertorial-style article from the "International Council of Shopping Centres". Oh, and a nice picture. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 19:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Newsworthiness" is not the criterion. That's already been judged by the journalist that wrote the article. And that you apparently haven't read beyond the title rather undermines any criticism that you may have. The criterion is whether the article is non-trivial (which at 2 pages and 21 paragraphs it certainly seems to be) and sourced independently of the subject (which, given that its author is Andrew Tellijohn, a <i>Journal</i> reporter, it also certainly seems to be). As I said, you aren't applying WP:CORP properly.
<p>And yes, it's an article by a local historical society. As such, <i>it is a good source for an encyclopaedia article</i>. History is well within the remit of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:57, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm tempted to say weakest of keeps per Uncle G but the article could almost be speedily deleted. The creator Dvac (<a href="../../../d/v/a/User_talk%7EDvac_1f79.html" title="User talk:Dvac">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dvac_945f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dvac">contribs</a>) has been creating countless articles about non-notable malls despite repeated warnings that these articles were being speedy deleted, proded, nominated for deletion. Most, if not all of these articles are written in a promotional tone, do not cite any third-party references, etc. The problem is that it is not Uncle G's job to do the research for careless editors: if an article is created as a poor, unreferenced, promotional stub, it should be deleted, period. If the topic has some value (as Uncle G's research seems to indicate to a certain extent) someone will re-create it in acceptable form down the road. I know we're not supposed to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">take actions to prove a point</a> but in this case, I think deleting would be good for the integrity of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 17:37, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The original content of the article, written in the first person, was the same advertisement as one can find self-submitted to other web sites, such as <a href="http://www.pngbd.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17015" class="external text" title="http://www.pngbd.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17015" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example. Although it has since been pared down, the article still requires a complete rewrite from scratch, citing sources. However, there don't appear to be the sources available. The article itself doesn't cite any.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge.</b> I'm not sure if this topic is significant enough to have its own article. However, the article is so new, it makes little sense to throw it away immediately.

<li>The 10th result on a Google Web search for the phrase "food insecurity" comes up with the article that Wikipedia has already had on this subject for 3 years and 6 months, now.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; Folks, <i>this</i> is why crying "there's no multiple non-trivial published works" (or "no reliable sources cited") is a really silly AfD nomination tactic. Everyone with even the most basic Googling skills can easily discern that this is a <i>really</i> freaking famous piece of software. Everyone who has ever investigated which blogware to use probably has heard of WordPress. AFAIK there was some books about WordPress too. <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" class="external text" title="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" rel="nofollow">Debian PopCon rank of #6926 out of 61035 packages</a> is not something to take lightly (hint: mediawiki1.7 is today at #7722). If this doesn't fulfill <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, I don't know what will, and if the subject fulfills the notability criteria, lack of sources essentially becomes a cleanup job and AfD Isn't Cleanup®. In short, <i>if your only complaint is that there's no sources or claims of notability, only nominate the article for deletion if you feel it's very unlikely these will ever materialise. If you get 139,000,000 Google hits, at least consider the possibility that there are good sources somewhere out there.</i> Thank you. Sorry for the rant.

<dd>However, as mentioned already, a Tycoon game is really just another name for an "economic simulation game" except where you're running a company of some description. Consequently I think this should be merged with the "economic simulation game" article where a note should be made that many economic simulation games are sometimes referred to as tycoon games due to the large number of games in the genre having that word appended to their titles. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 00:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> The article is awfully sourced, and I'm not sure that it would be easy to find sources on such a topic. However, the club does have almost legendary status in Durham (legendary, that is, for being monumentally appalling), and is a small pop culture phenomenon in and of itself. Because of that, I do think that Klute deserves an article.</s> <b>Delete</b>, per nom. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnas_aa48.html" title="User:Barnas">Barnas</a> 17:05, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article isn't awfully sourced, it <b>isn't</b> sourced and it probably never will be. The only two verifiable facts are that it plays cheesy music and it's the second worst club in Europe: not much for a whole page. Also, most of the 'facts' are opinions: <i>"Andy Readman is well known for his doormanship and stern attitude"</i>,<i>"Klute has gained a niche and successful reputation"</i> Wikipedia can't have original research on, even if thousands of students swear by it. Only when these facts are reported elsewhere can this be included in Wikipedia: "Encyclopedic content must be verifiable". This article should be deleted, and the only two verifiable facts incoporated into another article eg. <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladeofgrass_513d.html" title="User:Bladeofgrass">Bladeofgrass</a> 22:48, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

A couple of citations of local newspaper articles does not prove notability.

<li>OK, let's look at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which specifies that <b>"A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria: 1) The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself. * This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles..."</b>. Just as an example for one article, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaview_Square_Mall_628b.html" title="Seaview Square Mall">Seaview Square Mall</a> references two articles: 1. "Upscale development fills commercial corridor", Asbury Park Press, October 20, 2005 and 2. "For a while, plenty of parking at mall", Asbury Park Press, January 18, 2001. Both newspaper articles detail the malls efforts to repurpose itself from an indoor mall to an outdoor facility. QED. This sample article is indicative of a pattern of notable articles being deleted. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I predict right now that this discussion will end in a no consensus keep, because a whole set of malls, which should be dealt with individually, addressing whether each one satisfies the WP:CORP criteria on its individual merits, have been nominated en masse.

Applying the WP:CORP criteria to each mall individually, on its merits, <i>with editors doing the necessary research on each subject</i>, determines which are which.

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel for the nominator - you're damned if you nominate separately, and damned if you nominate together.

In this instance, there is nothing wrong with the grouping as presented. In such circumstances, I find doing separate nominations leads to inconsistent results. Given that this is not a vote, the closing admin can take into consideration any comments that support retaining any of the nominated articles (if the discussion makes it clear that any of the articles are worth keeping) while deleting the balance. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Procedural Keep All</b> This is not how multiple-nominations should occur. These articles share nothing more than a superficial commonality; they are all shopping malls. Some of them appear to be notable, and thus keepable articles. Others appear non-notable, and thus deletable articles. Someone should comb through these, pick out the deletable articles, and renominate ONLY those specifically, and each should have an individual nomination. Again, there is NO WAY TO ACT on this as a group as each article has its own qualities that make it either keepable or deletable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>South Sqaure Mall: Merge info into newer mall article and make a redirect</b>. In the SS Mall case, a newer mall basically ran the old mall out of business.

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that this is pretty similar to the school situation - is every school in existence intrinsically notable? What about schools that no longer exist? What about random buildings? The Smith Building in downtown Townsville USA. 100 people work in it every day; it is a major aspect of Townsville's "skyline" and a figure in its recent history; everyone in the Townsville metro area drives by it whenever they're en route from the courthouse to the town green. It is part of Townsville's psyche. Notable? Why not? I can personally attest that at least two of these malls are major elements of the local psyche. I know that's silly, but maybe it's better to be overly inclusive and then hash things out on a more specific basis than "these are just defunct malls, let's axe 'em all."<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 02:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Once notable, always notable. A mall that was notable when it was operating does not cease to be notable after it is demolished. Given enough time and resources, including an index to the relevant local newspaper, almost every mall can be demonstrated to pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Absolutely not. The claim that "practically all schools are notable because by their very nature, they have a reason for existing that differentiates them from other schools, hence they have notability for filling that niche" is simply a long drawn out way of asserting that all schools are notable. The "niche" that these schools fill is no different than the different niches that corner stores and individual firehouses fulfill. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think individual firehouses <i>should</i> be automatically notable, actually. All towns are notable, and firehouses and schools are integrally connected to their towns in a way that banks and stores obviously aren't. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 04:40, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think many schools are notable, and I have continued to work hard to improve articles and argue on behalf of school articles facing AfD. I find it hard to see that all schools -- even elementary and nursery schools -- will have sufficient documentary evidence to demonstrate notability. When I saw this AfD, I revisited the article and questioned whether the article had enough there to support a claim of notability per the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> proposed guideline. As it stood at the time, it probably didn't. I expanded the article, added sources and came to the conclusion that a strong case could be made for retention. If I had been unable to find any criteria for retention, I could have voted to delete, which I have done for many school articles. Arguing that all schools are notable is no more reasonable than arguing that no schools are notable. We need to find a middle ground, and pushing the premise that all schools are notable is, at best, hard to justify. As I learned in a test-taking skills class way back when, any statement that begins with either "all" or "none" is rarely true. Changing your statement from "all" to "some" -- or even "many" -- would be a good bit easier to support. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:08, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said "practically all", not "all". For reasons already stated, I believe <i>public</i> schools should automatically be considered notable for precisely the same reasons that all towns/cities/communities currently do under policy. <i>Private</i> schools are another matter, although the niche markets they often serve tend to give them notability and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>-satisfying press. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 21:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Irrelevant article</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This article was created as Josh South and was a bio of someone of that name. The nominator expanded the article. Since then it's been totally blanked, and then moved to this name, despite the fact that none of the versions seem to mention anyone named John Hanline. The article is totally empty except for the AFD notice. Can you tell us what is going on here? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The blanking is apparently because of libelous claims of an affair, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Hanline&amp;oldid=88714256" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Hanline&amp;oldid=88714256" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 18:23, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Given this situation appears to be cropping up with some regularity (unsurprising, since there are <a href="http://greenreaper.co.uk/wikifur/ConventionMap.html" class="external text" title="http://greenreaper.co.uk/wikifur/ConventionMap.html" rel="nofollow">over 30 active furry conventions</a> depending on how you count it, and <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Timeline_of_conventions" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Template:Timeline_of_conventions">more every year</a>), would some kind of a <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_convention.html" title="Furry convention">Furry conventions</a> summary article with redirects from these titles - as suggested in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Midwest_FurFest_4f6b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Midwest FurFest">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Midwest FurFest</a> - be more acceptable? People clearly come to Wikipedia to find out about the conventions, so if Wikipedia isn't willing to cover the topics in depth because it feels there is not enough information that can be verified by those outside the fandom to make a good article, then perhaps an article which included the bare verifiable details for the lesser conventions and directed people to the convention's website and to WikiFur for more information would be appropriate? I hesitate to suggest this, because as the founder of WikiFur it would direct more traffic to a site I'm involved with, but it seems like people above are suggesting that people <i>should</i> be directed there rather than create articles here. While each furry convention has its quirks, they share many common features - it would not be hard to create a general overview of what a furry convention is, which would give value to the article beyond that of a simple list. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 09:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Probably a good idea. Only larger cons tend to be noteworthy enough for encyclopedic purposes, but a more general article including (and not limited to) a list is typically more acceptable. You can <b>be bold</b> and merge the existing ones (or summaries, in the case of the few larger ones that would meet notability criteria) to such an article. No need to wait for them to be AfDed. Links from such an article to the conventions' websites would seem appropriate as well -- just be careful that the article doesn't read like advertising copy. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:54, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is a clear distinction between Brown's Gas, HHO, and Oxy-Hydrogen. This page is pertinent to establish the difference between HHO and Brown's Gas. There is absolutely no relation between HHO and Oxy-Hydrogen therefore the merger would be detrimental to the understanding of the topic at hand. Of course I have a conflict of interest, Wikipedia has lacked real substantive information for too long on these topics, and I am happy to be part of rectifying this defficiency. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Noah Seidman</a> 19:56, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> or maybe <b>merge/redirect</b> Not a single citation in the article, so all we have is apparent original research. Something as vastly counter-mainstream-understanding as this topic really needs many verifiable and reliable external references to even consider it to be kept IMO. There's nothing in HHO that explains how it's different from Brown's Gas. It states that it is different "conceptually", but that for practical purposes it is described as being essentially the same actual thing. Phyisical things aren't concepts: if HB and BG are not distinguishable by any describable means, are they really different things, or could one be mentioned in a sentence in the other's page? Otherwise we'll just have two pages full of the same debunking. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 20:36, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

What I put in the article is simply a re-writting of something that appeared (and I recently deleted) in the <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulk_Hogan_3ba4.html" title="Hulk Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> article. The definition of this term was present in the article, where it was not needed, since people at all familiar with the industry know what the term means, and people not familiar with the industry could click the link the the article I made. I also imagine that a search though other wrestlers' pages would find similar redudancies.</p>
<p>I do not believe that this article belongs in the wiki dictionary, since, while it is only a definition now, it could be expanded into a full length article listing things such as famous wrestlers known for a strong technical ability, technical moves, schools that focus on this style, and much more.</p>
<p>This is not OR!<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcewolf359_d672.html" title="User:Acewolf359">Acewolf359</a> 21:43, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Technical wrestling as such isn't a noteworthy concept - the noteworthiness comes from the wrestlers who implement the style. At best, a page on technical wrestling as a style of professional wrestling would be a dictionary definition and a list of wrestlers who arguably wrestle a technical style. Dealing with style on a particular wrestler's page is, in my opinion, a better way to do it. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytildebang_8116.html" title="User:Mytildebang">Mytildebang</a> 06:36, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have been reviewing whether to support or otherwise the call for deletion, I was disappointed to see inaccuracies in the bmi listing, entered during November 2006. For example G-WWBC never entered service with bmi. PH-RXA was re-registered in the UK during the spring of 2006 as G-RJXM. bmi also took on a B767-300 PH-MCV in the spring. The ATR left the fleet in 2005. Have a look at <a href="http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/bmi%20British%20Midland.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/bmi%20British%20Midland.htm" rel="nofollow">bmi fleet</a> for further details on the bmi fleet. These inaccuracies in the bmi fleet show that the information source being used is well out of date. Furthermore, the listing of G-ZAPM against Thomsonfly. It is owned and operated by Titan and has been also wet leased to British Airways and easyJet in the past twelve months, as well as one off charters. Based on this sample check I am minded to support deletion. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPencefn_2a78.html" title="User:Pencefn">Stewart</a> 18:47, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is a legitimate game that deserves a chance to be delivered to the world. It is not a game that was "made up in college one day". Give it a chance to catch on. Don't be a hater please.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia isn't the place for things that "deserve to be delivered to the world", it's a place for information that is already out there. That's why you need verifiable sources. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Famous_Movie_Director_f37a.html" title="User:The Famous Movie Director">Grace</a> 01:29, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How can i provide reliable verifiable information on the game when it has never been published or documented in any type of media outlet? That is what i am trying to start. The only thing that i could do would be to provide names and telephone numbers of literally hundreds of people, who are in the game, that could verify its existence. Other than that i am not sure what else i could provide. But i do think that, in the spirit of what Wikipedia is about, this content should be allowed. This game is certainly as valid as some of the other drinking games that are listed under your <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_games.html" title="Drinking games">drinking games</a> link.</li>

<li>I'm not sure "under attack" is quite the right term for this - rather, it seems that the question of what constitutes notability is in discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't have anything invested in this article either way, but I just want to note that the outcome of old deletion discussions that result in "keep" can be revisited, usually by opening up a second (or third or fourth) AfD on the article, and linking to the earlier AfD(s) in the nomination. Also, remember that this VfD occurred over an year ago, when relisting may not have been so common, but the closer did keep the VfD open for 13 days, so please don't be so hard on him. Nonetheless, as per <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a>, notability can be revisited on later good faith AfDs, especially in such a marginal case.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 17:10, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
