<li>This is Kate, a fan of James Hyman's. I've e-mailed him and he has no problem with this Wiki page. I would re-iterate that what James Hyman has achieved is valid to list just like other presenters on here who similarly para-phrase their bios e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Pilkington_74e5.html" title="Karl Pilkington">Karl Pilkington</a>, another <a href="../../../x/f/m/Xfm.html" title="Xfm">Xfm</a> DJ like James. Would you like me to re-write James's entry just simplifying it instead of copying his home-page which he has no objection to? Thanks. Also, if you want a link to the videos that he produced/edited/directed, it's: <a href="http://www.jameshyman.com/blog/archives/Green%20BandanaProjects.xls" class="external free" title="http://www.jameshyman.com/blog/archives/Green%20BandanaProjects.xls" rel="nofollow">http://www.jameshyman.com/blog/archives/Green%20BandanaProjects.xls</a> Thanks <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.27.228.4 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.27.228.4.html" title="User talk:82.27.228.4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.27.228.4_deaa.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.27.228.4">contribs</a>) 13:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> all I can gather is that's he's edited clips of famous people and possibly had brief, tangential interactions with them. Before they were famous.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> <b>DO NOT DELETE</b></s> Hi, this is Kate again, actually, many of those videos were the ACTUAL/ORIGINAL video for the artist in question e.g. Fatboy Slim "Santa Cruz", Prince "Pink Cashmere", Moby "C'Mon On Baby" etc. Check the new Fatboy Slim CD/DVD best of release which has the "Santa Cruz" video on there, directed by James Hyman. I understand you all have to do your jobs round here but I'm only trying to maintain a listing for James + his work!!!! Phew!!! There is this grey area on what's allowed/not allowed/notable. I can give loads of other examples for similar presenters on here which is simply their bio.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I count about 43 or 44 "original pop videos" listed on the unverified non-independent source, the Green Bandana client list. Also the roles are simply listed as "Production/Direction" for the Green Bandana company - it does not specify what role this exactly was (support for production/direction? assistant producer? amorphous executive producer credit?) or if James Hyman himself was directly involved. But again, this is an unverified non-independent source. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The first version comes over as pretty fanboy/girl (and used too much bold) but as the version currently stands it is reasonable entry - it could still do with some work (there is still information on other TV work that could be extracted for example, as should that info about his CD being one of the top 5 albums of 2004, if it can be confirmed) but he is notable and it'd be a pity if the initial tone of the article distracts from this.

<dd>The first version was taken directly from his own website, and was posted by User:JamesHyman.

<dd>Thanks for the clarification - as I say the tone was wrong but it had plenty of useful information that can be wrangled into making a decent entry. On the "actual celeb DJ" front I should probably expand the XFM entry to look at the distinction I was trying to make. What I am getting at is that XFM also have DJs who aren't "proper DJs" but are usually already famous in another arena (usually comedians as they come over well on the radio). These have included <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Gervais_3315.html" title="Ricky Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carr_ae3d.html" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Joe_4b99.html" title="Adam and Joe">Adam and Joe</a>.

I suppose with that in mind they he probably is but that all rather misses the point I was trying to make. I'd better go and update the XFM entry while this is fresh on my mind.

<p>James Hyman is an innovator and educator of the masses. His understanding of music and pop culture is a breath of fresh air. He respects all styles and musical genres. His cult radio show "The Rinse" on XFM showcases groundbreaking new music today. He was responsible for the music sountracks of two British films[Revolver and Kidulthood]for which he won critical acclaim.He is at the forefront of a new generation. --MaitresseMarlene 21:44, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To start, I'm a little bit shocked at the cattiness of the comments above. Secondly, I don't understand where people are coming from by trying to get this entry deleted. Hyman is a fantastic innovator in music. He doesn't play to a 'set list' which is dictated by a huge radio station (read back on your Peel biographies and his early days, please). A Peel of our day if you will, with his own eclectic taste in music. If you think his biography isn't factual, why not ask him for proof rather than pulling punches at him and making sly person remarks, or comments about his 'hot' assistant? Wiki is not meant to be smut.com.</p>
<p>I refer you back to the court case of Wiki vs Encyclopedia Britannica, and specifically:</p>
<p>For its study, Nature chose articles from both sites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles - one from each site on a given topic - side by side but were not told which article came from which site. Nature got back 42 usable reviews from its field of experts.</p>
<p>So where is your consultation with the experts here? It seems that the 'keep' people above know their stuff when it comes to the facts. I'll take their word for it because I don’t have the time to trawl the internet to back them up. However, regardless of ‘fact’ or not, I fail to see why anyone would want to delete the entry of someone who clearly breaks the mould on a musical front. I don't want to go back to the days when Heart FM or Capital Gold was all that the mass British public would (or could) listen to, and you guys are not helping the case here. We're in a completely different era of music - one that one that embraces originality and creativity. Don't try to stomp it out. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.227.62 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__82.3.227.62_e91a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 82.3.227.62">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I know it has rather fallen afoul of the non-promotion angle but I'm sure its not the first time a useful entry has arisen from such activity - the main criteria surely has to be whether the topic is notable enough. I am quite suprised this is an issue (I would have voted for notability on what I knew but reading through the early version of the entry I ran across various other things which I wasn't aware of which would have also counted towards his being notable like headf**k and his directing Fatboy Slim's first video) and things here seem to have got bogged down in claim and counter-claim so I did a bit of digging for information based on the criteria listed in the section on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html#Musicians_and_ensembles" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Notability in music</a>: "<i>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, <b>DJ</b> etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i>"</p>

<li><b>Keep!</b> When searching for info on mr hyman,i find a bunch of people arguing over wether he's notable??????????</li>
</ul>
<p>this doesnt surprise me as i hadnt heard of him until a few months ago,but this guy is supernova huge.no matter wether you've heard of him he's been the underlying force that was put in charge of curating the rave movement(so to speak).as a twenty something i'm starting to find all the music i love wouldn't be in the mainstream if he'd failed.(think jacque lu cont or The egg from the french car adds)i dont get london radio but i know the statistics &amp; he's heard by nearly200'000 people every week(2-3% of the london!).i think with a fanbase like that you can call him famous.he's all over nightclub flyers/festival line-ups at the moment,so i started researching how he's contributed to alternative music,&amp; can assure you he IS the new john peel.i think he was even the 1st person to ever air gnarls barkley(months before its release).his position in the british underground scene as a dj means he is realy good friends with some of the biggest names in music from before they were famous(just like john peel was).he's pushed many an artist into the limelight by having a massive influence on what other dj's play(just like john peel).And is in the british media on a monthly basis being interviewed or asked for a whats hot list.i think any directorial work he's done doesn't even need to be brought up.just think of how different pop music is nowadays,it's all beats.without him putting so much effort into making beats cool,getting them on air &amp; in adverts, we'd all still be listening to the spice girls &amp; aqua, condemning breakbeat as something only drug using ravers listen to.vinyl2008</p>

<p>"street-teamery"? Yes, I get that impression a bit. More extensive an article than I would have expected maybe, but worthy of inclusion.

<dd><i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Modest_Proposal_989b.html" title="A Modest Proposal">An even more modest proposal</a></i> - Art's chainsawing has fashioned a reasonable starting point from which a decent entry could be created. I'd rather not blanket ban people for being passionate about an entry (even if there is a degree of barging through various "ways things are done" - presumably through ignorance rather than... whatever a more sinister motivation may be). Who knows some may be bitten by the Wikipedia bug and go on to contribute in other areas (and the majority of the others will disappear and never be heard from anyway). Whoever its going to be difficult to fashion the best entry possible if there is too much interference (if well meaning) so how about a gentlemen's (and ladies) agreement from those folks not to interfere or we'll revert the article. It should then be possible to build the entry back up piece by piece focusing on the most notable work (DJing, film work, music videos, TV work, etc. - broken down into sections) with each stage getting a thorough factchecking as we go. Its not the fastest way to build an encyclopedic entry but perhaps <b><a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">being too bold</a></b> is what has brought us to this point in the first place. Just another idea on ways to move this forward. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 04:07, 9 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<li>Changing vote to <b>userfy</b>. Since this article claims to have been written by either the real, or an impostor of, James Hyman, his girlfriend, and their "street team", this is clearly a user homepage.
