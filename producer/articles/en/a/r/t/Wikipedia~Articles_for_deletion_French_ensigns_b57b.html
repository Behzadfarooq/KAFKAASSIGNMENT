<p>the basic concept is based on flawed research, namely, that there exist a certain number of plain flag with the french flag in canton used to design colonial flag. some french posession do have a tricolore in canton but these are either pre-existing flag to which a tricolore was added or flags that were created in toto. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_pasquin_7f83.html" title="User:Marc pasquin">Marc pasquin</a> 01:38, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b> - the article is more about British Ensigns than French. Several French ensigns are illustrated and there is a claim that they are used by French Overseas Territories but no actual example is given (ie which territories). Given that AVD has a history of misusing sources (Ground Zero has looked up AVD's sources in the past only to find that they don't say what he claims they say) we should probably delete this.

<dd>Homeontherange, <i>I see you have changed your vote from <b>Delete</b> to <b>Merge.</b></i> It is nice to see that you conceed that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article I created has some value on Wikipedia. However, as for <b>Merging</b> the article with another <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_France_a644.html" title="Flag of France">Flag of France</a> article, I would strongly disagree with that suggestion. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article touches on a subject that is not generally known in Vexillology, and it provides a compact, specialised article to highlight these French Flags, which are commonly overlooked, and un-emphasised. <i>I submit to you that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article is quite appropriate, and educational in <b>its present location (i.e., with its own separate article).</b></i> <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmchairVexillologistDon_2c04.html" title="User:ArmchairVexillologistDon">ArmchairVexillologistDon</a> 20:55, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> Sorry Marc, but you're incorrect. There are a number of flags that have used the tricolor canton. Togo has, Wallis &amp; Futuna has and Morocco has, to name just three off the top of my head. A quick glance at some of the pages on <a href="http://www.fotw.net/flags/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fotw.net/flags/index.html" rel="nofollow">the Flags of the World website</a> (many of which I had a hand in writing, I venture to add) will show that what Don is saying is basically correct, though some of the things said on the page do need their accuracy checked. The use of the word "ensign" is also a little wayward, to say the least - these are colonial flags, not ensigns (ensigns are flown from ships, not used on land). (BTW Don, are you on the fotw mailing list?)</s> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 12:21, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>
<ul>
<li>Okay - Marc's explained to me a bit more clearly what his beef is with the page, and I understand now. That there are flags like this in general is accepted, but their direct relation to British ones is questionable, especially given their usage. Also, some of the 'templates for flags" shown on the page in question never existed as flags in themselves. Many countries have used or do use flag designs similar to those probably first used by the British navy, either deliberately or coincidentally - and that is worthy of a Wikipedia article. The current article, though, is not that article. This needs a thorough rewrite, a split and a move to titles like Similarities in European colonial flag designs and Similarities in European naval ensign designs (or possibly something a bit more catchy). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 12:43, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no parallel -- none -- in the use of British and French ensigns. The British have a system: red for merchant vessels, blue for government, white for naval (I have somewhat oversimplified) that France never had. Please act along the lines of Marc Pasquin's and James Dignan's ("Grutness") arguments. The parent article is just plain wrong; I don't know where the author got his information. ASKirsch

<li>Is <i>everyone</i> from FOTW on Wikipedia?

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, in the sense that the French Ensign is worthy of an article. Much of the page belongs elsewhere, if at all, but that is an issue for talk pages, not AfD. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 09:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I want to comment on two issues, espeically since my name came up with regard to one of them. In a previous debate on AVD's contention that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_flag.html" title="Canadian flag">Canadian flag</a> was based on what he calls the "republican tricolour", AVD provided a list of references to support his argument. (This was on an article he wrote entitled "French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag", which was deleted.) Most of them were for books published decades before the maple leaf flag was introduced in 1965. I looked into a recent book to which he referred, and could find nothing to support AVD's claim. Part of the problem was that instead of providing the page number to support his claim, which is what would normally be done, he provided the number of the page from which he took the publisher's information, which is not useful in any way to someone trying to verify the references. <s>And he never provided the pagge number to support his claim at any time later.</s> The other issue is his statement, "If I have to obey the 'No Personal Attack Rule' then so does Homeontherange." When has AVD ever obeyed the NPA rule? Several editors have pointed out his violations, and he has never withdrawn the attacks (as far as I know). There is currently an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_ArmchairVexillologistDon_9fd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/ArmchairVexillologistDon">RfC</a> about his personal attacks, and he made a personal attack against me on the RfC page, which he has not withdrawn or apologized for. Because of his behaviour, it is hard to known whether this article has been written in good faith based on the references cited, or if it is original research. His past behaviour suggests the latter. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 15:39, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

He stated that he was not aware of this, and he had nothing to do with it.

<dd>I stand corrected with reference to the Archibald book. You did provide page references after I requested them, so I will withdraw the remark that I made above. The rest of our discussion shows, however, that the book does not support your claim that the Canadian flag is based on the republican tricolour. You have drawn, on your own, the conclusion that the remote similiarity of the Canadian flags to the flags of other countries, some of which are republics, is basis enough to draw your conclusion that the design of the maple leaf flag was chosen to promote republicanism by undermining royal and British connections and symbolism. In this case, the reference that you provided did not support your claim, but rather showed that what you were writing was original research.</dd>
<dd>As far as the "coincidences", it is not uncommon for editors to watch the contributions of editors who in the past have violated Wikipedia policies. As you know, the "French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag" was deleted for being a POV fork of what you were trying to include in the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Canada_52f6.html" title="Flag of Canada">Flag of Canada</a> article, which is not permitted. So you should not be surprised if your contributions are being monitored. This is one of the ways that Wikipedia policies can be maintained. Of course, if you are not violating Wikipedia policies, then you should not be concerned that others are watching your work. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 19:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
