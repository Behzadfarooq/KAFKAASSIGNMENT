<dd>Nothing to be sorry for, the AfD process did exactly what it was supposed to do... besides, the fault is largely mine. I should have made the article more complete in the first place. Wikipedia does have its share of local politicians - mayors of medium-sized towns, even some notable or controversial city council members. School board members are not so well represented, but then again, very few of them oversee multi-billion dollar budgets for decades in a row! --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:47, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b><s>:</s> Some dude. It's a local scandal, it seems, and that's interesting, but without any effects or regional implications, it's just too much of a news item. No actual accomplishments are given for him as head of the council (not superintendant, which is an elected office and requires notoriety at least) -- not even a particularly glowing smile from a patient -- just that he was a long time member of the board and that a school was named after him when folks thought it shouldn't be. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:07, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not being snarky, but could one of those who knows this other information please <i>add it to the article?</i> I assess articles solely by what it written, and the sorts of information that would have kept me from voting to delete simply were not present. One of the fallacies of VfD-cleanup is that we end up with people doing research, finding information, and voting keep, but the additional information doesn't always end up in the article. This is, in fact, why I insist on voting for the article, not the topic: if we all vote keep based on the article that <i>could</i> be written, then we end up leaving a subpar article in place. If folks go to the trouble of coming up with additional information, they have only to put it into the article, even in the crudest way, if they're strapped for time or disinclined to write. Again, this is not meant to be a personal attack or insult, but when VfD is over 150 articles a day, voting on a reading of the articles is difficult enough; voting on the invisible other articles is impossible, at least for me. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:11, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good point, and I guess part of the problem is that the best sources of information on the guy's contributions are not readily accessible on the internet.

<li>Reply: My high school was named after a living person, Queen Elizabeth, and she's not famous because many schools are named after her; it's the other way around. It sounds like he would never have been worthy of a school naming, but he got it, because he was on the board.

<li>I find the responses of several of the keep voters frustrating. "Why are we clogging up Vfd", "no need to keep voting", "article has survived a previous vote for deletion- no more need be said". Guys, Wikipedia is an evolving leviathan- as we go forward, there is nothing to say that old rulings can't be changed. <i>There is no Double Jeopardy clause on Wikipedia</i>. One Vfd survival does not create immunity. I wasn't going to vote, but now it's a <b>delete</b>, just to cancel out somebody else's vote.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 14:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find the re-nomination of <b>kept</b> articles frustrating. This is exactly the problem. Thanks for so clearly demonstrating the bad faith I was implying by speciously "changing" your vote. Also, great motivation for voting. You should be given a medal.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But even within the context of an evolving leviathan, shouldn't new reasons for deletion be given? If the old reason resulted in "keep" last time, why try a second time for exactly the same reason?<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:31, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree, adopting this as a norm encourages "I didn't like the last AfD, so I'll try until I get a result I like." This is a dangerous precedent to set, since there are many people with axes to grid who are more persistent than others trying to stop them. That said, I'm sure that's <b>not</b> what's going on here. I'm just worried about the precedent. --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 16:20, September 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is some precedent for re-nominating articles that were kept based on low-turnout votes. Six people voted in the original VfD (4 keep, 1 delete, 1 merge/redirect - oddly the nominator abstained). I certainly don't think the nomination was in bad faith, but rather represents a attempt to get a larger sense of the community. Also, it spurred me to improve an article which I have neglected. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 16:27, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
