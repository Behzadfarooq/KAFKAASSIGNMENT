<p>An autobio woudn't serve any purpose. But since when has that inhibited human behavior. If you are private or shy (I'm both which is why i didn't include my month and date of birth) then don't put anything, but at least brag about your cats, dogs, or whatever. haha. But then I'm probably too friendly for my own good. Do as you want. Len.</p>

<p>Well, since it comes from a Fox-related official organization, I guess I'll let it slide, but it certainly isn't the story that I've heard for years and years.

<p>Perhaps i was gullible. It may be in the talk page of the Dab or one of the articles linked from it, but somewhere, someone else asserted it convincingly, when i questioned the addition of the sexual slang to, i think, the place-name article. Or it may be on his and my talk pages (or now in my talk archive pages).</p>
<p>It's also on the sexual slang page, based on the same input (but bcz of my desire to get it off its initially prominent place on the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowing_Rock%2C_North_Carolina_2301.html" title="Blowing Rock, North Carolina">Blowing Rock, North Carolina</a> page).</p>

I have instigated a new poll on that page. I am hoping that this poll will properly allow all users who have an interest in the subject to express their views fairly before we come to a consensus. I have scrapped the poll that was previously in place on that page because I believe that it was part of an unfair procedure that was going against the majority view. I am appealing to all users who contribute to that page to approve my actions.

<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, becuase I wanted to, since all the other <i>Trek</i> pages are all like that...</p>
<p>Plus...what you did, didn't really make sense... you deleted the periods (...'s) from "USS" and "SS" in the ship names from "WNMHGB", and didn't in "The Cage"... you just un-italised U.S.S. but left the periods.</p>
<p>I suggest If you change ONE <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> page, then I suggest going and changing EVERY <i>Star Trek</i> page and do the same thing, delete all the periods from USS. Start with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_TOS_episodes_49ad.html" title="List of Star Trek TOS episodes">List of Star Trek TOS episodes</a> and go through each episode one by one and change them all. After that go through every other <i>Trek" page (including characters, locations, technology, alien races, and starship classes) and do the same thing.</i></p>
<p>Sounds like a daunting task to me. Have fun.</p>
<p><b>Re: Re: Ship Names</b></p>

<dd>More power to ya then, I won't make anymore changes to your corrections. I personally like having "U.S.S." with periods in the name. Since it's written that way on the starship's hulls. To me it's more I dunno "respectful". Just my opinion. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 20:20, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I read your comment in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemon_dialing_693b.html" title="Talk:Demon dialing">Talk:Demon dialing</a> about the confusion in the difference between demon dialing and war dialing, and I agree on your take one it. Specificly that demon dialing is the rapid redialing of a phone number, commonly used to gain access to a often-busy telephone number (such as a popular BBS). Whereas war dialing is dialing a large quantity of phone numbers (typically only once) to determine which ones have modems connected to them.</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to Wikipedia, so I don't feel terribly comfortable at this point making a big change or switch to the pair of articles, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_dialing.html" title="War dialing">War dialing</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon_dialing.html" title="Demon dialing">Demon dialing</a>, such as you suggested.

<p>Good afternoon!</p>
<p>&gt; I was wondering, what's your source for the detail that George Washington Carver &gt; was romantically involved with his assistant, Austin Curtis, Jr.?</p>
<p>I myself had had an opportunity to read about it in a biography about him from our local library. There are a few websites, and even a (registration required) online news article which talk of his assistant (a middle school basic report - <a href="http://www.east-buc.k12.ia.us/99_00/PK/gwc.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.east-buc.k12.ia.us/99_00/PK/gwc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.east-buc.k12.ia.us/99_00/PK/gwc.htm</a> ) and that he was gay ( <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/582/000030492/" class="external free" title="http://www.nndb.com/people/582/000030492/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nndb.com/people/582/000030492/</a> ), ( <a href="http://www.paulsgaystamps.com/The%20Victorian%20Age/The_Victorian_Age_Page_12.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.paulsgaystamps.com/The%20Victorian%20Age/The_Victorian_Age_Page_12.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.paulsgaystamps.com/The%20Victorian%20Age/The_Victorian_Age_Page_12.htm</a> ) ( <a href="http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioc1/carv3.html" class="external free" title="http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioc1/carv3.html" rel="nofollow">http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioc1/carv3.html</a> ) etc. Thanks for asking!</p>

<p>Hi. Someone just apparently decided to rename the episode "<a href="../../../w/h/e/Where_No_One_Has_Gone_Before_%28TNG_episode%29_c182.html" title="Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode)">Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode)</a> to "Where None Have Gone Before". This has been reverted, but I spotted it also quoted Data as saying "Where none have gone before". I noticed you added this. Can you confirm whether you added this from the episode in question, or from the shooting script on the internet, (which has the wrong "None" episode title, and thus I wouldn't trust). <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 19:49, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
