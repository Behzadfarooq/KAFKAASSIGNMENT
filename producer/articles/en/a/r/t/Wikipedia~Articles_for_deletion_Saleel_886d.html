<li><b>keep</b> Saleels website Sunniforum.com is one of the largest growing websites on the web for Islam with a wide range of support from Islamic scholars.

<li><b>keep</b> i think we should definitely keep this link. i have vastly improved my knowledge of the wonderfully varied world of Islam and Muslim peoples after reading some excellent thought-provoking material on his websites. We need to encourage more of this type of stuff from these youngsters at a time when many are being driven into despair and hatred of our culture through the actions of our very own war-mongering politicians. His articles are a breath of fresh air. i also thoroughly recommend everyone to sample some of the audio links on his site. the 'Nasheeds' songs he has contained therein are certainly unique and really put one's body under strain when trying to move to them. If this is traditional Islamic culture then i want more of this! Well done to Wikipedia for allowing entries like this to exist. They have certainly changed my life for the better and i will forever be indebted to Mr. Saleel for my improved understanding and music collection!--Aloo Paratha 11:37, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I haven't attacked anyone, yes they all posted before you, and what exactly is your point? As for whether or not they are sockpuppets, or they simply happened to be anonymous Wikipedia editors who all happened upon the article at the same time, and all happened to decide to register for the very first time so that they could vote, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> provides the answer. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:49, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>My "point" is that,in reponse your query "<i>were they all also "personally attacking" you and "blatantly lying"?</i> ", they were not making a personal attack on me - I hadn't even posted here, or made the changes to the article yet - wheras you were (Yet again). It's also worth noting that this is yet another Muslim-Based article that you wish to remove.. another 'trend' apparent. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 14:00, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One "trend" I see here is that only you and a bunch of sockpuppets want to keep this article, and everyone else voting sees that it is not notable. The second "trend" I see is that you have looked at my contributions, and then deliberately voted the opposite way I voted on all recent VfDs (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/CYNF&amp;diff=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/CYNF&amp;diff=0" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), along with reverting my recent edits or reversions (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11466679" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11466679" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). The final "trend" I see is for you to support vanity articles relating to Muslims, making all sorts of claims about notability which you refuse to back up with evidence; for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Ibraheem_mohammed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=9293268" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Ibraheem_mohammed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=9293268" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - There are no sockpuppets AFAIK. I made an appeal on Sunniforum for people to vote to keep the article (with the idea that many people on sunniforum were long time wikipedia users as well) because I truly believe that Saleel is a notable person. Instead of the vetern wikipedians voting as I expected, lots of people decided to register and make their first edit on the vote page. At the most there may be one sockpuppet, otherwise the rest of them are all different members of Sunniforum. <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHussaynKhariq_b8c1.html" title="User:HussaynKhariq">HussaynKhariq</a> 23:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
