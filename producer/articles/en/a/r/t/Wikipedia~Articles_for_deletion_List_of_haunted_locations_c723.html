<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The subject matter on this page is often subjective, and serves as a good point of entry for anyone with an interest in the paranormal to look up the facts behind what is often folklore, coincidence or tradition. A name change, and clear introduction into the subject would help and perhaps encouragement of referencing, but deletion would be a tragedy, a loss of a unique source for anyone with an interest in the subject. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostieguide_1f8a.html" title="User:Ghostieguide">Ghostieguide</a> 00:34, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Essentially all this is is a dismabiguation page that links to existing articles that claim paranormal activity occurs at a certain place. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is actually followed in the individual articles, as they themselves provide the links to reputable sources to back up the claims. As for the article itself failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, that's a bogus claim. Look at the bottom. References. A lot of the article IS supported by links to existing articles on the internet. That's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> satisfied too. Just because you haven't heard of something in the article isn't legitimate reason to delete the entire thing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 00:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your being selective. 'Most' are not in fact ghost sites. At least half of them are published books, which pass RS. We also have WGNTV, which is another news site like the BBC and the Seattle Times.

<li>Oh, and since all of these say 'alleged' 'supposedly' or 'said to be' haunted rather than claming they ARE haunted, all I have to prove to you is that there are reliable sources that make the claim.

<li>No, NOR means WE can't make the claims. We aren't making the claims personally. This article has citation tags yes, Because it's still in the process of being sourced and cleaned up. You've alread turned round and tried to argue that 38 sources don't count, so I doubt you'd accept it even if the 66 tags were filled in tomorrow. Strange as it might seem, putting together a comprehensive article doesn't happen overnight. The article was certainly not abandoned, as the dit history shows.

The question of its reality is irrelevant to the article itself (yes, as others brought up, the title may be changed to reflect this a little better), but if a newspaper says "<a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,21097363-27977,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,21097363-27977,00.html" rel="nofollow">such and such a place is haunted</a>," who are we to treat it any differently than a newspaper claiming "an <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_bomb.html" title="Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a> was dropped on <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroshima.html" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>?" Who cares whether the place is haunted by <i>your</i> definition of the term? To insist that it <i>isn't</i> despite sources would qualify as original research. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 06:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep!</b> Good grief, how could I have missed the fact that this was up for AFD for 3 days? I've been putting some effort into getting this cited and cleaned up with an eye towards nominating it for featured list in a few months. I thought it sort of strange that other people had suddenly taken off with the sourcing but was glad - now I see the reason, it's on AFD. However, there is nothing in this list that should cause it to be deleted. Everything I could say in favor of keeping it has pretty much already been said; but this list is improving by leaps and bounds and if it keeps up it won't be long before it meets all the featured list requirements. There's no reason on Earth not to keep it. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 19:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
