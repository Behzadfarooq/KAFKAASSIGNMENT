<p>It is half a list of quotations, half original research. There's no standard for inclusion--sources are incredibly diverse, and everyone knows that predictions often fail, anyway.

<li><b>Comment</b> This list may be interesting, but the same can be said of many other things (e.g., personal essays) which also do not belong here. Also, consider the vast amount this covers. I have old fantasy football magazines that predict various things about NFL players. Should I add quotes about the expected fantasy worth of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Rivers_39ff.html" title="Philip Rivers">Philip Rivers</a>? Should I find people who have failed to predict the proper results of various elections? Should I pull quotes from magazines or other sources that predicted <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Daughtry_4d28.html" title="Chris Daughtry">Chris Daughtry</a> would win <i>American Idol</i> in the fifth season? If this list has its place somewhere, let it grow happily, but I do not see it as the sort of article which belongs on Wikipedia. Perhaps if it were more specialized to some degree that it could reasonable be kept, I would vote differently, but as it stands, this is an indiscriminate collection of non-notable information with great potential to spiral into a great mess.

<dd>Well, Wikipedia isn't a place for lists of quotes in the first place - that's for Wikiquote. Secondly, why list failed predictions? Predictions often fail, often succeed - what is notable about that? Failed predictions as a category aren't notable in themselves, though they may be good in the relevant articles. (Would we want a list of successful predictions, where somebody once said something like "Everyone will drive cars to work in the future"?) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Famous_Movie_Director_f37a.html" title="User:The Famous Movie Director">Grace</a> 02:16, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Why delete it? If it doesn't seem "professional" enough, why doesn't it just get cleaned up a bit. It's an extremely enjoyable read, and a more complete list of failed predictions is nowhere to be found anywhere on the web. It is the perfect supplement to the 'predictions' Wikipage, and it would be downright discriminatory to deny people the right to explore the various predictions made over the years that have amounted to nothing! I say clean it up, but don't delete it.<a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckatsis_0dc7.html" title="User:Ackatsis">Ackatsis</a> 10:55, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please sign your comments by typing four tildes, ~~~~, at the end. That something is "an extremely enjoyable read" (which I agree it is, in parts) doesn't qualify it for inclusion on Wikipedia. That said, the whole content of the article is free under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, so if your reason for keeping is just that you like it, why not copy it to your own website? Or create the page on Wikiquote. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Famous_Movie_Director_f37a.html" title="User:The Famous Movie Director">Grace</a> 08:24, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you still want to delete it, why not integrate many of these quotes into their respective articles? And we just have to keep those failed Doomsday predictions- as far as I'm concerned, they're a part of human history, and, therefore, are worthy of inclusion in any encyclopaedia. They could easily be linked to the 'Prophecy' Wikipage. <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckatsis_0dc7.html" title="User:Ackatsis">Ackatsis</a> 12:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>(Please don't alter another user's comments, or add another "Keep" that might make it look like you're trying to vote twice. I've moved up your reply to make it clear that it's part of the same discussion.)

<li><b>Comment</b> The majority of Ackatsis's few contributions to Wikipedia are edits to this AfD. GassyGuy 08:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, GassyGuy- what's your point? I haven't exactly been a registered Wikipedian (is that the right noun?) for that many days. This article is basically the one that I feel the most strongly about keeping at this present time. Is there a minimum contribution quota that you feel I should know about?<a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckatsis_0dc7.html" title="User:Ackatsis">Ackatsis</a> 09:07, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just how many "votes" do you suppose you get? GassyGuy 08:32, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would also note that this user's only three Wikipedia edits have all been to this AfD. GassyGuy 08:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm really sorry, but I just want to get a genuine vote in. I changed a comment earlier, and it was a stupid, childish thing to do (and I really do apologise), but now I've been told that my previous vote is void. So I'm just trying to get one proper vote in here. If you want, I'll delete my previous comments and just leave the most recent one, but I'm not sure if that's counted as vandalism. Can I do that, or does somebody else do it? Thankyou. 203.49.243.1 09:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> My only complaint was that you started more than one statement with the word "Keep." That makes it look as if you're trying to vote more than once. I have no problem with you posting your views on here, but start the rest with the word "Comment" as you have done with the most recent one. GassyGuy 09:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> OK, thanks. I'll do that. Does this mean that I can just completely delete my previous votes and just keep the most recent one?203.49.243.1 09:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You don't even have to do that, just replace one of the "Keep"s with a "Comment" or whatever to make it clear that it isn't a vote. GassyGuy 09:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
