<p>&gt;Hundreds? There are 50. And if you delete the Monster Rancher stubs, by that token, you need to delete all the Pokemon stubs for the same reason. And the Neopets stubs. And all the other virual pet pages. And to a lesser extent, any stubs on videogame "ripoffs". And possibly stubs on dervivative movies and franchises, too. Why have stubs on Family Guy when you could argue that it's a Simpsons look-alike? And why not delete the Star Wars pages? They're just like Star Trek. Wikipedia is supposed to be totally comprehensive. Deleting pages because YOU don't like a franchise is just immature and goes against the inherent spirit of the Wiki. Please give a reason that's better than that. The page isn't offensive, false, spam, or vandalism. Just because you don't like the franchise or have the OPINION that it's superfluous is no reason to delete pages on it. I vote to keep any wikipedia page that isn't false information or vandalism. Too much information never hurt anybody. <b>Keep</b>, obviously. - Zeta7 06:23, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - See <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>; it's currently being discussed whether the Pokemon stubs are worth keeping or consolidating. The Monster Rancher monsters aren't terribly excyclopedic, because, to be honest, nobody but fans of Monster Rancher really care about them. Contrast this with the more important Pokemon or the Star Wars characters and concepts, which have significant cultural and pop culture impact. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 06:31, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I second that. If we're already planning to un-important-ise the phenomenally successful (by anyone's reckoning) Pokemon franchise, surely THIS should share a similar if not "worse" fate. I'm happy to see it moved as per what <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> said below though. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 09:03, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since when has notability been a requirement for a wikipedia page? Once it's established that anything too indepth or obscure can't be included in Wikipedia, I'll give you the point, but until then - none of these arguments actually adhere to real wikipedia policy. Unless there's a notice that says "Hey, don't write TOO much or else!", I don't see how Wikipedia could BENEFIT from NOT including articles that are factual. Wikipedia is not a real book with a limited amount of pages to write in. There are a number of articles on obscure data, facts, movies, or videogames that could just as likely be deleted. But I don't see how this website could ever claim to be comprehensive if "some information is just too much". Maybe you could just get rid of ALL the fictional pages? Or split wikipedia into fiction and non-fiction? I mean, all of my friends told me how great this place is because it accepts a high volume of data. I had no idea that it would be so discriminatory based on tastes. Oh, and A Man in Black, I notice that a high volume of your edits are to Pokemon pages. I wonder if your opinion on this franchise might have been infulenced by something else. These pages don't hurt anyone, and they don't violate policies. I don't see how you could argue for their deletion unless you change the policiy of wikipedia to exclude "information nobody wants". Which is an absurd idea - Zeta</li>

<li>Notability has nothing to do with how big an article is. There could be 2000 lines on this or more and it would still not change the fact it scores only 270 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Bajarl+%22Monster+Rancher%22+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Bajarl+%22Monster+Rancher%22+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>Quite frankly I HATE people constantly spouting "oh this isn't paper!" as a reason why others' notability/(something)cruft deletion votes are silly. Why document the side details of a (comparitively) non-notable franchise? It's not favouritism, it's realism. Do I start pages about every single <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Axe_7fd0.html" title="Golden Axe">Golden Axe</a></i> character and monster just because I love the franchise and could easily write a detailed page for each with "fascinating" (to me and other fans that is) details? No, because it's NOT important to most of the world. This is certainly far more noteworthy than <i>Golden Axe</i> is (I'll readily admit to that) but does not quite transcend into timeless culture the way <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> does. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 09:03, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes there are fifteen. The original nominator only nominated the first, and I, as noted at the top, dutifully added the rest.

<li><b>keep</b>. Wikipedia will one day be a great cultural resource, and factual articles about pop culture are interesting in that regard.

<li><b>Keep</b> If the series is notable enough to keep, then the monsters are notable enough since they'll add extra info to somebody who hasn't played the game but is looking for info (For example, the articles tell what the specific monsters look like, which can help somebody decide what the graphics in the game are like, or it can help somebody who reads that you can create different monsters with disks but who doesn't understand how the monsters vary.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There maybe doesn't need to be a separate article for each monster though--you could probably make one "Monsters in Monster Rancher" article and merge most of the info together.</p>

<li>Why don't we just delete all of this so-called "fancruft" while we're at it? Why does Homer Simpson need his own article? *rolls eyes* <b>Keep</b>.

<li>Well, I personally don't think that Homer Simpson is a notable fictional character. Who cares if others think so? What matters is what I think, obviously, since these Monster Rancher characters are being nominated because the nominator <i>thinks</i> they aren't notable. <a href="../../../k/e/t/User%7EKetsuban_cc56.html" title="User:Ketsuban">Ketsy</a> 20:20, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, you seem to be using the phrase <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> in a negative manner. If you look at the article on it, you'll see that not all <i>redictia ad absurdum</i> (is that pluralisation correct?) are "silly arguments". <a href="../../../k/e/t/User%7EKetsuban_cc56.html" title="User:Ketsuban">Ketsuban has spoken.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>merge</b>. Despite the apparent belief of its fans that these Monster Ranchers are on par with Darth Vader and Homer Simpson for pop culture impact, such arguments are, to put it politely, far-fetched. They are too insignificant for the amount of attention they're getting--- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 3:17 18 May 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. Monster Rancher characters might not be as culturally significant as say, Homer Simpson, but there are plenty of pages here that deal exclusively with characters, etc. that people not in that fandom wouldn't care jack about. Just in the realm of videogame players, <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecil_Harvey_7784.html" title="Cecil Harvey">Cecil Harvey</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kain_Highwind_d82c.html" title="Kain Highwind">Kain Highwind</a> both FFIV characters, have their own pages, and I think the Monster Rancher series probably has had more cultural impact than Final Fantasy IV did (as it first came out before the series got truly popular in the U.S., and it's rerelease made relatively little cultural stir outside of die hard FF fans).
