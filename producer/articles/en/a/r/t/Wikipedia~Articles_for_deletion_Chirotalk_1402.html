<li><b>Delete</b> - The sites owner (editor Abotnick) has made many attempts add a link to his forum site on the main <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> article as well. His forum site makes it known that they are focused on boosting the sites PageRank by getting inbound links (from prominent sites such as Wikipedia). As for the references by other publications below, it should be known that user Abotnick works with Neck911.com (organization that created the hate-message billboard) in publishing and promoting press releases. With the NCAHF reference, it should be noted that the anti-chiropractic circle is a tight ring (in fact they participate in a Skeptic Web ring). They all link to each other, again to boost PageRank. As far as the James Randi reference goes, the "anonymous ex-chiropractor" that it refers to is in fact Allen Botnick once again self-promoting his website. Doing a cursory web search for his name on Google, I am actually able to find that he has inserted links to his website and cause all over the Internet in seemingly odd and inappropriate places. My feeling is that him creating a Wikipedia article about his forum Chirotalk is just another attempt at - as TheDoctorIsIn noted - shameless self-promotion. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 23:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regarding WP:Web one of the criteria is if the site is referenced by other publications. This site has been referenced in three. The first is in print and online while the other two are online:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/tcj/2005/aug/a.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/tcj/2005/aug/a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/tcj/2005/aug/a.htm</a> "Billboard's hate message is short‑lived" August 2005</p>
<p>"Even many critics of chiropractic were put off by the viciousness of the attack. During a discussion of the billboard on a predominantly anti‑chiropractic Internet group (Chirotalk: The Skeptical Chiropractic Discussion Forum), one member called the sign "Fear mongering, nothing more..." Another stated, "It's a cheap tactic to hit the public with a sledgehammer that big." One member made an interesting point by saying: "What if we had one for 'Aspirin can kill you!' or 'Reading this sign while driving can kill you!' That is simply a sensationalized ad to get attention.""</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncahf.org/digest04/04-11.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ncahf.org/digest04/04-11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncahf.org/digest04/04-11.html</a> "Skeptical chiropractic forum launched. An online discussion forum for the critical investigation of chiropractic topics has been launched by Allen Botnick, DC, who voluntarily surrendered his chiropractic licenses after concluding that his education had not prepared him to practice safely. He started Chirotalk because other discussion groups have expelled people who posted critical comments. Chirotalk is open to anyone who wants to discuss the problems associated with chiropractic theory and practice."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-01/012006bigfoot.html" class="external free" title="http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-01/012006bigfoot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-01/012006bigfoot.html</a></p>
<p>"Thank you, Brian. We have here a note from last week’s anonymous ex-chiropractor who was involved, and I think it will be encouraging to others and give a new source of assistance. He writes:</p>
<p>Thanks for forwarding me the nice emails from your readers. While it will probably be a while before I "come out of the chiropractic closet" and use my real name, I do currently participate in an email discussion list called Chirotalk. The address is: <a href="http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi" class="external free" title="http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi</a></p>
<p>The members of this list are mostly former chiropractors along with a few Physical Therapists who are chiro skeptics. The purpose of the list is to support chiropractors trying to get out of the profession (suggestions for new careers, encouragement, etc.) and to keep information on the web to discourage new students from enrolling in chiropractic college.</p>
<p>I have gotten a lot of ideas from this list as to how to move forward with my life. The main reason I wrote you is that I respect your opinion a lot and, also, I wanted to bring attention to the fact that there are students like me who have been ripped off by the chiropractic schools.</p>
<p>I agree that I have a moral obligation to help potential students see the full picture. Chiro college recruiters are very good at painting chiropractors as mainstream healthcare professionals based in science. This is fraud – as far as I'm concerned – since all chiropractic is still based on subluxation theory, although some modern chiros call subluxations different names, like fixations, spinal lesions, etc.</p>
<p>Allen Botnick, D.C., is the chiropractor who started the discussion list. He is also graduated from my college and has written, under his real name, about his experiences as a chiropractor. He has really endured a lot of hatred from the chiropractic profession for his honesty. It’s at: www.chirobase.org/03Edu/botnick.html</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for spreading the word. While I certainly wouldn't accept donations from anybody, I am inspired to consider telling my story in a more public way in the future. The kind messages from your readers have shown me that skeptics really have big hearts."</p>
<p>The site is volunteer and not for profit-unlike the chiropractors who are bashing it. It deserves mentioning. Abotnick 22:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;The sites owner (editor Abotnick) has made many attempts add a link to his forum site on the main Chiropractic article as well.</p>
<p>Levine has a problem with many of the skeptical contributors to the Chiropractic article. I have actually written two of the paragraphs in the current chiropractic article and edited and rewrote the lead. Please see discussion for more information.</p>
<p>&gt;His forum site makes it known that they are focused on boosting the sites PageRank by getting inbound links (from prominent sites such as Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Levine is referring to the writings of one individual member of the forum, not the forum itself. The forum itself is referenced by many individuals outside the forum itself as the statistics show. It is not simply self promotion.</p>
<p>&gt;As for the references by other publications below, it should be known that user Abotnick works with Neck911.com (organization that created the hate-message billboard) in publishing and promoting press releases.</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with the reference posted above. That was independently written.</p>
<p>&gt;With the NCAHF reference, it should be noted that the anti-chiropractic circle is a tight ring (in fact they participate in a Skeptic Web ring). They all link to each other, again to boost PageRank.</p>
<p>NCAHF is a legitimate skeptical newsletter. Levine is implying that any skeptical publication is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>&gt;As far as the James Randi reference goes, the "anonymous ex-chiropractor" that it refers to is in fact Allen Botnick once again self-promoting his website. Doing a cursory web search for his name on Google, I am actually able to find that he has inserted links to his website and cause all over the Internet in seemingly odd and inappropriate places. My feeling is that him creating a Wikipedia article about his forum Chirotalk is just another attempt at - as.</p>
<p>I had no part in writing the Randi article. Please back up your statements with evidence Levine and stop the conjecture. Chirotalk is either the number one or number two top chiropractic discussion forum on the web and has been cited in several publications. It certainly has the most uncensored content as the other sites actively censor skeptical opinions (as I suspect some people are trying to do here by suggesting that Chirotalk's wiki entry be removed). People are going to be curious about its history and goals and it's worth a few bytes on Wikipedia.Abotnick 23:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Abotnick has tried spamming his website in many instances around WP. He has also added fake "press releases" into the chiropractic article that he has written about himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know this isn't my first comment, but if you take out all the sentences with Allen Botnik's name in them, as it should be on Wikipedia, then there is nothing to the article. It is basically an autobiographical article about Allen Botnick's bias against the chiropratcic profession, and why he created his own little weblog. I'll delete the sentences with his name in them and see 1) how long it lasts, and 2)what the article looks like...thank you<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.115.143.82 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.115.143.82.html" title="User talk:68.115.143.82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.115.143.82_0a38.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.115.143.82">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>"STRONG DELETE"</b> I have practiced chiropractic for 30 years. Based on my clinical experience with thousands of patients and based on similar experiences of well over a hunded colleagues of whom I have personal knowledge, I find Mr. Botnik's bitter remarks to not be credible. For whatever personal reasons, he failed in an attempt at practice and is conducting a bitter anti-chiropractic campaign in retaliation. I have never met Mr. Botnik nor have I personally corresponded with him, but based on his comments that I have read, he appears to be a bitter and immature person.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.57.51.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.57.51.102_8c2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.57.51.102">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<p>The content of this website should play no part in this decision (i.e. it might be totally unreliable for all I know, but if extensively used and influential then it would still merit an article), WP should not engage in censorship. The only significant issues are whether the website is sufficiently notable for inclusion and that the content of the article is a NPOV balanced, verifiable account. The latter is I think now true. The former however is not clearly established; I would suggest that Abotnick consider merging the content with articles on related or similar websites (e.g. Quackwatch) and use redirection to direct searches to the composite article. <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 10:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greng, I think the vandals and poorly qualified editors in the wikipedia process have greatly diminished the quality of the article. Further merging it with other nonrelated sites is no longer specific to the Chirotalk term so that doesn't work. This isn't chirobase-neck911-chirotalk. We are a separate discussion site with a history and individuality that deserves to be listed but was removed due to critical chiroprctors who don't want individuals to know that censorship is common at private nonprofit chiropractic institutions and that they have an accreditor who routinely doesn't enforce its own standards. Most likely we will need to just mount a PR campaign and get a reference in another media source to meet the WP guideline for notoreity. This is sort of ironic because of the biased chiropractors who are screaming that I am using wiki for self promotion. Anyway, wikipedia just isn't worth the bother if their major editors can't see the value of the entry. The information is available elsewhere on the net. Further, despite chiropractic's false assertions of growth they are running scams and it is simply a matter of time before the public hits critical mass and rejects them en mass. Utilization is already down 25% in just four years. So their reframing this as ad hominem attacks on me is really just a reflection of their inability to overcome the handicap. Chiros you can't build a house on a foundation of sand. Your scams won't win. Truth and knowledge have power. Abotnick 11:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure that 'merging' in this way would be a bad solution. Disambiguation could redirect a search for chirotalk to a larger article on sceptical websites that includes, as a subsection on chirotalk, all the material that you presently have (and more). The case for inclusion on grounds of notability could then be decided by comparison with other websites rather than in isolation, as now.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 11:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do agree that the content of or the motivation for starting the web site should have nothing to do with whether it should be included as a wikipedia article. Does it have encyclopedic value.. possibly. The article can be cleaned up to be quite NPOV, though there is no guarantee it will stay that way. However, that means that every web site with similar qualities would deserve an article as well. Where to draw the line is apparently in notability. The line for this article would allow for other sites that are pro and anti everything, including medicine, politics, religion, vitamins, vaccination, phone systems, and most other web blog discussion groups. Is that what Wikipedia is? Is this what Wikipedia wants to be? I don't know. This is an important question that my level(two months of editing) is not qualified to answer.--<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 14:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Gleng-The merge/subsections idea sounds like it might work. Would it still be under the heading of Chirotalk or another one? A list of Skeptical Sites could include: Chirobase.org, Neck911USA.org, "The Quack Files" and Chirotalk. How about "Skeptical Websites about Chiropractic"? Chirobase alone has a large amount of notoriety. Since this is a big revision can we put a pause on the deletion of this Chirotalk entry? Any suggestions for revision?Abotnick 15:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Agreed. Regardless of the infighting between the pro- and anti-chiro forces, the only relevant question here is whether the site meets the standards at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Certainly Wikipedia has entries for many sites with controversial (some might even say bizarre or even crackpot) viewpoints.

<li><b>Comment</b> Agreed. I think Abotnick is giving up trying to get a link to/article about his website and himself here and is now trying to start a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic_Skepticism_e916.html" title="Chiropractic Skepticism">Chiropractic Skepticism</a> article. I am not sure if that will fly either. Might I suggest that if he wants his POV heard, then he should keep on editting the main <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> article. But if this is all about trying to get a link to his website, then he should be submitting it to search engine; not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 18:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
