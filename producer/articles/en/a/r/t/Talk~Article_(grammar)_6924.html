<dd>Finland is a Scandinavian country but Finnish is not a Scandinavian language, nor is Sami. Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, are. Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language.

<dd>Finnish, Saami, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian are all Scandinavian languages. Icelandic is not Scandinavian. <i>Scandinavian</i> is a <b>geographical</b> grouping; as linguistic affiliation, it is a subgroup of the Germanic language family. A better way of putting this would be: <i>The Scandinavian group of the Germanic languages</i>. This narrows the field down to Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (and by default, Icelandic, due to the nature of its descent from Norwegian). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefamouseccles_063a.html" title="User:Thefamouseccles">thefamouseccles</a> 00:53 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)

<dd>Linguistically, "scandinavian" refers to north germanic languages, such as swedish, danish and norwegian. Also, icelandic hasn't descended from norwegian. It has, like all north germanic languages, descended from old norse, but due to its isolation changed significantly less than the "low german"-affected north germanic languages in Scandinavia. (I am not completely sure about whether icelandic and faroese are scandinavian languages are not. I heard faroese should be more like continental scandinavian than what icelandic is.)

<dd>Oops, yes, you're right. Sorry about that. I was trying to draw attention to the fact that Finnish and Saami are not of the same family as Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish and Danish, and made a silly error myself.

<p>So what's the phrase for "the plane"? Et plan or ett plan? I see both "et" and "ett", so we better get rid of "ett" (I think). Anyone who knows Swedish wants to confirm this? <a href="../../../w/i/w/User%7EWiwaxia_c8bb.html" title="User:Wiwaxia">Wiwaxia</a> 20:44, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In Swedish, a suffix is used instead of a definite article, so "the plane" translates into "planet". "Ett plan" is also correct Swedish, but that means "a plane".</dd>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I see that this work is missing quite a lot information. The articles in English are very complicated. They have multiple functions in English and seem to have many exceptions (for instance, involving body parts).</p>
<p>Here is one point:</p>
<p><i>Nothing</i> is mentioned about <b>given/old information</b> vs. new <b>information</b>. This is an extremely important notion that essential in discussing the function articles in English. It is impossible not to consider this. In order to do this, you must also consider the notion of linguistic framing.</p>
<p>Here are some things that must be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>reference</li>
<li>generic</li>
<li>specific/non-specific</li>
<li>definiteness/indefiniteness (i.e. indentifiability)</li>
<li>given/new
<ul>
<li>information flow through discourse</li>
<li>frames</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>something that I am not sure what call &amp;mdash maybe <i>importance</i> (??? I dont know where to look for this...)</li>
<li>categories of noun (proper, mass, countable)</li>
<li><i>the</i> deletion (as in <i>on top of the car</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are dealing everything below:</p>
<ol>
<li>semantics</li>
<li>pragmatics</li>
<li>syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>Another consideration is historical grammaticalization (i.e. semantic "bleaching"). <i>A</i> originally meant 'one', and I believe that <i>the</i> used to be a demonstrative meaning something like 'this' or 'that'. This would be interesting to note.</p>
<p>If the authors are serious about describing English article, why not take a look at Quirk et al's big English grammar?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is just English. I have no idea about what other languages are doing with their so-called "articles"...</p>

<p>I think <i>Article (grammar)</i> is a better name for this page.

<p>Would someone explain what this chapter is trying to say? I'm not sure I understand it. AFAICT, it says that 1 correct (?) usage of articles is learned by native speakers at an early age 2 some people who write in English drop the articles 3 said people risk being labeled as bad speakers</p>
<p>Doesn't look very meaningful to me - expecially to the title, why is this called "Age of the speaker"?</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> removed a sentence about French <i>ce</i>. My impression is that in French <i>ce</i> and its various forms serve a function somewhat intermediate between a grammatical and a demonstrative. So many grammatical functions have been hung on <i>le/la/les</i> that <i>ce</i> has been weakened from a full demonstrative; that role goes now to <i>ceci</i>, <i>cel√†</i>, and similar constructions.

<p>Someone recently added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Northern England the definite article 'the' is often dropped, for example "I'm going down pub"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that really true? On the page <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_dialect_and_accent.html" title="Yorkshire dialect and accent">Yorkshire dialect and accent</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Shortening of <i>the</i> to a form without a vowel, often written <i>t`</i>, as in "I'm going down t` pub". Sometimes even the <i>t</i> is pronounced as a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glottal_stop.html" title="Glottal stop">glottal stop</a>. This process is referred to as <b>definite article reduction</b>. See <a href="http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/DARover.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/DARover.htm" rel="nofollow">this overview</a> and <a href="http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/DARmorvar.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/DARmorvar.htm" rel="nofollow">a more detailed page</a> on the Yorkshire Dialect website, and also Jones (2002).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is of course well known. But dropping the "the" <i>completely</i> is something I find considerably less convincing. But then I'm from Southern England, so I would be grateful if someone from Northern England could please comment, and correct it if wrong. And if you would in fact say "down pub", is that phrase just a specific idiom or would you drop the "the" more generally? Thanks.</p>

<dd>This needs to be clarified on this page, too; the article currently says that several northern accents the article is lost altogether. As a native speaker of North Yorkshire English&#160;:-) I've never heard this, though the /t/ is often realised as a glottal stop. I think, however, that it <i>may</i> be lost altogether in certain fixed expressions like 'down pub' for some speakers, though I have no evidence for this. <a href="../../../j/s/t/User%7EJsteph_b781.html" title="User:Jsteph">Jsteph</a> 03:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think people confuse the reduction of the article to a glottal stop with the complete omission of the article completely. Probably because in English a glottal stop is not a proper letter, and the average person would probably not know what one is. In general conversation, if someone commented on the fact that Northerners omitted "the", I would not say they were wrong as, like I said, a glottal stop does not constitute a word in English. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatic_Sleepstorm_9a41.html" title="User:Static Sleepstorm">Static Sleepstorm</a> 20:04, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I was bold and removed the Usage section. Basically, Wikipedia is not a usage guide. It also seemed very unclear that this was really going to help anyone. To me: <i>"the" can be thought of as similar to a little computer cursor</i> is very confusing and I am a native speaker! Also this section is totally specific to English, not the grammatical article in general. To cap it off, it sounded a bit like this was copied from a textbook so there might be copywrite issues {just a suspicion}.</p>

<p>The word <i>said</i> is commonly used in legal documents in place of <i>the</i>, such as "said property" instead of "the property." The difference is that it is equivalent to "the aforementioned," while <i>the</i> can also be used for a unique thing not mentioned before.

<dl>
<dd>It's not that it is used in place of "the" but simply often without it. Past participal used as an adjective; by itself in the sense of "aforementioned". Googling "the said *" shows that usage with the definite article is still very much alive, so it's probably a bit early yet to be classifying it as one itself. The omission of the article is interesting, though. Nice catch. --<a href="../../../r/j/c/User%7ERJCraig_4e19.html" title="User:RJCraig">RJCraig</a> 08:16, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say a kind of demonstrative determiner. It has a little bit too much semantic content to be a definite article (which means that it does not have the range of uses typical of a definite article, for example generic or first mention: "the land of said free and the home of said brave; Said Earth revolves around said Sun.")
