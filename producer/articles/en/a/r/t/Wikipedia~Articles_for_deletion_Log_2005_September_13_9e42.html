<li><b>Weak delete</b>. As you say, tiny and non-notable and will probably go the way of most such groups in the next couple of years. I'm therefore almost inclined to simply wait until it goes away and delete the articles then. In any event, it clearly doesn't deserve the prominent mention it had in articles like <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Liturgy_b5ff.html" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> where the editor tried to put it on par with churches like Eastern Orthodoxy.

<li>Oh, I think you're on shaky ground there. There are lots of ways to verify a house. If Cmadler's real world name happens to be what you'd think, and if he or she cares to disclose the city in which they live—for a slightly rarer name the state would be enough—and if it's in the U.S.,you could use an online white pages like <a href="http://www.anywho.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anywho.com" rel="nofollow">anywho</a> or <a href="http://www.switchboard.com" class="external text" title="http://www.switchboard.com" rel="nofollow">switchboard</a> to find their street address. Depending on exactly where they live there's a good chance you could get enough of an image through Terraserver or other online aerial photography sources to verify the existence of the house. In certain downtown areas of major cities, www.a9.com has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0005YAE8E/amzna9-4-20/ref=yp_a9_3/002-8401604-3094447" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0005YAE8E/amzna9-4-20/ref=yp_a9_3/002-8401604-3094447" rel="nofollow">streetlevel imagery</a> of entire streets, Pinckney Street in this case, and you can "walk" up and down and see some of the nice private residences on Pinckney Street. Are they all worthy of individual articles? You could use one of the online real estate databases to find out whether that house had been bought or sold in the last twenty years or so, and for how much. And that's just for starters. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A sign of things to come, I think. Even primary schools are regularly surviving the AfD process, which will likely cause a moderate increase in the nominations of primary schools in response as attempts to peel off a few articles through attrition against the most vulernable. Obviously, poorly written articles about primary schools are the most vulernable of all, because some votes will be cast against the school before it can be re-written and cleaned up - some of those voters will never come back to change votes, even if they might otherwise have voted to <b>keep</b> in the first place. Nonetheless, YTD school articles AfD statistics: 277 nominated, 228 kept, 37 deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:07, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Take this, and all the other substub articles created via links from the education section of the <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairns%2C_Queensland_be34.html" title="Cairns, Queensland">Cairns, Queensland</a> and merge them into one article on education in the area. Which might actually be useful for something other than a child saying "oh look, our school has an article" and obsessives counting the number of stubs they can create. I am assuming here that we're actually trying to create a useful encyclopedia here rather than tiny, pathetic, feeble stubs about everything in the off-chance that something might happen to enable us to write a decent article. I mean, what do we have on this - it's a school, it's in Cairns, it has a headteacher. You could put the useful info on these schools in a table - name, age range, size. Which might actually be useful for people wanting to look up education in Cairns. But I suppose that takes more effort than just creating a bunch of sub-stubs which take far, far longer to look at than information on one page, and in all probability won't get maintained. After all, the time of people reading Wikipedia is NOT valueless. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:05, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The current article is not a sub-stub and is more useful for anyone who needs to know about the school itself than a merged page would be, so in fact it is saving them time. Note that it was created by an anon from a red link, so presumably it was a helpful outsider rather than an obsessive wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The claim that this is a sub-stub is currently false. Google counting seems to me like a somewhat bizarre method to determine the encyclopedic nature of a school.

<ul>
<li>I would still classify it as a substub. There is no more information that is of relevance that has been added since the VFD was tagged. However I will note that the only development on this article (however miniscule and irrelevant) has come as a result OF the VfD.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 01:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We only delete articles that are <i>incapable</i> of improvement. An article that shows visible improvement during a deletion discussion, well... You also claim that there is "no more information of relevance that has been added" since you listed it for deletion. This is blatantly false. Since being listed, the article has acquired a reference, the date it was founded, the coalition of which it is a member, and the name of the headmistress. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The addition of information to an article, caused because of an AfD listing, is obviously not a criteria for deletion. The argument being constructed here is: "the only development on this article has come as a result OF the AfD - therefore the article should be deleted". This inherently fellacious argument does not even merit a response.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:57, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Of course it is. All articles on Wikipedia have to have some notability attached to them. Schools are no exception. But that was not the basis of this AfD, but rather the fact this article can never grow into anything but a glorified stub as there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:59, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is false. As per Wikipedia <b>Policy</b> at <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, Lack of Notability is not a listed criteria for deletion, nor is being obscure, nor is being "unimportant". It is misleading to make the claim that "All articles on Wikipedia have to have some notability attached to them. Schools are no exception" in large measure because you are simply applying your own standard of "notability" to an article you feel should be deleted. In any event, my response was not made on the basis of your nomination, but rather to several votes on this page, including the one to which I responded directly prior to your reply. Further, the article has already "grown" beyond what it was when nominated. Assertions that it will only be a "glorified stub", and "there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature" are not objective facts - only subjective statements. Please prove your assertion that "there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature" with something a little more convincing than a "Google search".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:17, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper_and_Friends_b051.html" title="Casper and Friends">Casper and Friends</a></i> is an anthology show made up of reruns of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Studios_02bb.html" title="Famous Studios">Famous Studios</a> cartoons produced to run in front of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> films from the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> to the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. As such, that makes this list dubios on two accounts: (a) the actual broadcast order of the individual cartoons broadcast over the half hour has varied significantly since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, making this list inherently innaccurate (and also fueling the erroneous notion that these cartoons were made for television; in addition, there's no source provided and I can't seem to find one myself) and (b) <i>Casper and Friends</i> does not account for all of the Famous Studios <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost_1d32.html" title="Casper the Friendly Ghost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Audrey_2f5b.html" title="Little Audrey">Little Audrey</a>, etc. cartoons. I'd suggest a simple deletion; there's nothing to merge or redirect. I would also suggest the eventual addition of filmographies for the pages on the original Famous/Paramount cartoon series. <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 07:20, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Notable TV series that was responsible for introducing many viewers to these cartoons. I believe the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show has an article (though I cannot locate the proper title format) which sets the precedent. Perhaps merge the episode list with the main article if it doesn't make it too long. The dates given are dubious, however, as I remember seeing Casper and Friends in the 1970s. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:15, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This isn't a nomination for the deletion of the article on <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper_and_Friends_b051.html" title="Casper and Friends">Casper and Friends</a></i>; this is just for the episode list. Certainly there should be (and is) a <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper_and_Friends_b051.html" title="Casper and Friends">Casper and Friends</a></i> article, but this is not it. The article on the <i>Bugs Bunny/RoadRunner Show</i> and all of the other broadcast Looney Tunes anthology series is at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bugs_Bunny_Show_e149.html" title="The Bugs Bunny Show">The Bugs Bunny Show</a></i>. Now, the original 1960 - 1962 version of that show has a verifiable episode list as far as which cartoons were shown on what date, because new wraparounds were created to integrate them. However, there is no way to accurately track what <i><a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_dcd6.html" title="Looney Tunes">Looney Tunes</a></i> and <i>Merie Melodies</i> have aired on the spin-off <i>Bugs Bunny Shows</i> unless someone logged each broadcast. There should not be an episode list for those future versions (in its stead, we do have a proper <a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_and_Merrie_Melodies_filmography_fc42.html" title="Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography">Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography</a> here). As far as any dates given being dubios (in what way?), <i>Casper and Friends</i> first aired as <i>The Harveytoons Show</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, and has been on the air, in one form or another, since then. However, the cartoons included on the show were made by Famous Studios and Paramount Pictures between <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> for movie theatres. My point is that this list in and of itself is incorrect, unless it properly notate what version of <i>Casper and Friends</i>, and from what time period, it derives its information from. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 18:04, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: FuriousFreddy's nomination is good, but it requires some reading. This is an <i>anthology show,</i> and not original content. In the 1970s and late, late 1960s, there were multiple repackaging shows like this, and so an <i>episode list</i> is largely vaccuous. I.e. there were no episodes, because it was an anthology. An "episode list" of the actual cartoons would be another matter, but, since the original cartoons were not created for television, it would be impossible. In other words, the "episode list" is actively <i>misinformation.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:42, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry to have to correct you... If you do a search on Google for the words "sahara knite" the figure of "293" is for listings containing these two words, and not the number of hits or searches. If you go through the full list you will see many might be for "sahara" as the desert and not for "sahara+knite". There are also listings for "knite" without "sahara". Also, being listed on Google by name means nothing. Being listed high on any search engine is a success when you can use unrelated terms, ignoring a persons name, and they appear. A particular search without using her name on MSN has her listed at #1 and this is a search by the nature of her work, which I won't give details, but I can assure you is the most popular search term used everywhere on the net.</p>

<li>One problem is that no-one apart from its own author has published anything on the subject of this product. Whereas for the likes of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apache_HTTP_Server_5759.html" title="Apache HTTP Server">Apache</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Information_Services_fb37.html" title="Internet Information Services">IIS</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/t/Thttpd.html" title="Thttpd">thttpd</a> there is a whole cottage industry of third party books, web sites, training courses, how-to guides, and so forth. I've written an HTTP server, which I give away at no charge. Just like the subject of this article, it has nothing written about it that doesn't have me as the source. That I have no commercial interest in it having an encyclopaedia article does not eliminate all problems for an encyclopaedia article about it.
<p>"<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a>" does not equate to "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeware.html" title="Freeware">no commercial interest</a>", by the way.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: The product is not significant. It has a place in a <i>list of products,</i> just as some guitarist deserves a mention in his band's article. Does it need a separate article? Only if it's particularly notable in some way (first, best, most-used, etc.). What tipped to delete for me was the "Download it" link. Wikipedia is not Freshmeat.org, and the article above that "download now" link looked like download.com's product description rather than an article.

<dd>Please explain why you would have this merged (all of you). There is no notable information on this page that isn't on the GTA3 page already, except for, as I listed above, a primary source of a copywrite (a no-no). The tone proves that this is unencyclopedic, and all information can safely just be added to the GTA3 (soundtrack) page. Please state a furthur reason for your "merge" vote, or I will assume you have not read both, or are not familiar with the subject matter.

<dd>OK, I will give a detailed description of what I think sould be done and why.
<ol>
<li>Add missing info from this article to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_III_soundtrack_ba6e.html" title="Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack">Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack</a>, notably actually provide a link to the website itself.</li>
<li>Slightly expand the commercials section of Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack to give a better description of all the commercials, not just this one.</li>
<li>Delete this article to remove the copyvio.</li>
<li>Create a redirect page from here to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_III_soundtrack_ba6e.html#Commercials" title="Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack">Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack#Commercials</a> so that people can still find the info.</li>

<dd>Thank you for clarifying. I believe there was a link on the GTA3 soundtrack page before this page was added, but I'm not sure. In any event, I shall re-add it. I agree with your commercials stance, and in whatever little free time I can, I shall review the commercials and add info about them. I believe the article should be deleted instead of redirected, simply because I doubt many people would search for or link to this article, but "redirects are a cheap and easy way to inflate your edit count" or something like that, so if the consensis is merge/redirect, I shall do the honors (unless Splash would like to do them).

<li>Delete: Too fine a detail by far.

Not that Rifkin is necessarily... well... can you say "point of view?" Beef has had symbolic importance and has been associated with virility, as well as wealth and high social status, in many cultures, including ours. But this isn't a good start on such an article.

<li>I think I can address that one, with the caveat that I'm mostly responsible for current version of the EOI article. When the latest AfD came down I went back over the history. The first AfD resulted in a delete, and the second one, which came soon after the first, was inconclusive. There were some concerns on VfU that this article was undeleted without going through the proper channels. Some even wanted a speedy deletion because of that, but it wasn't undeleted, but recreated. The previous versions of the article were either stubs or scrapes of the EOI Web site, and IMHO deserved the kibosh. The current incarnation is based on something I wrote from scratch, with the history from the deleted versions restored. I think the idea was to decide the status of this article once and for all. Obviously, I believe it's worthy of inclusion, but I do agree it was worth bringing to the table one more time. -<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Adashiel</a> 17:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that people, as I said above, "give the faintest damn" about something does not in of itself make that something encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly, the comments of some other people, with things like "there are articles with less notability than this that are not on VfD, so keep" are ridiculous. Maybe those artciles should be. Maybe you people should go and find them, and VfD nominate them. But the status of "other aticles" does not in any way influence what happens to this article. We have a clear Deletion policy, which is the sole determinant of whether or not to delete this article. The fact is that this article fails the "ten year test". In ten year's time, people will not remember, care about or even want to know about a 30 minute power outage in LA. As such, Wikipedia is not the place for stuff like LA Power Outage 2005. Thanks to whoever created this article for their enterprise and effort; unluckily this is not the place for it. And remember, if it becomes a big issue (eg someone famous died because their life support got turned off or whatever), we can always recreate the article. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 15:15, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No vote yet. I sorta like it. The question in my mind is whether this was a <i>notable</i> fiasco. Was it mentioned in the national press? In _Billboard_ or _Rolling Stone_ or publications that chronicle rock concerts? That is certainly one notable bunch of musicians. Do biographies about them mention the failed concert? The article is so badly written I can't actually tell whether the event took place or not. "Rock Doctor William Abruzzi ... was there to treat bad LSD trips, and said there were more bad trips at Powder Ridge per capata, than any other music festival he'd ever worked." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:00, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Mark for cleanup of course. See this interesting article in <a href="http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/gbase/Music/content?oid=oid:123421" class="external text" title="http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/gbase/Music/content?oid=oid:123421" rel="nofollow">The Hartford Advocate</a>. These two paragraphs in the article convince me the event was notable:</li>

<dd>"Powder Ridge was a disaster waiting to happen, and it happened," Middletown author William Manchester wrote in his 1974 book The Glory and the Dream .</dd>
<dd>"A cloud of marijuana hung over the central portion of the resort last night, and drug dealers sold their wares openly. Some moved through the crowd crying, 'Acid, mescaline, acid, mescaline,'" the New York Times reported.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, it was mentioned in a Manchester's quite notable book (subtitled "A Narrative History of America, 1932-1972" and <i>still in print,</i>) and it was mentioned in <i>The New York Times.</i> A tip of the hat to <a href="../../../j/v/a/User%7EJvaGoddess_6474.html" title="User:JvaGoddess">JvaGoddess</a> for starting the article and roughing it in. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P. S. Since writing this, I've dug up a copy of Manchester's book. It isn't just a brief mention in passing, he spends nearly two pages on it. He considers it important in relation to the whole rise and fall of the hippie-rock-concert phenomenon. Mentions that despite the court injunction the promoters kept hinting that the festival might take place anyway, and people believed it <i>because basically that is what had happened with Woodstock,</i> which had been banned from its planned location and moved elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:15, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was able to find a reference to this in the August 10, 1970 issue of <i>Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly</i> (Vol. 50, Iss. 32; p. 3). The article in which the reference appears, "Rated "X"; The Movie Business These Days Is Not for Widows and Orphans," is about the poor financial showing of a documentary about Woodstock, but the article itself begins by saying, "When last month's Powder Ridge Rock Festival failed, so to speak, to come off, no one had more of a bummer than an enterprising company of independent moviemakers from Hollywood . . . But the big-time, big-name music--raison d'etre of any rock fest--was missing, offically turned off at the last minute by Middlefield's city fathers." According to an article in the June 30, 1985 issue of the Chicago Tribune about the Live Aid concert, 30,000 fans showed up at Powder Ridge in 1970 even though it was cancelled. That people were talking about it in the news media 15 years later is evidence of notability. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:00, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. Why did you propose the article for deletion? This was already proposed two weeks ago, all the arguments - including yours - were made, and it was voted to <b>keep</b>. You should have read the discussion BEFORE starting all this again. About "privacy" - all the contents of the definition are based on public information, among them the writings of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> herself (click on the links inside the definition). No previously private information has been made public. The a.r.s. post you mention is by Garry Scarff, who has posted a similar text for years, even before the wikipedia definition, so deleting the definition won't stop him.<br />
<br />
Barbara Schwarz is a public figure - she is well known in the FOIA scene. Just search Barbara Schwarz FOIA in google. You're an attorney, so maybe read also this court decision. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><br />

Finally, I doubt that Barbara Schwarz accepts being called "mentally ill" by you. By saying so, you've also made a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a> against her.

<p><i>Unfortunately, neither Dave Touretzky nor his bullies of friends have a legal education</i> He is lying by claiming that I am a part of a libel campaign. I never said anything about him or others that I can't prove. He and his friends are persecuting Scientology. I got a porn letter as harassment that could have been just mailed by Dave Touretzky himself, and he and his friends remove any website from the net that is critical of him and show the facts of the harassment. Fine "free speech activitist" he is. He also can't see that bomb instuctions on the net available to any lunatic is not a sane idea. He keeps his up.</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Schwarz is a public figure. There's an article in the Salt Lake Tribune about her. There's thousands of web documents discussing her. She broadcasts her opinion numerous times each day using her own name. There are numerous public court cases about her. This makes her a public figure worthy of inclusion. Just because some ass uses a Wikipedia article to torment her (if that is your argument), doesn't make it right that it should be removed. Our job is to determine if the article is worth keeping and to make it as NPOV as possible. Once we do that, its beyond our control how it is used by others. Many biographies here are less than flattering, see <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Slatkin_2f72.html" title="Reed Slatkin">Reed Slatkin</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Miscavige_578d.html" title="David Miscavige">David Miscavige</a>.

<p>I have been watching (reading) the continuing saga of Barbara on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.religion.scientology.html" title="Alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a>. She often claims that her prolific posting there is to counter "lies" posted by others, but, in reality, she mostly does a cut-and-paste job reposting the same tripe (and personal attacks) over and over, and never commenting upon the "lies" as she claims. She also claims that she has to keep posting there as when she does not, the lies about here get out of control. I have noticed that, in reality, the exact opposite is true. If she does not post for more than two or three days, almost all mention of her disappears (with a few exceptions from specific people.)</p>
<p>In any case, Barbara has made herself a public figure by her actions. A FOIA Officer I knew had told me that Barbara was a lunch room topic a number of times when they would have lunch with fellow FOIA Officers. In addition to being cited in the official goverment FOIA Guide, Barbara is mentioned at FindLaw.com, the Department of Justice web site, and web sites of many other government agency. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super7</a></p>

Ms. Schwarz has a right for a fair portayal and not an article written by people who hate her religion and therefore hate her as Mr. Barwell. I am sorry, Wikipedia, but the people who defame Ms. Schwarz on Usenet are the same who defame her here. Mr. Barwell is one of them.

<p>I'm a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, but I really don't think Blue Hell is noteworthy enough; The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's "Beta Quest" would probably be far more noteworthy, but even that doesn't have an article yet. GarrettTalk 04:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> the term "blue hell" has been around for years, and is not just restriced to the GTA series. In some 3D games the game camera can sometimes go through a floor or an exterior wall and reveal a colored void (of the default background color, usually blue). If the player is to travel through the floor or wall (primarily as a result of a glitch), the character can fall into the "blue hell" which either ends up with the player character's death or the game crashes. <a href="../../../k/j/a/User%7EKjammer_2df2.html" title="User:Kjammer"></a> — <a href="../../../k/j/a/User%7EKjammer_2df2.html" title="User:Kjammer">Kjammer</a> <a href="../../../k/j/a/User_talk%7EKjammer_da7b.html" title="User talk:Kjammer"><font size="4">⌂</font></a> 21:45, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Your wrong to argue that it breaks copyright, It is my interlectual property. The topic does require a page of its own, not just a mention on another. I am posting it as a discussion document, and if anyone wants to do a major edit on it, thats fair enough. It is not that extreme a point of view compared to the Bilston Glen website. Yes it does need some work to make it more encyclopedic in style. Most of the photos are also my interlectual property.</li>

<li>Hello, I am very new to Wikipedia as a contributor, but certainly not new as a user or researcher of how the Wikipedia solution works. Regarding the comments above, my comment is they are both very short. My first question is - have you thoroughly read the article? If so - please provide your specific comments about how the article violates a policy? What research told you the first statement above is correct? I would point out that Rizo on his page references a "why I'm a deletionist" page. This contains the very insighful observation that "<b>New users need to first believe that their efforts are worthwhile and then that they will not find themselves instantly ridiculed for working on an article</b>." <b>Deletion - before a group even gets started on making an article decent - seems very quick on the draw</b> (again reference Why Deletionist for his correct observation as to what happened with Usegroups - certainly not meritocracy - but those who were most energized dominated). I will also point out - the activities referenced in this article relate to key failings in internet architecture and something that is now happening in both the United States and Sweden. To get a benchmark on this delete recommendation, I have just spent some time checking Swedish companies in Wikipedia to understand why this article needs deleting relative to them. There are certainly many more articles in Wikipedia on very small as well as large Swedish companies. See for example Eniro AB. Eniro has been there as a fragment - I think - for months. Why keep Eniro? Or look at what is probably the largest known Swedish company - L.M. Ericsson. I have watched this article for months. I will admit, it is actually getting better, but it remains loaded with inaccuracies. Why not delete Ericsson when it is not only poorly written, but actually inaccurate? <b>What harm is done by allowing an article sufficient time to evolve?</b> Is 18 hours sufficient time? John Andrews....</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable, regardless of "sufficient time [for article] to evolve" since I don't think a case can be made for inclusion of a company which is not yet even in operation, except in extraordinary cases. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 07:36, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello, I am the main contributor on this article. I made this posting yesterday. Hello,</p>
<p>I am one of the people working with the introduction of this new company. In regard to candidates for deletion notice we have read the wikipedia quidelines and tried to work within that framework.</p>
<p>In particular we had already noted the reference "Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs."</p>
<p>This is not a garage company. The (open access) web-site will release in the near future. The article is being written in anticipation of that release. You may have read about Skype recently. The ambitions are in that category. If the article is not sufficiently neutral - please inform?</p>
<p>As we have understood, the guidance on Wikipedia is to lean away from deletion unless a clear violation has occured?</p>

<p>This page is simply a list of classical Greek placenames, with demotic and English translations. I see no encyclopedic content here. The names are from all over the world (and since they include <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>, I suspect copyvio from a Greek-English dictionary or gazeteer).

<li><i>If it has something wrong, correct it.</i> — It does indeed have something wrong. It's a Greek-English translating dictionary of placenames, complete with IPA pronunciations, in Wikipedia, contrary to our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy.

It's intended to be Wikipedia's lexical companion. There's no need to be a Lost Lexicographer wandering the encyclopaedia in lonely fashion, when one can collaborate with a whole load of other lexicographers at the dictionary. The dictionary has a group of editors doing far more than this mis-placed-dictionary-in-the-encyclopaedia can, with editors collaborating on giving individual words translations, pronunciations in at least three systems, declension tables, etymologies, and even audio files with example pronunciations. It even already has a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Greek_proper_nouns" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Greek_proper_nouns">category for Greek proper nouns</a>, with a sub-category for placenames, that can be filled to one's heart's content.

Yet, this is not the case here, and as far as I know we don't have a list deletion policy or a category deletion policy (if I'm wrong please let me know). Besides this is not a list with translations. It is a list that shows the present or the historical names of various places (with wiki-link, aka the articles for these places are present here on WP, and are named this way), and all these places have something in common. The place name derives from a greek word. This list is like a category, with a small comment for every article.

And, as is noted, this isn't a Greek-to-English dictionary, nor is it the geography of Greece or of Turkey—it's a linguistics article about listing traditional names, and includes modern Greek forms if the tradition still lasts. Look at the locations of these places—they're all over the place, but still figured prominently in the Classical Greek world, the Hellenistic world, the Roman world (where Greek was considered the language of the educated elite), the Byzantine world, the Ottoman world, and the modern world as well.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is a list, not an encyclopedia entry. Names of places which have Greek etymology should already have this information in the article itself (in fact, I have added it myself in many places),but I <i>especially</i> object to the link from individual articles to this list. I do find it interesting to have a list of all the names of Greek etymology, though: perhaps this should be a category, "Names with Greek Etymology". The word "traditional" is also inappropriate. As for names with non-Greek etymologies but which are used in Greek, that seems like straight dictionary material. What is Βρετανία (Britain) doing here, for example? Aristotle uses the word, so it belongs in a Greek dictionary, but not in an English encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:49, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: The point is that Βρετανία is a distinct form in the Greek language, and not simply an adaptation to nor from a Latin form. It has significance to linguistic studies, and there are many other such linguistics list articles around Wikipedia with clear encyclopedic value. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but <i>this</i> is not a dictionary either. If it <i>were</i> a dictionary, it would more resemble a gazetteer of every Greek name for modern places, and yet it doesn't. Notice that many of these places are long since in ruins, and are part of history. Yes, it is nice to put this information in each article, but it is also extremely helpful to a topical study to put these in one place, and placing a <i>category</i> in each relevant article raises its own issues for many an impatient editor who might think "This isn't a Greek place. It isn't in Greece. This category doesn't belong here," or those who are wary of having too many different topical categories stacked into one article, particularly when they don't see the relative significance of adding so much detail of a place's history for what may effectively be a dead culture for a place where it may not seem like a relevant topic to the region's modern inhabitants. This is a <i>linguistics</i> article, and many of the things that make it important and useful as a linguistics article also make it an extraordinarily dry topic. It may be college-level material and not well-suited to <i>most</i> Wikipedia users who just want to find a fact or an encyclopedic snippet, but that doesn't mean such rich topical academic detail doesn't belong here. Wikipedia has many lexicon-style list articles that have long since survived vfd challenges, for the reason that a list makes the material easier to browse. Another bad reason for categories in this case is that it complicates the effort it takes to make a detailed topical study like this. The subject material is somewhere <i>between</i> lexicon and encyclopedia, and should not be ripped from one domain just because it resembles the domain of the other. See how <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_name.html" title="Hawaiian name">Hawaiian name</a> especially survived a vfd challenge, and see how <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traditional_Arabic_place_names_7cd1.html" title="List of traditional Arabic place names">List of traditional Arabic place names</a>, List of Hebrew names, List of Arabic names, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indo-European_roots_5e14.html" title="List of Indo-European roots">List of Indo-European roots</a>, etc. thrive in Wikipedia's environment. To rid of any of them is inappropriate. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 07:23, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> As I said before, I do find much of the content useful. I also find the various dictionaries on my bookshelves useful.... And it's not so awful that this article appear in the Wikipedia -- my vote is really a weak Delete, because you can always ignore the article if you don't find it useful. What I do object to <i>strenuously</i> is the introduction of the link "List of traditional Greek place names" all over the place. <i>That</i>, you can't ignore. And the word "traditional" is being misused here; perhaps what is wanted is "historical"? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:18, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>—This is not a dictionary-anything. This has nothing to do with a dictionary, and is of great encyclopedic and reference value. It definately DOES NOT belong on Wiktionary, or any other dictionary, unless they specifically desire to include tables. What do you mean "massively uses non-compliant special characters"? When people are naming articles with Unicode characters, there are bigger fish to fry! My browser can display Unicode characters properly long before it and the server can do all the mangling associated with URLs. HTML named or number entities could easily double the size (bytes) of this article. It uses the necessary templates, too!

Non-notability of this school has not been established in any event (even if this were a valid criteria).

<li>Re: non-notability, regardless of whether the subject is notable or not, the article should attempt to establish notability, which this does not (unless one considers all schools inherently notable, which is obviously not agreed upon). This might be considered a vanity article, and would be deletable on those grounds (this is obviously my preference). Or one could say it is "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" in which case we could "merge the useful content into a more comprehensive article and redirect." If we were to merge and redirect into <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimbulah.html" title="Dimbulah">Dimbulah</a>, consider how little content there is to merge. (Average Earthman noted that there is more info on the school in the Dimbulah article than there is in this stub.) <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 12:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for re-phrasing the entire debate about school articles. I disagree that an article should attempt to establish notability - this is not WP Policy - only your own assertion. Given the high number of schools (even primary schools) that survive the AfD process, it is clear that schools may be many things - however "vanity article" is not one of them. The entire ongoing debate exists because there is a disagreement over the premise that <b>schools are inherently notable</b>, in the first place. Simply restating that you do not think schools merit articles by virtue of being schools, is no more productive than my repeating that "schools are inherently notable" on each and every AfD. The point I was making the above response, was simply that "non-notability" is not a valid criteria for deletion as per WP Policy.

<li>One could just as easily say "Delete, and stop creating school articles until consensus is reached."

<p>An article started by the author of a self-published book to promote the book and his alternative science ideas. The book has been reviewed by the Yorkshire Post, but has apparently attracted little or no scientific interest. A few skeptic sites debunk it.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I really think the above suggestion (by 66.69.219.9) that "expansion theory" should be treated in Wikipedia on a par with quantum mechanics is preposterous. Granted, one can always find people who think those two bodies of thought are on the same level, but it would make a mockery of Wikipedia to treat them as if they are comparable. Also, I think when 66.69.219.9 says the article should be "kept and allowed to evolve over time", and talks about "maintaining a dialogue" about a list of unanswered questions, he is really advocating what the Wikipedia founder euphemistically termed "original research". Wikipedia is not intended to be a forum for lunatic fringe crackpots like Mark McCutcheon to engage in "dialogues" about their crackpot beliefs. I'm afraid if the article is kept, this is what it will become (at best), to the detriment of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, I agree with those who've said that the general subject (expansion as the cause of gravity) could make a useful article, because it's a very old and well-known (albeit silly) idea, and there are interesting and factual things that could be said about it. Unfortunately there are no reputable references for these statements (as far as I know), so it would just have to be written by some non-crackpots... but then we immediately get into the business of deciding who is and who is not a crackpot. This is why the Wikipedia founder (wisely, in my opinion) said that the only feasible way of protecting against physics crackpots is to insist that material not be allowed in Wikipedia until/unless it has been published in a reputable source. If there's any other answer to the problem of crackpots, I'd like to hear what it is. 63.24.49.67 23:50, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The former version was a promotion of crackpottery. The new one effectively states that the theory's has no notability or significance. Either way, <b>delete</b>. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 06:12, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No harm having an article on the general subject and deleting articles that are problematic is not a good way to resolve the problems they pose. As far as "crackpot theories" go, I think we should cover them all, no matter how narrowly supported they are. They can be presented in a neutral way and verified and that is all we should require in my view. There's a proscientist bias in Wikipedia that doesn't really do it any credit. This is a book about the whole world and every way of looking at it, not just an encyclopaedia of science as endorsed by the establishment. This might not be science -- actually, I'd agree it certainly isn't -- but where does it say that only real science can be included? I urge the delete voters to put aside their scientific selves, don a more human outlook and reconsider on the grounds that if the article says "no one thinks this is science", no harm is done by including it as a curiosity. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:06, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think people voicing their opinions here might find the following statement of Wikipedia policy useful. This is from the Wikipedia policy page on "No Original Research":</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Origin of this policy - Wikipedia's founder, Jimbo Wales, has described original research as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "original research" originated primarily as a practical means to deal with physics cranks, of which of course there are a number on the Web. The basic concept is as follows: It can be quite difficult for us to make any valid judgment as to whether a particular thing is true or not. It isn't appropriate for us to try to determine whether someone's novel theory of physics is valid; we aren't really equipped to do that. But what we can do is check whether or not it actually has been published in reputable journals or by reputable publishers. So it's quite convenient to avoid judging the credibility of things by simply sticking to things that have been judged credible by people much better equipped to decide." (WikiEN-l, December 3, 2004).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...if you're unable to find anyone to publish it, or if you can only secure publication in a news outlet that does not have a good reputation, <b>then the material has no place in Wikipedia</b>, EVEN IF YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. [my emphasis]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What counts as a reputable publication? Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>End quotes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So there really isn't any question (is there?) that this article is not suitable content for Wikipedia according to Wikipedia's own stated policies. Of course, if people want to change the policies, that's fine, but I frankly think the existing policy is the only one that will protect Wikipedia from being over-run with crackpots. Just take a quick look at the edit history of this article for the past month. Then multiply that by a thousand, when crackpots discover that Wikipedia has opened its doors and repudiated what Grace Note calls its pro-scientist bias. Yes, it's true, Wikipedia is biased toward science that has been published in reputable sources... this is an explicit part of its policies. Grace Note says this policy does Wikipedia no credit. I disagree. I think it does Wikipedia great credit, and should be preserved. There's already a web site called Crank.net, that includes more crackpot theories than anyone could possibly want. No need to duplicate that here in Wikipedia, and certainly no need to conflate such nonsense with articles on real science. But that's just my opinion. I guess it all comes down to - what do people want Wikipedia to be? And are we guided by its existing policies, or are we making up new policies? 63.24.123.49 05:40, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>delete</i> the current version adequately makes the only point that matters: scientifically, this stuff is utter bosh. However, from the history page it seems clear that if the article is kept, vandalism will continue indefinitely. Someone said that crank theories can make <i>interesting</i> articles, if not exactly <i>edifying</i> ones&#160;:-/ They can, but it is probably best to wait until the author has passed on, so that we don't see the kind of edit war we see in the history of this page.

My personal preference would be to refer to controversies surrounding the film in the main article about it, ideally taking an NPOV and linking to the various protagonists' sites appropriately.

<p>Merge in with Fahrenheit 9/11 entry. The regular Fahrenheit 9/11 entry just makes it appear as this was a highly-acclaimed 100% factual documentary and it doesn't really seem to mention how many of Moore's points in the movie are presented dubiously from less than credible sources with little to no context.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. "Cock block" is not a slang term in the sense that it is a colloquialism that replaces a formal term, i.e. "rock" for "basketball", or "grom" for "young surfer". I would argue that "cock block" is the only concise term in English for a situation where one's friend is trying to flirt with a girl and is interfered with by another friend. It is definitely a phrase that is in wide use in the United States, and is perhaps the best term to describe a common social situation. So now the questions in my mind are:
<ol>
<li>Can references be cited for "cock-blocking"?</li>
<li>Is the subject itself encyclopedic?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Some editors contend that an encyclopaedia article that is merely <i>short</i> is a dictionary article. This is false. For one thing, dictionary articles are long. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogitare" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:cogitare">cogitare</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/line" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:line">line</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/key" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:key">key</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/can" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:can">can</a>, for examples.) Short encyclopaedia articles are <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stubs</a>, <i>not</i> dictionary articles.
<p>The difference between an encyclopaedia article and a dictionary article is content, not length. A dictionary article <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/numeronym" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:numeronym">numeronym</a> tells the reader <i>about the word</i> "numeronym" (its etymology, meaning, pronunciation, translations, synonyms, antonyms, related words, derived words, and so forth). An encyclopaedia article, such as this one, tells us <i>about the concept</i> of numeronyms (what numeronyms are, the history of numeronyms, the different types of numeronyms that exist, and so forth). A dictionary article is on the "mention" side of the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use-mention_distinction.html" title="Use-mention distinction">use-mention distinction</a>, and an encyclopaedia article is on the "use" side.</p>
<p>As the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a> says, if you encounter an encyclopaedia article that is erroneously on the "mention" side of the distinction, one thing that you can do to improve it is to edit it so that it is on the "use" side.</p>
<p>That wasn't the case here, though. This article was already on the "use" side, and labelled as a stub. The correct question is whether or not it will be a <i>perpetual stub</i>, with no hope for expansion. There seems to be enough source material for this not to be the case. And given that the article <i>has already been expanded</i> from its form at nomination, the proof of the pudding <i>has been</i> in the eating. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
