<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. There were a number of votes from new users, but they had some valid points which I have decided to consider. The argument for keeping is that the game is pretty old, yet the argument for deletion is that the game has never received a great deal of popularity and therefore fails the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. On vote count from established users there is an overwhelming majority for deletion.

<p><b>Keep</b> This is an article about a game that was played on AOL since 1996, hosted by a company that went out of business and was turned over to those that wrote the game and continue to work on it and put long hours and hard work into. There are hundreds of people who have played this game and have put thousands of hours into it and deserve to have their accomplishments recorded. Does the pages about movies only remain because they had millions of dollars budget behind them or because people enjoyed them enough to want to immortalize the information online for those that are fans of it to read about? This topic has valuable information, some of which I didn't even know about until one of the original creators of the game came here and edited my partially incorrect information. I learned something from this topic and others will to unless you get it deleted.</p>
<p>As for it being a non-notable RPG. What is your classifcation of non-notable? Does it have to be a published RPG that makes money to qualify? Something free can't? Does it have to have hundreds of thousands of people playing it? There are message boards still hosted by AOL that have thousands of posts from this game when it was hosted on AOL. The problem was we wanted to expand the game and allow those who didn't have AOL any longer to continue to play. So we took it off of AOL and moved it to AIM rooms.</p>
<p>For proof here is the message boards where thousands of posts still remain from when it was on AOL. And before you say there's only a few...make sure you change your settings to the past 999 days, and even then you can't get all the way back to the 1998 posts. You can only get as far back as 2003 because of the way AOL changed their message boards. <a href="http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/boards.php?boardId=122669&amp;func=2&amp;channel=Games&amp;refresh=true" class="external text" title="http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/boards.php?boardId=122669&amp;func=2&amp;channel=Games&amp;refresh=true" rel="nofollow">Black Bayou AOL Message Boards.</a> HoldynWolf 22:26, 12 January 2006 (EST)</p>

I just registered a week ago, never really knew about wikipedia before that. Decided that Black Bayou a game I loved to play deserved a place here for all the others that have played it in the years to be able to remember it. And with this AfD I haven't had time to go and look for other topics that I might know something about that's not beed added. I don't think all these comments you added are important in the consideration of whether this gets deleted or not. I think the facts about the page, not the users should be considered.

<p><b>Keep</b> This article is a valuable article to the hundreds of people who have played this game over the years. It is a fact that this game existed and there are many people who might benefit or enjoy knowing that the game still exists. Who has the right to go around and delete a post because they were never personally involved with the game? This game is FAR from non-notable. Thousands of posts on AOL and 2 separate message boards with posts currently. Sakia Warner 22:43, 12 January 2006 (EST)</p>

<li><b>Maybe Obscure to you</b> I cannot give you an exact number of people who played this game. But I just checked the old AOL Message boards, which have been there since 1996 but with AOL's changes can only go back 999 days in the archive. One folder had over 5000 In-Character Posts. Stories written by people. Hundreds maybe thousands. At any given time there would be several hundred active CS's. Which means that they had updated in the last 60 days of their last approved CS. And hundreds more that were not active from time to time. Have you witnessed the game to decide if it's obscure? I know quite a few posts on the internet regarding Black Bayou. There's several reviews of it on Gaming Sites. This page may not be of interest to you or the others asking for it to be deleted, but to all those that games here, and there was many that have. I say hundreds, but I played the game starting in 1997 - 1998 and have taken breaks from time. What is to obscure? I saw a post about some dead guy on Wikipedia who I never knew existed, it had about two paragraphs. I would think that's obscure. Look at the edits on this page already and all the factual information put up about a game that was a very important piece of AOL in it's early years.HoldynWolf 12:45, 13 January 2006 (EST)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> This experience has been a part of AOL and the internet for as long as I can remember. It has outlasted the tabletop Vampire: The Masquerade. Yet another version of Dungeons and Dragons has come and gone during its time. It has spawned countless "mini" spin offs along the way, including one that matured, found a home on AOL and is still there. The futuristic breeds that didnt fit Bayou became a game all on its own called Crossroads. If nothing else, Bayou is notable for the length of it's survival in a world of games that thrive on the newest graphics engines. An all text game running for 10 years... and nobody making a profit off of it as motivation to keep it going. Find another game that can claim that. ~Dark Requiem~</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- 10 years of history consistently rated as the No. 1 game on AOL should NOT be deleted. If ever there was an open-source Role Playing Game, this is it. No one profits. No one makes money off of it. There's not even advertising revenue coming in off of its Web site. Just because people are out to delete all mentions of role playing games on Wikipedia is NOT an excuse to delete this entry. ~ReporterSteven~

<p><b>Keep</b>: This is not an AIM based game, take the time to read everything rather than latch on to one area. AIM is offered now for a wider variety of gamers and writers, some who chose not to pay the price for AOL just to enjoy a nightly game. True there are still AOL based boards and the posts go back to as early as 1997 on those boards. Black Bayou is not a fly by night game, it is not a MMORPH, it is a gaming community even if it is small. The game is over ten years old, it started in 1996 as a premium game before AOL changed from an hourly rate. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Samantha Wolfe (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samantha_Wolfe_0cc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samantha Wolfe">contribs</a>) 02:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>You need to go to settings and change it to go further back then 23 days. PLUS those first three things you see are just categories, once you open them up you see all the other folders. The folders on AOL.COM are OLD, they are the archive. The game moved off AOL. Change your view settings then you will see the thousands of posts. Stop looking at the surface and dig deeper in.

<dd>This is not just about the current community but also about the past community since 1996 that has been involved with Black Bayou and Antagonist Games. BlackBayou.net is a split of of blackbayou.com(different versions of the game are being played at both, and I don't believe there is anyone playing both versions at the current time so those numbers don't overlap the two games). Both those games use the Black Bayou Rules. BlackBayou.net split off in August of 2005. They have around that number since just August. BlackBayou.com has been around just a bit longer (They were originally those AOL Boards I mentioned that have 5000 posts since just 2003) but I know for a fact purged some names on blackbayou.com that were inactive or no longer had valid emails. As for the current totals being played by just these two games should not be the basis for deletion. There have been hundreds more that have played. This is about the history of Black Bayou, about what Black Bayou started as, became and now is. I had hoped to add more to this wikipedia but now I have had to spend much of my time in this discussion. Oh and Explorecrossroads.com (Crossroads RPG) is based off of the Black Bayou Rules. That's three forums that I know off the top of my head that uses these rules and there has been others in the past.HoldynWolf</dd>

<li>A rule of thumb is not a community-accepted rule. It's an opinion. As we've already explained in showing citations, a game that existed exclusively on AOL, that pre-dates Google, was part of the dot-com boom, does not have that current acception. But iT DID. We're talking about a game that had a high in circa 1996.

<p>Apparently new comers are not appreciated here, nor is new information. The page was not even given enough time to turn into anything. I have not had time this week to devote to trying to work on Black Bayou wikipedia entry as I have had to use what little time this week to defend this. I had heard nothing but good about wikipedia and that's why I came here to post about Black Bayou. A game that was part of Antagonist Games and their parent company Hecklers. Both Hecklers and Antagonist went out of business when AOL changed the way they would do their keywords and channels. Black Bayou continued on. This game was played by so many, long before the 'internet' was as popular as it is now. Back before .asp and java and all the other amazing mark up languages that rule the internet now. Back when you could create a simple page using just html tags. There is so little from back in 1996 about Black Bayou because it was all on AOL, in their keywords using their special coding. It was not internet based then, so there are no internet pages from then. Everything is from NOW since we just moved off of AOL. Hecklers and Antagonist only had their website for months before they went out of bussiness. They could not survive outside of AOL. I can't give you the proof you want because this was all on an old America Online that has changed. You are all trying to take away the chance for it to finally be brought off of AOL and documented on the internet. I am disgusted with wikipedia and their 'community' of members that for the most part I have seen through their 'users contributions' links only go in and say 'delete not notable enough' ... 'delete not important enough' ... 'delete we can't get enough google hits' ... 'delete RPG's aren't important.' Well you know what, fine. delete this and everything else. You can then have your wikipedia of pages about how you got everything deleted. I will make sure to document something some place else in the future.</p>
<p>It's a shame that something as old as this is not considered notable or important enough. It's a shame that American Online which along with several other large online services at the time it being forgotten. Black Bayou was a part of AOL through Antagonist Games and Hecklers Online. They helped fuel American Online, giving content people wanted to pay for. American Online didn't use webpages then, they used their own system. And now because of that, this page is at risk for deletion because I have no internet prrof.HoldynWolf</p>
<p>Here's something about Hecklers who owned Antagonist who ran Black Bayou:</p>

<li>Hecklers went bust with the dot-com fallout and, thus, so went Black Bayou to the wayside. Thanks to the Library of Congress and the Way Back Machine, some of the Web content as far back as 1997 was saved here for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://Hecklers.com" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://Hecklers.com" rel="nofollow">Hecklers</a> and as far back as 1998 here for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://antagonist.com" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://antagonist.com" rel="nofollow">Antagonist</a>. Per the Web content information, this page needs only meet one of the criteria not to be deleted. "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." This game was created by an outfit so well-known that Playboy teamed up with them. Sure, the outfit may be bankrupt now, but does Wikipedia not talk about online outfits that went bankrupt? Wikipedia further states in <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Importance</a> that "An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true: There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, <b>were or might be concurrently</b> interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known <b>in a community</b> ((that means everyone everywhere doesn't need to know what it is and we established that it has a history amid a corporation that has been written about in business journals ). Further, If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  1. of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or
  2. currently small or a stub, or
  3. obscure. 
</pre>
<p>(Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)" So you may find it doesn't have the relative fame of current "millions" and that it's "obscure" but that doesn't matter to importance. This is a random journal entry on a message board from some guy I don't even know recollecting about his days with Black Bayou <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:XlCcGzJiXj8J:barroks-tower.net/forums/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D3884%26view%3Dgetlastpost+%22Black+Bayou%22+vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:XlCcGzJiXj8J:barroks-tower.net/forums/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D3884%26view%3Dgetlastpost+%22Black+Bayou%22+vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">cache here</a> In his post, he states, " I've been RPing since about 1998 or so. Much later if you mean tabletop gaming. I started playing in the chats of AOL. First in free-form gaming rooms, then in Moderated chats with pages and pages of rules. (It was great!) One was a futuristic game called Crossroads and the other was a WoD themed game called Black Bayou. If I had AOL still I would still be playing BB. After graduation, I went to Community College and finally found some like-minded gamers.... Now its 2005, and still haven't played a game of Vampire ...." At one point, Black Bayou even spawned a small convention called [<a href="http://www.bayoucon.aylyai.com/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bayoucon.aylyai.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">Bayou-con</a>] Users have created "member Web sites" for their characters like this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Wvp6HX-lO6UJ:hometown.aol.com/adriantheriot/+%22Black+Bayou%22+AOL+horror&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Wvp6HX-lO6UJ:hometown.aol.com/adriantheriot/+%22Black+Bayou%22+AOL+horror&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">one</a> and this <a href="http://www.jeweledwaters.com/fallon/" class="external text" title="http://www.jeweledwaters.com/fallon/" rel="nofollow">one</a>and many, many others. These people are passionate about their characters. On this Web site titled AOL Watch, which criticizes AOL in general, it copied the Home Page of AOL. That is the VERY FIRST Welcome screen someone would see when they logged onto AOL. Millions of people saw this screen. <a href="http://www.aolwatch.org/welcomex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aolwatch.org/welcomex.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Thousands of people clicked on the link o go to Black Bayou. This is a copy of the text from the screen from some guy who hates AOL, from an established Web site, yet it states "Today's selection of actual messages from AOL's Exit and Welcome screens....</p>
<p>Not just another pretty screen name--Meet your neighbors@AOL ON The Move!</p>
<p>Meet your AstroMate...</p>
<p>Edgy roleplay. Mouth to Mouth. Vampires of the Black Bayou..." Right up there with a basic astrology in terms of importance. That's dang good exposure. I saw one of those links way back in the day. I clicked on it. So did many, many others. ~~ReporterSteven~~</p>
<p>Here are more from ant.com.

<p><b>KEEP if</b> the scope is expanded to RPG games of AOL where the myriad other games can be talked about as well. I think this has a place on wikipedia, just not as it's own artical.

<li>I think that's a fair statement. Thank you for offering a POSITIVE statement offering a SOLUTION that helps us rather than dismissing this like some others who insist on arguing.
