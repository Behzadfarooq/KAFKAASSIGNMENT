The result of the debate was <b>no consensus reached</b>. The votes to delete were roughly equal to votes for merging and keeping. That said, more of the "don't delete" votes suggested merging, so I'm adding a "merge" tag to the article and listing it on <a href="../../../d/a/_/WP%7EDA_a8a0.html" title="WP:DA">WP:DA</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> 23:48, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Articles like this should be quietly merged rather than listed for deletion. But in this case, <b>delete</b> is fine too since there is no encyclopedic content, it's an unlikely external link and there are no internal ones except for deletion links and one from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shane_MacGowan_9b2e.html" title="Shane MacGowan">Shane MacGowan</a>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:26, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's about time deletionists gave reasons for wanting articles deleted that actually bore some relation to the deletion policy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this article. It is about a real thing, which it is possible to verify, and forms part of "human knowledge". This is not a paper encyclopaedia, so we can potentially include <i>all</i> knowledge. This is a wonderful and inspiring sentiment. Trying to cut it down to one's personal taste is not.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:29, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And by wanting this article to remain one could argue that you too are using personal taste in your judgement? I would like to think Wikipedia is democratic enough to allow dissenting voices to be heard, this is afterall Votes for Deletion not Votes for Retention. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:44, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's both, Megan. It's where deletionists try to enforce their personal taste, and those who want a broad encyclopaedia attempt to influence the community not to permit them. If you'll note, I'm not suggesting deletionists should not vote, only that they should give reasons, as they are asked to do, that show why the article should be deleted according to the deletion policy. "Not notable" is not in the policy, Megan.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:51, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One could also say: "It's where inclusionists try to enforce <b>their</b> personal view of Wikipedia as being a repository of all factual information, however miniscule and unimportant that information might be on those who wish to preserve Wikipedia as something that is still recognizably an encyclopedia." Neither side is evil, they just have different views of what Wikipedia is/should be.</li>

<dd>On notability: <i>of course</i> it is a valid reason for motivating a deletion. In addition to there being ample <i>precedents</i> of articles being deleted for this reason, point 17 of "What Wikipedia articles are not" clearly states that "The people who have biographies here should be important or otherwise notable for some reason." And I would like somebody to explain to me why being "important and notable" should then also not applies to fictional characters, beasts, weapons, etc. as well as to real-life things such as schools, malls, buildings, etc.</dd>
<dd>In addition, even if it wasn't covered by the above, "What Wikipedia articles are not" also clearly states that the list given is not exhaustive, but gives only the items on which there are consensus. Nowhere in the procedure does it state that other reasons that do not correspond 100% with the currently listed points cannot be given as a motivation for deletion, as long as they fall within the (admittedly broad) categories of: No potential to become encyclopedic, Original research, Inappropriate user pages in excessive or stubborn cases, Vanity page, Advertising or other spam, Completely idiosyncratic non-topic. "Non-notability" of a person, object, etc. is a perfectly valid interpretation of "No potential to become encyclopedic".</dd>
<dd>So, please debate each article on its own merits and don't browbeat people who use a motivation on VfD that you don't agree with by using the statement "it isn't in the policy" - there is ample room in the policy to permit non-notability being used as a motivation for VfD-ing an article. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 21:15, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm browbeating no one. I try to form a consensus by discussion. That discussion should be guided by the policy. It's perfectly acceptable to suggest that deletionists should give reasons that are coherent with the policy for getting rid of articles. The policy clearly is not deletionist and is not in favour of losing information. "Notable for some reason" is extremely broad, Elf-friend. Even if it did cover nonpersons, which it clearly does not, since the mention of notability is <i>only in</i> the section on biographies, "Notable by reason of being a mall used by hundreds of thousands" would cover it. I don't know of any definition of "encyclopaedic" that demands "notability" of inclusions in an encyclopaedia, and certainly none that suggests that "notability" has a particular level. Our own policy wisely doesn't set any particular bar. The page in question in fact suggests that articles should include what readers would expect to find under the heading of the article. If I search for Johor Bahru City Square, what do I expect to find? According to you, nothing. I expect it to be beneath notice. That's a very personal view, but this is not an encyclopaedia for <i>you</i> or for <i>me</i>. It's for <i>everyone</i>. I think you should only vote that an article is "not notable" if it is truly your belief that no one, or at the least, a vanishingly small number of people, would look up its title and expect to find something.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:48, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This isn't really a mall. It's the central square of the second largest city in Malaysia. Practically every city and town on the planet have at least one central square, mall, place. But it doesn't follow automatically from the size of the city that its central square is notable. I have no way to know whether this case is notable, since the article does not say. In fact, all the article tells me is that Johor Hahru has a city square, which I could have guessed. The article doesn't tell anyone anything that he didn't already know before he clicked on the link to the article. If there is anything to say about them at all, it makes more sense that central city locations are documented in the articles about the cities, unless they have notability beyond that of the city itself, or the article about the city has grown too long. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>

Furthermore, it is a very tall building with lots of offices and malls, like the structure of <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei_101.html" title="Taipei 101">Taipei 101</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petronas_Twin_Towers_c1c8.html" title="Petronas Twin Towers">Petronas Twin Towers</a>, except it is not that big.

<li>What's wrong with this article is that the information is better served in the main article. It has a context and point there, and adds local color.

<li>Speedy delete for recreation of previously deleted content. It's time for the inclusionists to go over to Everything2 or Wikinfo, if they get upset that other people have standards. Donut shops affect thousands of lives. Pay telephones can be the only ones for miles. The sewer cap could be very near dozens of important stores. The things every place has are not encyclopedic content. Only the things that stand out from the others are encyclopedic. Otherwise, go to Mapquest if you want to know the main drag of a city, go to the county courthouse if you want to find out how many students go to the high school. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:52, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Listen up, Guys!</b> I have a new suggestion. It is very hard to merge with the Johor Bahu article. Why don't instaed add the content into <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_centres_of_Johor_Bahru_b5e0.html" title="Shopping centres of Johor Bahru">Shopping centres of Johor Bahru</a> and expand from there? I think that is better than merging with <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johor_Bahru_e960.html" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a> since other city articles never had one.

<li>What is so hard about it? Just add a Landmarks section to the end of the article and mention it. The article is still short. If the editors <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johor_Bahru_e960.html" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a> don't think it is important enough to be mentioned, then that is good enough reason to delete a separate article. An article dedicated to a list of shopping centers in one city is not good idea. Every city on the planet has shopping centres. People shop. Would you want an article for the shopping centers for each of tens of thousands of cities in the world? Wikipedia is not a shopping center directory. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:25, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>why? because a notably named user (<i>DreamGuy</i>) accuses vanity? a more humble user states "personal essay" finished by "not an appropriate encyclopedia article" yet another with a "humbug" for good measure? is this why this article should be deleted? well let us hear what Webster says about an encyclopedic article:</dd>

<dd>See Cyclopedia, and Encyclical. Formerly written</dd>

<dd>The circle of arts and sciences; a comprehensive summary of</dd>
<dd>knowledge, or of a branch of knowledge; esp., a work in which</dd>
<dd>the various branches of science or art are discussed</dd>
<dd>separately, and usually in alphabetical order; a cyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>now, outside of the fact that this article is filed under "Philosophy" which is either art, science or both depending on your viewpoint --- this vote was opened by stating this article appears to be an essay...and I ask what essay is not at least art? further I wonder what author cannot be accused of vanity for simply believing that upon writing their ideas and or dreams on medium someone might actually want to read what they have written -- quite vain I'm sure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>humbug is right. I should hope more for a rebuttal of the ideas in this article via written perspective than a blatant deletion of a completely unique niche subject and article in Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>so delete it lest you feel compelled in a fit of weakness to add your philosophical view regarding the spirit of christmas...because obviously that would be vain and no one else is doing it... - <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabriel_Kent_b963.html" title="User:Gabriel Kent">Gabriel Kent</a> 19:31, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article claims that "The line has come into modern American English as a catch phrase," and it simply has not. A Google search for the phrase finds no examples of this exact phrase being used to describe anything else but the Clinton Testimony. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement.

<li>Delete, I guess. I have actually heard this used as a reference outside Clinton's testimony, to refer to semantic arguments in general, but just because this phrase's 15 minutes of fame has stretched to 20 probably isn't sufficient for an encyclopedia intended to be timeless. That is, I believe that all JenGod's citations ARE specifically based on Clinton's testimony, and find Kingturtle's conclusions based on the Google search innaccurate, but I really hate neologisms, and feel they need currency for a longer period than this has, so far. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 18:29, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: It has entered into popular American culture. That doesn't mean it should be kept. First, we're not writing a dictionary at Wikipedia. Second, it's POV. Third, discussing the context of the original remark ("You mean there's no sex?" "There is no sex?" "Yes. There's no sex?" "No." Later: "Did you lie when you said there is no sex?" "Depends on what the meaning of is is." Pinheaded lawyer mangles English and uses "there's" when he means "there has been," and this gives the witness a chance to gleefully answer "No" because, indeed, at that present time there was no sex taking place, and then that refusal to do the lawyer's job for him by correcting his grammar and answering an incriminating question that wasn't posed becomes a catch phrase for evasion) is not discussing the usage today. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:45, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> (Shrug) In my experience, it <i>does</i> have some significant use as a catchphrase. It's in decline, and in a few years will probably be as forgotten as "To the best of my recollection at this point in time" and "I'm just a simple country lawyer." I think it's valuable to document these things. There are any number of times I've been reading an old novel and a phrase, obviously a popular phrase of the time pops up and there's no easy way to find out what it means. Like "Mother, mother, mother pin a rose on me" (1920s) or "So's your old man" (c. 1900?)

<li><b>Delete</b> unless some kind of currency is shown, it seems a non-notable proposal. It also contains a non-Wikipedia copyright licence. Besides, you can't have a triangular calendar; everybody knows that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">time is a cube</a>. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:14, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It contains content under an open ended copyright (mine), which is free for use, and acceptable under the Wikipedia Copyright. It infringes no copyright, as it is my own original content. As for original research, I would submit that this article is just as valid as existing articles, especially those methods of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">time kookery</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swatch_Internet_Time_fc06.html" title="Swatch Internet Time">Original content based on previous concepts</a>, which are original ideas, but only follow the standards of Wikipedia policy because of a portion of news coverage. I support TEC because it was published prior to the Wikipedia article on an <a href="http://www.i8-d.com/calendar.html" class="external text" title="http://www.i8-d.com/calendar.html" rel="nofollow">independant website</a>. It does not contain a viewpoint, but rather, which was my goal, a non-biased explination of TEC. I also submit that it is a listing of an alternative <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar.html" title="Calendar">calendar</a> format, which I support that alternative calendar formats have been very newsworthy. I have stated the key concepts, and made proper comparisons to existing work. I further submit that much of the format is already published in a lesser format as the <a href="http://www.yunnantourism.net/scenicspots/sight_index.asp?sight_id=CN-01-15-04" class="external text" title="http://www.yunnantourism.net/scenicspots/sight_index.asp?sight_id=CN-01-15-04" rel="nofollow">Chinese Ten-Month Solar Calendar</a>, which consists of 360 days, plus 5 or 6. TEC uses a similar format, but conforms to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> in terms of the length of the year in days, leap years, and in the format of standard weeks. If you read on the Ten-Month Solar Calendar (google for "ten month" solar calendar), you will see that it is widely documented, and the concepts date back thousands of years, including the Romans and Chinese. Thus, it does not represent such original work, as defined by Wikipedia, but combined work, all of which is extensively peer reviewed under each seperate criteria. It also does not introduce any new terms. It uses months, weeks, days, mathematical concepts, etc. The only term that I know that it defines newly is the TEC Decimal Day which is not really a new term, but an explination simply of how TEC uses <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_time.html" title="Decimal time">Decimal time</a>. To summarize, I state that the concepts here are all existing, including the written formats, both mathematical, geometrical, and in script, that the original work has be prior published, that it is non-biased, and that it holds no copyright that prevents Wikipedia use. --DeWayne Lehman 18:27, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> — I agree that it is original research not appropriate for Wikipedia. It is solely the idea of and promoted by the author. Furthermore, any copyright, even one as broad as the author's is unacceptable on Wikipedia. The cited Ten-Month Solar Calendar is not Chinese, but that of Yi, a minority culture within modern China. The dominant Chinese calendar used since the sencond millennium BC has always had at least twelve months — even a fourteen month year is mentioned on <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_bone.html" title="Oracle bone">oracle bones</a>. The Roman ten month year was used, according to legend, for less than fifty years, and furthermore had 304 days (it ignored winter). Simply citing earlier ten month years does not change the nature of the author's original research nor his copyright. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 20:08, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't mean to get off on two side topics, but Wikipedia explicitly states:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>If you contribute material to Wikipedia, you thereby license it to the public under the GFDL (with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). In order to contribute, you therefore must be in a position to grant this license, which means that either</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>you own the copyright to the material, for instance because you produced it yourself, or</i></li>
<li><i>you acquired the material from a source that allows the licensing under GFDL, for instance because the material is in the public domain or is itself published under GFDL.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>In the first case, you retain copyright to your materials. You can later republish and relicense them in any way you like. However, you can never retract the GFDL license for the versions you placed here: that material will remain under GFDL forever</i>.</p>
<p>All original content works are copyrighted to the original writer (which I believe is most works on Wikipedia), with GFDL granted by the owner when they publish here. Even without explicitly stating it, the copyright is owned by me, with GFDL appended to it, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia Copyright</a>. The only difference with appending the copyright is to state that I have granted rights for all material I publish on the TEC, on Wikipedia or elsewhere. It does not affect the fact that the GFDL is granted to the copyright of the article text. The copyright was already placed on the TEC before publication to Wikipedia, anyways, so it would apply regardless, just as <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a> logo trademarks and copyright are not altered simply because Wikipedia has an article on them.</p>
<p>As for the 10-Month Solar Calendar and the Yi ethnic group, they are a population of <a href="http://www.toptrip.cc/destination/minority/yi.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.toptrip.cc/destination/minority/yi.htm" rel="nofollow">6,578,500 people</a>. That may be a minority for China, but it is larger than the entire <a href="http://minneapolis.about.com/cs/demographics/f/mnpopulation.htm" class="external text" title="http://minneapolis.about.com/cs/demographics/f/mnpopulation.htm" rel="nofollow">population of Minnesota</a>. It doesn't look good for the TEC on Wikipedia at the moment. Perhaps I should get to work on an article about the Yi and their calendar first. It gets the basic idea across, at least, even if I can't include any of my own thoughts. It seems I can only hope someday to get /.'d and have at least a few hundred TEC users before I can republish this.

<dd><b>keep</b> You probably made a typo when you did online search. Also, as you might have noticed, it is referenced in the template table for Chinese romanization.

<dd>Thanks for your feedback, Mikkalai. I do consider myself reasonably competent on Google, and searched on the literal spelling (cut-and-paste, to rule out typos) as well as several variants that seemed reasonable, given the odd spelling in the original article. Google turns up a hundred or so hits for 'Gwohndongwaa', which I diligently waded through, only to find that they're almost all from sites that scrape their content from Wikipedia. The sole exception turns out to be <a href="http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/phorum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=15443&amp;t=15443&amp;v=f" class="external text" title="http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/phorum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=15443&amp;t=15443&amp;v=f" rel="nofollow">this</a> discussion thread from someone with the same doubts about the legitimacy of this romanization system. On the question of the template, I don't agree that its presence in <a href="../../../r/c/l/Template%7ERCL_5e36.html" title="Template:RCL">Template:RCL</a> is a bona-fide indicator of its accuracy. The template content is user-driven like the rest of Wikipedia, and I don't see anything there that indicates that "experts" have approved the inclusion of this system on the list. I would look more favorably on this article if there were any relevant references, but as it stands now, it is simply an assertion of the superiority of the author's romanization system, with no supporting evidence. - <a href="../../../j/p/o/User%7EJpo_f75c.html" title="User:Jpo">Jpo</a> 23:58, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Thank yoy for detailed explanations. About the template: all what I am saying is that including into template makes the article <b>visible</b> to experts, unlike the case of an orphaned article linked from nowhere. And I am pretty sure that those who wrote articles about romanizations keep the eye on the topic. So if it is a hype or nonnotable, it must be detected very soon by those who know things not only from google.

But, after eliminating -wikipedia, -wiktionary, -OpenFacts, and the other obvious clone pages, there's barely 1000 hits left -- most of which are also clone pages, which do not attribute to Wikipedia. That's not really passing the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">Google test</a>....<br />
If it is indeed an underground Cantonese romanization movement. It's a pretty weak one!<br />
And in regard to the somewhat widespread appearance of <i>Penkyamp</i> in WP itself, I'm afraid I'm somehow responsible for that...due to my ignorance. When I first came to WP, I was very into adding Romanizations to Chinese-related articles, and I thought that -- without checking other sources, even Google -- that Penkyamp <i>is</i> the official HK romanization system -- which is obviously <i>not</i> true. So, instead of saying "offfical HK system", I wrote "Penkyamp", thinking it's a name I haven't heard, but synonymous.

The article has received much more collaborative work from Wikipedians and the system is used by some Wikipedians in Romanizing Cantonese. It is also mentioned by<a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cantonese.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cantonese.htm" rel="nofollow">omniglot</a> although that could have been a self-fulfilling prophecy.

<li>Having a small number of local enthusiasts and having a club ... How "popular" is this? Guangzhou, a big city, is not exactly lacking in Internet. One'd imagine a popular romanization movement to be popular on the net as well. After all, Cantonese romanization is not often used within the China itself.

<li>This article was originally at [Cantonese Romanization] before I moved it to its current location.

Fringe movements have no place here. If kept, it should be given as much coverage as it is important (that is, it should be delinked in all places except the article on Cantonese). Perhaps we can give it passing mention in a general article on Cantonese Romanization or at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Cantonese (linguistics)">Cantonese (linguistics)</a> (or at least merge some of its info there), but as a stand alone article, I dont think it should exist.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Ji</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang">ang</a> 20:11, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: Fellow Wikipedians, please pause and think for a second: do you know the exact origin and meaning of "penkyamp" in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_language.html" title="Cantonese language">Cantonese language</a>? Proper nouns(let's have no doubt that "Penkyamp" is indeed a proper name for the orthography), have varying degrees of SPECIFICITY. The fact that the name "penkyamp" does not automatically lead us to the origin of such system doesn't mean that such system wasn't in use under different names. Let's see: "penkyamp" as a GENERAL NOUN is inspired by Mandarin "<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">pinyin</a>", which is itself both a proper name for a system and a general noun designating "phonetic script". As a result, "penkyamp" as a general noun has been in use among the Cantonese referring to any phonetic script since at least the birth of the Mandarin Pinyin. And "Penkyamp" as a proper noun for a specific system might not be in place well after this system was in use for many years, only until it was introduced to us as such. What if on-line records before 2003 has been mostly erased?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, the article started under the entry Cantonese Romanization instead of Penkyamp. Maybe back then "Penkyamp" wasn't finalized as its only proper name. It could be "Lomazi" or "Zeuyamp". At least it's nothing as specific as "Jyutpin" (a name that is hightly stylized and specified as a "PINyin"--note: not a Cantonese pronunciation--- of the "Jyut"(Guangdong)-- nothing can get as specific as this, which will garantee to trace back to its origin as an officially sponsored scheme). But "penkyamp" is not as specific as this. It means "phonetic script", is spelled as is pronounced in Cantonese, and is in circulation among the Cantonese thanks to the already existing Mandarin "Pinyin". I urge you to think twice about our obsession with the specificity of the proper name of the entry: what you call "Penkyamp" is actually of secondary relevance. The question is, what kind of usage, or systems were in existence before this name was finalized, on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunshi_49e6.html" title="User:Dunshi">Dunshi</a> 18:44, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I still doubt the reliability of google, as I have discovered that Yahoo! groups information and discussions on Cantonese romanization before 2002 are totally non-existent. Needless to say, they were simply erased, as I definitely participated in these discussions. I hope someone can reach James Campbell, aka Glossika, a Western linguist on the Chinese language living in Taiwan, who might have passing aquaintance of Cantonese romanization schemes which surfaced in online communities around late 90s. I doubt the name "Penkyamp" was much used back then. A friend I used to communicate with using modified Cantonese romanization in early 90s was Li Zhu of Guangzhou. I have lost touch with him since 95. Guangzhou is a city where Cantonese romanization schemes were experimented as early as the 1930s. The Internet did not exist in that city until at least 1996 and traffics with foreign countries are still quite tightly controlled. (for one, I doubt that Mainland Chinese have free access to Wikipedia). These are my arguments against the reliability of google search on Guangzhou Cantonese romanization schemes.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm kind of new here. I find this discussion fascinating. Though I'm not casting a vote (I'm not sure I'm eligible anyway since I'm new), I would like to leave a comment. I'm part Chinese, but I was born in the West. Unfortunately, I didn't learn Chinese as I was growing up. But I find it to be extremely fascinating, so I'm doing what I can right now to learn Mandarin, Cantonese, and reading/writing. It's a slow arduous process, but I'm having a lot of fun along the way. Though I enjoy both, I personally feel Cantonese is the more interesting of the two dialects. Concerning transcription schemes, I think I'm in a good position to comment on it. As a non-native speaker learning Cantonese, I'm actually in the position of needing to use the transcription schemes. Cantonese may not have a single "standard" romanization scheme, but I think that is part of what makes it interesting. When I started learning Cantonese, I mainly learned from friends and colleagues. But that didn't provide the structure that I wanted, so I bought a book that I found at a local bookstore. That book used its own version of a romanization scheme. I searched the internet and local libraries to help me find additional materials to help me learn Cantonese. This is my own experience only, but the websites that I found useful on the Internet were using LSHK's jyutping. And the books I found in the libraries in my city were using other (perhaps older) schemes like Sidney Lau. But I think that's okay, because a transcription scheme is just a tool for learning Cantonese. I think that the preference in transcription schemes is just the prerogative of the person teaching it. By the way, I never came across Penkyamp until I came to Wikipedia. About learning Cantonese, I came across a statement in Wikipedia's own Cantonese (linguistics) article in the Romanization section that states, "learners may feel frustrated that most native Cantonese speakers, no matter how educated they are, really don't understand any romanization system." I respectfully disagree. That statement wrongly suggests that the education of a native speaker has anything to do with the matter. My opinion is that native speakers shouldn't have to learn a romanization system for their own language. The romanization system isn't actually part of the language after all. Why should native speakers be forced to learn something that won't be useful for them? It would only be useful for the rest of us who are learning. I personally feel that it would be selfish for us (learners) to expect the native population to go through all that trouble just to make it easier for us. Please excuse me if I'm too opinionated about this. I mean no disrespect to anyone. Good luck to both sides of the Penkyamp argument. Happy New Year to everyone. --Wang123 Friday, January 7, 2005 at 09:01:01 UTC.</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <i>Vote retracted: see Addendum</i> Sorry. I originally intended to stay neutral in this debate over whether to keep or delete the Penkyamp article. But after some consideration, I’ve come to the opinion that there is not enough reason to delete the article. Being so new to Wikipedia, I don’t know if I’m eligible to vote in this poll, so I won’t mind if you don’t count my vote. But, if nothing at all, I hope you guys will listen to my reasoning. So here it is: I don’t think that the Penkyamp article should be deleted, because that would cause a loss of information. It is the duty of an encyclopedia to provide information. In addition, I don’t think that a lack of popularity for a transcription scheme warrants not including it in an encyclopedia. If Penkyamp should be deleted, then why shouldn’t all the transcription schemes be deleted. After all, none of the Cantonese transcription schemes have gained wide acceptance. Furthermore: I feel that it is the duty of Wikipedia to provide information rather than promote a cause. Thus, there is no reason for the hostility between supporters of different transcription schemes. Supporters of Penkyamp should feel free to provide an informative article on Penkyamp in Wikipedia, and supporters of other schemes, like my personal favorite LSHK’s jyutping, should feel free to provide an informative article on their scheme in Wikipedia. But I strongly feel that the articles should be limited to only providing information on how to use each transcription scheme and not advocate any one as better than another. Wikipedia should strive to provide impartial information on such a benign topic. --Wang123 Friday, January 7, 2005 at 10:16:16 UTC. .... <b>Addendum:</b> I just read the arguments for deleting the other article, Gwohngdongwaa pengyam. Now I understand the point of view where all those ‘delete’ votes are coming from. Wow, this is problematic. I understand now that the debate over deleting Penkyamp (and the other one) is not over which transcription scheme is more popular or over which one is better, but over whether Penkyamp and Gwohngdongwaa pengyam are actually legitimate transcription schemes. Since I feel that Wikipedia should not be used as a portal to further a cause, then of course we should not have an article on Penkyamp if it is indeed illegitimate. I’m sorry that I didn’t understand this debate until now. I don’t know how legitimate either scheme is, and I’m unfortunately not in a position to find out. So I respectfully retract my vote. --Wang123 Friday, January 7, 2005 at 10:47:28 UTC.</li>
<li>Additional Note: As a note, I just checked the online Chinese Character Database, <i>Chinese Character Database: With Word-formations Phonologically Disambiguated According to the Cantonese Dialect</i>, at the website of the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Research Centre for Humanities Computing. That database can be used to show Cantonese pronunciations of Chinese characters, and it works with 7 transcription schemes. Penkyamp and Gwohngdongwaa pengyam (as described in Wikipedia's articles) are both <b>not</b> among those seven. In case you guys are curious, those seven are: LSHK's jyutping, Yale, Yale Orthodox, Wong Shik Ling, IPA, Canton, and Sidney Lau. I checked each one of them. None of them are Penkyamp or Gwohngdongwaa pengyam. --Wang123 Friday, January 7, 2005 at 11:12:17 UTC

<li>Thanks for your comment Wang123. The Internet has its own treacherousness and I just recently found out that the pre-2002 discussions and articles in Penkyamp is all lost to data crunching and I guess it's none of our fault that Penkyamp is deleted for "not meeting Wikipedia rules". I just wish, that people like you, me and FelixWan who has seen something of value in Penkyamp could get together (cybernetically speaking of course) as in a Penkyamp Society and study this scheme further, along with the official <a href="../../../j/y/u/Jyutping.html" title="Jyutping">Jyutping</a> and the foreign <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a>. Perhaps this way we can find Cantonese Romanizationists in the Mainland later on as the Web becomes less hindered by government control. Please note that Wikipedia's information on any <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> inspired Mainland Cantonese romanization system is blank. But such schemes exist.
<ul>
<li>Please don't misunderstand me. I've never used Penkyamp, and therefore have no opinion on the value of Penkyamp. Penkyamp could be a great transcription scheme, but I don't know for myself because I've never had the opportunity to use it. I only first heard of Penkyamp when I came to Wikipedia. By the way, to Felix_Wan, are you still working on an overhaul of the Cantonese Wikipedia articles? I love Cantonese, and I'd like to commend you for taking on such a big task. Is there any way I can help? --Wang123 Saturday, January 8, 2005 at 09:07:19 UTC</li>
<li>I don't want deletion to happen to less published Chinese dialect phonetic scripts such as the Wu-Shanghainese Romanization, the Mogo dialect syllabary, and many Minnan systems simply because they appear original, but are in fact well known in off-line circles.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see overwhelming proof that this is original research or a vanity page.

<li>Delete: It's true that it's a popular bumper sticker, but the thing about bumper stickers is that their sayings are purchased and endorsed by people with widely divergent understandings. Some might put on the "Visualize Whirled Peas" sticker because it's funny, while others may do so to make fun of the EST- and positive thinking-derived world peace group that Lenon liked, and others may hate hippies. The slogan independently of the bumper sticker has been used by, again, widely divergent groups. Some mean "subvert" as in the "detourment" of Guy DeBorg, and others mean "subvert" as revolution. In other words, there is no one thing behind the meme, so a discussion of it is inappropriate because it is not a subject in its own right. The groups that use it are proper for discussion, but a phrase that is now a badge worn by suburbanites and revolutionaries has lost its ideological content. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:48, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, my point is that it's not quite at the level of "Have a nice day" or "Shit happens," but it's more meaningless than "Organize!" I'm not against discussion of the groups that formed the meme and a discussion of how it has spread within the articles on those groups, but the fact that the groups have been lost is testimony to how the ideology has been evacuated. Marx argued, in the <i>Gundrisse,</i> that the moment a genre has a name, it has lost its activity in ideology. Well, something like that happens with slogans: they're successful only so long as everyone who puts on the button remembers that they're supporting the SDS or Acorn or PIRG. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:49, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't doubt that this is an actual working alphabet, but it doesn't seem to be widely used by any group of people. Its overall influence on society at large currently seems to be virtually nothing (or if there is some significant population with widespread use of this alphabet the article doesn't mention it) and thus it is not an appropriate topic for an encyclopedia article. People invent new writing systems all the time and an encyclopedia can't include everybody's personal projects. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 03:10, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Probable vanity page. While there are a number of people named Peter Sjögren to be found on Google, it's impossible to tell which one of them this refers to, and the information in this article is not interesting, especially since there is no main article for Peter Sjögren. --<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 23:52, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, possibly vanity, certainly not interesting or notable. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:24, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>, little content, no context. It's also a vanity stub. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:30, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
