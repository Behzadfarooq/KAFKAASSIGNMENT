<p>This article was written shortly after its subject's murder in 2005. However, being the victim of a murder does not automatically indicate <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">encyclopedic notability</a>, and there are no other indications of notability. Also, the article is written like a crime log, and not <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">an encyclopedia article</a>. <b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 00:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Brian, it looks to me that you are looking for a threshold of "importance", where WP calls for "notable" and the guidelines clearly state that the two are not the same. Notable is defined as being noticed, and media coverage to this degree is being noticed, whether the legal issues are important or not. Dito for Otto below. It's not for WP to judge the quality of mainstream journalism (e.g., Nancy Grace) but to offer factual information as a balance to the potential sensationalism. Again what is the harm of inclusion of this and other articles? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, my arguments are based in notability, not importance. I have argued here and elsewhere that there is a qualitative difference between something being "newsworthy" and something being "notable." <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> specifically states that the two are not the same. Even assuming that this particular murder is notable, which I'm not convinced of, that does not automatically confer sufficient notability to the victim. See my Brinks and Capitol shooting article examples below.</li>
<li>As for judging the quality of journalism, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> do require that we evaluate the reputability of the sources used for articles.</li>
<li>"What is the harm," with all due respect, is perhaps the worst argument for including an article. No article (other than false or libelous ones) actually "harm" Wikipedia. That doesn't mean that every article warrants inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, the murder was newsworthy but the topic is not notable. I think we need to visit the issue on when a crime victim becomes notable enough for inclusion, since most murders generate at least a couple of stories especially from the likes of Nancy Grace. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Etc., etc., etc. Seriously, take your pick. I'm not vouching for every individual story, but the overwhelming volume (A Nexis search confirms over 500 stories nationwide) and the fact that this was covered in huge news outlets all over the country. Maybe you could argue The Washington Post is local coverage, but honestly 20 times (says Nexis) in WashPost? That's not "anybody who gets murdered" coverage, that's something exceptional by itself. And as for "no sources attesting to this" the article itself already sites sources that mention this stuff.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand both sides of this argument, however after a little investigation I discovered that Wikipedia has articles on murderers whose only notability is that they have been executed. The facts of their cases have been obscured through the years. Take for instance <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Peoples%2C_Jr._5b3f.html" title="John W. Peoples, Jr.">John W. Peoples, Jr.</a>. In addition, this is one of the few instances where the victim gained more notoriety than the murderer, and that alone bears importance. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESectryan_1ba0.html" title="User:Sectryan">Sectryan</a> 14:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Agree with one of the Richmond papers cited that this is just another case of a missing white girl getting disproportionate newspaper coverage that the other 99 missing people in Richmond that year did not. Her tragic death is no more encyclopedic than theirs. Her mother worked hard to publicize the case. That does not make it encyclopedic either. This is not a newspaper archive, and news is not always history. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 15:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, the hype about this event has died down, and I don't think that this will be notable for long. Furthermore, the article seems to be linked to by only various user pages and lists, so I think that if the article is not being used by another real article soon it should be removed. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamael775_28db.html" title="User:Samael775">Samael775</a> 18:12, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't understand the rationale behind the AfD nomination. This article is not about the woman; it is about the homicide which is clearly notable as demonstrated by multiple verifiable sources. In a perfect world you might clarify the issue by calling it "Homocide of Taylor Behl", with a redirect from "Taylor Behl". But I don't think that is required.
