<dd>I can't see the point of this last vote/comment. The discussion in the Times doesn't seem to be about <i>public transport</i> route planners at all. No doubt a general article about computerised route planners could be written, and might be worth keeping, but this isn't such a thing - its a set of links. Without being too critical, has Robinh 'read' the article and would he like to explain the relevance of his remarks? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 09:25, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but get rid of the external links. The text above it, including the amusing note about their weaknesses, easily rises above dicdef.

<li><b>Delete</b> as listcruft. The one about the route via Dublin applies to all route planning software - Autoroute used to send you from Portsmouth to Southampton via the Isle of Wight, and Autoroute 2002 for Haverfordwest to Leominster takes you via dun Laoghaire on the seacat. Remove that non-specific allusion to a newspaper space-filler and what you have is exactly what <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a>: a collection of links. Remove the links and you have... pretty much nothing. I would link these individual planners on the sites for public transport in each country. The requirement for finding the information on several countries at once is likely to be extremely small. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:32, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am in two minds here, either to Redirect or Keep. On one hand, he is only notable as the father of J.R.R. Tolkein and hence could be included in his page. But on the other hand, how he brought JRR up likely influenced his books, and henceforth knowing about him provides useful background information about JRR and why he wrote like he did. Therefore, I think that it should be a <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 17:42, 23 November 2005 (UTC) (sorry forgot to sign before. didn't mean it to be unsigned so i will just sign it now)

<dd>He didn't raise JRRT; he died when he was 3. JRRT was raised by his mother, and then by their parish priest after she died.

<dd>What's surprising to me is that someone decided to add all this information about JRRT's father, who had little to no influence in his life, yet relatively little (and no article) has been written here about his mother who was an enormous influence on him. (Indeed, he always considered himself more of a Suffield than a Tolkien.) All this niggly background on his father's family indeed has a place in the main article IMO -- if correspondingly detailed information is added on his mother's family. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 06:55, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete: I'm no fan of individual episode articles, as I feel that it's far too granular for the bulk of them. Season summaries are sufficient for most shows, most of the time, and the stand-out episodes that had the world talking might need to be discussed as they, like people and events, <i>produced effects outside of themselves.</i> I.e. they set the culture to a new place.

<p>Definitely not the speedy it was tagged as, and talk page indicates good-faith attempt. Not sure if a redirect to a generic oil lamp is appropriate or if this belongs elsewhere or what, so AfD can do its research-thang. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:01, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete: Regardless of whether this type of oil lamp is all the rage or not, this article reads as advertising copy. The least that it needs is a POV rewrite. However, what seems to be at stake is whether this type of oil lamp is significant and discussed by other media. So far as I can tell preliminarily, it's just a particular product and not, say, the hand-crank shortwave radio or the recycled tire playground paving. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

That makes it somewhat non-notable. Whilst this is a valid product, I don't think that it is (yet) notable enough in its own right. Therefore I suggest a <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_lamps.html" title="Oil lamps">oil lamps</a> and keep the content. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 13:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to the article, <i>Rebar Jaff</i> is a widely published reporter whose main subject is Kurdistan and the Kurdish people. A Google search for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Rebar+Jaff%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Rebar+Jaff%22" rel="nofollow">"Rebar Jaff"</a> comes up with 41 hits, 9 of which are unique distributed over 3 websites. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 03:03, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The Google hits for this reporter show that he has published in Kurdistan. It is possible that his articles might not be online, but rather in print only papers. <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> 03:23, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Possibly. But the article also says that the author has worked for a number of Middle-Eastern newspapers and "Europe and US-based Internet news websites". Newspaper reporters and columnists tend to clock up a huge number of hits in Google. <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasmin_Alibhai-Brown_aed5.html" title="Yasmin Alibhai-Brown">Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</a>, who works for the <i>Independent {UK)</i>, has more than 500000. It could be that none of the newspapers that Rebar Jaff works for has an online edition (or uses Latin script, the wealthy bit of Kurdistan is in Iraq and Arabic script is used there, IIRC), or it could be that this is vanity. As usual, the proof that this isn't vanity is up to the editor who put the article up. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 03:52, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The IP address the article was edited from is assigned to the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg. Vanity, vanity of vanities. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 03:58, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete: This is no assertion of worth either way of the journalist's work, but anyone doing his job satisfactorily is, by definition, not remarkable.

<p>I found this one whilst searching for something completely different. Not only is it a dictionary entry, but it's of dubious truth; I'm sure this behavior happened long before 2003. So, in short, it's unverifiable, not an encyclopedia entry, and because of the name dropping, arguably vanity -- therefore, it should be <b>deleted</b> or changed back into a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Termination_of_employment.html" title="Termination of employment">termination of employment</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 04:11, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't? But the internet as a whole has a G-rating, unless prohibited in other ways. If Wikipedia does not have a G-rating, then it would have to be blocked (or else sections of it that are not G-rated would have to be) by NetNanny and other blocking software. This would make Wikipedia practically useless for class projects and such (which seems to be one of the main uses of it). Ergo, if Wikipedia doesn't have a G-rating, it should. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 15:51, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><i>Wikipedia contains spoilers and content you may find objectionable</i> is the closest thing that I could find to something suggesting it was not G-rated. Again, there are laws in existence in most countries of the world in relation to content that is allowable on the internet. For example, in Australia, anything that is considered to be "adults only", including explicit nudity, must first have a disclaimer on a blank page before linking to any pictures - and any explicit sex must require password protection and validation of adult age. I believe that the laws in the United States are very similar. i.e. the internet is G-rated. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 17:13, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please review the relevant policies. Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> censored for the protection of minors. Wikipedia is not "rated" at all. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias contain material which may be offensive to anyone.

<dd>Actually, you (accidently) <i>admit</i> on my talk page to being a puppet of the anon (not Piquan, who seems to be legit).

<dd>I did not "accidentally" admit anything. I have always been open with things. I merely created an account to avoid confusion, as I said immediately on creation. This is not a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppet</a> and you have falsely accused me of this. I had not voted on this page yet, and felt that a vote from an account would have more validity. On the other page, I do apologise as I had not realised that I had previously voted. There was no attempt to lie or hide anything. As for you saying that I am falsely accusing you of personal attacks - you are at minimum equally guilty, as you have falsely accused me of being a sock puppet. Whether that in itself constitutes a personal attack is debatable, but that, combined with you falsely accusing me of creating non notable articles, and deleting them 30 seconds after creation is, in my opinion, an example of a personal attack. If you do not mean it to be taken that way, then please apologise and resume good behaviour. I deleted your nonsense post on my user page, and have removed your false accusations about sock puppetry. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 21:49, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Right now, I'm inclined to delete all of this for one reason: The articles lack any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. There are lots of accusations and lots of chat-politicking, but nothing that indicates where that information came from. This suggests <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> on the part of the article writer, which is not allowed. Remove the unverified bits and you're left with... that this was an adult chat site that people used. If the author can rewrite and source the article, I'll consider keeping on the merits. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Yes, I did. One person's POV from a personal Web site is not a reliable source. From <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - "Personal websites and blogs may never be used as secondary sources. That is, they may never be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website." From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - "Personal websites and blogs are not acceptable as sources, except on the rare occasion that a well-known person, or a known professional journalist or researcher in a relevant field, has set up such a website... Subjects which have never been written about in published sources, or which have only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility should not be included in Wikipedia." <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:22, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you're never going to get a better link than that over this kind of topic. Do you want me to link to the 1,000 other places that refer to this link? I imagine that they are mostly personal web sites as well. I can't imagine this ever being in a newspaper, with this kind of thing. So I don't think that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is relevant with this kind of topic. If you dispute notoriety, sure. Would it appease you if I linked to other places that talk about or reference that web site as proven fact? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 00:04, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is *always* relevant. If you'll notice, it's an official Wikipedia policy which states that articles on topics which cannot be properly sourced should not be included in the encyclopedia. I have an issue with articles making unsourced and unsubstantiated accusations of hacking, invasion of privacy, etc. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 00:09, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just adding to this. That page was *NOT* a personal web site. It was not a homepage. It is an official business web site. I believe that these can be referenced. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 00:11, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure why <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has been brought up. The verifiability of something seems to be under challenge, but I'm not sure. If the verifiability of the site's existence is under scrutiny, then I'd say that it's pretty silly, and would question the existence of the Earth. If the verifiability of the content is under scrutiny, then I think there's a little better case, but that it's still not very good. The site's FAQ can reasonably be considered an expert source on its own content. If the verifiability of the history is under debate, then I'm fine with debating that.

</ul>
<p>Just summing that up there. 1) It is not a personal homepage - it is a business page, therefore meets the criteria for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. 2) There are no accusations being made. The word "allegedly" is used. 3) They are not unsubstantiated or unsourced, as they have been correctly referenced.</p>
<p>I think that you are either misunderstanding or misusing wikipedia policy in relation to this article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 00:13, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment: I have made the point of Alexa being relevant only when discussing web sites. This is a talker, not a web site. Most talkers do not have web sites attached, and if they do, it is only just so that you can link to the talker from there. There are a handful of talkers that did have active web sites - like Crossroads (chat site) at least used to, and there are a few others, but most simply don't. That <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> one doesn't even have a web site anymore (other than an old one which is no longer active), and a lot of them don't. If you look at old talker lists, you are talking about 1 in 3 that had their own web site, maybe 1 in 20 that actually used it as anything other than a link to their talker. Lintilla did (at least when they last updated it in 1999) have some kind of an active web site. But not anymore. That's 6 years since they last updated it. Oh and not to mention that when Lintilla was first created, there was no such thing as the <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldWideWeb_bd14.html" title="WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a> (that's how old it is). At least, it wasn't commonly available, and wasn't available where the talker was located. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 09:42, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Since Sleepy's multiple worlds, according to Alexa's rankings, is the 3rd most popular talker in the world at the moment, and that is a spin off of lintilla, I think that we have justification to keep this in some form. Alexa is generally regarded as an accurate source, and we can firmly establish that sleepy's was definitely a spin off of lintilla, henceforth this must remain in some form. There may be some debate however about whether it needs to exist as a page in its own right. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 15:40, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zocky, "guided evolution" is arguably Intelligent Design. "Unguided evolution" is simply evolution. That's why its a POV fork. A Google of evolution + guided + unguided - did you look at the returns? They were all, or very nearly all (I didn't follow *every* link returned) about the difference of Intelligent design and Evolution. We already have those articles. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 16:46, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is merit in the argument that a sane person who accepts that evolution is a real phenomenonon does not necessarily have to accept that it is <i>impossible</i> for some intelligent being to have tampered with it. In that light, believing in unguided evolution is a stronger version of believing in evolution. But that sort of info belongs in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Rather, I see this as a dicdef++ article, like we have for many terms. There seems to be enough to write about the usage and meaning in different contexts. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 18:16, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> And I wasn't going to say anything before, but this comment pushes me over. It's really freaking disturbing to see an admin make these kind of comments. Wikipedia founding principles do not say "admins get to push their own POV into any articles they want and threaten other editors when they complain".

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thoroughly agreed with DreamGuy. Ed's conduct here is far, far beyond what is acceptable from a Wikipedia administrator.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Concur with DreamGuy also. Ed cannot seem to maintain neutrality or remain reasonable regarding evolution. I agree that he should recuse himself from this subject, and possibly create a website elsewhere if he feels his POV must be heard.

<p>As admirable as the idea of such a list is, it is very difficult, especially for a free encyclopaedia such as Wikipedia, to maintain such a list with accuracy. When even A-list Hollywood stars like Sharon Stone have been known to lie about their Mensa membership, the claims of others such as Asia Carrera are difficult to believe reliably (especially as the latter claims an above and beyond IQ of 156!).</p>

<dd>Welcome to the Wikipedia! Your recent edits are looking good to me, I might try to help out a bit too. "Statistical literacy" gets ~43,000 hits on google, so I think as long as the page comes more into line with standard pages it should be kept. Take a look at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> for some examples of "top quality" pages. You can also look at <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">Wikipedia:How to edit a page</a> for tips on editing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject of the article is important and encyclopaedic enough, in my opinion.

<li><b>Keep</b> unqualified. It was popularised by songs such as "Wassup" which was a number 1 hit just 3 years ago in 2002.

<li>The article gives the (unproven) usage, (speculative) etymology, and meaning of a word. Despite the above claim to the contrary, it is a canonical dictionary article (albeit one that lacks proper citations and various other elements of a complete dictionary article), and is not an encyclopaedia article at all. Contrast this with <a href="../../../l/o/l/LOL_%28Internet_slang%29_6e70.html" title="LOL (Internet slang)">LOL (Internet slang)</a> which deals with Internet laughter slang and people's opinions about its use, and leaves etymologies, meanings, pronunciations, translations, and synonyms of words to Wiktionary. The only person/place/concept/event/thing for an encyclopaedia article by this title to be about is <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>, which we already have an article on.

<li>I've added in the Carter Poland one. Can you find verifiable links for the others? BTW it is very hard to find Democratic POTUS gaffes apart from Carter's! I've tried to find any. It seems that recent Republican presidents where gaffoholics, whereas the Democrats don't seem to be. (Clinton's "I did not have sex . . . " was neither a gaffe nor a faux pas but a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-denial_denial.html" title="Non-denial denial">Non-denial denial</a> so is irrelevant here (Its on the NDD page.) It would be interesting to compare the educational standards of recent Republican versus Democratic presidents. Looking at Kennedy, Carter and Clinton all three, in terms of academic attainment or measurable intellectual ability were better than either of the Bushes, Reagan or Nixon. That doesn't mean better presidents, but intellectually more able, which may explain their lack of a gaffe-history. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Fear√âIREANN</a> 05:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As per my remarks below, I have to disagree. Most of the list contents are taken widely out of context , framed to mislead, or sarcastically misconstrue the meaning of gaffe (sickness, as pointed out by <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a>, is not a gaffe even if it causes a diplomatic incident). Few have gone down in history as such, because they mostly relate to Bush, and history has yet to render judgement. They also betray a severe lack of knowledge of Presidential history. Harrison, the oldest President until Reagan, delivered his inaugural address on a cool March day without an overcoat (like many Presidents before and since).[<a href="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/whharrison1841.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/whharrison1841.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>] News reports at the time described the weather as mild, not requiring an overcoat, and did not consider Harrison‚Äôs removal of coat and hat to be a gaffe. Cause and effect with his death can not be established, although Harrison could be accused of bad judgement given his age. Kennedy, the youngest elected President, famously delivered his inaugural without an overcoat on a bitterly cold day in February.[<a href="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/jfkennedy1961.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/chronology/jfkennedy1961.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>] This was also not considered a faux pas. Instead, by the logic of this list, Kennedy‚Äôs major gaffe did not come until Nov 22, 1963, when he ruined his wife‚Äôs dress by spraying brain matter on it. By the same token, Lincoln committed an unforgivable faux pas, when he spoiled the performance of <i><a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_American_Cousin_1e1c.html" title="Our American Cousin">Our American Cousin</a></i> at the Ford Theatre, due to his urgent need to die across the street. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:51, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> perfectly valid article on a real topic, which was outrageously deleted without a vote first time around. It just needs clear definition. It should cover gaffes, as in unintentional comments or actions which caused embarrassment or defence. Clinton's denial of having sex "with that woman", for example, was not a gaffe. (It was a <i>Non-denial denial</i> which we already cover on WP.) It was deliberate. Carter's slip up with names, Bush's verbal slip-ups, etc do qualify as gaffes (unintentional and caused embarrassment). The mistranslation of Carter's comments when visiting Poland, though hilarous, does not belong here, as he was the not the author of the gaffe. It belongs in a page about translation gaffes.

Bush's comments date from Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2002, at which point the Dow was down roughly 17% YTD. It rose in the next three sessions, ending with a near 200 point gain on the week, and closed out the year down an insignificant 30 points from the date of Bush's remark. The dow then went on to gain 25% in 2003.[<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI&amp;a=00&amp;b=01&amp;c=2002&amp;d=11&amp;e=31&amp;f=2003&amp;g=m" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI&amp;a=00&amp;b=01&amp;c=2002&amp;d=11&amp;e=31&amp;f=2003&amp;g=m" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>]. It could thus be argued that Bush's "bumping along" gained trillions for the US economy, but in fact there was no real impact, as the markets, unlike blogs, do not react hysterically to non-gaffes. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:43, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

Who really cares whether Bush sr. puked on a PM or Carter wants to have intimate relations with the entire?!? Polish people except anti Bush or anti Carter people? If there's a really noteworthy gaffe then include it in said president's article. If it is just a partisan thing then spend your time more useful and write an article worthy of an encyclopedia.

The article is just gonna be used for attacks on Islam . People who want this article are well known for this non-sense . When there is a whole big section on Islam &amp; fachism , there is no point of starting a new article on it . Bush uses a lot of terms , like the famous "we are on a crusade" , or the "operation shock &amp; awe" , that is now changed to "operation enduring freedom". But is bush running this site?? Furthermore why isnt there any separate article on christianfascism or hindufascism . And most important , Americanfascism . The information black outs ( &amp; the media that calls itself free &amp; unbiased ), attacks on countries without UN permission , "either you are with us or against us", pre-emptive strike doctrine ....isnt all this fascism . Same standards should be followed for every article . This POV pushing is the kind of thing because of which no person would use Wp for serious research .

<dd>Bigotry, Hate speech, and Systemic bias are all things that aren't too good. However, being that Islamofascism is a word that is widely used today, my position on this article is that it should be kept and we should discuss exactly <i>who</i> uses the term, <i>why</i> they use the term and <i>when</i> the term is used.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate that you know I don't support the use of such a term. However, imagine you are an ordinary Australian who knows nothing about Islam and all of a sudden you are confronted with such a term in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>. You think to yourself, "I wonder what this is all about?". The average Australian would normally go to Google and do a search on it.</dd>
<dd>What do you want them to find? A conservative blogger who pushes their illegitimate POV in a convincing way (and doesn't point out the counter argument for why it isn't a valid term), or the piece on Wikipedia that details, in a neutral fashion, all sides of the argument?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>...not because I believe Islam is inherently fascist (despite my several objections to Islam), but because the term "Islamofascism" has gained rather widespread currency (for reasons that should be and are covered in the article)... I appreciate that the continued nominations for deletion of this article are brought by muslims who feel insulted by the expansiveness of the article, but I am bound by WP policies regarding notability, to vote to retain the article, keeping in mind that its existence is due to the <i>extensive</i> amount of usage of the term which led to its initial spinning off from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a> (which were beginning to inappropriately imbalance that article)... Wishing a phenomenon would go away by repetitively requesting deletion of the article addressing it on Wikipedia is counterproductive (and I think I speak for the vast majority here)...what Muslim Wikipedians and their fellow coreligionists who object to the term and its incumbent castigation of Islam should <i>instead</i> be working on, is cleaning up the well-sourced shortcomings of the Muslim community in addressing and fighting the phenomena the term circumscribes. You don't like the fact that people distrust and mistrust Islam and Muslims? Great. I have no fight with you. Don't cry "foul" tho, just because you disagree with the people against whom the charges are levied. Instead, do something to build up confidence in those who see an enemy in Islam. Don't piss and moan about "anti-Islam" sentiment, when you do nothing to fight against the stupidity carried out in the name of what you believe is a great religion. If you expect people to accord your position any respect, stand up for what you believe are the GOOD points of your religion, instead of fighting blindly against anyone who dares to malign it based on the manifold shortcomings of so many of its claimed adherents.

The text section on the page <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> has 1336 words (with commented out sections counted). The claim above, therefore, does not make a lot of sense. Most of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> page simply repeats what is already on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> primarily consists of quotes. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> also has a discussion of the concept both in the Islam section and the general section that includes cites to scholars.

<dd>Just to chime in here: there are <i>several</i> issues of neutrality in the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html#Islam" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism_and_religion#Islam</a> section: it's full of weasel words, unsourced claims and peacock terms (why are we arguing for or against a particular POV through the use of persuasive language?).

<dd>Well, the reason <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> resembles a cut-and-paste job is that we've sourced nearly every sentence in order to discourage OR and POV warring. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> has more unsourced musing, so it flows more nicely but is more vulnerable to POV warriors who want to charge in with a thorough rewrite. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:51, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Brandon, there are also more articles exploring Israeli shortcomings than there are articles exploring the shortcomings of any Arab or Muslim country. So imbalances go both ways. Wikipedia reflects the interests of its contributors. We can't force Wikipedians to be equally interested in everything, and we can't enforce an "equally offensive to each community" policy. We require a certain minimum of notability, and an NPOV approach. That's served Wikipedia pretty well, and I can't think of a better alternative. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:14, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've said this from the very beginning, Brandon. You've wanted to paint me as some kind of anti-Islam partisan, but I've insisted all along that notable terms are notable, no matter whose cockles they get up. Jewish cockles or Christian cockles or Hindu cockles or atheist cockles have no more bearing on notability than Muslim cockles. I've never heard the term "Zionazi" used, and it certainly doesn't have the currency that "Islamofascism" has attained, but based on the citations you gave above it looks like it probably is notable enough for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:32, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. When I start seeing Zionazi in the general press as much as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is, I'll vote for an article.

<dd>Don't know anything about Unitarian Jihad, but where do you get off saying GNAA doesn't meet standards of notability? GNAA has loads of mentions in mainstream press.

<dd>You misunderstand.

<dd>Yes, I think a topic can be less notable than "Islamofascism" and still be notable. If Yasser Arafat owned a book titled "Zionazism" that probably establishes notability for me right there.

<p>Sorry no change to my vote, I would vote to keep an article intitled Zionazi. Like Islamofacism it is a largly contentless confusion but that doesn't change the fact that in the non-perfect world we live in people talk nonsense. One of the reasons that we don't have an article for Zionazi is that we most of us live in England or America and thus focus on our idiot leaders rather then the idoit leaders of the Arab world and the propaganda they use to controll their population. By having articles on these phrazes wikipedia can infact play the positive role of exposing their vacuousness. --<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 09:02, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The unknown person was me, forgot to sign the comment. And your twisting my words. I dont mean that whatever-level-of-notability Islamofascism is should be where the line is drawn. I mean that IF Zionazism was as widely used as Islamofascism, I would without hesitation vote to keep it. However, if you want an ancedote, I saw 'Islamofascism' mentioned in an article in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">the Economist</a>, undoubtedly a mainstream news source, today.

<dd>You see my point, though. Determining notability based on what you personally happen to have come across in a newspaper is not the way to figure out which articles to keep and which to delete.

<li><b>Keep, and keep (term) in the title.</b> "Islamofascism" is indeed a widely used term; however, it is itself a POV term (and IMHO, a misleading one), and so there is good reason to be wary of simply titling an article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, since that implies that such a beast exists, and that that's what the article is about. In practical terms, putting/keeping all of the material in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> in the Islam section of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> makes the latter article too long and overly tipped against Islam. Much of that material should be broken out into its own article, which on any other, less controversial topic, would be titled in a way that follows logically from the parent article. However, in this case, most of the material in that section doesn't concern any actual connection between neofascist movements and Islam or Islamism, but the characterization of Islamism and jihadism as totalitarian, and therefore fascistic, by its opponents. This vilification is real, it is prominent in the English-speaking world, and it needs to be confronted and discussed. There is no better way to do it than in the existing article. No matter what happens, any surviving article must stay NPOV, and should continue to focus on the term itself (as does <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">this article</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">this one</a>), rather than the phenomenon it purports to describe.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I understand the impulse to want to keep this pejorative, misleading, POV term out of Wikipedia entirely. We must not permit Wikipedia to become a vehicle for the partisans who employ such terms to advance their propaganda aims. However, something still needs to be said about the term, including its origins and context, and if Wikipedia doesn't say it, who will? Like <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">Dominionism</a>, this should not be a word simply left to incubate and strengthen itself within partisan echo-chambers indefinitely. And for the record, I would also support keeping a Zionazism (term) article around, as long as that "(term)" part stays in the title, and the article itself can be kept NPOV and focused on the term itself and not what it supposedly describes. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoosh_95d4.html" title="User:Skoosh">skoosh</a> [[User_talk:Skoosh|(h√°blame)]] 14:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So long after this creation of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_the_Philippines_by_other_sources_09a7.html" title="Demographics of the Philippines by other sources">Demographics of the Philippines by other sources</a>, it still doesn't cite sources becuase there are no sources that corroborate the misinformation. That's why it had to be taken out of the main article. It's was created on the presmise of considering other "claims" made regarding the racial make up of Filipinos. However, should the article not have be based on whether any of those "claims" could actually be substansiated by any shred of evidence, other than wishful thinking? All sources attest that the demographic reality of the Philippines is another one, not the one presented on this article. As it is, it's amazing that this article has had such a long life. <b><a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> 20:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</b>.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of my rare keep votes for an music-related afd. This "collective" or whatever you call it is mentioned in <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=pitchforkmedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=pitchforkmedia.com" rel="nofollow">popular</a> music media such as <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitchfork_Media_a115.html" title="Pitchfork Media">Pitchfork Media</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">Jasmol</a> 16:56, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> The fact that an atist who used to produce under a "banner" "moved on to more high profile releases" does not make the lower profile bannerthey used to produce under notable. Nor does said artists getting written up for other work in major publications. Mere mention in popular music media isn't enough either; it must be "prominently featured." The movement/collective was talked about quite a bit in the <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/blithe-sons/arm-of-the-starfish.shtml" class="external text" title="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/blithe-sons/arm-of-the-starfish.shtml" rel="nofollow">review</a> of The Blithe Sons: Arm of the Starfish on Pitchfork. While establishing the presence of the Jewelled Antler collective, it does not feature it as the review is about an album by another group, albeitt comprised of Jewelled Antler members, and released under another label. That said, rereading the article, I find that it is neither "a musician or ensemble" as its changing membership and loose organization make it more of a genre than a band. I can't say that I feel it is notable, but <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a> simply doesn't apply to it. I withdraw my nomination. --<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> 04:06, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I found this page while searching on wikipedia for information about young politicians. It was useful to me, so I'd say leave it up.

<li>A look at the talk page suggests that the nominator did not intend to nominate this page for deletion. On the other hand, I will. This page is about a young Republican who ran for a state seat in Vermont and was unsuccessful. While being President of your local College Republican branch and unsuccessful candidate for the legislature shows that she is a political hopeful, at this stage she hasn't moved beyond that. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:55, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

What would I need to do to keep this on Wikipedia? This is info I need to get out, and simply having websites just ain't cutting it. It needs to be known, so I can really get this stuff off the ground.</p>
<p><br />
Ok, here is the whole story as far as I can figure it out, as I originally posted at the Central Galactic Union article - at the message board Spacebattles there is a roleplaying tradition in which the original author of this article participated in. He created the "Central Galactic Union" solely for gaming purposes, and specifically for the purposes of this roleplay tradition. Note that this roleplay tradition does not extend beyond the confines of Spacebattles.com. While this entry is encyclopedic for Spacebattles.com, it's barely so even then and hardly encyclopedic for Wikipedia. I'm going to reserve judgement and leave that to the moderators and popular opinion; I just wanted to deliver the background as best as I can figure. If there are any inaccuracies or incompletions, I invite those more knowledgable than me to comment. Hapsburg, if that above comment is from you, what you need to do to justify this staying on Wikipedia is to adapt it to an original universe of your creation, write it in novelized form and get it published. It's a lot of work but it's worth it - User:24.9.10.235</p>
<p>1. WE at PyroPics thought of the CGuverse long before I joined SB. 2. Well, don't all SciFi's borrow concepts, ideas, etc. from other sci-fi's as well as from history? Especially since the CGUverse is an allegorical tale. 3. Well, can you at least keep this on here for the time being? It took a damn long time to write this, and a damn long time to write the story. We have entered it in a writing contest, and are working on getting it published. This is close enough to at least keep the article open, so that people can learn about the CGU-verse while we get it into the public. Besides, I have written this pretty much neutrally, as the NPOV rules state.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We would advise you to develop your concept and promote it, <i>through appropriate channels</i>. Do what you can to get your story released by a major publishing house and noticed by the mainstream science-fiction media. By the time your book has received media attention and sold maybe a few hundred thousand copies, it will definitely be ready for an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 01:34, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Andrew, I couldn't have said it better myself. Thank you for your input. To direct my attention back to Hapsburg, as I have said in the main article, and as I have said back at Spacebattles, <b>get it published.</b> It's a lot of work but it's very much worth it. I would also like to note that, like you, I have invested a lot of time and effort creating a universe for another roleplay, and that I'm currently working on getting it adapted into novel form for publication. There's no guarantee that it will be successful or even published, but I'm willing to expend the effort. Believe me, it's much more productive than trying to get noteriety though Wikipedia <i>first</i> - User:24.9.10.235</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And one more important point, Hapsburg - <b>sign your comments</b> thusly: [ [User: YourIPAddressHere] ] (no spaces in between the brackets) Unsigned comments are considered lacking of respect here, and you're already in hot water in the eyes of this community for creating this article in the first place User:24.9.10.235</p>

<p>Another spacebattler here. Delete this article. To Hapsburg: are you trying to get banned from every site you go to? This is not a suitable Wikipedia article, maybe if you posted it on Uncyclopedia it could fit more there... Maybe. There's no real content, as has been stated previously. He was criticized for spamming this CGU on Spacebattles and now, for some reason, he's brought it to wikipedia.</p>
<p>And yes, this CGU 'borrows' from established universes. And by borrow, I mean he plagiarizes and steals, everything from other people's art to ship designs (and names) from various TV series (in particular, Babylon 5). Delete this article. And, Hapsburg, if you're worried about it getting deleted here's a hint: Use Microsoft Word or a free website. Don't clog up wikipedia with your CGU. If you are serious about publishing this, then get some original designs and ideas for once. Don't steal everything. kthxbye. User: Lord Azrael</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as respectfully as such a vote can be made. To the writer, you've obviously put some time into this project.

<p>Well, how can I sign my name with a user thing when I'm not a user on wikipedia? Or if I don't know my IP #? I didn't steal anything, and I have no idea what you are talking about, Azrael. All of the names for ships were thought up by Weston, he also made pretty much all of the art for it. At least, that is what he told me, and I wouldn't be a friend if I did not trust him on that. All of the character names are things we thought of, so what are you talking about? I've never seen Babylon 5, what is it? As for what some of ya'll called "innaccuracies"...well, I did what ya'll told me to do, and changed the stuff on it, and I did, and ya'll are still complaining.

<p>I'm not promoting myself, I'm putting information that the public needs to know into the publicness, as one onf my friends at school suggested.</p>
<p><br />
As I have said in the other entries (in addition on how to find your own IP address), I have good reason to believe your friend Weston is a lying cheat and thief, and is flat-out using you for the self-promotion of his <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanwank.html" title="Fanwank">fanwank</a>. Dump him.</p>
<p>And no, the public does <b>not</b> need to know about the CGU-verse just because your asshat friend suggested it. - User: 24.9.10.235</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to finally cast my vote on this article - as with the main article, I vote to <b>KEEP, but with conditions</b> - this article should be removed from the main site but still accessible somewhere to the public in its entirety (particularly all discussion pages) to serve as an example and teaching aid for future Wikipedia article construction. - User: 24.9.10.235
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a hosting service. Unclear what you mean by 'not on main site but accessible'. If the wikipedia help and guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are unclear then they should be updated. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 00:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again I think you misunderstand me - at least keep the discussion pages archived so that future authors may understand the consequences of creating articles like these. There's a lot of issues covered under here other than the whole encyclopedic/original research issue - copyrights, for one. I think that by having an example (at least in the form of these preserved discussion pages) future authors will better understand what constitutes a good Wikipedia by understand what constitutes a <i>bad</i> article. User: 24.9.10.235</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why is it a bad article? I followed the main guidelines: NPOV, etc, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, man, where else can I put this much info on the CGU-verse in this manner? No where else, that's why I like wikipeda: it's unique in how the information is done. -Alex, Confederate.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can put all this information on your MSN group, or a website, but not on wikipedia. Wikipedia is not the place to list insignificent personal universes. It is unpublished, not very well known content. Orion's Arm, Babylon 5, Star Trek, all of those universes are much, much more well known then the CGU, hence why they can be found in wikipedia. User:Lord Azrael.</li>
<li>And Alex illustrates maybe <i>why</i> at least these discussion pages should be preserved and archived (including my article in the discussion section of the Central Galactic Union article concerning the proper origin of the images). - User: 24.9.10.235
<ul>
<li>I think these pages are archived even if the main pages are deleted (should that be a delete vote then?). But rather than being a example, the documentation should be improved and clarified. Alex asks why it is a bad article: because (as in the first line of this page, and i agree) is not notable, see <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. <i>where else can I put this much info on the CGU-verse in this manner?</i> Maybe on a <a href="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" class="external text" title="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a> if you like this format? There's a science fiction section I think. (I don't know much about them). 24.9 please explain what you mean by 'why this should be preserved'? Why does it belong on Wikipedia? That's the whole question here.. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 07:37, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying it should be on Wikipedia at all - in fact, I agree with the consensus that it doesn't belong here. However, I feel that some lesson from this should be preserved in some form and presented to those creating new articles (<b>not</b> the general public searching for articles) so that some lesson can be learned here. And I do believe there are a lot of lessons to be learned here that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> does not adequetely cover - User: 24.9.10.235</li>
<li>If the consensus is to delete the article under discussion as original research (which the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CGU-verse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29097044" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CGU-verse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29097044" rel="nofollow">has admitted</a> it to be), then the article and its talk page will be deleted, and this discussion page will remain as a historical archive of the deletion discussion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:25, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait, wait, so, you're telling me that I can put all of this information down on this "wikicities", and it won't get deleted because of its obscurity? Why didn't you guys tell me about this in the first place? -Alex, Confederate.
<ul>
<li>Alex, You need to read their documentation and see if it is a good fit. All I know is that they use the same software as Wikipedia, and they have existing projects or let you propose a new project yourself. I mentioned it because you said you liked this format. If you have your own web host, you can even run this software <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaWiki_8838.html" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> on your own account and do whatever you want with it. In summary, I'm not saying that it <i>won't get deleted there</i>, I'm just saying that if it is not suitable for an encyclopedia, perhaps there is another project elsewhere that it is a good fit for. Check into it.. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 18:26, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alex, I wouldn't just jump headlong into Wikicities and just start up an article there - that's what got you into this mess in the first place. Like what Srl said, read over things <b>carefully</b> - and you might end up being better off creating a separate page and maybe using the MediaWiki software anyway.

<p>Please, stop using yankee as an insult. You are an American, are you not? I believe you stated that you were. Also, not everyone here is American, for instance, I am Australian. Using 'yankee' as an insult makes you look like a moron. User:Lord Azrael</p>
<p>By "yankee", I meant "northerner". Sorry if I thing against them, and I am sorry if I assume that a lot people on an international english-language website are from the US. But, my point was: why would you want me to not get screwed over if you hate me? -Alex, <b>Confederate</b>.</p>

<p>Just because it is obscure doesn't mean it does not exist, you know. There are many obscure scifi verse linked to on this wikipedia. Besides, this is an enclyclopedia, correct? This is info on the CGU universe that needs to be made public.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this is an encyclopedia. That means it is a repository of information that is <i>already public knowledge</i>. It is not an appropriate place for making previously-unknown knowledge public.

<p>But it needs to be made public. What would I have to do to keep this page on this site, because I need this info to get to the public eyes.</p>
<p><br />
Ok, here is the whole story as far as I can figure it out - at the message board Spacebattles there is a roleplaying tradition in which the original author of this article participated in. He created the "Central Galactic Union" solely for gaming purposes, and specifically for the purposes of this roleplay tradition. <b>Note that this roleplay tradition does not extend beyond the confines of Spacebattles.com.</b> While this entry is encyclopedic for Spacebattles.com, it's barely so even then and hardly encyclopedic for Wikipedia. I'm going to reserve judgement and leave that to the moderators and popular opinion; I just wanted to deliver the background as best as I can figure. If there are any inaccuracies or incompletions, I invite those more knowledgable than me to comment - User:24.9.10.235</p>
<p><br />
I have also been informed that furthermore this universe is unoriginal and largely "borrows" from other established, published universes - User:24.9.190.235</p>
<p>No, that is not what happened. It is original, though we used some concepts from history and other scifis, don't all science ficitons? Anyway, we at Pyro Pictures created this story long before I join SB.com and posted it for a VS debate. It was, and remains, a story which we will make into a movie. P.S- Who keeps vandalizing the article. just because it is being debated for deletion doesn't mean it should be vandalized.</p>
<p>Actually, on the Spacebattles site, the writer of this was ruthlessly critisized for the universe and its inaccuracies. He didn't create it solely for gaming purposes, he created it before he registered there.</p>
<p>...And yes, I say Delete. No real content or meaning. Or Hapsie, host it on Geocities. It's easier than annoying us. User: MJ12 Commando</p>
<p><br />
Hapsburg, it's bad enough when you annoy us but it's downright disgraceful when you're annoying the Wikipedia community. One small step you can do yourself to decrease that level of annoyance is by <b>signing your comments.</b> Signing your comments shows the Wikipedia community-at-large which comments are yours and is a mark of courtesy - and it's fun, fast, and easy to do! All you have to do (in the case when you don't have a Wikipedia account) is copy &amp; paste your IP number around double-brackets thusly: [ [User:YourIPAddressInHere] ] (no spaces in between the brackets). At least this way, you would show <i>some</i> respect for the community here - User: 24.9.190.235</p>

<p><b>Delete.</b> It's not only unpublished personal fiction but also very poorly written. --WyldStallionRyder 06:00, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another spacebattler here. Delete this article. To Hapsburg: are you trying to get banned from every site you go to? This is not a suitable Wikipedia article, maybe if you posted it on Uncyclopedia it could fit more there... Maybe. There's no real content, as has been stated previously. He was criticized for spamming this CGU on Spacebattles and now, for some reason, he's brought it to wikipedia.</p>
<p>And yes, this CGU 'borrows' from established universes. And by borrow, I mean he plagiarizes and steals, everything from other people's art to ship designs (and names) from various TV series (in particular, Babylon 5), he was caught out on SB for art theft for one.

In regards to the art thing, this is why you need to <i>verify</i> the source of your art. Your friend Weston is being lazy, dishonest, and downright a theif. In fact, I would strongly advise verifying every bit of information regarding the CGU-verse they send you, image or print, for plagirism. If nothing else ask around and maybe someone will catch onto whether it's original or not.</p>
<p>In fact I recommend maybe breaking away from your little group of friends alltogether. From the sounds of things they're lazy theives who are using you for their own ends, and not too scrupulous as to how they'r pushing their "CGU-Verse" agenda, either.</p>
<p>And finally, you can do what I do and simply look in the "history" section of the page and look up your IP and just go back and copy &amp; paste it in here. - User: 24.9.190.235</p>
<ul>
<li>Thier agenda? Oh, no, I'm the one who initially thought of the CGUverse, weston helped me find images, as well as aiding in plot development. I don't where he got them, and I don't really care if they are stolen. I was just clarifying that I didn't find them, he did. Now, as for verifying it, I don't know how I could go about doing that, but I guess I could just redesign some of the stuff, eh.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the IP signing thing...thanks, but I prefer signing like so, as it more accurately portrays me, as I am not just a number, I am a person. -Alex, Confederate.</p>
<p><br />
First of all you <i>should</i> care if they're stolen - it's called <b><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagirism.html" title="Plagirism">plagirism</a></b> and it happens to be a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statutory.html" title="Statutory">statutory</a> crime. And if you really are as serious as the depth and detail of this article being debated makes it out to be, you should care anyway for the sake of your own work and creative property. As for veryifying it, you should make at least some effort to do so - doing web searches is at least a very basic way of going about it. And finally, sign in with your IP address anyway, because as you may be finding out someone is at least going around signing it in for you anyway, and at least if you were to do it yourself you'd gain back a modicum of respect - User: 24.9.10.235</p>

<p>Yankee laws, not my laws. Anyway, I don't what the images originally were called. When weston emailed them to me, he renamed them. I can't really do a google search on the original image if I don't know what the original image was called, now can I? -Alex <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.220.157.93 (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.220.157.93.html" title="User talk:12.220.157.93">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.220.157.93_fd7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.220.157.93">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Wrong. They are your laws. England, Australia, America, they all have the same laws regarding plagiarism. His MSN group is located in the article, and, if you browse to the images you shall find the following images, I've got what he calls them, the true name of them (in brackets) and what verse they are from. These are only the ones I recognize: Aries class Space interceptor (Aurora class Starfury) Babylon 5 Aurora class Multipurpose starfighter (thunderbolt class starfury) Babylon 5 Tigershark class (some kind of Star Wars fighter) Nova-class Battleship (nova class Dreadnaught) Babylon 5 Gawain class Starbattlecruiser (Sulaco) Aliens</p>
<p>Those are the ones I recognize, and there are maybe 3 that are probably created by them. Frankly, it's for your own good. If you're serious about getting this published then you should not take things from well known sci-fi series, claim them as your own and think no one will notice.

Some of the filenames can be run through google image search to produce result. Note: Hapsburg, if you seriously believe that this 'Weston' is capable of the various forms of CGI seen in there, plus the sketching then you're a bit deluded. Also, Alex, Hapsburg, Weston, whoever you are, here is a link to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> it's a popular sci-fi series.

<p>I've checked through the MSN Group and here's what I've been able to conclude:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>After further reviewing things, particularly the short article I just wrote on the main discussion page, I feel I need to throw in my as yet uncaset vote:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP, but with conditions</b> - Yes, that's right, I believe this article should stay on Wikipedia - but not in its current form. I believe this article, the other disputed articles, and in particular the discussion pages for all articles (not just the VFD discussions but the disucssions regarding the main pages themselves) should be kept and archived somewhere off the main site, but still accessable to the public, to serve as an example of what <i>not</i> to do on Wikipedia, what does <i>not</i> constitute an article and the issues surrounding plagirism and Wikipedia. I believe these articles, and their discussion pages, will serve as a valuable teaching aid for guidance of future article construction. I would like to hear what you guys think of this idea - User: 24.9.10.235

<li>If the content is not encyclopedic it doesn't belong here. That is what the AfD here is about. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 00:32, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You miss my point - it should be archived or stashed away somewhere so that, while out of view of the general public, it can be still be seen by those wishing to create new articles to see an example of what <i>not</i> to do. At the very least keep the discussion pages - User: 24.9.10.235
<ul>
<li>Hm, then it would be moved to Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not/Examples (say).. 24.9.10.235 - do you think that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't adequately cover this situation?

<p>As for the ones I did go back and redo: well, I'm not good at computer drawing, especially when I only have MS paint, and its somewhat limited options. On paper, I can draw fairly well, but I don't have a scanner. -Alex, Confederate. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.220.157.93 (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.220.157.93.html" title="User talk:12.220.157.93">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.220.157.93_fd7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.220.157.93">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>And since the talk page is going to be deleted when this article is deleted, should I copy &amp; paste my section about the unoriginal and stolen works here then? User: 24.9.10.235</p>

<li>24.9 (if I can call you that)- Yes, that seems germane to the afd.

<p>A major point of this article in contention is the original and validity of unoriginal and original artwork used for visual support of the Central Galactic Union. The original author of this article maintains an MSN Group<a href="http://groups.msn.com/PyroPicturesInc-/shoebox.msnw" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.msn.com/PyroPicturesInc-/shoebox.msnw" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> that contains all artwork concerning the CGU. For those parties interested, here's an entire list of what I've been able to determine to be unoriginal artwork, modified unoriginal artwork and original artwork:</p>
<p><b>NOTE that the reason why I am doing this is so that, hopefully, the originators of these artworks may be able to step up and lay rightful claim to them, and to further answer the question as to the validity of the artwork in question and validate any original artwork suspected to be unoriginal, and to clear up questions regarding the true origin of any unoriginal artwork. I do this NOT to slander the originator of this Wikipedia article in question, or Pyro Pictures Inc.</b></p>

<li>What the hell am I supposed to do, then? Those are the things that resemble most closely what we wanted the Zaaroft ships to look like. Also, not everything on there is 'stolen', as you call it. Weston knows some people who are artists, and some of those things on there are from that guy, such as the Shocktroop and Heavy Shocktroop pics.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Alex, Confederate.</p>
<ul>
<li>No offence, but Weston has no credibility. Just because you found something that looks like what you envisioned doesn't mean you can just take it. It'd be like me coming along, taking all your CGU stuff, renaming it and claiming it was mine because it was on my website, don't you see a problem with that at all? And doubt Weston knows any artists, atleast ones who can draw and CGI as professionaly as shown in the above pictures.</li>

<p>That looks like a Hydran warship from Star Trek to me, the game Starfleet Command. It has the same blue hull, purple glowing narcelles and same T kind of shape.</p>
<p>User:Lord Azrael</p>
<p><br />
No, I've met the person he was talking about. And, I didn't say the guy drew the CGI stuff, I said the "Shocktroop pic and the Heavy Shocktroop pic". Now, if I could draw something like that CGI thing, I would, and do something somewhat different, but I don't know how to draw CGI 3D stuff, nor do I have a program to do so on. All I have is MS Paint. -Alex, <b>Confederate</b>.</p>

<p>Again, just because it is smaller than other scifis doesn't mean people don't care. It isn't nonsense, we authors did a lot of research and development for the CGU storyline, and we've worked for two years on the basics. Just because it is obscure doesn't mean it doesn't exist at all. the reason the stories aren't published YET is because PyroPics can't find any good publishers.</p>

<p>This article has been redirected and unredirected for a while now and I think it's best that we have it out here on AfD. The problem with this article is that it again represents original research of <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed Poor</a> and continues to <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">WP:FORK</a> both the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialism.html" title="Materialism">materialism</a> article. I'm not confident that such a subject actually exists except in the mind of creationists. While I thought that a redirect to materialism worked, I'm now inclined to say the page should be deleted outright because evolutionary materialism is a neologism and an inappropriate qualification for materialism. After all, we don't have people that are "plate tectonics materialists" or "solar nebula realists" or "faraday's law materialists" -- how can there be another paradigm from science "evolution" that has its own separate materialism? I submit that such a thing doesn't exist and so pursuant to the rules of forks an original research, this article should go. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 18:22, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term is in use and is even in the titles of chapters of a book, <i>Social Transformations</i> (Stephen K. Sanderson, 1999, New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing.) "Original research" clause is inapplicable, since the article does not state any theories; it merely makes a definition and lists a couple of facts. Unlike "solar nebula" and other witty picks, the issue of evolution is right in the middle of a philosophical dispute and hence a special treatment is warranted.

<dd>Yikes, that is definitely a creationist screed if I've ever read one. And here I was hoping for an actual citation to a scholar who claims to outline "evolutionary materialism" as a separate discipline. As such, since Richard Dawkins wouldn't call himself an "evolutionary materialist", I don't think Wikipedia should be endorsing it either.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I find nothing objectionable in this article. It is relevant to debates over the teaching of Evolution, and it stands as a counterpart to any article on the "guided evolution" position. It is also potentially useful in helping understand the scientific method and what science is.

<dd>I don't find anything objectionable in the article, <i>per se</i>, but I do find the omission of the fact that this term appears to mean different things in different contexts<a href="http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Lenski/other.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Lenski/other.htm" rel="nofollow">[105]</a> to be objectionable.

<li><b>comment</b> Two comments, actually: Just because there is a book with a POV fork does not make it policy on WP to have an article on that same POV fork.

<li>Re first comment:Wrong again. As long as a POV is of a notable person, you cannot delete an article. Re second: I will repeat: you are hardline deniers twisting the policy to remove what you don't like: it is only wikipedia's author's POV which is disallowed. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:41, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Re first response: The POV is of one (barely) noteable person, and is covered in his (very stubby) bio article. No one is trying to remove that from his bio. Re second response: Personal attacks are not sanctioned by WP policy, and switching from "lazy... deniers" to "hardline deniers" doesn't help much. An apology for the personal attack of calling everyone who doesn't agree with you "lazy" would be appropriate. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 16:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. I am not persuaded this is an ad, or spam. However, it is a poor article written in impenetrable management-speak, and does not explain what it's central concept, the <i>EFQM Excellence Model</i> is. If that proves to be a commercial product of some kind then this is an ad and should be deleted. Otherwise it should be deleted for lack of context and poor quality. It was created in one session by an anon IP with no other edits, so it's unlikely to be cleaned up if tagged. Maybe Wikipedia should have an article on "Excellence" in its corporate management sense, but this is not it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 21:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: There's no <i>need</i> for a list of straight people or a list of white people; those are the <b>default assumptions</b> that are <b>automatically</b> made about people in the absence of specific information to the contrary.

<dd>In the world overall, you're right, but Wikipedia does not categorize people that way. Wikipedia uses country-specific groupings such as <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a>, so minority vs. majority status is defined by one's <b>country-specific context</b>. Conversely, a list of white <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaicans</a> could potentially be valid, since they're the minority there, but there's absolutely no need for a list of white <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadians</a> since whites are the majority in Canada.

<p><strike><b>Abstain</b></strike> for now as nominator.

The only ref in the article, outside the man's own work, is a writeup in the New Yorker, which <i>might</i> be enough to establish him as notable as a social phenomenon even if not as a philosopher, but then the article should talk more about that and less about his philosophical claims. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:18, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

The news article doesn't do anything to help him here, but the 2 books cited might. If we can get ISBN numbers for those, and see if the publishers are actually reputable, that would help.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ahem...Gentlemen...We've just about had it with all this psychological warfare against genuine intellect:
<p>go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html</a> and place Fenyo, Jean-Pierre in the search box, see what that leads to. Someone a few years ago had the good sense to let Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, Philosopher become a permanent listing (or so it seemed). That particular text has found itself in over 200 World Wide Web Internet sites, mostly I-Encyclopedias, and in over a dozen languages!!! Then, lo and behold, User Trovatore, who may know quite a lot about mathematics, including Boolean Algebras (of which we know virtually nothing), notices some addendums at Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo and...like some kind of abracadabra magic...decides that this person may not even be worthy of mention. Is someone savvy at mathematics really qualified to make judgments about who is and who is not a philosopher (as opposed to a teacher of philosophy)? We think not. How about asking this of some Sociologists, Psychologists, Philosophy Professors or even some Linguists? We advocate multi-disciplinary education and research, and lament to see that very important decisions are now primarily being decided by technocrats, specialists and even mafiosi! And all this talk about "borderline"; now, seriously, just because a true and fairly wise philosopher is very likely to be an eccentric and somewhat unable to communicate in terms that most academics would prefer does not mean that she or he is borderline! So, which one of you in this debate really understands why Baruch Spinoza (1732-1766) is known to have been a great philosopher? And which one of you actually can claim to truly understand his ethics, principles, axioms, propositions and proofs?</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo has written little about Spinoza, but he does have a fairly good understanding of his views, which in some ways were a fundamental part of what we call The Enlightenment and all worthy civilization today. The point is simply this; you can delete this man's mention, but you will not delete his unique record in the annals of New York and American history, nor the odd chance that his conclusions will be proven correct and fully applicable to the improvement of the human condition. So, tread lightly on this little pond whose ice may be thin but whose waters may be very deep indeed!

<li><b>Comment.</b> I stated this in response on my <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMiketwo_a412.html#Jean-Pierre_Ady_Fenyo" title="User talk:Miketwo">Talk</a> page, but I'll say it again here: The legitimacy of Mr. Fenyo as a philosopher is <b>irrelevant</b> to the discussion of whether or not he is listed on Wikipedia. The policy of this encyclopedia is not to include any <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. Therefore, even if Mr. Fenyo is the next philosophic equivalent to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton.html" title="Newton">Newton</a> or <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, he cannot be listed until he has published in several reputable sources (news articles, peer-reviewed journals, etc...). I will keep my vote as a "Weak Keep" on the condition that these sources be found and cited.
<p>I would strongly advise against future ad hominems. We need not be philosophers in any regard to judge whether or not Mr. Fenyo has been published. Wikipedia is a place for researchers to find sources, not to explore new concepts, and while I find Mr. Fenyo's concepts very intriguing, as a loyal Wikipedian I must adhere to policy. --<font color="#1569C7"><b><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMiketwo_71f4.html" title="User:Miketwo">Michael</a></b></font> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMiketwo_a412.html" title="User talk:Miketwo"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a></p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I, Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, am published, albeit it is true that I am not a prolific author and that most of anything published about me or by me is not likely to fit your narrow definition of "reputable"... Clearly being a true philosopher in today's world it is unlikely that The American Philosophical Society will publish me (Spinoza was not peer-reviewed!!!). That I have one major work to my name, registered in 1994 with The U.S. Library of Congress is not an indication that my views have not had an impact on world events (I could prove otherwise...if it was warranted). Wikipedia bills itself as The Free Encyclopedia, and so why should it not celebrate the free spirited philosophical ideas of The Original Free Advice Man? After all, I was the very first person in the history of Manhattan and greater New York City as a whole to actually sit out in public and hold a sign that reads FREE ADVICE and engage people in deep philosophical discussions. My wife and I, and a few of my colleagues, are totally baffled by the odd manner in which this is all taking place. Oh, sure(!), we would concurr on deleting the mention of some ego-maniac with nothing relevant to say and without any real intellectual track-record or publication. So... for the time beign this is all we will say... and this business of using the qualifier "strongly advise against"...something one might expect from an unethical psychiatrist or demagogue...does not meet the high standards you claim to adhere to. I weakly advise you against trampling on the life of one whose only interest is to make the world a better, more intelligent, educated and wiser place (not just for the privileged few, the highly accredited elite, but for all people). Per me questo non mi fa molto piacere, ma io penso que oggi gli vero intelectuali sonno una minorita sensa voce al mundo.Cosa che? The Flat Earth Society deserves mention, but a real life philosopher struggling to survive in this world full of serious disconnects!!! What gives???68.48.73.93 04:12, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article in The Budapest Sun was significant because it came within days of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the WTC and Pentagon, and being the only serious English language daily in Hungary I knew my views would have an impact on ex-pats, including top U.S. government officials and military officials, as well as on any American ex-pats who might have decided to take out their hurt on relatively innocent people of Arab or Muslim (or Sikh, Bahaii, whatever..wearing turbans) background and what I said needed to be said in due time. It also let certain people know more or less where I stood on this all, since I was known for my behind-the-scene Middle East Peace activities (I was just one small part of the process that lead to the then secret Oslo Accords...my being Jewish and my mother having divorced my &amp; my brother's father and married a Pal. arab). Complicated it sounds...but my views are cleverly devised. I will be launching a media campaign for The Infinity Society within a few months...perhaps sooner.</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> In light of the new citations on here (which we should move to the article and verify at some point), I have changed my vote from "Weak Keep" to "Keep."

I recommend you post all this to the relevant debate in Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Fenyo wrote:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Wales or "Jimbo" if you so prefer,</p>
<p>First of all, allow me to qualify what I am about to say: in no way is my intention or that of any persons related to me or associated with my organization to disrespect the need for Wikipedia to adhere to the professional standards common to all encyclopedias (printed or otherwise).</p>
<p>I am a philosopher (whose mention within Wikipedia has been around for years and is now being threatened for deletion by persons who may not be sufficiently qualified to make the correct decision). This fact is attested to an verifiable by referring to the following sources:</p>
<p>1. (The earliest mention) A write-up in The New Yorker magazine of August 17, 1987 in The Talk of the Town, pages 18-19. The article clearly illustrates that I have a philosophical socratic approach to issues (personal and otherwise). The article can be found by paging down this site <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/samples/hm041/2003047837.html" class="external free" title="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/samples/hm041/2003047837.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loc.gov/catdir/samples/hm041/2003047837.html</a> . It was re-printed in Alec Wilkinson's book "Mr. Apology and other essays" (Houghton Miflin 2003).</p>
<p>2. (My book). In 1994 I was granted a copyright for my first book "Infinitism: Secret Key To The Doors of Wisdom" by the U.S. Library of Congress register of copyrights. go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html" class="external free" title="http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html</a> and search for my full name Fenyo, Jean-Pierre Ady or without Ady (my middle name). This book expresses my ideas on the penultimate practical social benefits of contemplating the infinite. A revised/expanded version was published in Hungary under the titlte "The Most Important Thought" (Silver Aleph, 2004).</p>
<p>3. My ideas gained recognition by Prof. Heylighen and his Principia Cybernetica site at <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Annotations/INFINITY.1.html" class="external free" title="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Annotations/INFINITY.1.html" rel="nofollow">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Annotations/INFINITY.1.html</a> in 1999. Principia Cybernetica speaks for itself!</p>
<p>4. MARQUI's Who's Who In The World 17th Edition (2000), also known as The Millenniun Edition, has me listed as a philosopher. (Not proof that I am a philosopher, but worthy of pointing out.)</p>
<p>5. Prof. Hernadi, Miklos of The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Book &amp; Periodical Publishing Board, Director of Public Relations, a Sociologist, wrote a letter of support in favor of the publishing of my book in which, among other noteworthy things, he states "The author has managed to bring about a highly noteworthy intellectual breakthrough. Through his analytic approach he had managed to reconcile the Eastern, non-linear concept of the infinite with the West's rational and linear expression of the infinite into one amalgam thought..." and "...the author manages to evade those typical traps that are often faced by philosophers." Prof. Hernadi may be reached for comment at priroda@office.mta.hu</p>
<p>6. More than forty articles, interviews and write-ups have been published about me since 1987 (not a lot by certain standards, but no small accomplishment for someone who was behind some major company's adoption of the word, logo (or idea of INFINITY for their product line(s) (Infiniti, SBC, Infinity Broadcasting, etc.) ). Virtually all of them recognize me as a philosopher (some are in Hungarian: Feny√µ Jean-Pierre Ady is the searchable name for some of those).</p>
<p>7. OR if need be contact Prof. Howard M. Robinson at (011-36-1) 342-2307 (both people are phonable between 0900 and 1500 GMT...to be safe...and not on major holidays). Prof. Howard Robinson's info. can be found at www.ceu.hu/phil/robinson/index, he is the Head of the Dept. of Philosophy at The Central European University in Budapest, and an epistemological researcher of the most serious kind. I am sure he will acknowledge that I am a philosopher, albeit not an accredited teacher of philosophy (no PhD. in my titles...although I did get an honorary one).</p>

<p>10. Fine...So maybe my estimation of my impact, the impact of my ideas on the world, world events, is trivial...probably so... And maybe not being recognized by formally accredited people of higher learning, PhDs in particular and those who call themselves Philosophers in specific, is grounds for my mention on Wikipedia to be deleted, but I bet you I will find thousands more who are even more worthy of deletion if we have too strict an interpretation of the rules/guidelines for inclusion.</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Here is how I think it should read:</li>
</ul>
<p>Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo (b. July 23, 1964) is an American-born philosopher and advocate of Infinitism (not the mathematical aspect but the cosmological). Fenyo was born and currently lives in Washington, D.C., and at age 23 gained his first major exposure in the press, when he was written up in The New Yorker by Alec Wilkinson, in an article titled "Answers" in The Talk of the Town section, published on August 17, 1987, (p. 18-19). This and subsequent media coverage (both television and print) brought him minor fame and recognition as "The Original New York City Free Advice Man", offering socratic dialogue and advice to passersby. From his early childhood on he travelled, mostly with his parents, throughout four continents, visiting some sixty countries and residing in eight (including Great Britain, Spain, and his father‚Äôs native Hungary). This experience afforded him a very liberal and yet worldly education which is reflected in the fact that he is fluent in several languages and has a significant understanding of world cultures and international affairs. And it was his experiences gained while living in Beirut, Lebanon for two years, his 12th and 13th, that contrasted so sharply with his liberal American and European upbringing and life before and after. Given his Jewish roots (he speaks of himself as being a scientifically m minded spiritual Jew) and the fact that his father was a researcher at The National Archives in the mid-60s involved in documenting NAZI atrocities and The Holocaust as well as World War Two in general (Prof. Mario Denis Fenyo, Historian), the extent and degree of his concern for the future security and intellectual welfare of humanity, minorities and individuals is well beyond average. His more creative side flourished throughout the 1980s, whilst living in New York City (mainly in Manhattan) and being, among other things, a poet, short-fiction writer, journalist, and even for a brief time a stand-up comic. It was during those years that he became close acquaintances with celebrity artists and intellectuals such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Jean Basquiat, Mark Kostabi and Quentin Crisp. Not having had the opportunity to earn a PhD and with only a few years of formal college and university level education Fenyo is more of an auto-didactic intellectual thinker who has made a living doing everything from working as an Assistant-Executive Chef to translating poems by Miklos Radnoti from Hungarian to English to working as an overnight security guard to teaching English (E.S.L.). All of which makes his worldview relatively unique and original. He has also been involved in handling the legacy of his grandfather, the famous Hungarian writer and intellectual Max (Miksa) Fenyo (1877-1972), with whom he spent countless hours as a child. During nearly a decade long period when Fenyo resided primarily in Budapest (visiting Southern California and Washington, D.C. on several occassions) he was interviewed regularly on TV and in major magazines and newspapers, mostly for his own views, as well as his involvement in the production and publication of the first fully searchable CD-ROM encyclopedia of the NYUGAT (Hungarian for WEST), Hungary‚Äôs most significant literary and social review (1908-1941), of which is grandfather was a founder and editor. In 1994 Fenyo wrote his first book, Infinitism: Secret Key to the Doors of Wisdom which covers some of his initial philosophical ideas concerning the infinite and infinity as a concept for non-violent, mass socio-psychological change. Fenyo's ideas are an evolution of those held by such greats as Bruno Giordano and Baruch Spinoza. In his book; "The Most Important Thought" (Silver Aleph, 2004), which he wrote while living in Budapest (1994-2004), he argues that only by making contemplation of the infinite popular will humanity become sufficiently wise so as to be able to reverse and eventually overcome the threats to social and environmental stability and progress. Fenyo concludes that wisdom can be attained by open-minded, long-term oriented, deep thinking, which he claims are stimulated by contemplating the infinite. Fenyo is also an advocate of the idea that society would be better off if it would popularize philosophical discourse and debate on a massive scale. According to Professor Hernadi Miklos of the Hungarian National Academy of Sciences Fenyo's philosophical insight into the penultimate practical applications and implications of thinking about infinity is nothing but revolutionary and a breakthrough in the effort to reconcile the Western linnear and the Eastern non-linnear expressions of infinity as a philosophical concept. Professor Howard Robinson of Oxford, an Epistomoligal researcher, has found Fenyo's arguments interesting and worthy of consideration but not conclusive. In 1988 he began the creation of a small, fledgling grass-roots organization he founded and named The Society for the Mass Dissemination of the Concept of Infinity, a.k.a. The Infinity Society, whose purpose is to promote public awareness of the concept of infinity.</p>
<p>Fenyo's book Infinitism: Secret Key to the Doors of Wisdom is registered with the United States Library of Congress as a philosophical work.</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> To Everyone Here Thus Far (Users Trovatore, MikeTwo, Calton, etc.): This is getting to be a bit too much gentlemen! User Gemaliel has definitely breached Wikipedia's rules of conduct. To his above entry I sent him (at his own User page) the following:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Regarding your comment concerning my case (Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo): I find it quite perplexing that you have attempted to defame my name by pointing out something obvious, namely that MARQUI's Who's Who (of any category) does send out queries, and does ask such details, but only to later verify them before publication. The fact that you do not seem to know this seems to show that you are either less professional than you would have us believe or not entirely absent of malice. Furthermore, to compare me to Naked Cowboy as opposed to Socrates is definitely defamatory. I happen to be very involved in the American Jewish world, as a Jew myself, and I may yet have you investigated for any prejudices you might harbor against any persons, ethnicities or other, in case I may have to seek legal remedies. I take this whole matter very seriously and I sincerely hope that you have made a serious mistake and intend to reconsider matters. Besides, I see that you do not appreciate my views on the social ramifications of contemplating the infinite, or so it would seem. It was not more than two years ago that I had to leave Hungary because of rising anti-semitism in Europe and threats against me in particular by the extreme right-wing in Hungary (for speaking out openly against prejudice towards the Roma community in Hungary and for helping topple, via my statements in the media, on TV, the virulently anti-Semitic, zenophobic, anti-Arab government of Viktor Orban and FIDESZ. Anyway, I find your seemingly reactionary manners suspicious to say the least. My advice to you sir is: be more scientific and cautious in your assertions and statements, for in the end your very reputation at Wikipedia could be at stake!"</p>
<p>To what ends has this man seen it fit to mock my intellectual worth so brutishly?!? I see that he has a certain "special" status...and I don't find his lack of manners towards my person one bit amusing. And, more importantly, just how far can this whole conflagration of sorts go on??? I think this should stop at once, and all the decent persons involved should make their deliberations final and conclusive. If you delete my mention then I grant you there will come a time when you will feel rather ashamed for having trivialised the ideas and worth of a human-being not much unlike Baruch Spinoza or for that matter "Yakov Bok", the main character in Bernard Malamud's famous novel "The Fixer" (first published in 1966) and later made into a major motion picture. At one point in the story, which involves direly false accusations against Yakov by anti-Semites under the rule of the last Tsar of Russia (a relatively simple but kind-hearted aspirant), B.A. Bibikov, the Investigating Magistrate for Cases of Extraordinary Importance, is talking to Yakov Bok about his interest in a book by Spinoza and this is what is written (that is of relevance to my own concerns): The magistrate smiled. Yakov snickered but caught himself and stopped. (Then spoke the magistrate&gt;) "Is such a thing as you describe it, true freedom, would you say, or cannot one be free without being politically free?" (To which Bok, the fixer, thinks to himself the following) Here's where I better watch my step, the fixer thought. No use fanning up hot coals when you have to walk across them. (He then cautiously replies) "I wouldn't know for sure your honour. It's partly one and partly the other." (The magistrate&gt;) "True enough. One might say there is more than one conception of freedom in Spinoza's mind - in Necessity, philosophically speaking; and practically, in the state, that is to say within the realm of politics and political action. Spinoza conceded a certain freedom of political choice, similar to the freedom of electing to think, if it were posssible to make these choices. At least it is possible to think them. He perhaps felt that the purpose of the state - the government - was the security and comparative freedom of rational man. This was to permit man to think as best he could. He also thought man was freer when he participated in the life of society than when he lived in solitute as he himself did. He thought that a free man in society had a positive interest in promoting the happiness and intellectual emancipation of his neighbours." (Yakov&gt;) "I guess that's true your honor if you say so", said Yakov, "but as far as I myself an concerned what you said is something to think about, though if you're poor your time is taken up with other things that I don't have to mention. You let those who can worry about the ins and outs of politics." "Ah," Bibikov sighed. He puffed on his cigarette without speaking. For a moment there was no sound in the cell (prison cell). (Yakov thinks to himself&gt;)Did I say something wrong? Yakov thought wildly. There are times it doesn't pay to open your mouth. When the magistrate spoke again he sounded like an investigating official, his tone dry, objective. "Have you ever heard the expression 'historical necessity'?" (Yakov relies&gt;) "Not that I remember. I don't think so though maybe I could guess what it means." (The magistrate&gt;) "Are you sure? You've not read Hegel?" (Yakov&gt;) "I don't know his name." (The magistrate&gt;) "Or Karl Marx? He too was a Jew, though not exactly happy to be one." (Yakov&gt;) "Not him either." (The magistrate&gt;) "Would you say you have a 'philosophy' of your own? If so, what is it?" (Yakov&gt;) "If I have it's all skin and bones. I've only just come to a little reading, your honour," he apologized, "If I have any philosophy , if you don't mind me saying so, it's that life could be better than it is." (The magistrate&gt;) "Yet how can it be made better if not in politics or through it?" That's a sure trap, Yakov thought. "Maybe by more jobs and work," he faltered. "Not to forget good will among men. We all have to be reasonable or what's bad gets worse." "Well that's at least a beginning," the magistrate said quietly. "You must read and reflect further." "I will, just as soon as I get out of here". (&lt;&lt;&lt;says Yakov Bok, having no clue as to the further horrors that will come his way!) And I am somewhere the mix of a Yakov Bok and a Benedict Spinoza. Too bad Edward Said, a late acquaintance of mine, is not around to raise hell about this.

<li><b>Comment.</b> J.P., chill out. For one, you are always to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> on Wikipedia. That you would charge him with being "not entirely absent of malice" immediately is unecessary. Just because someone thinks the article doesn't have enough reputable sources doesn't say anything about their opinions or bias towards the subject matter or the author. A simple "Hey Gemaliel, did you know that MARQUI's Who's Who verifies their information before publication?" would suffice.
<p>If this page did not have nearly 6000 words on it (4700 of which you wrote!), he might find it easier to see the list of sources you posted -- in fact he probably missed them! Those sources are not currently in the article, so he's right to say that "the article as written is a delete." <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Any uncited uncommon information (such as your theories) can always be challenged and deleted</a>. Click that last sentence to see the policy itself.</p>
<p>I reiterate again that your intellectual worth is <b>still irrelevant</b> to this discussion, and that you are only hurting your case by attacking every Wikipedian who sees a BADLY written, UNCITED encyclopedia article (<b>ARTICLE, not IDEA</b>) and wants to remove it. Instead of taking it personal (it's not) and trying to disrupt the process because you feel priveleged, go rewrite the article and properly cite everything! Nobody can or will argue with valid citations!</p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to change the process with "I think this should stop at once... " is silly - because it won't happen. Wikipedia policy trumps the passing thoughts of a user who won't even take the time to register.</li>
<li>Trying to argue that you are worthy enough to be included without providing sources won't work, because without verification an article about a person is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">vanity</a>.</li>
<li>Trying to argue that your ideas are unique and special, and therefore should have a place won't work because that's considered <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, which is prohibited.</li>
<li>Taking everything personal and counterattacking goes against the policy of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>, and, frankly, is childish. If anything the vast majority here are apathetic to your ideas, and are only concerned with where and how they've been published.</li>
<li>I will not change my vote (since right now it is basically the only one in your favor), but your page-long rants are not helping. Calm...down... Even if the article is deleted, there are many many channels and processes through which you can get it undeleted. Crying "wolf" to Jimbo and trying to circumvent these processes just makes you look devious. Let me state plainly: <b>Wikipedians are not stupid. If you have published in reputable sources, they will be cited and the article will be kept. If not, it will be deleted. All other matters are irrelevant.</b>

<li><b>Comment.</b> It is to my inestimable fortune that I have contacted a number of "outside" parties and sources of information during the past day or so, many of whom are of the opinion that Wikipedia, based on more recent revelations, is no longer considered the benchmark of Internet encyclopedic reference sources (as it still should be...but, well, it is almost to be excpected that when a good idea gets to big really big the quality is evermoreso at risk). As I stated before (in different words), it will only be a loss to Wikipedia and its many fine USERs and visitors if my mention is deleted. For what it was all worth; at least I have found another threat to intellectual freedom and thus to the rights of all persons. Some of you seem to be fairly constructive sorts, but there are those of you who know next to nothing about real philosophers and what philosophy has always been about (at least this would seem to be the case; given that those in question seem to imply that a philosopher today has to be extensively published in academic journals and would therefor have to hold a PhD.). Last but not least, this obviously highly elitist prejudice against persons who sit out in public and engage people in philosophical discourse can only be the mark of someone who has yet to experience the real suffering of humanity (as I have). Again, some of you seem to be very well intended and to those persons I felt obliged to defend myself, my ideas and my noteworthyness. To those in the contrary probably anything I would try to communicate would be pointless (as it is the conclusion of several colleagues gathered around me at this table that such persons are by no means qualified to have been working on Wikipedia, in as much as Wikipedia is what it purports itself to be.) To Jimmy Wales, who may have a fair set of reasons for allegedly accepting resources from Bomis.com(which might be entirely legitimate and mind you I do not know to this be a fact conclusively nor would I necessarily consider this totally unnaceptable given the nature of information-control today), I wish only that he will find a way to better insure the reputability of his otherwise highly remarkable accomplishment. To MikeTwo I have a special addendum: be kind to those who have walked the road less travelled, for some day you will want to look back and know that IT was all very real, meaningful, and, last but not least, appreciated. So,I bid you all <i>bon nuit et adieu</i>. "Wikipedia...The Free Encyclopedia" (not the "PhD.s and other vetted persons" encyclopedia.).

<dd>These aren't reputable sources! And even if they were, they don't call him a philosopher!

<dd>There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walden_-_Economy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walden_-_Economy" rel="nofollow">Thoreau</a></dd>

<li>I'm not entirely sure what your point is. Is it that Fenyo may (for all we know) be an admirable person who lives as a philosopher? Could be. Having a page on WP is not about being "admirable"; despicable people have them precisely for the things that made them despicable. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:57, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I probably should have formatted my post as a response to the delete vote above, the concern of which seems to me to involve a question of Mr. Fenyo's certain unworthiness to be called <i>a philosopher</i>... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 21:30, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it relates to the issue before us, the question is not whether he <i>is</i> a philosopher, but whether we can <i>verify</i> his <i>notability</i> as a philosopher, via independent and reputable sources. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:34, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the words "....a philosopher...." and then "....as a philosopher...." had been left out, this would have been the exact <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia policy</a> as I know it, even with the damn verifiablity issue mentioned. I agree I comment on an issue which may even be irrelevant, but then had the preceding poster not done so at greater length? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 22:19, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point was not to say he's not a philosopher in spirit or practice (or whatever). My point was that he's not a verifiable philosopher, by Wikipedia's definition of verifiable, and that the sources he cites as proof of his verifiability are pretty bogus overall. To be a philosopher may be all those things you state ("to love wisdom...etc etc..."), but to be a philosopher <b>on Wikipedia</b> one must found a school, publish a book, or have opinions that a great number of people take seriously and write about independently. It is not just appearing in "Talk of the Town" articles, annotating Philosophic websites, registering an unpublished book, buying a web address, and calling yourself a "philosopher" to the Who's Who publishers.
<p>Finally, Conf, the "Wikipedia policy" you cite is actually only a <b>proposed</b> policy, and you should pay attention to the words near the top that say <i>"References or links to this page should not describe it as "policy".</i> --<font color="#1569C7"><b><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMiketwo_71f4.html" title="User:Miketwo">Michael</a></b></font> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMiketwo_a412.html" title="User talk:Miketwo"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 23:04, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Shouldn't the point be not whether Fenyo is "a verifiable philosopher" (whatever it means), but whether he is verifiably notable.
<p>As for the proposed not-a-policy, reference to which did not accompany Trovatore's assertion, what makes the assertion true. I suppose the word <i>notability</i>, repeated incessantly all over Wikipedia, is not merely an abbreviation of "<i>proposed</i> concept of notability". <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConf_f25c.html" title="User:Conf">Conf</a> 00:26, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>Gentlemen &amp; Not-So-Gentle Men (hey, where are the women??). So, there it is. We've come to one of the biggest weaknesses of Wikipedia, namely the inability to recognize the worthyness of philosophers whose public recognition as such happens to have taken place in ANOTHER LANGUAGE (Hungarian in my case). More than a dozen articles and TV/radio interviews in Hungarian, at a time when Hungarian media usage of, and long-term storage/retrieval on, the Internet was minimmal at best (no thanks to over 45 years of post-Stalinist Russian Imperialism disguised as Socialism...only to be followed by ruthless Wild-West-style capitalism without sufficient welfare protection). SO THERE IT IS: THE ALLEGED PHILOSOPHER CANNOT FURNISH US ARTICLES IN HUNGARIAN OVER THE INTERNET THAT HONOR HIM WITH THE TITLE "PHILOSOPHER". But, if Trovatore wanted it, I could post him photocopies of some of those articles in which the Hungarian equivalent of philosopher is clearly how I am defined (filozofus). That the Hungarian Wikipedia does not yet have an article on me may have something to do with the mind-set and socio-political leanings of the Hungarians who can afford the time to be involved. And I will readily admit that the vast majority of Hungarians today dislike me...because I was very critical of their tendencies to be zeno-phobic and even to be somewhat racist, in particular towards the Roma (Gypsies), Jews (like me) and blacks who are not supermodels, movie stars or gangsta-rap-'artists'. So, IF (and note that I mean "if") this is what Wikipedia is all about then I, as a true philosopher and not a university-level teacher/academic of philosophy, do not want to be mentioned on Wikipedia at all! For then Wikipedia cannot be considered worthy of true philosophers, other genuine intellectuals and I will not consent then to being mocked as an "urban curiosity" (to quote someone here). What follows is my response to USER: conf., who deserves the very best that life can offer. Vivre le resistance contra la mediocracie! Touchet!</li>

<p>++ Greetings. Your words are infinitely precious to me! And to quote Henry David Thoreau, in reference to my case, is almost like having an invitation extended to the two of us to join him at Walden Pond. Then again,dying of influenza is not such a pleasant experience. How kind and compassionate your words. As per practical deeds: I do try to live up to my own set of principles, ethics, values and morals, but I would be insolently dishonest were I to claim to be so fortunate, yet I have risked my life, turned down great matterial wealth (that would somehow have been at the expense of others) and blown plenty a whistle when it became obvious to me that was the only correct manner to act. My words and ideas helped topple a zeno-phobic, anti-Semitic, anti-Roma, racist, corrupt, elitist government administration in Hungary (Orban, Viktor and his lunatic FIDESZ); my consultations with Israelis, Palestinians, fellow American-Jews, Jordanians (not Palestinian citizens of Jordan) and others, behind the scenes, during the days of the secrete Oslo meetings (though I was not in Oslo at the time, but in New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.) all helped improve the chances for an eventual resolution of this most dire of world conflicts; and my many interviews and statements in public advocating thinking about the BIG PICTURE (Infinity, Life, Death, Existence, Love, Truth, Awe, etc.) have had some inestimable chain-reaction impact. So have the writings of Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and countless others. That one of these unofficiated editors should point out that that most of the media coverage has never called me a philosopher per se, yet by my very actvitity of philosophizing (as described in these articles and snippets, is a sad sign of our mad times. They should read your comment with great attention. A philosopher does what I do: 1) Ask questions, almost incessantly, like; why do we enjoy things...what is the meaning of happiness and joy?; why are some things, like Strawberries and Raspberries to me, so tasty and pleasing to our senses and others not?; how is it that we sense we exist even as nothing physical that makes up our brain-bodies is made up of anything truly stable enough to keep its absolute integrity for longer than fractions of a second?; why do so few people (or so it would seem), like myself, find such appreciation in being able to see colors and feel textures, perceive the relatively natural elements of our world and know, even then, that such an experience is fleeting and will end to our personal character's knowledge at the time our non-physical essential beings depart our lifeless brain-bodies?; and I could go on... That these technocrats, specialists, elitistic persons (oh, how I resent having to label persons whose outer lives have so imprisoned their true inner selves!) should fail to realize that publishing/expressing in public one's own deep thoughts about things relatively uncommon is the highest mark and proof of being a true philosopher is all so typical of our times. (Funny thing is this; had they been able to get hold of the articles, interviews, etc. about me that were published in Hungary in Hungarian they would not be able to jump their proverbial gun of assumed conviction regarding no media claims to my being a philosopher!!! After all, my first book was only published in 1994, just before I left to live in Hungary for a decade, and from which I have barely returned to my native Washington, D.C.!!!) I had hoped to stop responding to their attacks, but for whatever it is worth I am going to let them know about this one. Last but not least, I would very much appreciate it if you would be so kind as to establish a direct line of communication between us (admin@infinitysociety.org).

We are here to summarize existing human knowledge compiled from legitimate mainstream sources.

<li><b>Acknowledged</b> Probably some of those invited Hungarian Wikipedians will "show up", but knowing other Hungarians as I do it does not mean they will speak in my favor. Hungarians, in general (there plenty of exceptions), are among the most cautious and skeptical people on Earth. This is much due to the nature of the Hungarian language and the cross-cultural phenomena that arises from their linguistic isolation. Which, aside from a diet that has too much Paprika, grease, salt, oil and sugar, is probably a major factor in why Hungary still has one of the highest suicide rates in the world! That and the unfortunate resurgence of virulent anti-Semitism which I estimate infects one in three non-Jewish Hungarians does not give me much reason for hope. Few Hungarians will admit that anti-Semitism has become a problem, once more, in Hungary and the Hungarian expatriate world. Nevertheless, most Hungarians are fairly decent folk and perhaps I will be lucky. J.P. Fenyo 68.48.73.93 00:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>168-Ora, Two-page magazine interview, Oct. 1998. - This is the magazine of the socialist party in hungary - not too bad, but not anything amazing.</li>
<li>Irodalom √©s √âlet - first off, it is "√âlet √©s Irodalom"(!). It is a very intellectual magazine, that is true, but as I have graduated from an elite school in hungary, many of my friends have published there quite some stuff, and I don't consider them being eligible to be in Wikipedia</li>
<li>TV show-ups. Forget Sziv-TV, its crap. RTL-Klub: you can get in there by having an IQ &lt; 20, e.g. in the programme 'Fokusz'. TV-2: a similar stuff to "Fokusz" is here, so forget it. Only interesting is the MTV appearance, but come on... Anybody even a bit well known in Hungary has no need to have himself credited with the stuff mentioned before. MTV should have been enough. Also, my father once having a popularity rate of about 10%, he could most probably list about 200 of these TV-appearances, so forget it.</li>
<li>Anyways, as a non-hungarian, my thoughts are the following: He keeps explaining why it is so important to have him here. That in itself should give us a clue of how important he is. So let's delete this stuff and go on doing something more productive then arguing *with*(and not *about*!) a self-nominated 'important' man.--<a href="../../../m/s/o/User%7EMsoos_77a1.html" title="User:Msoos">Msoos</a> 09:23, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> here comes another Hungarian. I can largely corroborate what has been said by <a href="../../../m/s/o/User%7EMsoos_77a1.html" title="User:Msoos">Msoos</a>. Kurir and Kiskegyed are not serious newspapers, so the fact there were articles there about him doesn't mean too much. 168 √≥ra is a more serious weekly mainly interested in politics and to a smaller extent culture. In any case, it usually doesn't deal with philosophy as a topic. It would be interesting to read the article itself, I may try and find and read it. √âlet √©s Irodalom is a very prestigious weekly in Hungary, but he himself said that it was actually a letter of his that was published, which again doesn't prove anything as ordinary readers get their letters to the editor published every week. In his case, there was a debate on relaunching the literary weekly Nyugat his grandfather used to edit, and he expressed his opinion on this topic in a letter, so his statement (21:42, 28 November 2005 (UTC), below) that he was described as a philosopher in Elet es Irodalom is a blatant lie. The significance of the appearance on MTV (Magyar Televizi√≥, (the state-owned) Hungarian Television) is difficult to judge as we don't know what kind of program he appeared in.
<ul>
<li>On the whole, what really should make us suspicious is this: here is an American philosopher who publishes in English, and still, for some reason, the main sources he marshals to defend his claim of being a recognized philosopher happen to be all in Hungarian. And, for some other reason, non of these sources actually prove that he is a recognized philosopher.</li>
<li>As a matter of fact, most recognized Hungarian scientists and scholars publish amptly in English, in peer-reviewed journals, so his idea of being recognized "only in Hungarian" is quite odd, especially in light of his book having been published in English.</li>
<li>His ideas of being hated by most Hungarians and having played a major role in toppling a government are ludicrous, as a matter of fact, I am sure he is completely unknown to most Hungarians. I myself never heard of him before being invited to this discussion. He may be a philosopher for all that, but a recongnized and well-known member of the intellectual (or even cultural) scene in Hungary he definitely isn't.</li>
<li>I made a quick search of Hungarian webpages, there were two classes of hits on his name: (1) where he was mentioned in connection with his grandfather, the late editor of the literary weekly Nyugat, (2) marginal pages like forums, the webpage of a community centre where he held a lectures, a magazine of lifestyle etc. Not one university homepage, not one homepage of a research institute or a journal of philosophy. And the number of hits was less then 10, before I forget... --<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamas_284d.html" title="User:Tamas">Tamas</a> 23:41, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Attention</b>After so many attacks on my name, character and person, and obfuscation of the fact that I am a philosopher, my most relevant ideas to date have all been published (some even on the Internet) and that such has even been written of me (Budapest Sun article, Internet-Galaxis 2000 program, etc.), I and several people who know me are of the conclusive opinion that Wikipedia is no longer what it set out to be and cannot be a fair arbitrer of anything! So USER: MikeTwo,USER: Trovatore, etc.... Go ahead and delete my mention on Wikipedia, for it is not worthy of my good name. USER: Gemaliel: hooray for you, you've done a great service to humanity (NOT!). Erasing my statement about the possibilities surrounding Msoos was actually a disservice to Wikipedia, besides you seem not to pay attention to 'qualifiers' as I have often been using them. USER: Msoos:</li>
</ul>
<p>[[[[you seem to ignore the main question so far and the only issue on which USER: MikeTwo and USER: Trovatore are concerned with, namely; has any reputable source ever described me as a philosopher (!, which many have done jsut that, but in 168-ora, MTV-1, Elet es Irodalom and a number of others; in Hungarian]]]]), you should consider yourself to be a proud member of the what seems to be a world-wide anti-Wikipedia conspiracy to infiltrate it with people who seem to have a very dark agenda...probably to manipulate the general public's perception of 'reality' as it becomes defined by a select few. This is also the opinion of several dozen people, all of equal or greater notability than I, with whom we have established contact and who may find a legitimate way to inform the world about the tragic condition of Wikipedia. SO PLEASE DELETE ME and ignore all the facts as they stand and have stood. Last but not least: A shining bright star of reason did appear in the form of USER: conf&#160;! May whoever that person be: the world needs much more of your kind, keep up the resistance and never doubt that your words of reason are much appreciated and have limited my own grief. Wikipedia must be saved. Some Wikipedians must be held accountable. The Infinity Society will continue to herald a new age...or perish with the rest of the world! I will always be true to myself: a real American patriot, fighting fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, bigotry, hypocrisy, elitism, racism, inhumanity, ignorance, hate, intolerance, narrow-mindedness, and the list goes on. As my dear friend Larry Alaimo once put it: "J.P., the only problems with this infinity thing of yours is that it goes on and on forever (lol)." Yes, that's a good problem worth laughing about! The phenomena of the corruption of Wikipedia is no laughing matter.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am a native Hungarian and I have to admit I have not heard of this man so far but that doesn't mean he cannot be significant. I did, however do a research on him on Google Hungary and it did give some information about him being a philosopher BUT I haven't found ANY major proof that he did significant work in his field. He does hold lectures about his things, as fars as I understood but one of the major Hungarian Literature Periodicals listed him in the category of "Crazy" when he stated some foolish thing about one of the major Literary periodicals of the beginning of the 20th century and that he apparentl√©y just took up the name Ady, who was one opf our biggest poets. <a href="http://www.kortarsonline.hu/9904/kristo.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kortarsonline.hu/9904/kristo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kortarsonline.hu/9904/kristo.htm</a> So it seems to me that this guy is just a balloon to be blown out, not a serious philosopher with recognizable ideas. But that's just an opinion.

<li><b>Answer</b> To USER: Go for it! &gt; In Hungary a printing of 5,000 copies of a philosophy book would be, for all intensive purposes, impossible. Note that Hungary's internal population (not including Hungarians residing 'permanently' outside of Hungary, in Transylvania, Germany, the U.S., Australia, etc.) is not more than 11 Million. Even some of the more famous Hungarian intellectuals do not get a first print of over 2,000 copies! Mine was only 1,200 copies, and distribution was limited because of threats to book-sellers! &lt;&lt;&lt; I am a very controversial figure in Budapest society...and now that it has been almost two years since I left people are beginning to forget me; some because of the fact that I was a nuisance in their lives (reminding them of serious social problems in Hungary, such as racism and prejudice towards minorities), others because in today's world if you're not constantly exposed in the mass media then within a year people (most) will forget! I would say, however, that 1 in 20 people living for over ten years in Budapest will know something significant about me (that's roughly 100,000 persons, give or take a few thousand). In Hungary I'd dare say 1 in 40 (250,000). In New York City my fame index hovers around 1 in 40 persons (roughly the same as in Hungary: 250,000), not very good, but that puts me in the top 1% of humanity. By Wikipedia standards my notability as a "writer" is virtually zero! But the measure of my noteworthy is problematic and very complex at that; for on some level Wikipedia must also mention those whose degree of influence on world events is very high, but whose fame level is very low. Which reminds me of the time when a previous President of Portugal asked his A.D.C. who the hell I was (at a V.I.P. event hosted by the Hungarian government) and his A.D.C. whispered in his ears something to which he said (loud enough for people around to hear, and in Portuguese; "Oh, that's the man...well keep me away from him and any other philosophers who might be present!" The President's stare was rather ominous! My ideas about infinity have inspired dozens of major companies, since after my first days of fame in 1987, to use the word or motif (logo: symbol) of infinity, in various altered forms and straight for their public brand or company image recognition!!! My letters of advice to world leaders, mostly in the early 1990s, influenced decisions, sometimes with impressive results. Of course, these things are virtually impossible to prove conclusively, for by their very nature they do not lend themselves to the kind of proof of causality that other things do. One serious factor...mind you I still think DELETION has its up-side (especially after the fact that it had already gone through scrutiny once before over 3 years ago and more or less passed without any major problem) and I would just love to get e-mails of apology further down the road when the evidence of my noteworthiness/sincerity starts rolling in! My mention was on Wikipedia for almost as long as Wikipedia has so far existed, and I will not let those who delete my mention get off easily. I just love receiving apologies...even years down the road!!! Wikipedia needs to have room for extremely odd and complex exceptions, especially if the person in question is highly likely to be the next Spinoza or, in terms of popularity only, the next Jean Paul Sartre (whose views on Existentialism I almost completely disagree with). There is nothing exciting about a major Internet reference source that only covers the subjects already covered by the mainstream. Wikipedia must recognize the need to include the avant-garde and the unusual if it wants to be of any use to the mass media and students in a world whose speed of information exchange and change itself is beyond easy comprehension. No longer does Andy Warhol's famous "15 minute of fame" apply; the question has to be not in quantitative terms but in qualitative terms: and given that it is I alone, in the known English language world, who claims (before any others ever did) that infinity is the only concept that will truly evolve us humans from the homo-ignoramus most of us still are (explain what happened and why in Rwanda, Bosnia-Hercegovina and other recent inhumanity...after The Holocaust!!!!) to the true homo-sapiens we should already be! No other concept is as important in defining one's humanity...for while primates can communicate and thus think about some basic concepts directly associated with emotion(s), they will not be able to conceive, to any extent/degree, the concept of that which is everything and has no beginning in terms of time-space-change!!! Maybe, if we humans survive this catastrophic period of history, then thousands of years from now (unless we do some odd cross-genetic breeding!) will primates evolve sufficiently to become able to conceive the infinite! Infinity is truly the final thought that we can conceive!!! So...I have enjoyed educating a few people...but hidden jealousy is no reason to defame a daring new intellectual!!! "And they will fear the words and ideas of those who might wake up all the sleeping tigers...and they will find ways aplenty to silence the lions of truth who dare bathe in the bright sun rays of reason and truth."

<li><b>DELETE.</b> NN bio. This guy has absolutely no reference in the Philosopher's Index which is <i>the</i> definitive resource for philosophy in the English language.

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> I voted to delete the original articles as too vauge, it could encompass any scientist who called themselves Christian or Catholic - which is just about all of them before modern times, and for many scientists their religion has played little or no part in their science. However, I see where this article wants to go, it want to include those people who are notable both for being religious and for being in science. And that is an important cross over, for many of them have been influential in the science and religion debates over the ages - many will have published cross-disciplinary works (e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Polkinghorne_9e70.html" title="John Polkinghorne">John Polkinghorne</a>). Providing this isn't a list of scientists who go to church, or clergymen with an MA in physics, but the subjects are notable for being cross-disciplinary, then keep. But rename - and I'm not sure what. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 00:47, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Refactor</b>. The list is useless as it is. It only becomes useful when it is a list of those who have commented in some way on the relationship of their own faith to their science.

<dd>Okay, I respect that. However statements there included "In brief: the quality of these lists is too low for them to be useful. It doesn't say how they were made or what the criteria for inclusion are, and no sources are given, so cleanup is practically impossible. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">User:Dpbsmith</a>." I tried to make very clear what the criteria are here and pretty much all sources are listed. "First, it's impossible as a list, as all Western scientists prior to Henry VIII were "Catholic," and scientists don't have to declare their affiliation when they get their special Science Card and secret handshake in graduate school." I added that all names before 1600 have to be noted as such. Scientists may not have to list their religious affiliation, but in the case of in least Eyring it was mentioned at the National Academy of Science obituary. Other objections to that list was that it was too arbitrary or too loosely associated. I think that should be much less true now.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>This page has been recently created. It's not a well written page and I have tagged it NPOV and I expect other tags could be used as well. Chelman tagged it for speedy delete, and I will add his vote here for him. However, the term is real, and the concept probably important. I think speedy is too fast, so I am nominating it for AfD. I however, intend to vote 'weak keep' Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 22:24, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Chelman per nom. First off a crusade implies a war to further a (christian)religious cause. No matter what people's stances on the war in Iraq are it is conducted by mostly secular countries with a strict division of church and state who have no interest in overthrowing a religion. I am guessing that the author intended the more colloquial usage of the word crusade. In that case I would still opt for deletion. While the resentment among sections of the Islamic populace is undeniable I don't think that the term Crusade describes it. Only a handful of rather extremist organisations use that term. There are possibly many other sites that use other terms for the perceived aggression. It would make no sense to have an article for each since we could then have Final Solution (modern), Western Lebensraum (modern) and many more crafty terms. An article on this matter should be titled something like Perception of the War in Iraq whereby it would become possible to shed light on what extreme, moderate and non-muslims think about it as well as what do the Americans, Europeans etc. think about it. This would be a much more valuable entry. I am guessing that a similar section is in fact already present in the War on Iraq topics. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelman_8a03.html" title="User:Chelman">Chelman</a> 11:49, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenth_Crusade_8207.html" title="Tenth Crusade">Tenth Crusade</a> and <b>Redirect</b>. Googling for iraq crusade bush gives about 1,550,000 hits, so while the article may be POV, the term is real. And George Bush has described the GWOT on terror as a crusade. Only when he was told how much damage he was causing, did he stop using the term. He still describes it as a war on evil, which is more a religious term than a political one. All the arguments about POV I agree with. (I placed the POV tag myself, and I've checked the creator's edit history.) But the biggest argument is that there is already another <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenth_Crusade_8207.html" title="Tenth Crusade">page on this topic</a> so I suggest a merge and redirect.

<p>I keep coming back to this one. On the plus side, it does make some attempt to discuss the encyclopaedic subject of dramatic irony; on the minus side, the list is potentially almost limitless, depending on where you put the bar; the technique is a mainstay of stage comedy (not least pantomime) and always will be, and many "straight" plays use this as a narrative device. So in the end, it is not actually particularly unusual, which I guess is why it is large and expanding, and why I consider that it is pointless, because it is potentially merely a list of al comic and a good proportion of dramatic theatre. Oh, and it includes original research. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:00, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Any list is going to be hopelessly unmaintainable and likely to attract cruft, but it isn't an idiosyncratic non-topic like many of these lists. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl‚ôück</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:21, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete- with reservations</b> I created this page to save <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>. No matter what I and a handful of other wise editors did on that page, pointless cruft examples kept creeping back in. This page was a last ditch attempt to make fourth wall encyclopedic, at the expense of a clearly pointless page here. It worked! Fourth Wall has remained largely undisturbed and I think is a good page. This list is, I admit, awful and I'd love to see it go, but for some reason Wikipedians seem to be desperate to list these somewhere. Think of this page as a holding area for useless content! Please check the history of fourth wall for a bit more background, and please, please, please, <b>don't merge!</b> <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyote-37_f632.html" title="User:Coyote-37">Coyote-37</a> 10:33, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Before this article was created, the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> article contained this list. Despite the efforts of some editors to trim the list down, examples continued to be added to the list. Attempting to establish some sort of minimum standard for this list didn't work, so the list was split off to its own article. It should remain or the same problems that you see here will again become part of the main article. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 18:55, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see what you're saying, and agree in principle, but my experiences of editing <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> tell me that there is no way to merge this without totally undermining the content of that page with a fancruft swamp. Fourth Wall currently deals with breaking in as much detail as I think is necessary. A list is not only bad prose, it invites deluge examples as seen here. I don't think Fourth Wall should contain a list of any kind. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyote-37_f632.html" title="User:Coyote-37">Coyote-37</a> 10:04, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
