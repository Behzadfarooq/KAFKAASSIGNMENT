<p>Well, if Wiki adminers have determined precedent for like sporting clubs, any retort I can offer appears to be a waste of time. However, a couple for your consideration...</p>
<p>Links to the area (<a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Doncaster_078b.html" title="East Doncaster">East Doncaster</a>) discuss schools, community groups &amp; sporting clubs based throughout the area. Is it not logical for these clubs to then have a wiki presence??</p>
<p>The club has a significant history in the area, which has been documented extensively, and is currently being prepared for release in book format.</p>
<p>The club effects hundreds of individuals &amp; families on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>I don't see the point in ignoring sporting associations that play a prominent part in a local community, and limiting a wiki presence to those that reach a specific "grade". It's easy to state that a club is "Not notable", but by whose reckoning does this apply??</p>
<p>Other than following wiki guideliness that have already been established, I don't think the arguments noted for deletion so far, are at all contructive.</p>
<p>Kind regards, Heater</p>

<dd>There are some more, but they are all essentially the same. Some of those stories above were copied by multiple papers. It is important to note that these articles are only about 200-500 words each. I would personally count them as trivial, but I suppose I'm not completely sure. This company does have a novel business plan and did receive a little money from important investors, but that is their only claim to notability whatsoever. Their stock was listed as a hot buy some time ago, but there is nothing else concerning this company other than the investment and business plan. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 16:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Unfortunately, users have different standards of "notability" on Wikipedia. I personally feel that an article about a business that provides a unique service is more notable than the List of people predominantly seen wearing sunglasses. Also, there are articles in important news sources about the company. Including <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/22/ap/business/mainD8KTRGOG0.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/22/ap/business/mainD8KTRGOG0.shtml" rel="nofollow">this one</a> from an AP Business Writer shown on the CBS news site.

<li>Note that the list you mentioned is up for deletion as well, which is why talking about being "more notable" than another article is not a sound plan (which I think is a synonym for "more useful" in your case, even though notability doesn't actually talk about usefulness).

The NY Times article from March 9, 2006 is especially interesting in that it lists some competitors of Jingle Networks such as inFreeDA who operates 800-411-METRO and easy411.com who operates 1-877-Easy411. The easy411 service is not free, but does not have any advertisements. -<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> 17:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I didn't read the press articles, but it seems this company has a certain notability to me. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_3ae6.html" title="User:Lucasbfr">lucasbfr</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucasbfr_039f.html" title="User talk:Lucasbfr"><font color="darkblue">talk</font></a></sup> 21:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability criterion that relates to this article is: "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." A google search on "Jingle Networks" yields 148,000 pages. A google news search yields 164 news articles (some not necessarily unique). Virtually every major newspaper in the country has at least one article about Jingle Networks. It would be difficult to reason that these sources are not independent. The authors are different as well as the editors and media itself. I doubt that neutrality is impossible to verify in this case unless there is some mass conspiracy of journalists. I claim that it is difficult to dispute that there are multiple independent sources reporting on the company. The question then becomes, are these articles "non-trivial?" Clearly, people have differing views on what is considered trivial. I would argue that the wikipedia criteria for notability defines triviality in a particular way. One guideline is that "media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company" should be excluded from granting notability to a subject because they are trivial. Also, "Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories" should be excluded. An in-depth NY Times article does not fall under the domain of triviality according to the two exclusion clauses. Individual users may feel that Jingle Networks performs a trivial service to society or that the business is too small (and in that sense trivial) to warrant a wikipedia article; however, those notions of triviality are not in the spirit of the wikipedia notability criteria. The wikipedia notion of triviality is related to whether the published work itself is trivial in that it is a duplicate of an already existing article, an advertisement for the company, or an article published in a business directory. In that sense the article would really be trivial. The intent of the notability requirement is to prevent individuals from creating articles about their own small proprietorships or corporations. Once a company becomes important enough that it is mentioned in every major newspaper (and sometimes more than once), and the articles present different information from one another, the company has become notable enough to have a wikipedia article. I raise this issue because I believe that we should adhere to the notability and triviality criteria as defined by wikipedia rather than by using personal notions of these terms. -<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickycds_01de.html" title="User:Rickycds">J</a> 23:23, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>South Africa is rather a large country and has more than a few schools...</i> is not a deletion nomination (but is a rather good argument for creating a list of this type). I expect noms to take the time to spell out their objections <i>cogently</i> in a way that all users can readily understand. AFD is not for riddles or mind games. Regarding your reference to WP:NOT, I would point out that the clauses on that page contain specific detailed examples. They do not fit this list. Instead, lists of lists are perfectly acceptable as per the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> guideline, and are quite common. They are meant as navigational aids, not directories. In the present case, the primary school list would be swallowed by the High School list. It therefore makes sense to break them out in keeping with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Schools_b2b6.html" title="List of Schools">List of Schools</a> structure.. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> Festival is a well-documented festival that was not made up in one day. It involved months of preparation. Please read the entry before making your evaluations. Thx. Festwoman 11:53, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Do Not Delete!!!</b></s> <i>[Duplicate vote removed]</i>I would like to begin my comment by requesting a 30 day period during which the article may be re-written, as suggested by Cbrown1023. This article was created as a skeleton to be fleshed out by the greater Festival community. It has not yet exited for four hours and yet there are already calls for its deletion. Such calls appear to be contrary to the community spirit of the Wikipedia. If the reason for this suggestion is that the Wikipedia community is concerned about respectability in the greater community, I appreciate this concern. However I think that allowing enough time for a communal creation of an article is well within the spirit of the project. If, after 30 days, enough members of the Festival community have not deemed it appropriate or worthwhile to commit enough time to Wikipedia to flesh out the entry enough to address the criticisms below, then I agree it should be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this request, I will address the specific reasons for recommending deletion. Cbrown1023’s request for a total-rewrite in which the author can explain the subject better is well received. The idea was for one participant to provide the skeleton of the article such that various other participants could more readily add to the substance of the article and clarify it. However, I respect the need to put a limit on such efforts, given the prevalence of lazy communities that start projects on the Wikipedia and are not committed to maintaining them. This is why I recommend the 30 day moratorium on the discussion about whether or not the article should be deleted. If after 30 days the article is not fleshed out, then I too will recommend deletion. With regard to Masamage’s request to send the article to WP:BJAODN, this, again, might seem appropriate to those who do not, for obvious reasons, understand the article, but again I urge a 30 day period during which the article may be fleshed out by the entire Festival community. This article was created in order that those who participated would have an easier time adding content. Although the wiki format is easy to use, if there is an article already created then it is easier to edit. OfficeGirl suggests what may seem like the most appropriate critique of the article with the suggestion that it violates WP:NFT. I was concerned about this particular guideline myself while creating the article and this is why I created the history sub-heading. I do not think that Festival is a violation of these guidelines, and I know several other Festival participants who have read the guidelines themselves and still agree. Furthermore, because I did not want to waste the time of the Wikipedia community, I requested assurance of those Festival participants in the creation of the article prior to their participation in the creation of this article. I have been assured by several participants that, if the article itself were created, they would be happy to add content in order to clarify it. For this reason I request a 30 day period during which Festival participants are allowed to contribute to the article prior to its consideration for deletion. There were several complaints about the lack of sources. I feel very redundant at this point in my request, but I think it best to allow a 30 period in order to list the sources. This is, perhaps, the most tedious task, although one of the more important, or any wikipedian and at times takes more than six hours to perform if it is do be done correctly. Having just read the the wikipedia guidline on verifiability I can assure the Wikipedia editors, whose commitment to the integrity of this project is evident by the number who have turned out to pass judgment on this single article, that two legitimate sources have published articles about Festival and one is in the works, and that if the 30 day wait period is suggested that these publications will be linked to the website. We will verify it, although we do appreciatability Metropolitan90’s link to the page with the verifiability criteria. The fact that Mikeblas cannot find the soundtrack on Allmusic or Amazon seems entirely irrelevant, and the suggestion that this is “Something made up at break one day” is both insulting and unsupported. I take great offense that the conclusions jumped to by this particular Wikipedia-editor. I will assume for the time being that they have been reached by the lack of respect for the wikipedia project that Mikeblas has encountered in the past and a general embitterment to those whose actions undermine the integrity of the project. Consequently I will not make further comment on this ill founded suggestion to delete the article. • I cannot understand Arbusto’s request to delete (without bubbles) unless it is just a suggestion in an overall vote. If so, the vote is respected. If ‘(without bubbles)’ is supposed to provide some reason for this vote, I am left in a state this perplexing by another’s reasoning since I stopped teaching introductory logic courses. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Festwoman (<a href="../../../f/e/s/User_talk%7EFestwoman_ae2e.html" title="User talk:Festwoman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Festwoman_5c56.html" title="Special:Contributions/Festwoman">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Save</b> because their status in the future is unknown, as most of them are rookies or second years. We can delete them when their hockey career leads to little, but they are a part of a professional team in a professional league.

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> Not true. The NCAA considers the OHL and all members of the Canadian Hockey League to be professional teams, and playing with a team removes a year of eligibility from NCAA hockey play. Just signing with an agent in the NFL nullifies college elibility, the OHL is a professional league. 35.11.236.45 12:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Counter rebuttal</b> I find it very ironic that the NHL, which is a much larger organization that the NCAA considers the OHL, QMJHL and WHL to be junior/amateur leagues. Wikipedia also concurs with the NHL. These are amateur teams. <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlibirigit_3d7f.html" title="User:Flibirigit">Flibirigit</a> 13:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Clarification: the guideline at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states <i>Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles.</i> So for hockey players, they are wiki notable if they have played professionally. Of course there are always exceptions like hot prospects (<a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_Staal_a394.html" title="Jordan Staal">Jordan Staal</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Kessel_b5b9.html" title="Phil Kessel">Phil Kessel</a>, etc)... <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 20:29, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>With the OHL being considered a professional league, it would mean that all players could be up. Don't get me wrong, I don't really consider there to be entirely bright hockey futures for all of them, but I can promise that at least 4 will be playing in higher leagues in the next 3 years, at least one of them next year. 35.11.236.45 00:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC) Update: upon further research into the matter, I would make a suggestion as to players to save, from this list, as long other OHL teams are given similar chances to get their prospects "wikiworthy". I would suggest leaving Steve Ward, Andrew Fournier, Vern Cooper, and A.J. Jenks. Among players in the list above, there may be fringe NHL draft picks, but the four I have mentioned will move on. 35.11.236.45 01:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There's no evidence that she is "known by millions"; this argument is literally unsubstantiated and just an assertion at this point. Presumably, the assertion has been made because these "inherently notable" people are appearing on a television show. The television show is not in the top ten of weekly Nielsen ratings <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/nielsen-more.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/nielsen-more.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so it's hard to jump to the conclusion that a show participant is "inherently" notable when the show itself doesn't draw. The show is tied for eleventh on the night it airs <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=wednesday" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=wednesday" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, but a little bit of resarch reveals that more people watched <i>Cops</i> reruns <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=saturday" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=saturday" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. We're not about to start adding articles about each of the "inherently notable contestants" on <i>Cops</i>, are we?

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a>; this may need debate and discussion elsewhere, but the "inherent notability" argument seems valid. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 17:33, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Plenty other contestants have been deleted up to now, and consensus appears to favour deletion of those who hav not capitaliised on their 5 minutes of fame on the show, which tends to refute the assertion that all reality contestants are notable. Catie is a case in point: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Catie+anderson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=m82&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Catie+anderson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=m82&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">181 unique Ghits</a>, nothing beyond the usual fansite links, wiki articles and mirrors and blogs.

<p>The article is not written very well, but I would like it to be improved on, rather than deleted. Jordan Maxwell's work is very important to the 'research community' (aka conspiracy theorists), and he is cited and quoted by many other writers and lecturers, including Michael Tsarion, David Ike and others. To delete his entry would be to start a trend of removing entries for anyone who dares to question the status quo. Just because the complainant hasn't heard of him, doesn't mean that he is not notable.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you delete _him_ then that's a good precedent to "nominate and destroy" most of those christian preachers, bible colleges and other such organizations that have cropped up on WP as of late; few of these pass the same litmus test. There is too much of Maxwell's work in circulation for him to be dismissed like that. What's more, and most telling is that <a href="../../../a/r/b/User_talk%7EArbustoo_794d.html" title="User talk:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> chose to forget to mention the many documentaries for television Mr. Maxwell has worked on and at times appeared therein in person as well as the many events Mr. Maxwell has been a featured speaker at many venues and has been invited as a guest to many radio shows such as Art Bell / George Noory's Coast to Coast etc. etc.</p>

<p>Just looking at this website at [<a href="http://www.jordanmaxwell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jordanmaxwell.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>] it's therefore not just "three books" "published by a PO Box".</p>
<p>I can imagine his work does not sit well with (christian) religionists and other such related organizations and cults, however as I stated in the beginning, as far as notability is concerned, once you delve into subjects such as secret societies and the inner workings of organized religion then there is no way past Jordan Maxwell.

<dd>Perhaps if the person named in the articles you mentioned is notable enough for his own wikipedia article, currently he is not, this article could be merged with him.

<li>You seem to misunderstand WP:V. As I stated with my first comment, the article needs expansion from someone who knows the subject. There are clearly a lot of sources available for that expansion. Hence, WP:V can be easily satisfied. Finally, your comment about wikinews is not relevant to this discussion. A school of higher learning that has been newsworthy enough to garner attention from major sources such as the Washington Post more than qualifies for an article here. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. I see the point of this list -- there are articles with addresses as titles.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm undecided at this point, but one thing that troubles me is that the criteria here seems rather arbitrary. What constitutes a "famous address"? How is this quantified? Why isn't this a list of famous people's addresses? As it stands I see no reason why Oprah's address couldn't be added here and the text "but not just a list of addresses of famous people or things." removed as this seems a rather arbitrary decision to exclude that information by the article creator. Also, where is the sourcing suggesting these are famous addresses? Is this just an example of "I know it is famous so it should be in this list?"--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did you not read the talk page? You seem to have completely missed the point. It is not a list of famous people's address. Would you recognize oprah's address as her address? Would the average person know? Doubtful. How many [americans] recognize "1600 pennsylvania avenue" as the white house? The talk page explains this and gives two litmus tests for this and I explained it above. The criteria is not arbitrary as you believe it to be.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I welcome any input (perhaps this could have been done before AFDing it) on how to make this more clear: the addresses here are recognizable when they stand alone. I think 10 downing street, 221B Baker Street, 1600 pennsylvania ave, and 30 rockefeller plaza are excellent examples that demonstrate this. Would you know oprah's address from jay leno's from tom clancy's from leonard nemoy's?</dd>

<dd>As for "As it stands I see no reason why Oprah's address couldn't be added here". People move and people change addresses. Wikipedia is not a phone book.

<dd>Yes, I read the talk page and I commented there as well. Your point about celebrity addresses is well taken. The problem I still see though is that the addresses you've cited as examples are not sourced as famous, specifically it is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> in the article that these addresses are famous or well known. I think it is an assumption on your part (albeit perhaps a correct one) that most Americans would recognize "1600 pennsylvania avenue", but what of wider notability? How many people in the world would recognize that as the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>? Does the fact that the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> have an article qualify it as a notable address? What about <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> locations that might have significance to the populace of a city and be referred to with their address but are not perhaps generally known by the larger public? I still don't think your litmus test for inclusion is well enough defined.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I initially set the bar to "famous" to make it a more exclusive list but I, like you, recognized the trouble in labelling them as "famous". If lowering the bar to notability presumed by the existance of a WP article is required then so be it. On looking around <a href="../../../4/0/_/40_Wall_Street_14c5.html" title="40 Wall Street">40 Wall Street</a> should probably be added being that it claimed the world's tallest building (albiet for ~1 month).

<li><b>Comment</b> - Changing the title to 'notable' would help, defined as having a WP article. I propose to do that unless there are strong objections. The other thing that is essential is to separate the fictional from real addresses. To give the list utility I suggest a move away from country splits to topic splits. For example 'Notable addresses of world leaders', Notable addresses of fictional detectives' etc. If a couple of these were setup and then filled before the next is created that gets over the incomplete problem, and would give the list real purpose. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Several school deletionists, JoshuaZ notably among them, have tried to tag <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> as rejected, when this is simply NOT the case. The fact that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> has not reached consensus is part of an effort from those who refuse to cooperate to develop objective standards. The fact that the deletionists refuse to offer an alternative leaves <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> as the only viable guideline. It's time that folks come to the table to work on a mutually-acceptable standard, rather than putting up with the claim that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is a rejected standard. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> Many "deletionists" have made specific comments about what they find unacceptable in the current proposal. This has been extensively discussed on the talk page. The end result was that none of them occured. If you want I'll make yet another proposal which will be the same as the current one but missing certain items that I already brought up on the talk page. I doubt it will get any consensus either. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Personally, I don't think using a non-accepted proposal as a guideline is necessarily the best idea... beyond that, calling out the "deletionists" is a bit misleading as there is just as much (and possibly more) opposition to ever working on an accepted guideline by "inclusionists" as well. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but what possible incentive is there for school inclusionists to ever pony up to the table and discuss <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> when virtually every single <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> school that is over the "homeschool" threshhold is kept? If I were an inclusionist and I was seeing even Pre-schools kept on a no consensus, I'm not sure I'd be eager to sit down and discuss guidelines...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am fairly convinced that this will not satisfy Wiktionary's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion">attestation criteria</a>. There are barely a handful of occurrences of this purported word in running text anywhere. This appears to be a protologism, not a word. Interestingly, in contrast, there appears to be evidence that "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/albophobie" class="extiw" title="wikt:albophobie">albophobie</a>" is a word, in French. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki to wiktionary —</b> It's dual root makes it seem like a neologism to me (latin and greek roots combined are unusual). Doing a google search for "Fear of white people" give a plethora of results, from "caucasophobia" to "gringophobia" and "albophobia" in the middle. But we're not here to discuss that - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a dictionary.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Personally, I feel this afd is premature. It would appear that the creator of the article is simply following a request from <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranslation_into_English_French_f372.html" title="Wikipedia:Translation into English/French">Wikipedia:Translation into English/French</a> the article <a href="../../../../fr/a/l/b/Albophobie.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Albophobie">fr:Albophobie</a>, which seems to be quite extensive and would legitimate as an encyclopedia article, but has stopped with the translation because of the AfD, and is confused. The problem is in my opinion is with the title: I'd opt for a <b>rename</b>, possibly Anti-White racism, or something similar.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 15:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I see! The page images are from the French article... Hmm. I agree, they were translating the French article. The only question now is whether the French article is worth translating.

Normally a closer doesn't search, but normally people provide evidence rather than just vague claims of it. On a News search, I get one result and it's a simple mention that isn't very informative. On a regular google search, everything seems to be various random webpages either of credential check sites or other schools / practitioners. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_McKeith_894f.html" title="Gillian McKeith">Gillian McKeith</a> cites at least 2 articles from newspapers... this article cites nothing, none of the "news coverage" of McKeith mentions this group, let alone gives useful information on it.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This group does not seem to be primarily an accreditation mill; it also certifies practitioners, and claims to function as a referral service, etc. It may be scam-like, but it appears markedly more notable than the entry above; for instance, it gets more than 39K Google hits, 713 unique - most of them schools and practitioners mentioning their certification. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 10:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Was in the news as part of the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_McKeith_894f.html" title="Gillian McKeith">Gillian McKeith</a> education scandal. Obviously important to document these groups given the number of schools who cite them as accreditors.

<ul>
<li>1) You listed NO sources for that claim. Perhaps if it is so important it should be included to prove notablity? 2) Just because its on a list does not mean an automatic keep (as you have been told before.) 3) 713 unique google hits is not very many. 4) What are some of these "schools" its connected too? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Not sure what claim you are objecting to. Check the coverage on McKeith. This was major news in the UK. Otherwise, besides the list guidelines, I think we should be documenting all unrecognized accreditors, for the simple reason that people constantly claim bogus degrees from these groups. Merely listing them does not provide enough information for our readers. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Coment</b> - 1. Is every descendant of Ţepeş' notable for being his descendant? 2. The claim of direct lineage is highly unlikely, as anyone vaguely familiar with Romanian history knows (ie: no direct lineage was necessary to become prince, all boyar familes were related to the prince, and something called the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phanariotes.html" title="Phanariotes">Phanariotes</a> came about at some point - Brianna is a descendant, more or less direct, of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caragea.html" title="Caragea">Caragea</a> family, who <i>were not</i> "descendants of Dracula" more than hundreds of other families); even the sources you mention indicate that she is an [indirect] descendant of the 27th generation! Caradja has <i>never</i> made that claim inside Romania, arguably because she knows it is refutable for the said reasons. 3. And what else has she done, pray tell? A Google glance over Romanian journals says that she has: married an American, paid reporters to photograph her (!), married (re-married with?) a man who was <i>supposed</i> to be the son-in-law of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_I_of_Romania_d8e1.html" title="Michael I of Romania">Michael I of Romania</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 08:04, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

As for the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caragea_family.html" title="Caragea family">Caragea family</a>, it seems they have history with Wallachia and that makes it more probable that she's a descendant of Dracula, and there's an article about <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_Caradja_78ee.html" title="Catherine Caradja">Catherine Caradja</a> too (could be family).

<dd>Let me explain som things. I was using tabloids <i>precisely</i> because they are <i>the only Romanian sources</i> on Brianna Cardja you will bump into on the entire internet, and with this kind of topics (in fact, there are two sites or so, with the same news, the odd English-language chat, and then that's it!). If you did not see the point about the Caradjas being a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phanariotes.html" title="Phanariotes">Phanariote</a> family and how that relates to their descendants and their kinship with Dracula, then perhaps you should refrain from commenting on issues having to do with Romanian hisory. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 08:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unbelievable. You are ASSUMING that she's 100% from the Caragea family because of her surname. You haven't done serious research on her family lineage, YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT HER FAMILY LINEAGE IS OR ISN'T. A surname is a surname. It doesn't prove anything. You can have an Arab surname, but that doesn't make you an Arab. You're basing her entire lineage on her surname. And don't tell me to not comment on things. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 09:48, 18 Nov, 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me make it even more clear. Aside from the fact that it is very unlikely to be named Caradja and not be a Caradja in Romania, especially when you also say <i>you're a princess</i>, I will say that she'd better be a Caradja <i>at the very least</i>.

<dd>Not that it matters, but I believe I have told you several times already that Caradja (with or without the name) cannot be a direct descendant. Moreover, I have also mentioned that succession rules in yesteryear Wallachia were absurd (one of all male children, legitimate and illegimate alike, could inherit a title), and direct lineage was a non sequitur (in general, all such claims are dubious). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 16:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't care what her surname is. Surnames change throughout the years. You can't expect a family lineage to have the same surname for 600 years. So a surname isn't really that important. But if his last male descendant died without heirs, that's another thing (I'd like to have a source for this if possible). <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 22:53, 03 Nov, 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1) "Caradja"/"Caragea" is not "Johnson", you know? It's more like "there might have been more than one families named House of Hannover in England". I'd wager that the name was not held by any family other than descendants of the original Carageas, who were Greek and came to Romania in the 1700s (300 years after Dracula died). This would imply that, since a princely claim is involved, Caradja is, <i>at best</i>, a descendant of those people. 2) Turns out I was wrong - I had forgotten that Petru and Alexandru II were brothers. Which leads us to Alexandru Coconul (the Child-Prince), who left no inheritors after his 1627 rule (Mihnea III was, <i>possibly</i>, his brother - he died without inheritors after getting whoopass from the Ottomans in 1659) - see <a href="http://www.sizes.com/time/CHRNWallachia.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sizes.com/time/CHRNWallachia.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. With <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matei_Basarab_8b18.html" title="Matei Basarab">Matei Basarab</a>, princes were no longer nominated after any real hereditary criteria, and all boyar families claimed to descend from the <i>legendary</i> rulers of the 1300s (which, if anything, would make them collateral).</dd>
<dd>Since it is highly unlikely that non-Caradjas could bear <i>both</i> the name Caradja and the "title" of prince (I should warn you that nobody was exactly a prince or princess after the 1870s), Dracula "blood" could only have come to them through a collateral branch; since the male line was extinguished before the 1630s (while parallel branches from Dracula's various brothers and uncles continued to exist) the very probability is ridiculous; since clear rules of succession were never really the case in medieval Wallachia, and women did not have the right to inherit, all such "genealogies" are merely shiny beads for the gullible. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, but please tell me, if she's not a descendant of Dracula, then why is she claiming to be a descendant of Dracula and how is it that the Discovery channel presents it as a fact?

Presumably because they were hoodwinked as well - not every documentary maker is able to check every single fact thoroughly (every time I see documentaries about areas I'm interested in, I spot mistakes). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right. And so it was decided that Brianna Caradja is not a descendant of Dracula by the infallible Wikipedia community. Now, it has become a fact. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 00:43, 04 Nov, 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, she may be a descendent of Dracula (if she is, she's still non-notable because she's 27 generations removed from someone notable). What I'm saying is that there are perfectly sensible reasons why she might claim to be one if she wasn't, and equally sensible reasons why a documentary might say that she was even if she wasn't. You asked two questions and were given two answers. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is blatantly self-publicity and seems to being continually altered and updated, quite possibly by the subject themselves. I fail to see how a very minor presenter of a gaming quiz programme primarily on non-terrestrial television is a suitable subject for Wikipedia. This undoubtable falls short of theWP:VAIN criteria.</p>
<p>Any edits and changes which cast doubt on the credance of the entry are immediately reverted with juvenile spin. Wiki is not a CV page for desperate wannabee starlets. This is a serious encyclopedia project and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I have done this incorrectly. I am relatively new to Wiki, but have become passionate about what it stands for, and find this to be beneath the standards it should rightly quest for.</p>

<li>Comment - whether or not Ms Kramer is important or not to classical historians or whoever, it must be noted a person who regularly appears on a terrestrial TV channel for 6 hours a week is going to be a part of TV history for good or bad. For them to be not noted in Wikipedia shows a snobbery, an elitism and a lacking. Wikipedia is a virtual encyclopedia, if it were printed you'd need to edit, but not on a web site. I should check if the Cillit Bang character 'Barry Scott' or Sugar Puffs 'Honey Monster' are here too. They all make part of TV's chequered History. I have looked at other "to delete" pages &amp; some I've wondered why. Some clearly are the "twaddle" as noted above.</li>

<li>No, she isn't. She is a presenter on ITVPlay, a cable channel with such minority interest that it almost never registers a statistically significant number of viewers. Content from this channel is sometimes simulcast on ITV, but that does not make her an ITV presenter. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 08:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. She ONLY appears on the 'Make Your Play' show which is on ITV for a longer duration than it is on ITV PLAY. Check the start times, you'll see the ITV version starts up to an hour earlier than on ITV PLAY. Therefore in this case, it's more an ITV programme, simulcast on both ITV and segments on ITV PLAY. For this to be debated so strongly, we are drawn to it because we like Alex Kramer (or don't!). Admittedly she is currently little-known outside of TV Quiz circles, where she is very popular (check out fan sites ie <a href="http://shoppingtvbabes.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://shoppingtvbabes.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://shoppingtvbabes.co.uk/</a>), but why should (example) a 16th century artist with no public profile of any sort, be "more worthy" than this entry just as it is more highbrow that a Quiz show.

<li>Dear me, are we now quoting shoppingtvbabes as a source for an encyclopedia, that's the best reason for a delete I've ever seen. What next she should stay because a picture of her appeared in dogsonheat weekly (not that I'm saying it has, but you get my point!)</li>

It most likely violates <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a> and either way, the book itself is not notable enough for this detailed a summary, so the article violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<li><b>Question</b>. Interesting. Good catch on that one. The Emmy was given by the Pacific Southwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

<li><b>Answer</b>. The Emmy he won is technically an Emmy, although it's a <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html#Regional_Emmys" title="Emmy Award">regional Emmy</a> which <i>"are less glamorous than the Prime Time Emmys and are sometimes technical"</i>. I'm torn as to whether this qualifies him for notability. The regional Emmys don't have their own page here; they're just a single paragraph in the <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy.html" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> article. My instinct isn't for a keep vote, but I can't back that up through policy. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></sup> 05:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that winning a regional Emmy should qualify a person under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; note that he was only competing against people in San Diego, Las Vegas, and some mid-size California cities (not Los Angeles or San Francisco). <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Initial comment from author</b> I feel that the article meets the notability criterias. The company has been around since 2004, there has been several printed and non printed articles in independetn and well established, respected news sources, magazines etc. about the company including some full page articles during the last few years (both due pressreleases and due personal interviews of the company officials) both in US and Finland. Additionally Helmi as a company is referede by several independent analysts, including <a href="http://www.rfgonline.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rfgonline.com" rel="nofollow">Rober Francis Group</a>, <a href="http://www.the451group.com" class="external text" title="http://www.the451group.com" rel="nofollow">451 Group</a> among others, in their analysts reports. Obiously most of the information, in terms of source, in the article is from the company itself, but atleast the article tries to be objective there. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 10:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please provide references for the published material in indepdendent, respected publications. This will clearly resolve the notability question in favour of the article.

<dd>In Finland there has been several printed articles about Helmi Technologies, for instance one of the most respected economic magazines of finland "Talouselämä" had an interview of three entepreneurs from Oulu, Helmi had coverage of over one full color page. "Talouselämä" is such news paper, that frequently intervies for instance CEO's of companies like <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia.html" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>. There has also been several other printed articles, not related to press releases, for instance in news paper called "Kaleva" (published in Oulu, Finland, about 200 000 readers). I don't know all the US and English language sources, but I know that there has been articles also in English printed press. Helmi has also been several times, among press and other sources, refered as one of the most promising startups in Oulu, Finland (which is one of the most important software hubs in Finland). I would also say, that since helmi is mentioned in several US analyst reports (definately an independent source), it also makes the case rather strong. Personally, I feel that informative and objective content about some company shouldn't constitute article to be deleted. In that way only big companies end up in to wikipedia, which is shame. Additionally I would like to make a note that there are allready few editors who has edited the article and outsiders from Helmi's stand point. Please also note that the link to the 451 group "protected" content is a full report only focused on Helmi, it goes trough in detailled manner Helmi's product and it's strenghts and weaknesses. Helmi doesn't have any client relationship to the 451 group. I added few references to the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmi_Technologies_ef49.html" title="Helmi Technologies">article page</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 18:06, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A quick google search returns 253,000 pages thats a reasonible quantity of hits and lends itself towards notibility. From within wikipedia the article has no links to it from other articles which I would like to know/see how it can contribute to the overall project by supporting other articles.

<dd>Above note is correct, just thought, that for credibility shake (so that there will be no "hidden agendas" discussion"), I should place my background on user page as well so that everybody know that I'm part of the source (original page was entered by some one else, propably by some one of our US employees). I feel that there could be links from other articles to this one, and I'm quite sure that there will bee soon enough. The thing though is that article is so new, that there hasn't been too much time for links to appear. We're putting significant resources in to use of Open Source community. Obiously, Helmi is a small company compared to IBM and ohter large contributors, but compared the overall resources of Helmi it's very significant, there are 6-8 full time employees involved in to Open Source development all the time (and it's going to grow significantly).<a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 11:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What comes to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> section on soapbox, I feel that current article tries to be objective. There is facts like locations, employees, history etc. about the company, objective information about state of the product as well as references to some independent sources (there has been hundreds of mentionings about the company in press). The primary reason for the article is not advertizing, but provide company information in relation to open source community. In case you feel that it should be changed some way in regards to quidelines descriped in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, the article should be changed such a way. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 11:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would say that this is the perfect example of listcruft. Is there an encyclopaedic topic <i>nicknames mentioned by Chris Berman</i>? Doesn't look like it.

As to 'citing actual sources,' most of these Bermanisms—even all—may derive from simply watching Berman on ESPN. (I recognize virtually all the baseball examples, most-to-all used on multiple occasions/broadcasts.) Thus, there is no citable text or website. This also happens to be a very thorough list of Bermanisms and explanations of their meanings/derivations, thus it's very valuable. D3gtrd 3:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel it should not be deleted. It may be a small party and you may not agree with it, but that is no reason to delete it form Wikipedia. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_First_Party_a68d.html" title="England First Party">England First Party</a> are a party just as small of the EIP, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> have as many councillors as the English Independence Party (0). `BBC news article from years ago` this is telling of the history of the party. It's a small and fairly young party so you cannot expect that the party will have been advertised as much as <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour.html" title="Labour">Labour</a> or the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> and [[England First Party] haven't been advertised much will you delete them?. Nor can you expect as many elections to be fought by such a small party, the funds simply arn't there. If your only reason to delete this is because of a lack of referances you could delete the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_First_Party_a68d.html" title="England First Party">England First Party</a> article with only 3 referances and the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> with 0 referances&#160;!<a href="../../../r/_/j/User%7ER_johnson_954a.html" title="User:R johnson">R johnson</a> 11:43, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The core of your argument appears to be an admission that this party isn't notable at the moment but should be or might be one day. So you do nothing to assert the notabiliy of this page (which I note you created and which you have been the only real contributor to...)</li>
<li>As far as I can see this party doesn't have <i>any</i> elected representatives, and its sole participation has been its founder running in one parliamentary election (losing his deposit) and in one council election.

<li>So your argument for deleteing the article is because the party has been unsuccessful in getting representatives into councils etc? May I note that the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> have no representatives of any form in councils etc. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_First_Party_a68d.html" title="England First Party">England First Party</a> doesn't have many more members than the EIP. I did not create the page only edited it. All the reason you have given me to delete this article could be used to delete alot of other articles. 84.66.69.76 12:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You are wrong I am afraid. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> have two members who are elected councillors, as do the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_First_Party_a68d.html" title="England First Party">England First Party</a>. The English Democrats, certainly, have received a certain amount of publicity and many people have heard of them. Not sure about the English First Party - I've personally never heard of them.</li>
<li>If you think other articles should be deleted feel free to propose them - but that isn't an argument for keeping this one. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 12:40, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, he didn't create it that I can tell, also note his recent activities on the article have largely consisted of repeatedly removing mentions of its electoral failures, which still has yet to be explained despite many many requests; combined with adding unverifiable material. Given the almost total lack of secondary source material about the party, I don't see why it shouldn't be <b>deleted</b>. If it gets a single councillor my position may change. Comparisons to <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> are specious&#160;: that party, for better or worse, has had far more press coverage and for that matter candidacies. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 12:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am English and have never heard of this party. Neither the party nor its founder score significantly on the Google test. Having gone to the trouble fo putting their accounts in External Links, the figures confirm that the party is vanishingly insignificant with their year's total income of around £2,000. The party has no elected representatives, at any level, and if that ever changes tere will probably be some millinery consumption going on. In short: a one man band, and the one man does not appear to be notable as a result (unlike, say, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Boaks_162d.html" title="Bill Boaks">Bill Boaks</a>, whose quixotic parliamentary campaigns got him a good deal of notice). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:21, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>RJohnson, can you please let the rest of us know your role in this party? It seems to me you are using Wikipedia to create the impression that a virtually non-existent political party is in fact active and notable, which it clearly isn't.

<li>Whether the content is valuable is beside the point. Whether the content is <i>verifiable</i> is, however. One of the points raised in the nomination is that there are <i>no sources other than the party's own web site</i> for anything <i>except</i> the election result, which should of course be mentioned in the result table for the election, <i>and already is</i>. To justify having <i>more</i> than just a single line in a results table, there needs to be source material from independent sources that is itself more than just a single line in a list of election results. There isn't such material. Coverage such as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/280.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/280.stm" rel="nofollow">this</a> is just 1 line in an election results table.
<p>Moreover, <a href="http://www.uepengland.com/scms/english-politics.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uepengland.com/scms/english-politics.html" rel="nofollow">this article's</a> description of this political party makes for good reading, indicating as it does that nobody knows anything about this party apart from rumours and what is on its web site, and they don't trust that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Not much is known about this party, although sources have told us that they stand for a white England. We have also been informed that this party does not agree with Immigration or a multi-cultural society, so it seems this party could be more on the lines of an English BNP. This information however could be incorrect, and we cannot verify this as there is no E-mail address on the web site etc. Anyway, to judge for yourself, visit the link."</p>
</blockquote>
The size of the party, which you are also trying to make the focus of the discussion, is also beside the point. To warrant an encyclopaedia article, we need more material than just 1 single web site published by the party itself, which is <i>all</i> that is available here. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> for simply re-hashing a political party's own propaganda. But <i>without any independent sources whatsoever</i>, that is the <i>only</i> thing that an article on this party can ever be.
<p>The 1 line in the election results table is all that can be found <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia, and is all that should be found <i>inside</i> Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:07, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

`RJohnson, can you please let the rest of us know your role in this party? It seems to me you are using Wikipedia to create the impression that a virtually non-existent political party is in fact active and notable, which it clearly isn't.
<p>Wikipedia should be about things that are already notable - it should be used as a tool to promote things that aren't.`</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not a member of the party if that was what you ment. It is not non-existent it is active, the EFP has never been in the paper are you going to delete there article after this? The Englanf First Party and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_b397.html" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> both have few if no referances so I find deleteing this article for that reason is poor. The UEP description is very old it was written when the party didn't have a website and you could only call Christopher Nickerson to find out anything, i have email the admin of UEP to update the description and nothing is ever done. I honestly don't see the reason why you want it deleted. It is similar to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">BNP</a> but a little less racist, politicians find the EIP less extreme to talk with. Wikipedia plays host to alot of small "pointless" parties.</li>
<li>`One of the points raised in the nomination is that there are no sources other than the party's own web site`</li>
<li>Have you been on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_First_Party_a68d.html" title="England First Party">EFP</a> article? Did you notice there are only three referances.

<li><b>Delete</b>, despite this party contesting in the general elections, it doesn't assert much notability. With the sources given, it has a vague mention in the BBC articles and other sources come from its website. The party has not enough coverage by the media and it has very few obscure candidates.

You could delete half of the articles of Wikipedia for a lack of referances.
<ul>
<li>Not notable.</li>
</ul>
You could easily delete 50% of articles about British political parties that have articles of Wikipedia. At least the EIP has a history. Until you provide a reason i'm unconvinced. I do not make it my business to accuse people but I believe you purely want to delete this article as a {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} not a nuetral stance. <a href="../../../r/_/j/User%7ER_johnson_954a.html" title="User:R johnson">R johnson</a> 11:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop with the paranoia. Please especially stop with the "I don't like to accuse people" stuff, when your very first response to this deletion debate was to accuse <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">User:SandyDancer</a> of wanting to delete the party because supposedly <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">User:SandyDancer</a> disagrees with the party (of which you provided no evidence).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is there are NO independent sources about this party - and you keep removing bits you don't like or find embarrasing - repeatedly over and over abusing the minor edit feature and refusing to supply a reason. If anyone is using the article to POV push it is you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The policies of the party in question have nothing to do with it. Other political party articles may not have references right now, but they are generally sourceable - the sources actually exist, and only remain to be added. This article has no good sources. Because there ARE NO GOOD SOURCES. You seem to have been adding information based on email with Nickerson, which is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SOURCE, as I have told you on your talk page. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 12:08, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He's a character. He appears on the show when it's appropriate. Fits my definition of wrestling character. That he's not on all the time means he is a minor character, which isn't surprising since he's not a wrestler, let alone a big name one. But is he any different from any of the other minor entries on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_roster_f348.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment roster">World_Wrestling Entertainment roster</a>&#160;?

<dd>Well, I'm right, and you're wrong, deal with it. They just have him on screen once in awhile if someones injury plays into a storyline, like stiching them up or giving a shot, for instance. On that roster page, I know for sure that 2 of the writers, Chris Dejoseph and Brian Gerwirtz have had their pages deleted, and they are probably more notable than this person.

<dd><i>I'm right and you're wrong?</i> That's not a convincing argument. Sorry. You might wish to leave such outbursts out of your replies. And while certainly being employed by the WWE doesn't garner notability, being on-screen in front of millions of people is another matter. It's be one thing if he was only on once, but the article itself indicates he's been on several times.

<dd>I agree, all of those points are useful information, and should be included in the article. However, lacking sources on them, all we could do is say we don't know. This doesn't mean nobody knows, as it is quite possible that the community of professional wrestling afficiandos (of which there are many) may well have a great deal of knowledge on him, from reliable sources. At the least, I'd expect somebody with at least some established authority to say "No, that sort of thing doesn't exist at all" before I'd agree with deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b>- I appreciate your desire to be an inclusionist, but I'm not sure this article is salvageable at this time. It needs to be torn to the ground completely and maybe someone can build a new one. Is anyone prepared to actually look at the third-party sources listed on the artist's website and draw information from them directly? Artists from the visual arts field tend to be horrible writers when it comes to factual pieces. This is a prime example. <b>Notability is not the only criteria. Someone has to be prepared to do real research and write a good, encyclopedic article.</b> If no one is ready, willing and able then we MUST delete and put this artist's name on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">the list of articles that are wanted but not created.</a> Trimming the text won't be enough to keep this <i>piece of copyright infringement.</i> According to Wikipedia's very own <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad_Patrick_1861.html" title="User:Brad Patrick">Brad Patrick</a> in <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" rel="nofollow">shoot on sight</a>, "draconic" measures are necessary to remove excessive vanity articles that threaten <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>'s credibility.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I did some further work on the bibliography to eliminate any remaining copyright infringement, discarding most of the material from the original article, and adding citations that I was able to verify myself. At this point, the article is more of a stub, but being a stub is not reason in itself for deletion. Laurent Pariente seems quite notable, based on all the evidence, and after all the pruning that has taken place, there's not much remaining of the original article. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:10, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>keep</b> I want to reply to Officegirl and MichaelCurtis: First Guitemie Maldonado and i wrote the presentation in my article. To my knowledge I don't see why this article is not encyclopedic. It's a very good introduction about my work which as all visual work is not easy to describe. Second there are a good deal of visual artists in the entire history who have been both tremendous visual artist and exceptional writers. I have myself written numerous articles on my work as well on other artists. Being a visual artist doesn't make me illiterate. Third, again if you consider the work worthwile as Truthbringer seemed to have understoond, you should give it a chance instead of trimming it like a bonzaï (I'm currently working in Japan), and be happy to have one more interesting creator becoming part of Wikipedia. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>keep</b> Hello, I'm Laurent Pariente and I only put the information I had in hands right now. If you go to my website you would see I have done a lot of personal and creative work so far and all the information I put on Wikipedia is just mine and will grow with time. Deleting my article won't help growing the article. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Nothing more than an advertorial for a candidate in an upcoming municipal election. Does not meet the minimum standards in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Candidates for local office are not notable, and Mr. Seeton does not appear to be notable enough for other reasons to merit an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 13:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - If for nothing more than originial respearc and POV. If some sources were cited, I would have to retract my delete nom though. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 13:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The article's claim to notability is largely based on Seeton's political career. It even goes so far as to state (in reference to the 2000 Ottawa Bay Ward City Council elections) "He had an extremely strong showing for a first time candidate but lost that election to Cullen." Reading this, I was led to believe that the dark horse really challanged the incumbent and lost in a norrow victory, which could have helped the claim for notability. However, after reading up on the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_municipal_election%2C_2000.html#City_council" title="Ottawa municipal election, 2000">mentioned election</a>, I learned that Seeton placed <i>4th</i> in the race with a mere 550 votes (3.67%) whereas the winner held 7191 votes (48.02%) and the runner up got 6262 (41.82%). This strikes me as a misleading statement in an article about a candidate who already seems non-notable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 16:00, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article is still full of POV ("well known in political circles for his forward thinking", "Seeton is campaigning on bringing new ideas to Kanata North", "He will garner allot of support from those who are concerned with the environment, transit, as well as their bottom line", etc.), not to mention unsourced statements. BTW, Mr. Seeton's own web site likely does not constitute the verifiable, reliable source that is required (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). I'm not sure how www.wikipedia.org, or the intro page of the City's own website, constitute sources for any of the statements in this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - clearly nn, vanity. This is an article for a minor group that used to be a society at BUGS but got chucked out for severe breach of the constitution. This event itself is noteworthy, but is discussed in depth on the BUGS page, so the group doesn't justify its own page. LeeWhittaker 13:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Article makes assertion of non-notabiliuty by cliaming it is 1 of hundereds of such organizations. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 13:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> anything useful into the main BUGS article. I've had to fight off two waves of vandals over this article originating from the IP's correlating to that university, so this article will be a smoking wreck if not deleted anyway. --<a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl">In ur base, killing ur dorfs</a> 14:40, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Maybe keep</b> - Valid point about the fact that vandalism - however, if they're IP's correlating to the uni, I suspect they were the same vandal (the vandalised discussion page seemed to imply the same thing) and that said person will grow up and get bored of trolling fairly soon. My only hesitation is that there's a feeling at BUECU (I'm associated with them - my job involves supporting evangelical theology students at Brum uni, and to a lesser extent BUECU as part of that), including among the exec, that legal action may be necessary in order to return to the guild (and possibly retain the funds - the guild have promised to return it on certain criteria, basically fulfilled, but they stalled and I don't know if they have yet). Legal advice has indicated that BUECU is 99% likely to win and thus the guild will - a number of high-ranking Christian lawyers are eager for BUECU to do this, in fact, in order to set a precedent throughout the country, which would be a particularly notable event, and not easily able to be fitted into the existing BUGS article, unless it was significant. This may easily happen in the next few months, and would possibly be rather notable. I don't know if it's easily possible to resurrect old articles, but that might be something worth bearing in mind in the deletion process. But as it stands, I think the fact that the event is discussed on the BUGS page is a good point.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheologyJohn_ded0.html" title="User:TheologyJohn">TheologyJohn</a> 15:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete or merge with UCCF</b> - Seems very vandal prone, by someone who obviously isn't a fan of the group but that in itself is not reason to delete. I think BUECU would be able to get the funds, which they should be getting, but they won't be able to get back in as they made virtually no effort to comply with the BUGS constitution, whether for the right or wrong reasons being a long debate. The BUGS constitution making it clear that all processes must be democratic and that societies can't discriminate, and all other societies have got back in line. I don't feel two sentences about a group of which there are hundreds similar nationwide merits a whole article, hence I've suggested deletion or incorporation into UCCF. The only part relevant to BUGS is already there, under controversy, I don't think a disaffiliated group needs mentioning over the 160+ current societies James Bowes 15:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No change from my previous ambiguous feeling</b> - James, I'm aware that the guild are acting entirely in accordance with their constitution (which does allow them to make exceptions, e.g. Niteline, I understand), the legal question is about more than whether that's the case - the guild constitution goes against government guidelines etc, and the lawyers verdict is that we're 99% likely to win an order to the guild to force us back in (presumably by ammending the constitution). I disagree with some of your comments about the rights and wrongs about BUECU's relationship with the guild, but I think that's a whole other debate, and if it's worth having is better carried out in person rather than in this particular context! (The fence between our gardens alright for you!;) ) I have no idea whether or not the funds have yet been returned, but I know the guild stalled for a long time. So basically no strong feelings about whether or not the article should exist, but wanting to raise the particular point and counteract your counter-point.&#160;:)<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheologyJohn_ded0.html" title="User:TheologyJohn">TheologyJohn</a> 16:36, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disturbing comment justified</b> - the IP of the poster is very close to that of the previous vandal of the site. That said, while it's helpful that the motives of the proposor of the deletion are thus highly dubious, I do think it's a legitimate question as to whether BUECU has sufficient significance by wikipedia criteria to have it's own article. (Not that I have any particular answer.) Although it is questionable as to whether it's likely to encourage vandalism and trolling by actually bowing to their requests. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheologyJohn_ded0.html" title="User:TheologyJohn">TheologyJohn</a> 17:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect to the BUGS article</b> Normal practice is to merge student groups to the relevant university or school, unless there is overwhelming evidence of notability. We have two independent published sources about the controversy, but none about the group. So notability isn't overwhelmingly established. If BUGS is the right place to take it for a UK group, fine by me. And it is already there, checking the Wikilink from the article. I remember a similar incident at <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tufts_University_160e.html" title="Tufts University">Tufts University</a> in the States a few years back that got plenty of media coverage, but don't think that group would notable either. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:33, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A list, of which two entries are cited (and one more is probably unambiguous given that Roy Orbison's biographers tell the story of the sunglasses). But really, is the topic of people who are ususally seen wearing shades encyclopaedic? If so, is it encyclopaedic enough to support a list? Anyway, what constitutes sunglasses? Any tinted spectacles? If so tha Galaghers are in, but so are half the people who achieved fame in the 70s. In the end I think this is too random a subject. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:54, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article was nominated for speedy deletion for a lack of context, but that doesn't apply. The notability of this site is asserted, but not (yet?) referenced.

<p>As above stated from Kostas, this website provides a general walk-through to the visitors coming to Greece. We have seen tons of people visiting the website to find information about Greece. It Wikipedia's purpose is to have useful information, then i think this article is directly related.</p>
<p>Other than that, i will be soon updating this article and provide *complete* information about one of the world's earliers profession (prostitutes), and how that influenced ancient Greece and their people. bourdela.com is the ONLY website related to that.

It just seemed a bit suspicious to me since you made the edits at two seperate times and neglected to mention why Kostas did not post his or her own reply.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> (G10, see below) Per EVula, subject possibly meets notability requirement by being the subject of a notable court case.

More importantly, the article accuses a law officer of perjury, coercing witnesses and fabricating evidence, which may be considered libelous if not cited and/or proven in court. I say speedy this b/c of the attack/libel issue. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 21:08, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Disputed murder convictions is a well accepted topic. Robert Rivera was very newsworthy when his case was active. The Delaware County Daily Times (circulation 160,000+) featured him on the front page many times and lists over 70 articles about him. The site is backed up by trial transcripts and police reports recorded by government officials. The items involving the law officer mentioned are backed up by the transcripts and reports. No conviction can be disputed unless there is some contention that the prosecution's case is false. Prosecution witnesses cannot sue for libel because someone contests their testimony. There is no libel issue here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Users are free to contest specifics and rewrite sections they think are unsupported. Something could be wrong, but no one has found any specifics. This article violates the POV of some users who want to censor by deleting any mention that government prosecutors are capable of error. Wikipedia does contain many articles on individuals who were legitimately convicted. I am not aware that they are contested on POV grounds because they fail to cite that prosecutors sometimes make mistakes. Wikipedia should contain accurate facts, not just puff pieces of a world viewed through rose-colored glasses. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 19:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Danras, I don't believe that Wikipedia is any more biased than the rest of society when it comes to highly controversial cases. It's not that we want to censor opposing viewpoints, it's just that those viewpoints need to be independently documented. The only reference you currently offer is the robertrivera1.com website, which for the most part only presents one POV. If you can add in other references, such as press coverage and opposition writings, this article has a better chance of surviving. Check out <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumia_Abu-Jamal_fb96.html" title="Mumia Abu-Jamal">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a>'s article for an example of the kind of article you want to write. Even though the Abu-Jamal article still has neutrality problems, it is much more well-documented than the current Rivera article. --<span style="border:3px solid #00f;font-weight:bold;background-color:#c00;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk"><span style="color:#fff;">RoninBK</span></a><sub><span style="background-color:#fff;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_Esperanza_3389.html" title="User:Roninbk/Esperanza"><span style="background-color:#0f0;">E</span></a><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></span></sub></span> 03:28, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the "items involving the law officer mentioned are backed up by the transcripts and reports", then cite them. Official court documents are legitimate sources. But if the court permitted certain evidence and testimony that is in dispute, then the reason and source of the dispute <i>needs</i> to be referenced. Also, language like "fabricated circumstantial evidence", "snitch story" and "fabricated confession" without substantiation shows "opinion and bias" and thusly violates <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>, and potentially <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a>. If you can cite legitimate sources that show the prosecution acted in bad faith, then do so and I'll withdraw my objection. But as it stands, this article cannot survive as is when <a href="http://www.robertrivera1.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.robertrivera1.com" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and <a href="http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/r/rivera-helton_katelyn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/r/rivera-helton_katelyn.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> (both equally spurious sources) tell completely different versions of the events, but the WP article only chonicles one side. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 08:34, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep per Captaintruth below!</b>. The article can be greatly expanded, give it a stub tag and give the article some time to grow. Actually, I'm not the creator of this article - but I am seeing if I can source this article properly. I've asked for some time to do so, but Wikipediatrix seems to be a bit impatient. When this article was created, I along with several other editors, assisted a new editor in some technical aspects of creating this particular article. I think there may be some value to this one, and I'm trying to explore the background of this particular music scene. I think this article may be something that can be sourced and expanded like the article on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_rap.html" title="Southern rap">Southern rap</a>, which has sections on "spirituality" "typical features" and things besides just the music. I think it's an interesting article on a regional social style and should be given a chance. <s>Perhaps it needs a change of title?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In the small amount of investigation I’ve been able to pursue over the past few days while I recover from surgery, it looks like South Florida, specifically Miami, is a major, innovative and unique hotspot for music from the State of Florida. I think I understand what <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatience561_0223.html" title="User talk:Patience561">User talk:Patience561</a> was trying to say and I don’t think <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">Music of Florida</a> quite does the southern region of Florida justice. I believe there may be sufficient material for “Music of South Florida” to have its own article. With the heavy influence of Cuban and Latino music added to the innovative and unique Rap style of the area, further mixing in southern rock, and a country heritage that brings a unique blend of sounds out of the southern Florida region, it looks like a “Music of South Florida” article could be rich with interesting and unique information.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I understand your desire to clean up and save this article. From the history, it looks as if you have been fighting this battle largely on your own since the other main editor stopped tending the page in July. Maybe a change of title would help the article more than a tone of work. The AfD will be open for several days (at least 5 in most cases) which should give you a bit of time to work on it. The AfD nomination will also bring quite a bit of support from Wikipedia Inclusionists who will help you clean up the article. I'll do some poking around on my own to see what support I can give you. In the mean time, I'll hold off judgement by changing my proposed delete to an undecided. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 17:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I further agree that it should keep going in the direction it is going but I also feel other editors should get involved so this does not turn into a one man show.

Can we discuss the article on it's talk page? I'm looking for sources, but my time is limited. I'm recovering from major surgery and don't really have the stamina to sit in front of the computer too long just yet. Bad timing....:) What should the title be changed to? How do do I do that? Create a new article and move the contents of this one, or ask an admin to change it? Suggestions on a new title are welcome! Looks like the "Donk Donk" content is easily sourcable...what are your thoughts on a title based on Donk..:) Many thanks to you and Bobby both for your offers of help!

<p><b>Keep</b> and apply stub tag. South Florida has made outsized musical contributions (Jimmy Buffett, the Miami Bass sound, hub for latin music to provide a few examples).

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's a no-brainer (at least to me) that since Miami is in South Florida, most of the info about Florida music in general would logically be here. The question is, is there a reason to differentiate this from the non-existent article Music of North Florida? For example, even though most of the notable music scene of Illinois is in Chicago, we don't place it in an article called Music of North Illinois. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:59, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. IMHO, it's simple, because South Florida is such an incredibly robust music scene, so completely different than the rest of Florida that it truly is a no-brainer that it should have it's own article - a concept well covered under <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> - because there is no doubt that the information on the South Florida music scene would dominate "Music of Florida". As far as I can see, this in no way requires the creation of a “Music of North Florida” to “differentiate” the two. "Music of Florida" <i>itself</i> should also be expanded to include older and broader music history of the state. There's nothing in Illinois to compare to it. Please let us enthusiastically expand both <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_South_Florida_ac31.html" title="Music of South Florida">Music of South Florida</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">Music of Florida</a>. You can revisit them a month or two from now and see if they deserve life or extinction.

<li>There is plenty of notable music info re North Florida. For example, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> is from <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_Beach%2C_Florida_1bd6.html" title="Daytona Beach, Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a> and Lynyrd Skynyd is from the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacksonville%2C_Florida_dcd8.html" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. I am sure that there are numerous country stars from the area that some research would reveal. As for Central Florida, ever heard of the whole boy band craze of the 90s? The fact of the matter is that South Florida is quite distinct culturally from the rest of the state and its musical flavor (carribean and latin influences, urban edge, etc.) reflect this distinction. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 20:10, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dictionary definition. Not sure how to transwiki this to Wiktionary, which might accept it. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:07, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Note</b> I'm also including Snoofing in this AfD, as it too is a dictionary definition page. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:10, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Snoofing is not just a word it is an encyclopedia article and should remain as it is a robust new concept, that give a supporting verb (doing word) to new events, that have only become available and are doable due to changes in a capitalist society since Adam Smith, Fordism, Taylorism, Thatcherism, Reaganomics, etc. and wireless technology (WiFi). Snoofing is a process, outcome and product of changing and evolving capitalism and technology based society, which is global. This single word sums up a culture of change and is common to all cultures and societies, which move in a capitalist and technological state of progress.</p>
<p>Luddites would do no “Snoofing” as they would not use WiFi or aspire to capitalist and technological change as a snoof. (Snoof (Selfish New Object Orientated Flirtation) (Noun) to analyse resources and be questioning with the objective of critical evaluation and / or personal gain (Noun) one who snoofs For example Consultants’ may use Snoofing techniques to find out information which may be used against Luddite thinking for critical evaluation and gain of the Consultant. Therefore, this is a concept and not a mere dictionary word.</p>
<p>This Snoofing concept is commonly regarded as a correct reflection of a changing society, which has been summed up in a single word. Therefore the concept of Snoofing has a rightful life outside of a dictionary as it is a growing culture, of greed, envy and critical review, which has been defined in a word for a changing society. The Snoofing concept is defined in the Urban Dictionary. See <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snoofing" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snoofing" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snoofing</a></p>
<p>Rather than mark for deletion Snoofing should be expanded and deeper embedded in other concepts of Economics and Technology that reflect our changing societies.</p>

<dd>Not part of a content dispute, rather I was reading the article and said, "Wait, this doesn't meet notability guidelines."

I don't think that there's been considerable discussion over whether or not being the child of a president automatically creates encyclopedic notability. It's an important topic to be discussed. I'm not co-nominating the articles, only this one in order to see where this discussion goes first.

<dd>I understand it, I'm just saying that it's not to "resolve" a content dispute. The realization that it doesn't meet bio standards came after I sought 3O - ie realizing that people seem to automatically assume encyclopedic notability simply by being the child of a president. If it were a monarchial society where the children had governing roles then I would say ok they're notable. I think that it merits a discussion, as I've said. I didn't rescind my 3O figuring that I might as well get a comment regarding the content dispute. That should actually point to the fact that see the AfD and the 3O as two separate issues. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 17:53, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Criteria for Notability (must satisfy one):
<dl>
<dd>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</dd>
<dd>Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage.5 Just being an elected local official does not guarantee notability.</dd>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> The question is whether he meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Robert seems to be claiming that he meets it MECO and criterion 5. I haev not however seen any evidence that MECO is a signficiant or well-known concept in the field. While he has papers published in respectabe journals, most of the articles about him (such as <a href="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" class="external text" title="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) make clear that he has gotten little or no attention from the mainstream astrophysics community.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would argue that it is a significant concept in the field of astrophysics because it proposes an alternative to black holes. This is significant just as alternative theories for the big bang are significant. Until someone can come out and prove one way or another that one theory is <i>absolutely</i> correct, any plausible hypothesis (which MECO certainly is) deserves to be debated. Combine this rationale with the numerous articles published on the subject (found on the MECO page, some of which review Mitra's work) and we are left with a clear candidate for crit 5 of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProf_bc6c.html" title="WP:Prof">WP:Prof</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 20:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Absolutely not. The standard for whether something is significant in a field is whether people in the field have found it significant. The above claim is particularly hard to swallow given the standard of having to "prove one way or another that one theory is <i>absolutely</i> correct" since this never happens in science by definition. We need evidence astrophysicists find the idea notable, not that you or some random individual or even a few astrophysicists find it "plausible" Furthermore, I fail to see "numerous" articles about the subject. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A few astrophysicists finding it plausible constitute "multiple independent" sources and hence satisfies the notability crit. As such, "people in the field" have found it significant satisfying your criterion. As long as plausible alternatives to describing so called black holes exist, and until we eliminate them as possible theories, they are notable and worthy of inclusion so that researchers and anybody else who is curious can get a sense for all theories proposed and not just the most popular one (quick note so I don't get pegged for this: I'm not suggesting that alternate theories presented on wikipedia should be taken as fact; I'm just saying it's a good place to get a general sense about a field before doing some solid research within a good library). I don't understand your comment about absolute certainty "never happens in science by definition". I have never seen a definition of science which does not allow for certainty. I am certain, for example, that the moon revolves around the earth, and the earth around the sun. This was not always widely believed, and at one point this theory would have been considered absurd. As we expand the limits of the known, things that once seemed like pipe dreams become very plausible, and can (in time) become certainties. I'm not sure quite where I'm going with this, but I'm also not sure what your objection to MECO is. I am admittedly not into astrophysics (math is my comfort zone) and perhaps you are better versed in this issue than I. However, from what I've read, Mitra's theory is notable enough to warrent its own wikipedia page, which seems to indicate that Mitra deserves one as well (not an acid test, but I've already cited a crit which I believe is met and maybe this line of reasoning works better for you). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 21:56, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <b>The issue is the notability of Dr. Mitra, not the notablity of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetospheric_eternally_collapsing_object.html" title="Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object">MECO</a> theory.</b> First of all, the MECO theory is not extraordinary, but instead is one of many theories that seek to explain how <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> really does not permit <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black holes</a> to exist. I personally have reason to believe that all such theories are mistaken, but will not contest the MECO as an encyclopedic subject due to the attention that it has garnered. My issue instead is one of whether Dr. Mitra is automatically becomes encyclopedic because he has contributed to the MECO concept. I really fail to see that. Instead I see an article about a relatively minor scientist that is very unlikely to ever be more than a stub. Even now it says little more than that Dr. Mitra is a contributor to the MECO concept, somcething that can already be inferred from the MECO article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The controversy due to the MECO theory has earned him enough notability in the mainstream Indian media (<a href="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" class="external text" title="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/03hole.htm" rel="nofollow">rediff</a>, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/800815.cms" class="external text" title="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/800815.cms" rel="nofollow">Times of India</a> and <a href="http://www.siliconeer.com/past_issues/2004/september2004.html#Anchor--MA-57906" class="external text" title="http://www.siliconeer.com/past_issues/2004/september2004.html#Anchor--MA-57906" rel="nofollow">elsewhere too</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:54, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I see <b>no</b> notability in those links. The first link is to the same article as the second link, and the third link is to a magazine article that is mostly a cut-and-paste job from that same article. So in the end there is <b>only one article</b> that you are referencing. To make matters worse, this business of "challenging Hawking" is a standard "crackpot" tactic. Also, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a> has nothing to do with Mitra's MECO concept. So the article being linked to speaks more of a fringe scientist trying to make himself look good than a notable scientist talking about his work. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- Well my point is that the largest Indian newspaper and website have found the scientist notable enough to write an article about him. Even if it is the same article, it features in both the sites making him notable outside of the scientific community. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Being noted does not make you notable. That article fails to give Mitra a standing beyond being one of the main contributors to the MECO, and while notable the MECO remains a fairly obscure theory. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject of this article is about a song that is not notable (not even a single) off of Tool's record <a href="../../../1/0/%2C/10%2C000_Days_1ce8.html" title="10,000 Days">10,000 Days</a>. It was clearly made in an effort to subvert the page <a href="../../../1/0/%2C/10%2C000_Days_%28Wings_Pt_2%29_b22c.html" title="10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)">10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)</a>, which is the actual title of the song, and which currently redirects to the album's main page. I tried to send the article through the proposed deletion process, but the prod tag was removed by an anonymous user with no justification whatsoever. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Bee_6533.html" title="User:King Bee">King Bee</a> 19:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm with Yanksox on your <b>ludicrously</b> long signature. I'm also against you that notable alums is a "generally acceptable" means of inclusion. <b>Nothing</b> about the school debate is generally accepted. I'm generally against keeping all schools (I'm much more against lower-level schools than high schools, though), but I'm <i>especially</i> against the idiotic "notable alumni" clause. Almost every school that ever existed has some notable alumni, because pretty much every notable person of the past two centuries at least went to elementary and middle school, so chances are that <i>one</i> person of note went to any given school. Moreover, people generally don't choose where they go to school, so saying that a school is notable simply because one person with a WP article was forced to go there for three or four years is- in my opinion- stupid. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I do think we should have an article for all high school's that have been around for longer than 50 years (and/or) have notable alums. The article on this particular school needs to be expanded, but that's no reason to delete it. School's are often notable if they've been around for a while, and I do think that it is interesting to see where various famous people spent their later childhood. If you feel differently, join the debate at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">the proposed notability guidelines for schools</a>. As to the sig, sorry about that. I'm a 4th of July American Baby so I've always loved patriotic colors. It should take up less room not.

<li><b>Transwiki to wiktionary —</b> Dictionary def -&gt; wikitionary. However, it is (from my research with a Greek dictionary) a real word (etymologically speaking) and literally means "fear of all opinions". A google search for "fear of opinions" gies results which back up this article, though I agree that it is phobiacruft here on WP (yes... phobiacruft is a word...). <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 23:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know - as I stated in my comment above, I have googled to find confirmation for myself that allodoxaphobia is a word, and then, as I always do, I checked that it was etymologically real (as a phobia) by looking it up. Note that I also said "(etymologically speaking)" by way of a disclaimer for my research - etymologically it stands, but otherwise, it may fail - hence my googling. I hope this clears it up - thanks, <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 00:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi - I've searched for a while, but really can't find anything which would satisfy wiktionary's criteria (something I was not previously familiar with - apologies).

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Under WP:BIO, William merits inclusion based on the criterion: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". William is both an editor and an author of his own work. William's work has received hundreds of thousands of views by an international audience and has been independently commented upon and rated by that international audience. William's work may not feature in national galleries or on television, but this does not mean one can discriminate against the value of William's work, for on the basis of popularity alone, William's work is a notable achievement (and continues to become ever more notable). Moreover, if other YouTube celebrities are admissible into this encyclopedia, then so too should William be (you only have to look at William's subscription levels on YouTube as proof of his place amongst other YouTube celebrity peers). YouTube is an artistic phenomenon of our time that allows artists and others a vehicle to connect with the world, and in the case of some, YouTube delivers fame and notoriety, which cannot be dismissed as insignificant. --DavidRWilson 23:42, 4 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— DavidRWilson (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidRWilson_b329.html" title="User talk:DavidRWilson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DavidRWilson_7538.html" title="Special:Contributions/DavidRWilson">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>I don't understand what you mean, "People <i>on YouTube</i>". The point is that <i>people</i> want to have an article on him; how is it possibly relevant whether they know him from YouTube or anywhere else? Where do the "Wikipedia standards" say anything about YouTube? 50,000 people watching his videos is 50,000 people. If you had decided that 50,000 was not enough exposure to be famous, I would understand your position, if disagree with it. But when you say that 50,000 is not enough because those are "people on YouTube", I don't understand your logic. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 04:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This is not the Youtube directory. Notability isn't based on how many subscribers someone has there, or number of views of their videos, or anything like that that is only tied to the Youtube community. There has to be claim to some semblence of notability to the outside world, or there isn't even a valid argument for keeping this around. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 11:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>In what way is the "YouTube community" not part of the "outside world"? They don't live on the same planet or something? This distinction you're trying to make doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 19:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In general, in order for something to be notable it needs to be noticed by someone outside the community. For examples of how this works, you may want to see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:26, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>"A large fan base" is one of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As for the person's "community", you're using a very broad definition of the word. I don't see how the so-labeled "community" of people who watch YouTube differs from the "communities" of people who watch CBS, or read the New York Times. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 23:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's listed under the section for <i>"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions."</i> Youtube videos aren't covered under any of those. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 00:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a very dogmatic way to read what is, after all, a guideline. The whole point of guidelines is that it's impossible to cover every single contingency—they're simply guides to policy. A YouTube personality with a large fanbase is completely analogous to an actor with a fanbase (IMHO, of course). A fanbase is a fanbase. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 00:33, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not "dogmatic", that's what the guideline actually <i>says.</i> You can't compare actors who are known by millions around the world through movies, television, news coverage, etc. to Random Youtube Guy who no one else knows about and hasn't been covered by any outside sources. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 00:51, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure that's what it says; when that sentence was written, I doubt YouTube celebrities were even envisioned. My point stands: a guideline is meant as a general outline of policy, to be applied to specific cases through judgment. To say, "This is what is written—anything else is proscribed", is to be very dogmatic. That said, in your last comment, you did mention a solid distinction between actors and YouTube celebrities: millions versus tens of thousands. In my view 50,000 (viewers, smaller fanbase of course) <i>is</i> sufficient to be called notable, but that's an area of opinion where you're free to disagree, obviously. What I don't understand is the knee-jerk branding of "YouTube celebrities" as by definition non-notable. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 03:34, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Once again, the key is having significant recognition from outside sources, not a high hit count on Youtube.

<li>I hate to bring lonelygirl15 into this, but her reason for having a Wikipedia page is because she is a fake YouTuber. If a fake YouTuber gets a Wikipedia page, then why shouldn't a real one? They both used the same medium to become famous, it just so happens William Sledd is actually William Sledd. If it comes to this article being deleted, all I ask is that there is a possibility for this page to be recreated in the future. He has talent, maybe he'll have his own talk show. It's also very possible he won't get famous outside of YouTube, but you never know.--Tezzy149 22:33, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a vast oversimplification. Lonelygirl15's "fakeness" generated a lot of attention from outside sources, Sledd has not.

<li>William may not be the focus of this article, but that is not the point. The point is, that a reliable third party source has testified to William's popularity on YouTube. This is independent verification of his YouTube celebrity. If the test of inclusion on this encyclopedia in William's case is popularity plus independent verification of that popularty, which combined constitutes "notable", then William has met that test. There is no need for this article to write extensively on William, all that is required is verification. --DavidRWilson 22:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is entirely wrong. The article you posted simply includes his name in a rather large list of high-rated users, at the end of a story that covers YouTube in general and doesn't mention him at all.

<dd>Now hold on a minute. I've been following the thread closely here. I'm the guy that started of this trend by creating the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renetto.html" title="Renetto">renetto</a> article. As I understand from what you have written above, the veracity of his notability is disputed since there is a lack of third party (media) coverage, of his fame. What is <i>not</i> in question is his fame, there is certainly no need for documentation of that point. On the other hand, he is rising to fame on only on YouTube and similar vlogging sites, which arguably is not a comparison to an independent media body yet. But yet again, the fact has it that he is in class of his own, in that he is the fastest rising subscribed member since <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geriatric1927.html" title="Geriatric1927">Geriatric1927</a> whose article here is well written and received a high visitor count. So he is famous now, but we are trying to establish how and why. Dont confuse your own points as put above by yourself in discrediting his notability. Yes we are waiting for sources outside of YouTube to write it up so we can attach them as sources at the end of this article, but no, there is no need to delete him speedily just because we cant wait a few days or a week. The bottom line is, YouTube is unique phenomenon in that it is a media body in itself, that Google have now bought that out is making this hard to see, since its going to be a monopoly, but if there would be a few popular vlogging sites, it would be more clear to us how their users are both independently and by being featured (as in media bodies) becoming notable. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChavatshimshon_82c9.html" title="User:Chavatshimshon">Chavatshimshon</a> 01:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe you're misinterpreting the word "third-party", WarpstarRider. Third-party sources are sources other than the editor himself. In this context, YouTube.com itself is surely a third-party source: the issue is verifiability, and statements which can be verified from youtube.com are verifiable. The statements in this article fall into that category. Some of them (i.e. information about hit count on a specific date) may no longer be verifiable; but when written were verifiable; those are debatable, but I think that if something is included legitimately, it should be valid, even if the source is no longer available. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 20:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, YouTube is a primary source. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> talks about information from blogs on YouTube—that's not at all the same as the statistics that YouTube itself publishes about the views, subscribers, etc. of its videos. It's ridiculous to think that YouTube, the primary source for this information, is unreliable about it, but if a newspaper would republish <i>the same information</i>, it would become reliable. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:44, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're still not getting it. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> again where it specifically says that <i>reliable, third-party, published sources</i> are absolutely required for an article's existence. Anything can be a primary source about itself; the very idea of verifiability is that there must be outside sources backing them up. The existence of enough such sources is what establishes a subject as notable. Now stop waving around the guy's YouTube stats, because that's not what we're looking for here. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 06:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> While it is a valid point that there are 10's of thousands of similar troupes in the world, SOTP is not the only one that has its own Wiki page. It is a matter of opinion on how "important" the troupe is to deserve a Wiki page. Also, the majority of this page is not advertising. It gives a brief background of the group, the style of games they play, and who are the members. I can understand the "current events" being considered advertising, but the rest of the article is an objective description of the group. If one is going to propose the deletion of this article, then they should be prepared find every other small group with a Wiki page and contest them as well.

Someone used a rugby union competition that had league in its name to show that there was rugby league there, think of it as using the NFL Europe to prove the existence of Canadian football in Germany if you're not aware of what rugby league is.James Bowes 15:51, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with a note that rugby league is no longer played in Moldova. The consensus is that this should remain for history purposes. My comment about Canada was correct, but some people are ignorant of the difference between rugby union and rugby league.</li>

<dd>There's no proof it is either. It is known on rugby league sites that the game's no longer played there. I suggest keeping the article for history, but I've heard strong evidence that the game's been dead there years. In the last few years all European nations have been active, but nothing from Moldova who are not registered with the RLEF (www.rlef.eu) or anything.James Bowes 11:24, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The site I've cited above talks about games which were scheduled for 2003, which would suggest that if it's died then the death occurred sometime in the last 3 years. Anything's possible in Eastern Europe, but it surely would've been reported somewhere. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those games never went ahead, despite being planned. I believe they were to be based on Moldovans playing and living in Russia. Like I said check the www.rlef.eu page, if a country plays any internationals or has a single club they get mentioned there. Now I know Wikipedia better, I know that a national team, current or active deserves a page, but I know for a fact that there is not a single rugby league club in Moldova, and that the national side has not played since 1995. I suggest we conclude this as keep and then discuss on the talk page what to include in the article?James Bowes 14:15, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This link shows people discussing Moldova no longer playing rugby league:<a href="http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova" class="external free" title="http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova" rel="nofollow">http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova</a> Not sure whether it's a valid source but it's more valid than the above article.

<dl>
<dd>The people at that forum may have more evidence than we can find, but without it all we have is a group of people saying that the game isn't played in that country, which is largely what we have here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the fact that the www.rlef.eu.com site doesn't mention them would suggest that it's unlikely that there's any rugby league in Moldova, due to the fact that that site lists countries where even a few schools play. However, the article does seem to suggest that the national team's inactive and has no mention of domestic rugby league.James Bowes 16:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The <a href="../../../p/z/l/PZL_PW-5_81a2.html" title="PZL PW-5">PZL_PW-5</a> that I fly has a tube under the seat cusion that lets me use just the Texas Condom and not the complete Stadium Buddy.

<li><b>Comment</b> And in the interests of full disclosure, I made the edits to this page on 2 Nov. I've signed up for a wikipedia account because, while I was comfortable making edits anonymously, I am not comfortable with defending them anonymously. I have never heard of a Stadium Buddy for sale, they're something I've assembled after buying the components in medical stores. (Interestingly, Texas Condoms are sized in colours instead of "S/M/L/XL" so that you don't have to ask for a Small one at the counter. I'm a size Blue.) Really old pilots told me what store to go to and what to ask for in parts, but they always called it a Stadium Buddy. Cheers, Russ0035 05:08, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you move your cursor over the boxes to the left there are still open links, but that site, with no matches played since 2003 is the only page concerning rugby league (as opposed to the rugby union played in the Canada Rugby Super League) suggests that the sport is at best dormant in Canada.James Bowes 14:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There were Ontario and Manitoba 9-a-side leagues up til 2003 as evidenced by this site <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/</a> (you need to run the cursor over the left hand boxes for the link). However, all evidence suggests that rugby league in Canada has been dormant since 2003 (at least on an organised level, who knows if there have been ad hoc matches). I think the article needs heavy improvement as to describe rugby league as an emerging sport there is both inaccurate and a non-NPOV as there's no evidence it will ever emerge there. Not sure of the split but I would assume all rugby league in Canada was allied to Super League, as it was in most countries, with the ARL largely being localised.</dd>

Some of his instrumental recordings have been used as background music in advertising campaigns and radio shows, but not featured in a way that would have listeners going out to buy a CD of the music. He has <i>worked for</i> notable musicians but hasn't done much of note on his own. The press clippings that he has re-printed on his personal website are <i>underwhelming</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Assuming sources can be found (something I'll turn my mind to shortly if nobody else does), this is a team in a notable sport representing a country.

<li>While I agree with the above rugby league has been non-existant in Canada for two or three years since the regional 9-a-side competitions folded and thus this is now a defunct national team. If they were still in existence I'd support the inclusion, but the fact that they didn't even consider entering the world cup qualifiers and haven't played internationals for years suggests that the team is dead. Maybe the results can be merged into a past international results section?James Bowes 22:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here's the thing: Making the comment that "rugby league has been non-existent in Canada" doesn't actually make that the case. Indeed <a href="http://www.rcsl.ca/" class="external text" title="http://www.rcsl.ca/" rel="nofollow">the reverse would appear to be true</a>. A merger <i>may</i> end up being the best solution, but the way I read the whole thing is that the Canadian team is essentially on hiatus and may well return to the fold sometime soon - much like a football/soccer team which doesn't opt to qualify for a particular world cup. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:56, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not a good idea. AfD tags are meant to stay until the debate itself is closed (chances are that this one will be soon enough, but still). Additionally, league <i>is</i> still played in Canada per the source I provided earlier, so adding erroneous information to an article doesn't help matters. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please check your sources very carefully before making assertions. The above link proves that rugby union is played in Canada. You may not know the difference I gather, but rugby union (the form sometimes simply called rugby) is the type played in about 100 countries and is the type played in Canada and in the confusingly named Canada Rugby Super League. Rugby league is a sport played in about thirty countries, mostly in Europe and Oceania and is no longer played in Canada, there having been no domestic competition since 2003.James Bowes 14:22, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The link hadn't been working perfectly for me at the time I posted it, so all I had to go on was that it was used in a previous AfD around the same topic and that it contained the words "Rugby", "League" and "Canada".

<li>True, but by precedent, the blog's article was deleted, and I saw more importance asserted there than in the O'Connor article, so by that logic, insufficient importance is asserted. Prior to MLW's speedy deletion, the assertion of importance here was that she created a notable blog. If the blog is non-notable, then what's the assertion of importance here? I still think speedy delete is merited, but I am not opposed to letting the AfD run its course.

<li>Cute, but you really should know better than that. Speedy deletion is not a domino effect, based upon "notability," it's based upon a lack of stressed importance. The article attempts to stress/assert importance. Also, there's nothing wrong with having a partially open mind, staying the course no matter what is why George Bush appointed <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Miers_ae2c.html" title="Harriet Miers">Harriet Miers</a> as a Supreme Court candidate. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 11:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So that third article uses her name once; that's the very definition of trivial coverage. And I "avoided" the Jessica Rose example because it has nothing to do with <i>this</i> argument (and for the record, my position there was for merge and redirect to the lonelygirl article, not deletion). <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 02:19, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Trivial" sources refers to things like "mentioning the person in passing" and "telephone directory listings."

<p>This pertains to a conspiracy theory about the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. The article does not cite any sources, and focuses instead around one article hosted on a website "attempt[ing] to uncover the truth about September 11, 2001". We have a plethora of articles on the multitude of conspiracy theories surrounding that day, but the vast majority of them are on the conspiracy theory <i>movement</i>, instead of on the actual theories themselves. Of the few articles that we have on the actual conspiracy theories, the articles cite a multitude of sources and have established that the theories are verifiable and, at least within the conspiracy community, widespread and notable, something which this article fails to do. While a redirect to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> is plausible, I would advocate deletion, as the theory has not been proven to fit our criteria for inclusion, and a redirect from every conspiracy theory made regarding the events of that day would not be appropriate.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am the author of this article. I have never written an article before and am not good at editing for NPOV. People posted NPOV warnings on this article but posted no discussion of what was to be fixed. I don't think it is fair to post NPOV warnings without explaining yourself so I removed them. If they had left reasons on the discussion page I would have left the warning and discussed needed changes to the article. The article also is not finished as I work and cannot update it often. But the existence of pyroclastic flows in NYC on September is not deniable. You only need to look at the images from that day, from the tower being pulverised into dust (by what is the question,) to it blanketing the Island of Manhattan and going as far as New Jersey. When the article is finished please comment but do not delete the article because it is a conspiracy theory. The official story is also a conspiracy theory. 19 Arab hijackers conspired to attack the World Trade Center using airplanes. To use such an argument to justify it's exclusion is a pathetic argument, and to say that the one source posted so far is just an article is proof you have not even looked at it. It is a serious academic paper that has undergone four peer contributed revisions, and it is solid science. Not very advanced science, but correct nonetheless. The science behind this is not that hard, high school mostly. How much kinetic energy is in the buildings and jet fuel? How much energy is used in the dust clouds following the collapse? If the answer to the second question is substantially larger than the first answer, then you have a missing energy source somewhere. Couple that to the existence of red-hot metal at ground zero, 3 storeys below the ground, for 99 days after 9/11 is proof there was another, much hotter energy source present on 9/11. Please allow me to finish the article and please contribute changes to editing and format errors, or post competing science, but do not delete the article.</li>

While I disagree with these claims as the ravings of the wackiest conspiracy theorists, the article is quite balanced and makes clear that it is an alternative theory, meeting all criteria of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The basic observation of the dust cloud clearly shows an event that nearly identically resembles a pyroclastic surge phenomenon. If you understand the sheer amount of energy required to lift and travel the pulverized materials in that way, you'd have to question how gravity and carbon fires could produce said energy. If you do the math, calculating the potential energy of the buildings prior to impact (at rest) and then measure the amount of energy required to do what we all saw happened, there is a dramatic deficit.. anywhere between a factor of 100 and 500, depending on the variables. This phenomenon must be researched and the government's denial of it must be backed up with test results. This article should stay and be improved with it's focus being the thermodynamic requirements to move that pulverized matter in the way we saw it happen. Wikipedia's policies regarding information like this is showing firmly that the interest is not to provide truth, but to cover up "dangerous" information on a governmental level.</li>
<li>weak <b>delete</b>. needs reputable sources and is unencyclopediatic and POV in current form.

<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is not a neologism, because it is not in common use outside of certain anti-semetic groups, and fails to cite any reliable secondary sources that meet the standards of Wikipedia's "Reliable sources for neologisms." At best, the subject appears to be a protoneologism, in which case it should be deleted because this article appears to exist only to promote the use of the term (despite that the article mostly contains critical discussion of the term, and many Wikipedians have attempted to correctly portray it as a fringe-term, they are merely playing into the hands of the individuals who wish to promote its usage.) In fact, the article has existed for several years and has neverbeen edited to include any references of sources.</p>
<p>If one considers the subject to refer to an actual organization, it should be deleted because it does not meet the criteria for the notability of organizations. Unlike significant items of historical interest, such as the Elders of Zion conspiracy-hoax, this "organization" is not notable; again, its presence as an article merely acts to ascribe notability to something nonexistant and invented by certain groups with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Redundant: this subject is adequately dealt with as part of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of conspiracy theories">List_of_conspiracy_theories</a> and therefore does not require more extensive coverage (and debate) here. If there is any content in the article that is additive to the subject of Jewish world domination conspiracy theories, it should be dealt with there.

There are pages for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of conspiracy theories">List of conspiracy theories</a> that would be more appropriate for this. Also, the page <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_conspiracy.html" title="Jewish conspiracy">Jewish conspiracy</a> currently redirects to this page. I'd suggest that when/if the content is merged elsewhere, that that page redirect to the new page (Jewish Conspiracy is clearly a larger subject than one particular acronym that hasn't met widespread usage.) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:02, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and Comment</b> The term, despite its dubious merits, is notable. We aren't going to start deleting neo-Nazi terms like <a href="../../../8/8/_/88.html" title="88">88</a> next are we? ZOG is referenced constantly on supremacist websites, forums and propaganda. Comment though, can we clean up the talk page and keep it only to the article content? The tit-for-tat jokes and assorted silliness is not what talk pages are for. They are for discussing the current, past or future content of the main article.
