<li><b>Keep</b> per Richardcavell. Should be broken up into smaller articles. "Unusual time signature" is a common Western designation for meters not divisible by 2 or 3; the list should be confined to Western music, in the most broadly defined terms (so, for instance, rock music from anywhere in the world would apply, but recordings of West African drumming would not). <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 02:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep this article, it is amazing. It actually has helped me sometimes. that Sufjan Stevens with his wacky time signatures. Seriously though, I actually looked for a list like this. I googled "list of ridiculously bizarre time signatures", and found this page. Actually this is one of my favorite wikipedia pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> in its current form it is unmaintainable. Remember, Telephone Directories are VERY useful, and utility is NOT a criteria for an article at wikipedia. I would have no problem if this article reappeared as individual lists for specific smaller articles, for each specific time signature as a list, which would each be more useful and more manageable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 04:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctantly, I can't see this being anything other than a delete <i>in its current form</i>, which is a shame because I'll admit it is both useful and interesting. A possible compromise might be to <b>split it into separate articles</b> for individual time signatures: though "unusual" may be a POV term, articles such as List of musical works in 5/4 or 5/8 time might at least save some of this in usable, non-POV form, so I'd prefer splitting it into these if possible, though that still may fall foul of deletionist views. FWIW, in its current form it could also get extremely long - I keep a similar list offline myself, and there is very little cvorrelation between the two in terms of what tracks are listed. From this, I suspect that the current list could grow to several times its current size. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:45, 23 November 2006 (UTC) (now playing, Pete Shelley, "I generate a feeling" - 13/8 time)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I stressed over this decision, but I think that although the term "unusual" sounds very POV it is still a useful list. I think it could be of use to people interested in the subject, and unlikely to be found anywhere outside wikipedia in this form (unlike information on schools or a phone book for instance). I suggest adding the qualification that to be included in the list the artist or song must have or be worthy of a seperate wikipedia article. Thus all notability criteria would then be followed. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:22, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Chubbles' comments above. Its current large state doesn't mean it can't be broken into smaller pieces (per time signature).

<li>I'd <b>delete</b> - at 89 KB and based on the ambiguity of the criteria for inclusion - anything other than 4/4 and 2/2 could be on it.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Oh no, not again!" What is unusual? Who defines what is unusual with respect to a particular genre? Is there systemic bias in the genres represented? Or the dates? Look how over-represented the last decade is within the list. Do we have reliable sources for the time signatures of the more modern pieces, which are typically not published as sheet music? Far More Blue and Far More Drums are the same piece, essentially, why two entries? What about movements within other works, such as <i>In Freezing Winter Night</i> from Britten's Ceremony of Carols? Is there an objective definition of what constitutes an unusual time signature in the context of a given genre, or is this just an end-run around the removal of articles like the list of songs in triple metre?

<li>That would be an "interesting" choice, since we already deleted articles for "list of songs in <i>foo</i> metre" due to the fact that the selection of an individual metre is arbitrary, the lists are potentially vast, and almost every inclusion from the last couple of decades is straight OR since they are not published in sheet music. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:31, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Unfortunately, this list was deleted some months later, and I can't find any further debate about it. A pity, since I used that list several times for information... The parallel here is that the longtitle list consisted of "original research" in that the authors had to <i>count the number of words in the song titles</i> rather than use verified sources stating that the titles were long. Here, the authors are <i>counting the number of beats in a measure</i> rather than finding sources that state that the song is in an irregular meter.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though it should probably be split to keep it from being overlong.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b> - at least one entry is well sourced - pruning of unsourced entries of the list is not a concern for AfD. <b>This article is incomplete, and likely to remain so</b> is a terrible criterion for deletion. It'd result in the deletion of most articles on wikipedia. Nor is <i>maintaining this article is a lot of work</i> a good argument. The article <i>is</i> being maintained - if someone wants to put in the time and effort to create a good article, it's hardly the wiki spirit to say "You're working too hard - stop building such a good encyclopaedia".

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Dear Wikipedia Administrator,
<p>Please do not delete the article "Nabs" (Snack Cracker) co-authored by myself. Since Aug of 2006 this article has been created for the sole purpose of defining this term, with sources cited directly from Nabisco &amp; Lance Inc. No other such article exists anywhere that can be found on the world wide web.</p>
<p>Since mid-Oct 2006 an Indian firm referred to as "NABS INc.", rather than creating their own article in Wikipedia, decided to vandalize this one for the sole purpose of marketing their company, which already has its own website (<a href="http://www.nabs.com" class="external free" title="http://www.nabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nabs.com</a>). Responsible contributors who performed these unauthorized and malicious modifications were "Ekeeran", "Ashwathaman", "125.22.158.109", &amp; "59.144.22.194".</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards.</p>
<p>Ms. Christina Fellows, Executive Representative Kraft Foods, ~~TLXEA_13861319~~N</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can actually see a decent article on this topic, but it's hard to advocate keeping this one. The subject is fairly notable, being one of those brand names that develop into a generic name. Throughout the Southern US, this is an easily recognizable term that, while it's a step below in outside recognition, it's a step above the moon-pie in commonality. It would be nice if there were a good place to redirect this for now, but I can't really think of where. Maybe <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker_%28food%29.html" title="Cracker (food)">Cracker (food)</a>, but that still doesn't seem quite right. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 21:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm a little new to this, so pardon me if this a frequently asked question. When I read the initial proposed deletion item and followed links about notability, I started the task of collecting some of the other things written about the strip, appearances in magazine and other media, etc. From the wording here though, and one of the comments below, I get the impression that it is desirable that the article actually explicitly says something like, "The comic is notable because..." I haven't noticed that in other articles, and if we routinely write that way, it will sounds stilted and formulaic to readers. That said, if phrasing it that way is desirable we should change it. As to whether it actually *is* notable, I guess that's still to be determined. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoak_2487.html" title="User:Yoak">Yoak</a> 16:38, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no requirement for the phrasing "The comic is notable because..." Notability assertions take various forms. If this comic was featured in the New York Times, for example, we might have the article say "Joe the Circle was presented in a New York Times feature on popular web comics." This would be sufficient to qualify as an assertion of notability. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 20:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Definitely claiming to be notable for its print history going back over 15 years.

<li>The print version of the comic does go back 16-17 years. (I've been unable to find out exactly.) The origins of the strip were as a print comic in the late eighties and early nineties. The article mentions this. The start date I entered was for its launch as an online comic. Also, I've moved that back to 1995 today to the initial launch of the online comic by SuperNova. The earliest date I could confirm otherwise was the registration of the domain name which was in 1997. <a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoak_2487.html" title="User:Yoak">Yoak</a> 16:38, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps I can diminish your tingle. This is my first wikipedia project. It's something I'm interested in and think has a place here, but seems to be a better place to work out this sort of newbieness than trying to edit the entry on environmentalism or something. &#160;;-) If you look at the source of the article, you'll see I included a source for that quote, but apparently wasn't using the rquote template correctly for it to display. I'm attempting to correct this now. Hmmm... I've done so, but put a large external URL in the article. I'll do that rather than leave it unsourced, but perhaps you could suggest a more appropriate way? <a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoak_2487.html" title="User:Yoak">Yoak</a> 16:38, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I was the one who made the page and as I noted during the creation, it's possible that this game is not notable enough for inclusion and could be deleted. I wouldn't be too disappointed, though I lean towards keeping the page (if I didn't, why would I bother making it in the first place). However, I think some of the reasoning to delete it is suspect. First and most obviously, this is not a hoax. With all due respect, anyone who does even a 5-second competent search on google or bothers clicking the reference link can go to the official site, where there are screenshots and a download to the game (it's freeware since some time ago, as noted in the introduction) can see that. In any case, which of the following aren't reliable sources? There are probably more than this, but this is what a quick search reveals:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure if <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the only criteria to apply to this comic. According to the article, it began as a printed work in 1989. It's only been recently that's been put on the web. I think the general rule is that a comic that starts in print and then moves onto the web is not technically a webcomic (similar to Garfield or Dilbert). Were the publishers of Jazz Age notable? Can anyone find any reviews of the comic from when it was published? <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 23:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think I can summarize the argument to keep with three main points. First, Jazz Age Chronicles was published by a notable comic book publisher, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber_Comics_aede.html" title="Caliber Comics">Caliber Comics</a> (I looked them up - now I remember where I heard that name before). Second, the author of the comic is notable. Third, the webcomic version of Jazz Age Chronicles is currently being released by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If only the third point was true, the subject might not be notable enough to warrant inclusion (I'm not going to argue that every comic on Graphic Smash is notable because it's on Graphic Smash). However, the original Jazz Age Chronicles was released through a publishing house that was "well known and independent of the creators," <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirement #3 (Caliber was well known in the early 90's). This, to me, indicates that not only was Jazz Age Chronicles notable in the early 90's, but that it has remained so today, as proven by Graphic Smash's willingness to include this comic in their commericial enterprises. Slampyak's own personal notability furthers adds to the value of keeping this article.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, the article passes the "perfect article" test. Given enough time, Jazz Age's publication history, offline reviews from the early 90's, and other NPOV facts could be compiled to make this a well-referenced article. It's only because of the comic's age and the current defunct status of its major publisher that makes it difficult to find this material. But it's not impossible. We have articles on Caliber's other major series, such as <a href="../../../a/2E/k/A.K.A._Goldfish_9b1e.html" title="A.K.A. Goldfish">A.K.A. Goldfish</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadworld.html" title="Deadworld">Deadworld</a>. This one is no different. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 19:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Keep" with no coherent rationale is avote, but AFD is not a vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's not uncivility, just fact combined with brusqueness. This AfD covers the exact same alleged ground as several AfD attempts on Gundam articles before. It's pure egocentrism at its finest. An article of this type takes up at most a handful of kilobytes, and is virtually invisible to anybody who doesn't go explicitly looking for it (I say "virtually" because there's a one in one-point-five-million chance that it could be randomly pulled up by somebody hitting the "Random article" link). However, for the people who DO go looking for it (unless they're looking for it for the purpose of agitating the feces), it's invaluable. The information included is purposeful, not random, so "indiscriminate collection" doesn't fit. "Original research" is incorrect - the article is just cited poorly. In-universe perspective, as mentioned, is grounds for a rewrite, not for deletion. And WP:CRUFT is an <i>essay</i>, <b>not</b> policy. That basically leaves the nominator's personal preference as a reason for deletion, which is insufficient. Going by the precedent of previous Gundam-related AfDs, this discussion should be closed. This ground has already been trod. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 19:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Uncle G's notability essay - read it at <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a> - is always good when it comes to cruft. Where are the third-party sources&#160;? How could a reader verify that "the TS-MA2mod.00 Moebius Zero served as the basis for a more advanced design fielded in late CE 73, the TS-MA4F Exass"&#160;? Or that "very few Gunbarrel Strikers are produced"&#160;? The article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, the subject is not notable, the likelihood of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> is compelling. True, "an article of this type takes up at most a handful of kilobytes, and is virtually invisible to anybody who doesn't go explicitly looking for it". What separates Wikipedia from Uncyclopedia is that this is an encyclopedia and has guidelines on content. If you want to create a Gundam Wiki, to document every last detail, Wookiepedia and the Runescape Wiki have shown the way. And yes, this ground has indeed been well trodden.

<dd>I did a Google search and looked through the first 6 pages of hits or so (so, about 60 of the 104 current useful hits), and all of the listings I saw were either in a language I couldn't understand or they dealt with the "old" definition of autocentrism, which is basically a more general version of the word Eurocentrism. Doing a google define on the word came up totally empty. This absolutely screams neologism, and basically by saying that it comes from new urbanist literature, you prove as much. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 20:19, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

In this case, since there are so few incidences of this definition of the word on the Internet, the word is a protologism. "An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that use the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research policy</a>)." --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 23:53, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just maybe there is something here, but nothing in the article demonstrates what. It started off as an Antisemitic diatribe and has now been reduced to a dismissal of its own title. Either the term has some currency, and relates to a concept worthy of an encyclopedia article, and hence there is an article here that can be written from citable sources—if so, show us—or there isn't and this should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:50, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This was a significant news event and a complex story with wide repercussions. The references consist mostly of the most well-respected news outlets in Canada.

<li><b>Delete</b> As far as I can tell this is not a widely-cited landmark case, not quoted in the law reviews, not regarded as a legal precedent. Some minor local sensationalism is not a reason for having a long article which is detrimental to the reputation of a living individual, it constitutes undue weight.

<li>While keeping this article may be opening a can of worms, the same has been said about the entire Wikipedia project. I don’t think that we should shy away from a difficult topic. I agree with the anon.’s concerns and I feel that it should obviously conform to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and that it can be radically cut or stubbed if it does not. But I think that should be said of all of our articles that relate to living persons. I think we can’t begin excluding articles just because we can get them wrong because I hate to say it but <i>we can get them all wrong</i>. That said, I understand that we have indeed gotten things very wrong in relation to Marsden but I think we should fix it rather than pretend that she doesn’t exist (or exists only as a stub). So I’d <b>keep</b> this article and hope that a few vigilant editors keep their eyes on it as well.

<dd>Guy, you seem to think this issue involved criminal or civil law. This was handled entirely within the university system, and as the article lead indicates, it led to a rewriting of procedures within that system.

<li>Not quite - but in general, court cases that receive this level of media attention are encyclopaedic, in the limit that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. As much as I hate to use the word <i>notability</i>, press coverage is a reasonable measure of it for modern court cases. My point was more about the quality, quantity and nature of sources, rather than their mere existance (though <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is always the first test I apply at AfD). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:58, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested speedy. Remarkable, perhaps, but not notable. "Ben Hale" is a common name I guess but this Ben Hale doesn't come up at all in the first Google few pages - granting that people born in 1910 have less presence on the net than younger folk, I supppose. He does have a book on Amazon. If I knew more about his radio show, maybe, but I don't have any reason to suppose it wasn't a local show on a low-watt station. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Very short article about a Norwegian BDSM organisation. The article does not really claim very much notability. I proposed it for deletion but the prod was contested with this comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Definitely not a valid prod. Appears to be a national organization with thousands of members, including hundreds of couples. In this particular subculture, in a country of that size, that is a lot.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This looks like the only reason for its notability is its number of members. I don't think that is enough for notability. I think some Finnish BDSM organisations also have several hundred members, and Finland is a slightly bigger country than Norway. <b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:12, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I co-prod'd the article with the following comments: "<i>Supposition, duplication of info already on other articles (salinity, global warming), plus the above stated reasons</i>". Although a very well-written piece, it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Some of the links are non-specific, they just point to a general page, and at the very least support the original research theory. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 08:38, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this is still just an essay and would require massive reconstruction if it was to meet our usual requirements for what we include here. It was requested that we avoid AfD jargon so I encourage the author to read the policies himself. Basically we require ways of verifying the information using reliable sources. Reliable sources usually means independent sources that we can trust. Also we don't allow original research. Generally what you want to refrain from is posting your own ideas on the subject and not ask the reader questions inside the text. Sorry this one fails, don't let it discourage you.

<li><b>Delete</b>, although reluctantly, because it's better than 99% of what turns up here. Where it falls down is that it seems to involve Original Research (presenting solutions and explaining why the government hasn't done X thing is always risky, and you'll need sources to show that these <i>are</i> in fact the best solutions and that this <i>is</i> why the government hasn't acted) and also to duplicate other articles, with much broader sources. What I would suggest as the best option is to hunt out sources for everything that isn't already covered in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_crisis.html" title="Water crisis">Water crisis</a> and move everything that can be moved to that article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:02, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with the above. Let it grow inside <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_crisis.html" title="Water crisis">Water crisis</a> until it is mature enough to get its own article. Also keep in mind that most articles here don't start out as long finished articles. Usually they start as a stub and some of the best ones actually start out as sections in a broader article. Just keep trying, use the help that is available here and try to take advantage of what is already written here by letting it grow from a broader article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:14, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While a good article could be written on this topic as most Australian cities face ongoing water supply problems, unfortunately it is original research at the moment.

<p>This is not a real concept. It looks like someone's personal thoughts, or at least the thoguhts of a small group of people. Also the philosophies which are linked to from the article are not real either. If I use Google to look for it I only get about 500 results, of which most are for all those fake Wikipeda sites you get nowadays, which are probably just copied from here. Please delete this page. Wikipedia should not have articles about things which are not properly documented in the scholarly literature. Thank you. TechnoLuddite 08:31, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Seriously, can you name one change in the use of boxes throughout the whole of history? From "thing you keep things in" to...?

<li>Keep what things in?

Lists of Wikipedia articles do not make up for good overall articles; people looking for information about computers should not be faced with a list "<a href="../../../a/l/t/Altair.html" title="Altair">Altair</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_I_4e0f.html" title="Apple I">Apple I</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a>, ...) and be forced to figure out what they need from that.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 12:04, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But why would they need to figure out what the word "box" means? If someone were to come up with a history of the box, the evolution of the box, the social impact of the box (you know, all the stuff in the other articles you mention) then this would be a valid article. I'd add 'em if I could find 'em but there's nothing around that I can see.

<p>Breaking my promise (and well, there really aren't any guidelines/policies on when it is appropriate to renominate an article), but as it is difficult to get the discussion noticed on the talk page and it certainly needs more participants, I am hereby nominating it again. And please take this seriously.</p>
<p>The article is redundant as its contents are already in the <i>Architecture</i> section of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel.html" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a> article and the notability of the debate is rather weak, more of a curiousity than encyclopedical material. <a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">msikma</a> says that the article can be expanded with their respective views, and sure, that is true, but pros and cons for microkernels/monolithic kernels are already discussed in their respective articles. Having it in this article too would just cause further redundancy. And, please see it for what it is: a discussion/debate (or flamewar) on a mailing list.</p>
<p>Suggested action: Delete or redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel.html" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a>.</p>

<li>I am not renominating it on a "regular schedule", I am merely continuing what I feel wasn't sufficiently discussed (and what the closing admin thought can hardly be considered consensus). Memmke 09:54, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first nomination was made on the 14th and closed on the 19th of this month. The second was made on the 20th ("just over 12 hours" after the first one, according to one comment) and closed on the same day. Today being the 23rd, I guess we could say that the 3 day interval is proof of restraint. The point about an AfD is that, by running for 5 days as the first one did, it creates enough time for a consensus to be reached. That the consensus doesn't march with what you want it to be is obvious, but it's a consensus nevertheless. Neither of the closing admins said that there wasn't consensus, and in fact in the second instance it was made quite clear that there <i>was</i> consensus. I'm not disrupting an attempt at discussion, either. What I'm doing is suggesting that further discussion be deferred until such time as it can gainfully be done. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:04, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It's not quite that. It's a little more complex. First and foremost, the first AfD ran for 5 days. That's the length these things are meant to run so that a consensus can be arrived at. A consensus was arrived at and the AfD closed. It wasn't what you wanted the consensus to be, but that's the nature of the beast. Since then, to my knowledge you've opened <i>another</i> AfD on the same topic 12 hours later, taken the matter to DRV where it's meant to stay for 5 days <i>regardless</i> of the depth of the debate and <i>then</i> opened a third AfD. The topic may well be non-notable, but the idea is that the consensus back on the 19th was that it should be kept and there's little or no reason to assume that the consensus 4 days later is going to be much different. In 4 <i>months</i>, it could well be so. It's like constantly asking "are we there yet?" on a car trip. We weren't there a few minutes ago, so we probably aren't there yet either. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But most of the opinions adding up to the first AfD's consensus was based upon uninformed and <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> "arguments". Memmke 10:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)~
<ul>
<li>[edit conflict]That may well be the case, but the admin who closed the discussion saw that as consensus to keep. Now, if we assume that the arguments <i>were</i> based on a faulty premise, you've got two options. The first is to wait a few months for the smoke to clear and then nominate the article again in the hope that people won't make the same mistakes as they did the first time round. The second is to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> and let that run its course. You've taken that option, as is shown by the post at DRV timestamped earlyish yesterday morning. Now all you need to do is to sit back and wait for everyone else to discuss it there. The fact that, 24 hours after the fact, you haven't got what you wanted out of DRV is immaterial. That's where it is currently, so opening another AfD on it isn't going to help matters (as I think you can see here). Again, if the consensus at DRV goes against you, the solution is to grin and bear it - and maybe wait a longer time than 72 hours before you re-open discussion. There are times when we all don't like the consensus of the community, but the point about Wikipedia is that we have to abide by it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:31, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>They aren't technicalities. People don't like defending their articles over and over, and many of them barely tolerate AfD at best. Letting people know that once they've justified their article's existence, they won't have to worry about it for another six months or so, is important so they don't feel under attack. Furthermore, AfD is a mess, and reducing the number of articles nominated that have passed once helps fix at least part of that.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 10:26, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment —</b> I'm not sure if it should deleted or turned into a disambiguation page - ultimately, the list would become very, very long if every villain from books, movies, games, and novels were put into it, and the resulting article would be a bit hard to maintain. Further, would the page only put fictional characters who were actually <i>called</i> the Dark Lord (like Voldemort, for example), or just any villain? I suppose I'm leaning towards deleting it - but what should the guidelines be for the disambiguation page? –- <strong><a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><font color="blue">kungming·</font></a><font color="green">2</font></strong> <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 17:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I didn't attack you, I asked you (fairly politely, in fact) not to advance false arguments in an articles for deletion discussion. That's a pretty reasonable thing to request, I believe. You said <i>no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players</i> - which is a directly false statement. If you accidentally misevaluated the article, then I'll apologise about saying you did deliberately what you may have done in error. It didn't occur to me you might simply have what appeared to me to be a straightforward issue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is my comment "no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players" false? Can an opinion even be "true" or "false"? What does the list (in its present state) do, that the category doesn't? And calling someone a liar is not justified by saying it nicely. You could just have asked "could you please clarify what you mean by saying that the list has no use whatsoever?", and I would have gladly answered you. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 14:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Opinions can be true or false. I can say <i>My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative</i> - my opinion is then false. The statement <i>no use whatsoever as we have a category for the players</i> is false by the same virtue. If your claim is that you didn't mean what you wrote, I'll happily retract my earlier statement - for the time being, however, I can only respond to what you say, not what you mean. As for the usefulness of lists, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> - it articulates them better than I can. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, an opinion can't be false. If I say, "My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative", you can't say that my opinion is false, because I (in this example) really do believe that "x + y ≠ y + x". <i>An <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a> is not a fact, because opinions are either not falsifiable, or the opinion has not been proven or verified.</i> I stand by my first post. This list does not improve Wikipedia in any way that the category does not. That's what I mean. Now tell me why that's wrong, and plase do not answer with "read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>", as I have no idea what specific line or paragraph you refer to. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 18:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ironically, on the issue of whether opinions can be false, the opinion that they can't be is false. You can believe an opinion and it can still be false (in fact, I'd guess that every last person believes something that's factually inaccurate). One can certainly take an opinion on a question that's falsifiable. My experience tells me that if I merely copy &amp; paste <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> here I'll get slapped for being uncivil, but I'm not sure how else to explain the usefulness of lists. Lists serve as navigation aids, as growth structures and can organise a subject in a way categories can't - this is basically a stub-class list, but <i>stub</i> isn't a criterion for deletion (though I do see it used as such surprisingly often). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not an opinion that opinions can't be false, it is a fact. So, what you're basically saying is that all lists should be kept, as they "serve as navigation aids, as growth structures and can organise a subject in a way categories can't"? The category also serves as navigation aid, and regarding the growth structures and organisation of a subject, I see no difference whatsoever between List of Belgian footballers and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Category%7EBelgian_footballers_30da.html" title="Category:Belgian footballers">Category:Belgian footballers</a>. They both contain blue links only. They both contain the same names. They both list the names alphabetically. Now please tell me again what in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> applies to this case. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 20:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really - lists need to be of encyclopaedic value, be verifiable, et cetera. The same standards that apply to non-list articles apply to list articles. But it's unreasonable to hold articles to a <i>higher</i> standard just because they're lists. As for how much use you personally find an article to be - I don't see why that's an important consideration. There are tons of useless articles (to me) in Wikipedia - I certainly wouldn't vote to delete them all. As for whether opinions can be wrong, it certainly is a fact that they can. My commutativity of addition example demonstrates that. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your comparison fails. I did not say "this is not a useful list", I said "this list is useful, but we already have a category that does the exact same thing, and it makes this list superfluous". See the difference? On opinions, I entitle you to the opinion of believing that opinions can be true or false, but it is a fact that they can't. Citing <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a> once again: <i>An opinion is not a fact, because opinions are either not falsifiable, or the opinion has not been proven or verified.</i> Or <a href="http://www.worsleyschool.net/socialarts/factopinion/factopinion.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worsleyschool.net/socialarts/factopinion/factopinion.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>: <i>A statement of opinion expresses an attitude toward something – it makes a judgment, view, or conclusion, or gives an opinion that cannot be proven true or false.</i> Or <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0STR/is_6_108/ai_54169026" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0STR/is_6_108/ai_54169026" rel="nofollow">this page</a>: <i>A statement of opinion can be very well thought out but cannot be proved true or false - it is always open to debate.</i> You mix up the opinion with the possible inclusion of a statement of fact in the opinion. I can never be proven wrong when saying "My opinion is that addition of integers is non-commutative", because you can't prove a person's opinion wrong. The only thing you can do is prove that the statement of fact contained in the opinion is wrong or right, but that still does not prove the opinion wrong or right. Either way, I don't see the point of this discussion, and I still haven't seen any explanation for why you called me a liar. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 22:58, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, by that definition of opinion, <i>this list is useful,</i> <b>but we already have a category that does the exact same thing</b>, <i>and it makes this list superfluous</i> does not have an opinion in bold, but a factually incorrect basis for your opinion (since that statement is falsifiable and already shown to be false). You labelled a falsifiable statement that had already been falsified an opinion, I spoke with the same usage of the word - I'm not sure there's much motivation to muddy the issue now. As for the idea that <i>an opinion can be an easily falsifiable statement, but can't be proven right or wrong</i> - that is what comes out of the north end of a south facing bull. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> the article does assert notability, and a Google search for "Hristo Tsanoff" would not turn up references that are in Cyrillic.

<li><b>Delete</b> This isn't really a "culture" or a "stock phrase." It is just a word that means "wierd foreinger" and isn't anything I've heard in use other than as an insult. Should we turn every japanese word or insult into a Wikipedia article? If you want a "culture" article, "Foreigners Living in Japan" might be an appropriate topic. Denaar 12:58, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I've heard it both ways, both positive and negative. The literal meaning "strange foreigner" ("weird foreigner") happens to be still extant, despite what the cited sources say. But the negativity we detest comes primarily from the word <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaijin.html" title="Gaijin">gaijin</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaijin.html" title="Gaijin">gaijin</a> article goes into details of that negativity. Hence a merge with <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaijin.html" title="Gaijin">gaijin</a> would make better sense than a merge with <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanophile.html" title="Japanophile">japanophile</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. People continue to comment on the talk page instead of here. The most recent comment was the following (anonymous): <i>In Japan, if you say "henna gaijin," people will think "weird foreigner" which does not necessarily mean "foreigner who has adapted to Japanese culture." Yeah, maybe someone who has adapted to Japanese culture will be described as "henna gaijin" since it is a rather unusual sight, but that doesn't mean that "henna gaijin" MEANS "adapted to Japanese culture." That's like me saying that "weird old man" is a term for "pedophile" because one could describe a pedophile as a weird old man.</i> <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 05:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This book doesn't look too notable to me. It's got an Amazon rank of 487,511, and a Google search for the title and author yields 505 hits from booksellers, libraries and such.

<li><b>Strong Merge as cut-down mention in new stub The No-Nonsense Guide to...</b> This yet another iteration of the commercial academic publisher's device of a series of short summary guides to serious academic or current affairs topics aimed at people who don't want to do heavy reading (especially lazy students) - see 20 or so books listed in the No-Nonsense series with different authors on Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_nr_n_17/203-7775959-6069554?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22no-nonsense%20guide%20to%22&amp;rh=n%3A1025612%2Ck%3A%22no-nonsense%20guide%20to%22%2Cn%3A60&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_nr_n_17/203-7775959-6069554?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22no-nonsense%20guide%20to%22&amp;rh=n%3A1025612%2Ck%3A%22no-nonsense%20guide%20to%22%2Cn%3A60&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> . At least in the UK, this trend seems to have taken off in the 1990s, the formula being inspired by the classic 1975 book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marx-Beginners-Rius/dp/0375714618" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Marx-Beginners-Rius/dp/0375714618" rel="nofollow">Marx for Beginners</a></i> by the Mexican cartoonist, <a href="../../../r/i/u/Rius.html" title="Rius">Rius</a> (This 1975 work was not created as part of a planned series but was quite an original concept: cartoon Marxist theory with comedy moments aimed at educating the masses). Scores, perhaps hundreds if you include the imitator series spawned, of "... for Beginners" books followed<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marx-Beginners-Rius/sim/0375714618/1/ref=pd_sexpl_s_b/103-4867583-8232610?ie=UTF8&amp;pf=book" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Marx-Beginners-Rius/sim/0375714618/1/ref=pd_sexpl_s_b/103-4867583-8232610?ie=UTF8&amp;pf=book" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> with increasingly uneven quality and content. The No-Nonsense series seems to be pretty respectable, but the editorial process would have worked with the series editor commissioning an expert author to write a particular book of the series, and <i>not</i> by the author submitting an original concept manuscript to the publisher. Such books are also typically intended to give overviews of the field rather than original arguments (the author would do well to to save that for a book which is not part of a "beginners" series). So, the No-Nonsense <i>series</i> may warrant an article here (compare the articles for <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...For_Dummies_95f0.html" title="...For Dummies">...For_Dummies</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Complete_Idiot%27s_Guide_to..._2339.html" title="The Complete Idiot's Guide to...">The Complete Idiot's Guide to...</a>), but we don't need an article on every book in the No-nonsense series (a commercially published book is not automatically encyclopedically notable) just as we don't for every one of the ...For Dummies series.

<dd>- Yes, because a couple of the mods on the list are big, we should definitly have a huge unmanageabvle list of every mod for HL2 with no limits on who can put their 2-bit never-to-be-finished mod on it. (Irony over.) Seriously, if the mod is big, then people will look for it's article directly, and if the game isn't that big, and doesn't have an article, it should not be included on an indiscriminate list as who would be looking for further information on something they never heard of? And as always, the 'if X and Y have an article then E, H and Z should be mentioned' arguement doesn't hold water. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>- Yes, but the problem is that every time we add a page for a mod that is notable someone post a adf and since there will be always someone that disagres they end up deleted even if we post prof of the notability (there will be always some Admin that disagres and it will delete it) Snewerl 20:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>- It's not an indiscriminate list, the List of Half-Life mods at least only has mods which either gained awards, made it to the Mod Of The Year feature or have their own article.

<dd>Yes, and now that list has only 6 games, 2 with articles, and at least 3 of the others are notable enough to have articles that would be kept, therefore the list is serving no useful purpose because the mods are big enough that people would be looking for the articles directly without the need of the list. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I understand now, thanks for that. The way I see it, a lot of Mods were caught off-guard with that purge a couple of months back and had their pages deleted, but I'm sure that mods like sven could re-create their pages and have them kept, as long as they made sure they paid special attention to establishing notability and providing sources.

<dd>Azure Sheep had at least a review in a computer magazine and other stuff that was reason for notability (not sure what you mean as prod).

<dd>(Moving indent back a a bit) A <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prod</a> is when someone puts up a tag saying they believe the article should be deleted. If the tag is left untouched for 5 days, the article is deleted without a second thought. This was what happened to Azure Sheep. All that was needed was someone to remove the Prod tag and the article wouldn't have been deleted, although most contested prods usually end up becomming AfDs, but at least people would have had a chance to argue their point. And whether an article is deleted or not is never down to just the admin. All the admin does is look at the arguements and have to decide which side makes the better arguement, and even then there is various appeals processes for people who disagree with a decision. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Livejournal is clearly a notable site. Some of its notability comes from the notable people using it, or from the notable events that have come from it. Thus it is useful for Wikipedia to have that information. There's no vandalism that I could see on this page, no content concerns at all really. At the worst, rename it to something other than notable LJ users, even though I think that's unnecessary to change, I won't object. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:46, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Looking at the article, I don't agree that this can be categorised as "listcruft". The article is of a decent size (not too big, not too small), is well annotated elevating it above the normal "just a list" articles so despised on Wikipedia, certainly verifiable using the external links, and actually quite interesting. It's also a bit ironic that some Wikipedians are saying "classification as notable is NPOV"... on AfD no less! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 16:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe going out and trying to find out if a figure on Wikipedia has a Livejournal does consist of original research on some level. I don't mean guys like Billy Corrigan; smaller figures, such as minor entertainers or politicians who have a blog, might not want others knowing about them and having them linked from this article. If we take <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy</a>, which is an official policy, into account, then unless the user is <i>famous</i> for their Livejournal, I see absolutely no purpose in listing its existence. Given that there really aren't that many people who are famous solely for LiveJournal, I think they could be included in the main article.</dd>

<dd>If we decide to begin including every Wikipedia figure on this list, then we will eventually run into problems with verifiability (ie which blogs are real).

As far as I see, this list is just an arbitrary listing of factoids. If the user is notable for their LiveJournal, mention it in the main article. I certainly wouldn't want to see List of MySpace users. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be confusing "original research" with "looking something up" or "reporting a known fact" . They are quite different. The prohibition against original research is against theories and ideas, not so much against facts (though there are facts that might qualify, this isn't one of them). So, you check to see if somebody famous has a livejournal. That's just "research" and is no different than say, watching a movie, noting who is in it, and putting that information on Wikipedia. Your concerns about privacy are not something that can be addressed here. If a famous person doesn't want their livejournal known to the public at large, they should consider using LJ's privacy features. Besides, that would be more of an individual problem than an article one. Given that as far as I know, none of the famous people listed in this article have tried to hide their livejournal (in fact, several of them link to it from their official websites), I don't see it as an immediate concern. Can't understand why you even begin to suggest including every Wikipedia figure on this list, that would seem to be odd. And I don't know about you, but I could get behind a List of Famous people who use Myspace or some such list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My concern is that it will eventually lead to sleuthing to find LiveJournals. Personally, I wouldn't mind having a list of people who are famous <i>for</i> their LiveJournals- the problem is that this list would be so short that it would be better off in a main article. In my opinion, having a list like this is pretty much the same as having a list of famous people who drive BMWs, or a list of famous people who like toast. Yeah some people might find it interesting, but it's just so trivial. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:47, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Famous people are already searched for, in all sorts of ways and places. If you think Wikipedia is a major factor in that, you might as well be arguing for the deletion of any article on a living person. Yeah, there are things we need to watch out for (like personal phone numbers, addresses (though there are exceptions to this, like <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neverland_Ranch_5297.html" title="Neverland Ranch">Neverland Ranch</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gate%27s_House_3053.html" title="Bill Gate's House">Bill Gate's House</a>) and emails ), but if someone puts their livejournal up publically, and it is found out about, deleting it is iffy, though we could do it if requested and they took obvious steps to make it private. To you, this may be like a list of famous people who drive BMWs, but perhaps you might want to look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_people.html" title="Lists of people">lists of people</a>. There's a fair number of lists in there which I would regard as more important than this. At least, until everybody and their brother gets a livejournal account. In which case, this list could indeed be deleted, and replaced with a list of folks without one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're making a bit of a stretch there by equating my position on this article to my position on every biography article we have. The only thing I'm concerned about privacy-wise is that it creates the possibility for editors to go out and find LiveJournals that haven't been declared publicly. Regarding the "lists of people article": The way I see this is list is it's just completely arbitrary in what the criteria for inclusion is, and it's essentially trivial information. This doesn't touch on the fact that it acts as a directory of famous peoples' LiveJournals too by simply listing their name, profession, and URL. I can't see List of people with websites being any different. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:48, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if I'm being unclear, but I trying to point out that you could potentially make the same argument about having biographical information about any living person. You can't make a broad statement that it could be a problem and blindly act on that, you have to make the decision on the individual case. If people want to go out and find non-public livejournals, I doubt they'll be inspired by Wikipedia. They'll do it, because they want to do it any way. Not because they want to put some information on Wikipedia. Even if they did, deleting this article would't help, they could still put it on the individual person's article. That's why I don't find that aspect of your argument convincing. Taken to its logical conclusion, it produces something absurd. Even if you limit it to just concerns about livejournals, it doesn't work too well. There are many celebs who publicize their livejournals. As such, including them would be appropriate. If there are any that request privacy, again, I say the first burden is on them to just Livejournal's privacy tools. If for some reason that doesn't work, then we can see about it when that does happen, on an individual scale. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now as for the second part, that's much more of an argument. Indeed, I don't think an article of lists of people with websites would be workable. That's too broad a category. Though I think this is a useful category Category:Celebrities who personally authored their official sites. Now Livejournal is a website, but it's a subset that is reasonably particular. Currently. For example, if you look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_people.html" title="Lists of people">lists of people</a>, of similar content. Take a good honest look at it, and all the sublists. Like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrity_guest_stars_on_Sesame_Street_d11b.html" title="List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street">List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street</a>. Perhaps one day that'll change, but not so far. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable private school in Poland. This article was speedied several times in its early days, but that was because it was a copyright violation.</p>
<p>The reason why this version should be deleted is that all that we know about this school points to it being non-notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not agree. The school is unique in Cracow as a school offering IB Diploma and GCSE options. The comment about Prague is irrelevant as Prague is not in Poland.

<li><b>Comment:</b> There's also a British School in Warsaw... so my comment about "Prague" is still relevant. Maybe this is the only such school in Cracow, but this fact would only mean it is notable within the city. The existance of the school was already <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> before you added the link - the IB organisation's entry shows that the school exists - but does not show how it is notable. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 00:57, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

That another school in Warsaw offers some of the same course material is irrelevant in a country of 40 million people in over 120,000 square miles.

I changed them to be more inclusive... there is more than 1 type of "$10" in the world. However, most of the items in the list are links to the general currency article, as most currencies don't have an article for each denomination. (Generally, only the US, Canadian and Australian dollars have denomination-specific articles) Is this overkill, or is it only neccessary to link to denominations that actually have an article written about them, such as in <a href="../../../%24/2/_/%242_bill.html" title="$2 bill">$2 bill</a>? <a href="../../../r/a/w/User%7ERawr_f73d.html" title="User:Rawr">Rawr</a> 23:34, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed - "bill" is a specifically US-centric term for banknotes. <i>But</i> since this list also includes $10 <i>coins</i>, either name is inappropriate. FWIW&lt; I've expanded the names of the currencies to make things a bit clearer, and also replaced the word "bill" with "note" where the former is inappropriate. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. No pages link to these articles. I don't think it is a good dab page (no article point to these pages, and I don't think users will search for '$10').

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dark Shikari. While I agree this article could use work, and should possibly be marked as a stub, PCSX is definitely a notable piece of software. Significant development, use, and availability (it is, to my knowledge, the only significantly compatible PS emulator that runs under OS X for example). A quick web search also reveals reviews and other media coverage, which all add support to its notability (per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>). From wiki deletion policy, "articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing", so even if it needs work, I disagree with deleting it. At most, I would vote for a <b>weak merge</b> with PCSX2, perhaps in a "history section", if no one steps forward after a reasonable time to further edit this article. However, I think it is capable of supporting its own article. <a href="../../../x/o/a/User%7EXoa_b5e3.html" title="User:Xoa">xoa</a> 05:49, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ok, few things you have got wrong: "Barely notable?", If you haven't heard of a fairly popular UK charting artist have the decency to admit it rather than making out he is extremely obscure. The tapes are still handed out at gigs and are fairly important to those researching this upcoming musician. Yes its a cult thing, but it seems if we left things up to you, we would only have articles on U2 and some other bland mainstream rubbish. Another thing, is it really worth all this hassle? i see nothing wrong with it being seperate. it definately doesn't merit this kind of arrogant fuss that comes from wiki-superiors and general meddlers.

<p>I would like to add that the mixtapes are very relevant because it is a large part of the artists success and why there was so much hype from magazines like NME. It has itself resulted in a boom in mixtapes amongst the independent music scene in the UK, from just normal kids, to other bands etc. Since this artist has an album out in january and is predicted by prominent mainstream faces of the UK music scene like NME and Zane Lowe of being a massive success i think it is important to anyone researching him. He is also signed to Virgin records, just to give you an idea of the scale.--Joeshawuk 19:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the links that you have provided:
<ul>
<li>1) <b>drownedinsound</b> - interview with artist's manangement team with a splash of hyperbole</li>
<li>2) <b>factmagazine</b> - tells us that he makes mix tapes. This was not disputed</li>
<li>3) <b>canvasmag</b> - informs us that there are mixtapes. Again - This is not disputed.</li>
<li>4) <b>jamie-t</b> - the artists own site. This counts as self referential citation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These links don't appear to do anything that supports your case. If you can cite evidence to support your claims (re: NME hype, the mixtape boom) then there might be something worthwhile. In the meantime, wikipedia is not a primary source of information - for anybody researching the artist, or his work, it is a starting point that collates sourcesm but doesn't make any conclusions itself. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincess_Tiswas_8ce5.html" title="User:Princess Tiswas">Princess Tiswas</a> 12:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Provided sources are added, I see no reason to delete this. I have a nice book that could help add to it. There's no doubt gonna be people who find anything remotely paranormal unreliable. The fact is, whether it's true or not, it has been documented. I just think this personal was trying for a legitimate article. Disappearances that have been attributed to a paranormal cause just isn't a good title. I don't think the title is to promote a neologism, it's just an attempt at a short descriptive title.

<li><b>Delete</b>: For the same reasons cited above. Sure, you have sources, but the sources also state that they really fall into the fourth dimension as a possible theory.

<li><b>Keep</b> Much has been made from the deletion side about "paranormal vanishing" being a neologism. And while this might, in a sense, be true, it only means that there is a difficulty in categorisation in this case. It says nothing about the subject of the article itself which is fairly well known and is certainly not new. The whole notion of paranormal vanishings or disapperances, of people(temporary or permanent), and sometimes of things, has a very long and solid tradition in folklore and, with the new arrival of, e.g., the alien abduction phenomenon, it seems to be firmly embedded in the modern world as well. The point, then, is that the problem here is merely one of what to call the article so that people can find it; the subject itself, on the other hand, surely meets all the criteria to warrant an article.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 15:02, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - i will have a go at it tomorrow, and redirect to a new title, and include 'disappearance stories' not simply as phenomena but as folklore ("strange disappearances" is a better title - a websearch turned lots of relevant returns, so that's a better title to go with.)

<li>Interesting find -- thanks for posting that. It certainly establishes that the subculture is notable enough, and I don't think there are any real verifiability concerns. So the subject should be discussed here -- it's merely a question of how it's most usefully arranged. I do honestly think it would be better discussed as a section within a wider context, either within <a href="../../../g/y/a/Gyaru.html" title="Gyaru">Gyaru</a>, or possibly within an article on Japanese male fashion (the article you link already does something similar, contrasting it with a different male fashion subculture, which seems to work quite well). My recommendation is therefore <b>keep or merge</b>, and if there's no consensus on which, keep and open a merge debate on the article's talk page. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:31, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Articles about cities, towns and villages, no matter how tiny, don't have to assert notability. All they have to do is assert that the hamlet <i>exists</i>. Some of us feel that the logical implication is that municipal functions of these towns - such as schools - are extended the same privilege. Until a definite policy or guideline exists, it means neither deletionists nor inclusionists are right or wrong - yet. But the lack of a guideline means there is no basis for calling for this article's deletion. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 15:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Some of us, on the other hand, feel that "cities, towns, and villages" should have to assert some manner of notability, same as everything else does (though for incorporated cities and larger towns, this wouldn't be very hard). But there are tons of "municipal functions and locations"-if we broadly exempt that, we run the risk of having "Office 22G in the municipal courthouse of Noplace, Nowhere", so long as something confirms its existence. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cities, towns, and villages <i>do</i> assert some manner of notability; they are notable by virtue of being permanent, distinct human communities; likewise, independent countries are notable by virtue of being independent countries (or do they need to assert notability to?). IMO, schools are notable <i>insofar as</i> they are permanent core institutions of permanent human communities. In most cases, including the present one, "X is a (public/parochial/..) school in Y" is essentially equivalent to saying that "X is a permanent core institution of the permanent human community Y. It plays a key role in Y's performing the most basic function of human society, viz. education." How can that not be seen as a claim of notability? -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 01:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that's not accurate. Many of those debates have led to "no consensus, defaults to keep" more than anything else. Furthermore, the majority of voices for keeping come from a small set of editors. Finally, not only have occasional schools in the past been deleted but if you look at current trends deletion has picked up massively in the last month or so. It is therefore inaccurate to claim that there is "massive community consensus" (these comments were made by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">User:JoshuaZ</a>)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Being a new user, I do indeed find it difficult to compile a perfect wiki page. I do find it unacceptable however that the page me considered for deletion due to a poor first posting. Since being brought up for deletion, the WP:NOR violations have been cleared far enough for the charge to be dropped, in my opinion. As another user on the discussion for the page said, The notion that this event isn't notable outside of Maryland or graduates is quite uncalled for. This event is followed by graduates and students of the schools, families, relatives, and other schools. While this event may not matter to you, it would be foolish to say that this event is not notable. the scope of people who do care about this event is quite large, and is backed up by documentation. Though it may not appear in textbooks or encyclopedias, it is well documented in newspapers, not just in Baltimore. I thank you for your concern over the content of Wikipedia, whoever I do wish for you to reconsider your decision to mark this page for deletion. --Andier 03:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> No sources are provided to back up any claim why this should be of more than local significance.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This rivalry is one of the oldest in the country, <i>the</i> oldest Catholic-school rivalry in the country. The results and other claims are likely from gameday programs, of which I'm sure someone still has a copy from the game played just a week ago. Are there any scholarly books or in-depth web pages about the game? Of course not, it's high school. What did you expect, an Encyclopedia Britannica article? However, this does not mean it is not of significance. I made the first Turkey Bowl page because I thought it was one of the more noteworthy things not present on this site, and I'm sure a casual browsing of this site could find many more absurd articles than a century-old high school rivalry game, one of the biggest of its kind in the entire country. I will immediately add this link to the sources: [<a href="http://www.examiner.com/a-415859~This_game_s_no_turkey.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.examiner.com/a-415859~This_game_s_no_turkey.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>]. Hopefully that will satisfy some of the more rabid sourcemongerers on Wikipedia. If anyone has a gameday program, I implore them to add its info to the page and cite it. Otherwise, I see no problem but citation with this article. Emphatic KEEP. Nursethisviper 15:21, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although I expected the opposite before I read the article, I'm going to say <b>Keep</b>. Not a vastly significant event for any but afficionados, but I could imagine this coming up as a very difficult question on some multi-million dollar quiz show. I'm not saying we should carry the results and history of every local rivalry, but this one does seem to be persistent and mildly notable. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep:</b> Wikipedia has an article by Brianyoumans on Adamu Tesfaw; arguably a much less notable artist than Die Mannequin, as far as the English version of Wikipedia is concerned. So why can we not have the Die Mannequin article? I, for one, found it very useful. Brianyoumans has posed no valid reason to delete this article, other than his own opinion. Wikipedia, would be greatly undermined if the opinions of individual users began to dictate what is relevant content and what is not. Please do not remove this article.

<li>I have in fact considered the notability requirements for bands. The requirements under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> as listed: #1, charted hit - no claim for that in article; #2, gold record - ditto; #3 - international or national concert tour - the article claims that they "opened a few dates" for Guns and Roses (which is good, I admit). I haven't seen a reference that this constituted a tour of Canada. #4 - two or more albums released - no; #5 - featured in multiple non-trivial sources - I haven't seen proof of that; the articles referenced in the article are mostly small mentions in articles on the G&amp;R tour; #6 - contains at least one member who is a member of a notable group - no (Jesse Keeler played on the EP, but is not a member of the group); #7 - most notable representative of a style - not claimed in article; #8 - major award - no; #9 - won a competition - no; #10 - performed notable theme music or soundtrack - no; #11 - placed in major network rotation - no claim of such; #12 - subject of at least half hour feature - no. So.... I'm open to withdrawing this nomination if anyone adds references for any of these, but, until then, they are a band with one EP out. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:39, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not completely impressed with the McGill article - it seems to be based on the interview with Care Failure, and I'm not sure what her idea of "brief Canadian tours" is.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Terveetkadet - You realize that an administrator is going to look at this AfD page, and they're going to delete your article, right? And not because the band isn't notable, but because you have handled this in an utterly foolish manner. Because you have turned your addition to Wikipedia into a personal assault, no one is going to pay attention to the band's entry, only your sockpuppeting and vitriol. And the result is, Die Mannequin will become a red link. I suggest crossing out (with the &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags) all of your <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and sock-puppeted votes, as a measure of courtesy. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles</a> 16:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that administrators are supposed to review these pages on the matter of the subject in question and NOT delete an item just because I argued with a guy who's trying to destroy my work in a way that you don't approve. I respect every person who made a comment here EXCEPT brianyoumans cause he destroyed my work in the past, he wants to destroy it again and he takes pride in the numerous pages he deleted. He even lists them in his user page. So sorry but NO &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags) for that guy.

<li><b>Nomination Withdrawn</b> - I was not able to verify the tour dates from any of the references in the article, but after a good bit of research, I found a tour listing on <a href="http://www.gnrdaily.com/tour_history_compact.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.gnrdaily.com/tour_history_compact.asp" rel="nofollow">Guns N Roses Daily</a> that verifies that Die Mannequin did in fact open 5 shows for them in Canada, in Halifax, Toronto, Quebec City, Ottawa, and St. John's. I think that probably constitutes enough of a tour to establish some notability, so I will withdraw this nomination.

<li><b>UnDelete</b> I just read the policy for deletion and this article clearly does not qualify. There is no copyright issue, nor is this a vanity article. Unless you have some evidence that this is illegal, this page will remain. For newer users of wiki there are a number of rues and procedures we are still learning - in turn there are a number of overzealous edits being made in the name of juking stats to claim more edits not good edits. The educational outreach of this program is slated to reach a large number of students and adults - more than 1 million so before you guess a post is suspicious do some basic research.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is contact info at the web site for an attorney and I will provide you with contact info at the Global Fund if you email me with a private email address, but the contact info at TGF should not be part of a public record or they would be inundated with junk.

<li><b>Comment</b> THis is my bad, the writing is unclear here. What shoudl have been written is that in children, HAPE is difficult to diagnose properly and it often shares symptoms with less serious ailments. Oxygen will often alliviate the symptoms allowing a correct diagnosis, and a continuation of the climb if it is simple an altitude headache. With HAPE you must descend, again my bad, but hardly a "clear hoax," at worst a lazy mistake. <s>Musicbiz 10:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</s><small>This comment was posted by user 24.54.227.131</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, not to toot my own horn, but I have spent the last couple of years working with the Fund in various ways and so have a fairly good idea of its scope, scale, and methodology. What is the associated 501(c)3 non-profit that is performing oversight on this project? The logistics of getting a U.S.-based tot (and may we presume that the doe-eyed child photoshopped onto the elephants on the site is in fact the putative climber?) up Kilimanjaro must significant, and that overhead could easily eat up the funds raised via PayPal... <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 20:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that this statement by Pjacobi is an unsubstantiated stereotype and removal of this article will help perpetuate false claims. Keeping this article will help squach stereotypes and will in-turn clarify the true naure of the subject at hand. The only reason these stereotypes exist is because of entrenched carbon infrastructure; I mention this because in other countries, especially Korea and China common ducted electrolysis technologies are quickly becoming the foundation of their fuel infrastructure. Why distribute liquid fuels, when electrical networks and on-site fuel production its more intuitive? <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Noah Seidman</a> 20:43, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article is a complete POV mess, it should be deleted or stubbed. Original text had a single reference from an obscure foreign press. Later on another author from a single-purpose account (who may or may not be the same person) adds a few more mostly obscure books at the bottom, and admits on the talk page that some are 'primary sources', which is against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Additionally no page-number or chapter references at all are in the text.

<p>This article has had several months of confusion. It's never gone beyond much more than merely being an un-sourced descriptive list. Attempts to add such things as a sourced Etymology have been opposed, usually by a single editor consistantly reverting. See: <a href="../../../w/i/z/Talk%7EWizard_%28fantasy%29_5e02.html" title="Talk:Wizard (fantasy)">Talk:Wizard (fantasy)</a> if you have a long length of time to read. Note that you will want to attempt to read the page history contemporary to the discussion, else it can become rather hard to follow at times. One editor has created continuous streams of RfCs, and even when spamming several other editor's talk page, only 1 or 2 people have responded. Since then the article's information has been merged to several articles. Now it's to the point of navigation and a disagreement of where the redirect should point to. I think it's time to just delete this mish-mosh of an article, and move on. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 20:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused. Wizard (fantasy) is currently a redirect to Wizard. That's a disambig page (and there's no question of deleting it Too many valid references). What exactly do you have a problem with? Are you sure you don't want to take this to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a>? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. This is an otherwise valid redirect that goes to <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard.html" title="Wizard">Wizard</a>, another article that is otherwise perfectly valid. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:14, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. For some history: after a dispute about what information was appropriate (the first RFC), a compromise was proposed that the article be merged with <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magicians_in_fantasy.html" title="Magicians in fantasy">Magicians in fantasy</a>. Jc37 merged information to Magicians in fantasy and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_magicians_in_fantasy.html" title="List of magicians in fantasy">List of magicians in fantasy</a> -- and then redirected the article to Wizard. As the Wikipedia guidelines clearly show, this is not the standard practice for mergers. Neither would deleting it be. It should be redirected to one of the pages it was merged with. Rather than enter an edit war, I opened the second RFC -- and those two RFC constitute the "continuous streams of RfCs" that Jc37 complains of.</li>

<dd>I note that one of the other editors has consulted an adminstrator, and reports that there are licensing concerns about merely deleting it. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 23:34, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, if some of the content has been merged elsewhere, the record of this article must be kept. Furthermore, I suggest the people involved go through <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a> to resolve their differences. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> is over two and half years old and has a long edit history. It's contents were merged into another article, so the resulting redirect can't be deleted because it contains a list of editors who contributed to the content that was merged into the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magicians_in_fantasy.html" title="Magicians in fantasy">Magicians in fantasy</a> article. We need to keep that list to satisfy the GFDL licence that Wikipedia uses. Since the information was put into the "Magicians in fantasy" article, the standards would seem to indicate that that is the proper choice for redirect. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 04:02, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the edit history at <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Wizard (fantasy)">Wizard (fantasy)</a> certainly needs to be kept. The issue of where the page redirects to is, in fact, independent of where the material formerly in it was moved or merged to, despite what some people have been saying. I'll discuss in more detail over on the talk page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:13, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact, if Bosniakophobia is invented term, then Serbophobia is also invented term, and for the sake of fairness, if you decide to delete Bosniakophobia, then please delete Serbophobia also. This article deserves a chance. It's still under construction, it will look much richer after a month or so when more users join in and contribute. There is no valid reason to delete this article. Bosniakophobia, or fear from and extreme prejudice against Bosniaks is a fact that must be dealt with.<b>Serbophobia</b> In the beginning, Serbophobia returned only 2 matches at Google. When Serbs introduced this word to Wikipedia, thanks to thousands of scrapper pages, Google now returns close to 3,000 matches (all copies of Wikipedia content). Serbophobia was also nominated for deletion etc, but nobody deleted it. Bosniakophobia should also not be deleted. Give it a chance, let other people join in and help the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> a sub-stub article for an individual team. P.S. On a side note, why is it that College football teams don't have their own articles? For instance, <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_26f5.html" title="Rutgers Scarlet Knights">Rutgers Scarlet Knights</a> redirects to the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_University_ce58.html" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a> article. If anyone is willing to start the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_26f5.html" title="Rutgers Scarlet Knights">Rutgers Scarlet Knights</a> article then change this to a redirect to that article. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 21:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> all individual college football season articles for individual teams. Please see Category:2006 NCAA Division I-A football season, all team articles in that category need to go if this one goes,not to mention ones for previous years. There are many already made, this just happens to be one of the ones with the least info.

<li><b>Keep</b> per VegaDark. This is a particularly notable season for the oldest college football program ever. The article's problem (and the reason I went with "keep" instead of "strong keep") is that it needs to be written; with absolutely no info about the season, the article really shouldn't exist when it's of this quality. However, I absolutely think this article <i>should</i> exist.

<dd>Additional comment: this article was authored by a company employee. Furthermore, the company has aroused some controversy by virtue of many of its writers adding links to Wikipedia articles in violation of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Nevertheless, the critical point as I see it turns on notability -- by our rules as an encyclopedia, if they're notable, they're included regardless of congeniality, ethics, or other POV attributes. See the talk page of the article for more discussion of notability -- several of us did a lot of digging and came up with some a few references, but they're very mrginal at best. I'm bringing the article to deletion not so much as a partisan for its deletion but more to get a broader community look at it and the refs. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>Thanks for digging up the NY Times links, Jim. Several of us dug around pretty thoroughly for evidence of notability and didn't find anything, so you win the search prize.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Sandstein. I am not partisan regarding the addition of links to S101 in WP articles - that can be dealt with separately. Here we are discussing notability of a website per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. A single 4½ year old article (which basically said the company was in decline) in a non-notable email newsletter is a clever find, but does not achieve notability for the company. The information we have is that the company operates under a different business model now and therefore that citation is largely irrelevant on content alone. Regarding the Alexa rank, I wonder if that link wasn't achieved at least in part through spamming Wikipedia. If this company was notable, there'd be a lot more independent reviews and news on them than there seems to be. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 03:16, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm the original prodder on this one. There is so many unreliable sources out there for this one that it is tough finding substantial reliable sources on this. The New York Times is obviously a reliable source, but the mentions of the site are, at best, in passing. I see a fair amount of blog entries mentioning some of the problems this organization is having, but if this were a notable site, it seems to me that it would be possible to find references to these issues (or even positive ones) in a site we could reference per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - This is a tough one for me. I actually utilize this website, posted there a few times and read from it alot, particularly from its investing advice sections. From my experience with it, I would say it is a very large in scope, prolific and heavily used website. I'm just a a regular person who has had no connection with this company's management* and who lives in a place far away from the company's headquarters. (*Disclosure:the nice president and I recently discussed this matter on <a href="../../../o/a/k/User_talk%7EOakshade_8291.html#Suite101.com" title="User talk:Oakshade">my talk page</a> after I demonstated I was sympathetic to this company.) I know this is antidotal, but it's one of those situations where it seems that it's notable even if if it doesn't strictly fall under WP inclusion guidelines.

<li>I looked through a fair amount of these results. So far, the vast majority of what I can find is self promotion on free sites, pr sites, and blogs. A couple of other editors did the same, and so far very little substantial has come up. Earlier in the discussion, someone noted a mention in the NYTimes, but if you take a look at the article, I think you'll agree that it falls in the trivial category. If this is a notable company/site, there would be at least some degree of non-trivial, independent coverage. I'm open to being convinced to the contrary, but so far, my conclusion is that this coverage doesn't exist. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 12:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Previously prod'ed, with that tag being removed and no extra evidence of notability being added. Essentially, we have here a 25sec interlude on an album by a notable band. It's not even an album track which didn't get released as a single, it's 25 seconds of excerpts from radio programs (either real or artificial). There are a couple of other tracks on the same album which would appear to fall into this category as well, but I'm refraining from mass-nominating them for the simple reason that it would muddy the waters. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm. So all notable tracks must be singles? Is that right? I don't think so. Because alot of the songs on this album stand out, despite never being released as singles (this statement not being just my opinion). You say this track isn't notable? Well I couldn't disagree more. White Zombie uses many audio samples in many of their songs and this track in particular represents that individual trait, a trait for which they were somewhat known for. Merge into the main album article you say? Well, I believe the information placed in the main album article is specifically for the album alone. The information I have given for the track, however, is specifically about track, which may conveniantly be placed under the page specifically for the song (Knuckle Duster (Radio 2-B)) to prevent a clutter on the main album page, which I do not wish to see). People visit this site to learn about what they are seeking (or at least I do...). If one visits this site with the intention of gaining knowledge about this song, then all the info they need could be right here for them. I am just trying to make it easier for people. -- <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoul_Crusher_0642.html" title="User:Soul Crusher">Soul Crusher</a> 02:15, 25 November 2006</p>

<dd>All quite valid points, however the <a href="../../../s/i/n/WP%7ESINGLE_146b.html" title="WP:SINGLE">current attempts at formulating a notability guideline on the matter</a> certainly tend to come down more heavily on the side of singles than album tracks, unless the album track is something like "Stairway to Heaven". It's that particular proposed guideline to which I'm referring when I say "notable", rather than anything else. In terms of the band using audio samples, I'll agree that that's a distinctive trait, but I'm not convinced that a 25sec compilation of some of these is important just because it demonstrates this trait in action. As far as a merge goes, perhaps the idea would be to add a section to the main album article listing the various samples used and then add that these particular 4 samples are on this track, these 3 are on a different track and so on. If done well, it would hardly clutter up the album's page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:19, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If this particluar track was a particular example of the sampling that media and critics consistently singled out as an example, then by citing these sources, one can establish the notability that has been claimed. But failing that, picking this one track as an example is one editor's opinion, and does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 21:53, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>In the beginning, Serbophobia returned only 2 matches at Google. When Serbs introduced this word to Wikipedia, thanks to thousands of scrapper pages, Google now returns close to 3,000 matches (all copies of Wikipedia content). Serbophobia was also nominated for deletion in the past etc, but nobody deleted it. Now, people want to delete Bosniakophobia. I contest the deletion of Bosniakophobia and suggest - if you want to delete Bosniakophobia, then you should also delete Serbophobia. Since you haven't deleted Serbophobia, please keep your hands away from Bosniakophobia. Let's play it fair.</b></p>
<p>Either delete both or don't delete any.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of some of discussion about this article dating back to December 2005 (by Asim Led):</p>
<p>This word ( Serbophobia )does not deserve an article of its own, it’s a term devised for explicitly political purposes during the late 80s and early 90s. It can not be compared to "Russophobia" or "Islamophobia" because both of these deal with prevalent general social attitudes against ethnic and religious groups based on their culture and heritage. The term Serbophobia, on the other hand, is used virtually exclusively in a political context, in either an accusatory manner or as a justification. To say that it is "comparatively" as common as the term "Russophobia" is ridiculous, and based on some shady calculation certain users made involving army size and GDP. A simple Google search shows that the term "Russophobia" is far, far more common than "Serbophobia". Of the results that do show up on Google, I think they adequately manifest the nature of this term and exactly why it does not belong on Wikipedia. Of the initial 10 results that come up on the first page: The #1 result is the respective Wikipedia article 2 come from a radical right political site 6 of them come from the same two Serbian political writers and analysts. 1 comes from a book on Serbian propaganda efforts during the late 80s and early 90s If this all wasn't enough, the single legitimate source provided has been completely misinterpreted. The quote reads as follows: "Furthering this incipient nation-fever was the extraordinary memorandum issued to the public in 1986 by the prestigious Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, condemning the perceived presence of "Serbophobia" in the central government of Yugoslavia." The use of this as a reference for some traditional use of the term would be fine and dandy if the word wasn’t placed in quotes; but it is. This is because the author views the term with skepticism and questions its validity, implying (just as Dado mentioned) that the word was used by Serb officials to drum up support amongst the populace for their nationalist policies. I challenge any neutral observer to read the context of the word, notice the tone of the passage, read the preceding paragraphs, and not reach the same conclusion as I did[2].</p>

<p>This article is about a magic weapon which appeared in a single installment of the <i>Ultima</i> series and was not integral to the plot.

<li><b>Delete and Don't Merge</b> Blatant Gameguide article. There are scores, even hundreds of hidden secrets/special weapons in a game like <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_VII_4623.html" title="Ultima VII">Ultima VII</a>, which also has a huge plot with scores of characters each with their little backstory.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm the original creator of this article. Let me put it this way: I was young and needed mo... er, well, something. =) I certainly wouldn't create an article like this today. Just a few days ago, I was contemplating on <i>maybe</i> something like "List of items of Ultima series" or something, which would list notable and memorable items from the series. A list article would be the sane way to handle items that just appear in one part of the series. (We already merged <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Companions_of_the_Avatar_435a.html" title="The Companions of the Avatar">The Companions of the Avatar</a> previously, in similar vein.) Hoe of Destruction is unique to Ultima VII part 1, therefore in my opinion, it's merge material - but in this case, it would need a chainsaw-trimming <i>and</i> the list article in question doesn't exist yet. The item is unique to the series, and certainly an unique item considering all CRPGs, but I don't think those facts alone save it. It's like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Victory_Gin_%282nd_nomination%29_4eac.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Victory Gin (2nd nomination)">Victory Gin</a>. So as the primary author of the article, I don't mind if it gets deleted now; it would be largely rewritten <i>anyway</i> when <i>and if</i> I ever get around to creating that item list article. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete and don't merge</b>. The existence of this weapon is probably worthy of noting in an article like List of weapons in Ultima, but the backstory is utterly unimportant.

<dd>the MUGEN network of Excellence aims to structure and shape a world-class framework of European scientific and technological excellence in the field of “murine models for immunological disease”, to advance understanding of the genetic basis of disease and to enhance innovation and translatability of research efforts. MUGEN’s specific mission is to bring together different expertise from academic and industrial laboratories in order to study human immunological disease by integrating the participant institutions’ strengths in immunological knowledge with new approaches in functional genomics. By removing barriers to progress and promoting the synergistic interaction of scientists from various disciplines integrated, MUGEN expects to bring Europe a competitive advantage in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MUGEN aims to:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Systematically study animal models for immune diseases and processes through the application of functional genomic platforms (transgenesis, targeted and random mutagenesis, expression profiling and bioinformatics).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Integrate the outstanding research experience and capacities of each network participant to allow the efficient application of post-genomic approaches to generate new knowledge in immunological diseases and processes. Such knowledge is expected to lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Ensure spreading of excellence, optimal use and dissemination of the knowledge generated through the network beyond the boundaries of MUGEN, by integrating competencies to train researchers, to encourage knowledge transfer, to address innovation related aspects of research and to raise the public awareness of scientific research issues.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm sorry if you feel that this article is not up to snuff. I've spent a good deal of time researching and documenting things about this group who I saw perform here in Berlin in 2004. I don't really know them personally, but I've contacted them since I started trying to write material for this article and asked them questions. Their actual name is a drawing and so it's very hard to search for information on them online, but I've tried. A lot of the information is from zines interviews I've read which are not published on the internet. I'm also very new to wikipedia and I'm not on the computer as much as a lot of you are so I can only devote a certain amount of time to learning how to format and footnote things, but I tried to footnote some things from the portion of information which came from the Artists Space website. Artists Space is surely a reputable source as it's been an important non-profit art space in New York City since the 1970s. I will work more on this article to try and make it more neutral, if that is the problem. I am just trying to make it comprehensive and accurate. I can heavily edit it, or you can edit it if you do the correct research, but I feel like you are jumping to conclusions without actually knowing anything at all about the subject matter, or even about experimental music, noise, and contemporary project based-art. For subjects which do not have a lot of internet information about them, I feel like wikipedia is a great resource. If this page is deleted, you're creating a catch 22. I've put a lot of my own time and energy into this article because I think that this group warrants it. I know that there are thousands of people who have seen this group perform or own their albums or have read their writings who have felt affected and inspired the same way that I did.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also understand that part of what makes wikipedia so great is that it is heavily edited, ending up with entries that are as accurate as possible. So, I'm not offended that this be proposed for deletion even though I've worked hard on it thus far and even though I know that a lot of editors like to rack up "Number of deletions" on their profile pages. Please try to do some more research of your own before discrediting mine, and I'll attempt to get more references together and properly footnote them. I can remove things which seem too much like speculation and whittle it down to something more digestible. Hopefully you'll allow me this. Thanks! - Anette</p>

<p>Seems to be a Pokemon-type idea made up by the article author. No sources are given or even alluded to. Google searches like <i>multimon "multiple monsters"</i>, <i>multimon egg</i> and <i>multimon Xyclone</i> turn up nothing. (There are lots of results for "multimon" because the name is used for software, etc.) Looks like it violates <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 00:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
