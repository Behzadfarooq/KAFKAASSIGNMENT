No, it's not your fault that Google lists them, but that's not the issue, it's the point that there's not a whole lot else listed. That just suggests to me a degree of non notability.

<dd>I see. A cause for above results might be that in the demoscene, realnames are traditionally detached from scene names which means that demosceners seldom appear with their realnames mentioned, neither next to their productions, nor to any articles published about them - with the exception of user pages where the entry of a realname is mandatory. That means you will not find as many hits for a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Leonard+Ritter+paniq" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Leonard+Ritter+paniq" rel="nofollow">realname AND an artist name</a> as you will find for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+paniq" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+paniq" rel="nofollow">group and artist name</a>, where you wont find a lot about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+Leonard+Ritter" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+Leonard+Ritter" rel="nofollow">group and realname</a>. Additionally, collaborative releases are more common and informations about those often omit member names. Therefore searches for the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+demo" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=farbrausch+demo" rel="nofollow">group itself</a> are most fruitful. It is obvious from such results that, especially in the demoscene, a directory of artists associating them with their reallife identities is needed. There is virtually no place on the net where you can find out about those people. -- <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPaniq_4446.html" title="User:Paniq">Paniq</a> 22:20, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As much as I would love to vote, I'd call a <b>neutral</b> on this one due to being subjective - since I happen to know the person in question. His notability is questionable among "normal people" - among <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demosceners</a>, however, he's a well-renowned artist, who developed skills in both programming, graphics and, most importantly, music. <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15092" class="external text" title="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15092" rel="nofollow">His</a> <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=11248" class="external text" title="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=11248" rel="nofollow">works</a> usually recieved very good reviews among critics, which isn't easy to achieve - if you don't believe me, take a try. I know that all this alone does not imply a Wikipedia entry. Then again, the line is thin. And Google searches are definetely the silliest way of defining notablity; if something produces only a few hits on Google, it means that the information about it is vague, and must be extended somehow - Wikipedia is a good place to do this. Or do I have to put up a load of pages of something to prove it notable? No. (edit: Oh and I just can't wait to get the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28demoscene%29.html" title="Conspiracy (demoscene)">Conspiracy</a> page to get VfD'd...) // <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGargaj_5184.html" title="User:Gargaj">Gargaj</a> 02:58, 2005 Feb 6 (UTC)</li>

Google hits for someone who is active in on-line forums is not very telling, either, and anyway it looks like most of the hits are due to intense activity on a few demoscene sites. Notability within an Internet subculture might qualify but the threshold should be pretty high, In other words he would have to be among the handful of most famous demoscene people, and I can't tell if that is so. Otherwise the Wikipedia will become a Directory of On-line Personalities. By the way, the article as it stands is verging on puffery. Notability not established.

<li>For biographies, my opinion is that they should establish notability in a verifiable way so that a person reading them can determine whether the person is notable. The authors should be given some time to do this -- we shouldn't jump on an article and nominate it for VfD within minutes or hours of its creation. But it shouldn't be many days, either. It is not my responsibility when voting to go out and do research to determine whether the subject of an article is notable. If you are an expert on this, then edit the article to include verifiable information that paniq is one of the 4-5 most notable in the demoscene world, and I will reconsider my vote. Verifiable information means facts. It doesn't just mean your say-so. I don't trust your opinion, because (1) every editor on Wikipedia is a nameless nobody, including me, and in principle nobody's opinion here is to be taken on authority; and (2) given the tone of your comments, I particularly don't trust you. For example, if you are saying he is one of the demoscene people with the most radio-play, lets have some proof of that. As for the puffery comment, it is not the basis of my vote. It was an aside, and if the article is not deleted, I probably will try to edit it out, as I have in many other cases. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:08, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't imagine a single reason why anybody should be impressed with my opinions. I'm a nameless nobody. So are you. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia created by nameless nobodies. This is why opinions don't matter much here, only verifiable information. Nobody is expected to believe something just because "BM" said so. Who the heck is "BM"? Who the heck is anybody here? That is all beside the point, anyway. The issue is whether the subject of this article, who happens to be a relatively popular Wikipedia editor, is notable enough to have an article about him. You see, he doesn't get an article about himself just because he's a nice guy and we all hang out together on the Wikipedia. Maybe that is how other sites you hang out on work, but this is not just another site. We are trying to build an encyclopedia. I am asking for verifiable information as to notability within the demoscene community. If the demoscene community hasn't established any way for the world to determine who their notables are, that is not my fault. The world is not going to accept that they are all notables, and they have reason to be skeptical if someone from that scene is claimed to be notable.

<li>Its only partially about music. Where are the guidelines for manifolds and demosceners? I understand that maintaining a new kind of encyclopedia is a hard task, especially because it is not completely defined what it is. The net has opened new ways of understanding culture, and the demoscene is rather young, on its way to climb out of the pit of subcultures, in its own a redefinition of what art is about. While this is happening, the music industry is going down the drain and additively defaces itself as a pusher of taste, obfuscating the spectrum of musical quality with bruteforce marketing and top tens that are primarily constructed from sales results. It is indeed a controversial topic, so I understand that an article about me comes rather early. Your decision defines what this place is about. I'll always love wikipedia and in case this article goes, it might be back in a few years (I hope). -- <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPaniq_4446.html" title="User:Paniq">Paniq</a> 20:26, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Paniq, I hope you appreciate that this isn't personal. The demoscene obviously isn't (yet) the royal road to notability. What criteria would you suggest for high notability in that world? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:38, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Notability is subjective, so I'd say: Democracy. This page decides this articles notability given the facts, opinions and informations that have been mentioned here. The fate of this article is actually telling me something about myself. High notability in the demoscene is usually accompanied by top placement in various competitions on large demoparties (placement is democratic as well, the audience votes the winner) and high activity over a longer period of time.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Notability is subjective". Is it? Surely it is one of the few things which is not subjective? Agreed, one can be notable in a quasi-subjective sense: in that, for example, a small group of people may consider a person to be notable. But, ultimately, it must be objectivity which defines notability: if we remove the notion of objectivity from notability we are really talking about something else. My point being? You seem to think that people on here are subjectively deciding whether or not you are sufficiently notable. I disagree. People on here who are saying 'delete' or 'userfy' are saying so on the objective basis that you are not, in fact, notable regardless of what persuasive arguments or points may be raised. And it is on that, objective basis, that I still do not consider you to be "notable". (Seems terrible rude to say that, I'm sorry. Please don't take it personally!!!) --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 20:30, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No problem. I have yet to encounter true objectivity. Even the article about <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28journalism%29.html" title="Objectivity (journalism)">objectivity</a> seems to be unable to define it sufficiently in an objective way, which is a rather amusing observation, contradicting your statement. "People say" is subjective judgement of notability at its best. I doubt that, unless one rests among the spirits and thus is above all material things, one is able to produce any "objective" results at all.<br />
Do I understand your point correctly as "People who disagree to keep the page have an objective basis"? Does that mean that solely people who vote for keeping the page are subjective? If yes, we should call this <i>Marcus' Law</i> and apply it to elections.

<li>Let me introduce myself: I'm scamp/vacuum, active member of the demoscene, and I know Paniq for years now. I'm also the main organizer of the Breakpoint party where paniq won competitions at. I highly respect paniq for his work. That being said: I also respect Wikipedia, and I think it should be free from self promotion. This article clearly is. And sorry, "I did not put the article here, but I am updating it from time to time." is a blatant lie. The article was originally created from the IP 212.202.50.46 which resolves to port-212-202-50-46.dynamic.qsc.de and traces to Frankfurt/Germany, and paniq right now is online on IRC at 212.202.50.103, which resolves to port-212-202-50-103.dynamic.qsc.de. Also back in 2004 he told everyone on IRC how funny it was to create his own entry about himself on Wikipedia. While I really welcome recent efforts from RadMan1 and others to add articles about the demoscene to Wikipedia, I don't think it makes sense to now add each and every scener to Wikipedia - and well, the list of people more "important" (and therefore would need to be added first) to the scene than paniq is quite long (though that list for <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> would be much, much longer&#160;;) - <b>Delete or Userfy</b> -- <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESKissel_90f7.html" title="User:SKissel">SKissel</a>

Paniq +"Leonard Ritter" isn't a good metric for someone known in his field of notability almost exclusively as Paniq alone, and commercial album release does not appear to be a good notability bar for the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a> now and, with the shape of commercial album releases, possibly ever. I've edited the article a bit to remove the <i>one</i> glaring vanity-like element (the link to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_universalis.html" title="Homo universalis">homo universalis</a>), and to otherwise conform with my best understanding of Wikistyle. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 23:06, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's interesting how Paniq's being compared to Jason Kottke. It seems like those who voted Keep in the Kottke VfD discussion were being directed to this article. Is this normal Wikipedia practice for users to solicit practically everyone that might possibly support their position? Or is this just an attempt to make it seem that more people would be interested in having the article in the encyclopedia? That being said, by looking at the article, it seems that Paniq is notable in his field; however, the question is, is the field itself notable enough for his inclusion? Blogging is notable enough, IMHO, and Kottke is a top blogger. And that's why I voted Keep for Kottke. German demoscene? Personally, I'd classify it at about the same level as the Canadian trivia scene -- and I had an article about myself run through VfD and deleted. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 01:10, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You misunderstand what the "demoscene" is, its not a strictly german thing, or a swedish thing, or an american thing. It is a global computer hobby subculture, much as Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a fantasy hobby subculture, both involve some level of creativity and artistic talent. If it were strictly a cultural thing I would likely join you in a delete vote, but its not and I urge you to reconsider your vote. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™<a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 02:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../f/a/r/Farbrausch.html" title="Farbrausch">Farbrausch</a> have their own article, as they should, as wiki-worthy main figures of the genre. However, when even THAT doesn't establish that paniq has any individual importance, I'm going to remain unconvinced. The bare truth is that outside of Farbrausch, there has been no evidence presented that paniq has done anything to warrant a separate entry for himself. I'm sorry, it's nothing personal, but that's how it stands. Everyone knows Google hits can be manipulated either way to promote or upset popularity, but at the base level, on the most basic of searches, paniq turns up 3,200 hits from only 80 sites. In my mind, that's not diverse enough, especially for a topic based around computers. --<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawlore_968f.html" title="User:Lawlore">Lawlore</a> 11:01, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This has been one of the best debates on a VfD that i've seen in my brief time at Wikipedia. I've been re-reading it all, plus the new entries -- and I have been tempted to change my delete vote above, just based on the amount of discussion it has generated. Plus I've come to like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a>! Having spent more time checking out the Wiki entries around the subject and checking out a few web sites, however, I realise that my emotional side is predominating here, so I have to stay with my original vote <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 14:17, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. I don't HAVE to do that at all. When I think about many of the entries I have seen that I have not yet summoned up the energy to put up for VfD, this one has far more justification for being there. Maybe someone in 5 years will successfully VfD it because <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a> sinks into obscurity without leaving a true heritage, (I hope not, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paniq.html" title="Paniq">paniq</a> ) but until then I'm going to change my vote to <b>Keep</b>, <b>Keep</b> (the two of them because I don't know how to strike thu my old vote, and don't have the time right now to find out, so one delete plus two keeps should equal a YES <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 14:21, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>That also isn't very flattering to paniq, is it: "OK, paniq, you're in. We decided you have to be more notable than Machinedramon". That seems like a race to the bottom. It is saying that since we don't seem to be able stop non-notable subjects from becoming Wikipedia articles as fast as they come in, we might as well give up. Let's put up a big sign: "Write an article on anything you want. Who are we to tell you what might be important? As long as your article is factual and not too opinionated and it looks like someone, somewhere, might want to read it, its fine by us. But if the subject is youself, get your friend to write it for you, pal, because we don't want vanity." --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I thought I was parodying it, guys. On Wikipedia, people can edit articles and if they write something that is not true, muddled, irrelevant, POV-pushing, etc, some other editor can delete or modify it. Within an article, the collective efforts of editors determine the final result, sometimes after a lot of wrangling. Above the level of an article, though, where you are deciding what articles should exist and how a large subject should be divided up between multiple articles, that changes dramatically. Anybody can create any article, and according to your logic, nobody else can question it, provided the new article doesn't fall into a small number of categories of recognized badness. If we allow anyone to edit at the infra-article level, why do we have such different rules to edit at the supra-article level? That is what VfD is basically about: editing the Wikipedia at the supra-article level. If I put a new section into an article about a sub-topic that the other editors think is irrelevant or not sigificant enough to take up the space, they will delete it. But if I put the material into a separate article, nobody can touch it. It can only be cleaned up. The more extreme inclusionists seem to be saying that nobody should try to edit at the supra-article level, that an article-creation decision should never be challenged and the structure of the Wikipedia should not be planned and should simply left to accretion, as article-creators come along at random and create new articles. By that view, except in the rare cases of vanity, original research, and patent nonsense, any attempt to undo an article-creation decision is "deletionism" and is beyond the pale. If that view prevails, the result will be that Wikipedia will have no coherent structure above the article level. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:19, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
