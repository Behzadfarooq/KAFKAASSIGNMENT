It's a completely dead-in-the-water vanity page about a complete nobody that openly flaunts its own non-notability.

<li><b>Please do delete it!</b> Perhaps the ultimate proof that this is not a "vanity" page on my part is that I do indeed hope you all delete this page. This has been a nightmare of the surreal kind. The fact is that there are many pages on Wikipedia about people that are not famous, and being famous has never been the qualification for being on this page. (Talk about not knowing about what makes an entry encyclopedic. Since when has being famous qualified one as being worthy to be in an encyclopedia? Have most people heard of <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Laban_e203.html" title="Rudolf Laban">Rudolf Laban</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Jooss_0d54.html" title="Kurt Jooss">Kurt Jooss</a>? But please, God, DO delete this page. What a nightmare this has all become. And -- for the record -- the only reason I really got angry and it became a "edit war" is because I resented the comments that this page was a "malicious hack job" by me, that I didn't know the facts of my own father's life, and that I got his ethnicity wrong. Bizarre! Again, yes, PLEASE delete it!<br /></li>

<li><b>Merge to Tegal Corporation:</b> (<b>or Delete</b> -this note added Aug. 18, 2005-) After reading user JYolkowski's suggestion, I have done a bit of research, and changed my mind. Thank you user JYolkowski for the fresh suggestion. Even though Mr. Parodi may not be worthy of a dedicated article himself, it would seem that the <a href="../../../t/e/g/Tegal_Corporation_26be.html" title="Tegal Corporation">Tegal Corporation</a> is. I just did a Google search on 'Tegal Corporation' and came up with over 5,000 hits. Clearly Tegal Corp is worthy of an article, and if Tegal is worthy of an article, then the info re: the Tegal CEO for the last 10 years is also very pertinent to that company. I say, nearly all bio info on Parodi could be merged verbatim from the Parodi article into the Tegal Corp article, and then the Michael Parodi article could be redirected to Tegal.<br /></li>
