<p>Essentially a memorial page, albeit one with some press attention. This is admittedly a close call, and the subject of some discussion at Recent Deaths, so consensus might as well be sought here. I'm indifferent, so I will <b>abstain</b><a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:38, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If there are five deaths in 22 years directly attributable to cheerleading, and this is one of them, I'm of the opinion that makes it notable. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 17:13, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I disagree that it is a memorial page: she is notable for how she died, and the article focuses on cheerleading, which led to her death. It doesn't tell us, for example, that she liked fluffy kittens and wanted to grow up to be a ballerina. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 17:14, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is very sad; however, I have to say <b>delete</b>, I'm afraid. If dying while cheerleading is notable, it should have its own page. Many, many wonderful people have died in unusual ways, performing sports, hobbies, etc. Its a shame, but they can't all get a mention.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrayum_0635.html" title="User:Grayum">Grayum</a> 17:23, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> naturally I'll go with the consensus, but I would comment that it would be surprising if an article about a single incident comprising 20% of the deaths in any other activity were classed as non-notable <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 17:40, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In reply to Tonywalton, all that proves is that the rate of death from cheerleading is fairly low, and/or that the number of people who participate in it is also fairly low. Most individual deaths are not notable, unless the person who died is notable before their death, with few exceptions. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 18:23, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Put Elsewhere</b>. I tend to agree with Tonywalton on this. Cheerleading is a dangerous sport with the constant possibly for severe injury or death. Instead of giving it an entire page, could it be added to the cheerleading page already in existance? And then, other cases can be added as they occur, also. I think it's important to show that it's not just a bunch of girls shaking pom-poms for boys, but a sport where people can get hurt or die. Why not include it with cheerleading? <a href="../../../k/_/o/User%7EK_of_slinky_a34a.html" title="User:K of slinky">K of slinky</a> 20:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable enough to make CNN, MSNBC, FOXNEWS and all 3 network broadcasts. Also, as per <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a>, this represents a significant event within the sport. Future deaths in Cheerleading are sure to refer back to this event.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Facts are important, not fame. Just because I haven't heard of a story doesn't mean I should automatically dismiss it as not being noteworthy. It's an encyclopedia, not a copy of US Weekly. Let's get as much factual information together as possible...just because it's not important to you doesn't mean it's not important to someone else. Vanity and advertising should be deleted everytime, but not factual news like this. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigGuy219_ebf7.html" title="User:BigGuy219">BigGuy219</a> 20:25, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>; the only reason this caused a media flap is because of the somewhat amusing nature of the otherwise unfortunate story. That doesn't really make someone particularly notable, but the sheer <i>amount</i> of media attention here would seem to make up some of the difference. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:09, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Her name is already mentioned in the main <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheerleading.html" title="Cheerleading">cheerleading</a> article. The contents of her article should just fully be displayed in the main article. Although her death may have been tragic, I don't think she is notable enough to warrant her own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. The test is if her name is used to push (or see attempts to push) changes in cheerleading organizations, the schools, and/or the law. I suspect it might. If it drops from the headlines, and no effect is left, it can be deleted later. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 09:46, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As the original editor of the article I assert it is not a memorial page as has been suggested in the nomination for deletion. I am an Australian. I have never seen live cheerleading and would not participate in such an activity and would actively discourage my daughter from cheerleading. I wrote the article when I became aware of the death and issues of notability on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Talk%7EDeaths_in_2005_79dc.html#Ashley_Burns" title="Talk:Deaths in 2005">Talk:Deaths_in_2005#Ashley_Burns</a>. Before coming across the reference to her on that page I had never heard of her. At that stage, just over a week over her death, a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22ashley+burns%22+cheerleader&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22ashley+burns%22+cheerleader&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">simple google search</a> showed 464 hits. Today, three days later, the same search shows 609 hits. Her death, reports of the funeral, reports of the potential impact on cheerleading stunts has received national coverage being reported several times in the Washington Post, on CNN, in the Houston newspapers as well as local Massachussets papers. It is my assessment that the threshhold of notability has been reached and that although there are limits to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">the Google test</a> other articles have been kept with fewer hits. I have referenced Ashely Burns's death in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheerleading.html" title="Cheerleading">Cheerleading</a> article but I do not think it appropriate that the article be taken over by details of this incident. As a passing observation on process I find it strange that the nominator of the VfD chose to abstain. I also think as a matter of courtesy original editors of articles should be advised if an article into which they have obviously put more than a passing amount of effort were notified via their talk page of the deletion debate. Because of subsequent edits to the article the nomination to VfD did not show up on my talk page and I nearly missed the debate.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:17, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I brought the matter to VfD having following the discussion on Recent Deaths (and wishing for the widest possible consensus), but I truly have no firm opinion, so I abstained, which is not uncommon. I do not follow the practice of notifying contributors of VfD's on their creations, at least not when ample and capable defenses are otherwise provided by dispassionate parties. Although I continue to abstain, I believe some would argue that the Google Test is less appropriate here, on the theory that this is a transient phenomenon, and not likely to be widely remembered after a short time has elapsed. My suggestion that is a this memorial page follows from my belief that nothing is memorable about young Burns except her tragic death. Any other details (about cheerleading hazards generally) would belong at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheerleading.html" title="Cheerleading">cheerleading</a> or, possibly, the odd-sounding cheerleading hazards. On the other hand, I acknowledge that press makes one notable. Hence, I am undecided, and <b>abstain</b> as above. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:32, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
