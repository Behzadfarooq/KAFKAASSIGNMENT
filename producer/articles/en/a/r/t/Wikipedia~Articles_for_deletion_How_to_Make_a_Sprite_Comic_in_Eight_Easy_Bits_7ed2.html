<li><b>Comment</b> - If it is an April Fool's joke (which I doubt) then it's pretty realistic. Because the entire site and forums are down and the whole thing has been replaced by a placeholder advertising portal you see at "parked" domains.

<li>Wouldn't it be better to give the article the proper citations? Mind you, in the case of webcomics, most if not all citations will direct to single episodes. If that's okay, expect citations once the site is back up. No problem there. --R. Wolff 07:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: 8 Easy Bits has a fundamental uniqueness to it. So far as I know, no other webcomic shares its premise or style. Some might say it is similar to Captain SNES, but 8 Easy Bits is definitely its own comic and not a clone of another as so many are these days. 64.72.87.113 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.72.87.113.html" title="User talk:64.72.87.113">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.72.87.113_1979.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.72.87.113">contribs</a>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and I know my vote won't count. 8 Easy Bits is literate, topical and funny. There's nothing else to say: the comic has artistic merit and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wiki is not paper</a>. The fact of the matter is that there are people who care enough about this comic to have the article kept, and there is nobody who cares enough about twenty kilobytes on Wikimedia's servers to have the article deleted. Or nobody who should care enough, at any rate. Honestly, this is a good article, and deleting it isn't worth the effort of voting.66.245.141.71 (talk <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.245.141.71_5116.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.245.141.71">contribs</a>) 05:10, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: The Alexa rating is obviously there (albeit for the older domain), so that argument is invalid. Apart from that, it's a higly original comic in its genre and does things very few others do (reference the use of sprites, not just rehash the game's story etc.) --R.

<li><b>Week Keep</b>: I have little experience with Wikipedia itself, but I have helped work on other Wikis. I feel that a Wiki is for informational purposes about everything, no matter how mundane. I have found other articles in Wikipedia that had less of a reason to be here than this, and they're not being discussed for information. Why? Because it's handy.

As others have said, this does seem to be fairly unique and somewhat popular in the webcomics community.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If you take a look at "eight easy bits" on Google now, it only gives back <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22eight+easy+bits%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22eight+easy+bits%22" rel="nofollow">45 unique hits</a> and about 300 in total. The reason for the high amount of links beforehand was because Google was indexing roughly 3000 links for a forum user with "eight easy bits" in his signiture. I do disagree with the synopsis that being launched in 2003 makes for a long running webcomic, it has only managed 97 strips and if you look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>, you'll find many more webcomics which have lasted much longer. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 22:18, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Eight Easy Bits comics tend to be at least three to four times as long as typical webcomics, and have exceeded seventy panels on a single page. Not to mention that it's a very sprite-intensive comic, with sprites and graphics extracted from many different NES games. You can't dismiss it out of hand based on the "97 strips" criterion. <a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob_0e74.html" title="User:Lebob">Lebob</a></li>

<li><b>keep</b> For reasons listed above. it is notable enough, and Wikipedia is not a paper encylopedia. Wutasumi (talk <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wutasumi_003e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wutasumi">contribs</a>) 05:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> The Wikipedia policy says nothing about notability. It merely states that it isn't a dumping ground for random information, and with the organization and content in the article, it isn't random information. 07:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the comic is often linked by other webcomic authors, and thus seems to be somewhat notable, at least in the webcomic community. "Notability" is such a fuzzy criteria anyway, and there's little to no mention of it in Wikipedia policies. This does not seem to be a vanity or advertising page, and that's the closest thing on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to a "notability" requirement that I can find. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartBurn_Kid_1f88.html" title="User:HeartBurn Kid">HBK</a>|<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeartBurn_Kid_0c33.html" title="User talk:HeartBurn Kid">Talk</a> 16:07, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Due to the fact that Hannchann's own links link to 916 and 11,600 sites respectively, I find the statement to have little merit. It is linked to by VG cats, whose author is himself quite notable, giving it plenty of merit in the webcomic world. Beyond that, several of the comics written are four or five pages long, giving the sparse updates a good reason. --Funk Masta K 00:15, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> While I personally don't hold any strong like or dislike of this webcomic, and I'm sure that my opinion isn't as valid or accepted as some more established members, it seems that it has some notable points. The comic is linked by VGCats, it has been online for something like three years. It's fans seemed to believe that it was worthy of an entry, which show's that people feel strongly about the influence of the comic. The entry seemed somewhat well written and I don't actually see any reason for the entry to be deleted, though I don't see much of a reason for it to remain either. -- Moggy 05:17, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

I believe that he should be allowed to continue to contribute to other areas of the project, but he has shown vast amounts of immaturity in regards to deletion in his defense, nomination, and support of deletion of articles.

If the domain name remains expired, the terms of this entry deletion might be different. (Ex - Votes to keep to preserve the history of the comic.) Perhaps it would be best to make sure if the domain will be renewed before continuing with the discussion of deleting this entry.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It does have a proper citation. "How to Make a Sprite Comic in Eight Easy Bits" is the entire name of the webcomic. How else would you put it? And why doesn't it belong here? It's not advertising, as the author of the comic was unaware of its creation until someone pointed it out to him (or so he claims), and it's well written. A bit more professionalism would be good, but other than that, it's quite descriptive and is up to date. Besides, plenty of comics, especially webcomics, don't become famous from the get-go. It's a well written comic, one that lies under the shadow of its crude presentation (the website, which is just the comic, is pretty ugly). I'd be willing to bet that if the site were to get a complete makeover, it'd receive a lot more traffic.206.248.72.52 05:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)Ipsum</li>
