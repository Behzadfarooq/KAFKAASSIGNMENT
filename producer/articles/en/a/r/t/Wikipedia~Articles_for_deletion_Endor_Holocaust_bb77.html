<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was merged into the forest moon's article last time around and wound up being a disproportionately large section on that page. It got split back out again as a result. Nothing much has changed since then, so re-merging will probably result in re-splitting again. As for the "cruftiness" of the article, we've got something just as extensive on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate, so why not? It's not original research in that it's an article describing <i>other people's</i> original research, as referenced in the external links. Those are secondary sources. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And they are not legitimate sources according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>, therefore it is original research (OR: "it introduces an argument without citing a reputable source, which purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position"). <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 00:40, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There was question raised about this on the article's talk page a while back, here: Talk:Endor Holocaust#Original research?. Here are the references I counted back then:
<ul>
<li>The second Death Star was a sphere of machinery somewhere between 180 and 900 kilometers in diameter (depending on the sources one holds to be authoritative)... (these sources are discussed in detail in the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> article)</li>
<li>it has been established in Star Wars comics and novels that some Ewoks had been removed from Endor in the past for use as pets or slaves... (Source needs to be made explicit, but this at least suggests that one exists)</li>
<li>Some Expanded Universe sources maintain that Endor was not significantly affected by the destruction of the Death Star and life continues there as normal. One other suggested it was destroyed, but the author had taken pains to paint it as Imperial propaganda... (These sources also need to be made explicit)</li>
<li>In one of the Star Wars Tales comics, an Imperial veteran of Endor makes an apparent reference to the holocaust theory... (Again, it'd be nice to get a reference for exactly which comic)</li>
<li>In the 'Jedi Academy Trilogy', by Kevin J. Anderson... (this source is very explicit)</li>
<li>"Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy" describes how the Rebels... (same here)</li>
<li>The two Ewok telefilms are set on a non-devastated Endor... (these are <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ewok_Adventure_805d.html" title="The Ewok Adventure">The Ewok Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Ewoks%7E_Battle_for_Endor_27de.html" title="Ewoks: Battle for Endor">Ewoks: Battle for Endor</a></i>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The sources I noted as needing to be made more specific don't appear to have been filled in yet, but that's an argument for <i>improving</i> the article rather than <i>deleting</i> it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Almost all of those sources do not refer to the Endor Holocaust at all; the inclusion of facts related to the speculation is irrelevant to a discussion of the speculation itself. Of the sources listed:</dd>
<dd>1. The information about the size of the Death Star is not in contention, the OR discussion of how those facts are interpreted is; the unverified weasel phrases like "are speculated" need to be verified, and no sources do that.</dd>
<dd>2. The comics and novels talk about Ewoks being removed from Endor, a fact which is completely unrelated to the verifiability of the Endor Holocaust.</dd>
<dd>3. The sources alluded to flatly contradict the Endor Holocaust, and again it is not mentioned by those sources, with the exception of 4. below. More weasel phrases and unverified worded misdirection: "Pro-Holocaust debaters speculate that".</dd>
<dd>4. This is the only legitimate source that actually talks about the Endor Holocaust, and it is only mentioned in passing. Using only this source - as Wikipedia is supposed to - would produce a one-paragraph article.</dd>
<dd>5. This source again flatly contradicts the possibility of the Holocaust but *does not mention it*. Again, facts are being used as Original Research - the facts are not in contention, what they are being used for is.</dd>
<dd>6. Weasel words again: "by possible implication"? Again, no mention of an Endor Holocaust.</dd>
<dd>7. Another flat contradiction of the Holocaust, without the Holocaust being mentioned.</dd>
<dd>In summary (sorry for the long post; gosh it's fun being an Endor Holocaust denier!) the facts are verified, but their relationship to the original research that is this article is almost entirely negative. So the argument to keep it is based on all the verified evidence in the fiction that contradicts it?</dd>

<dd>I think you're misunderstanding the point of a Wikipedia article on something like this. The point is not to prove that the Holocaust "happened". The point is to <i>describe the arguments</i> that have been had about it. This distinction is demanded by the NPOV policy. All those sources that "contradict" the Holocaust are still quite relevant to the argument itself, as are the sources that only address background issues that are frequently used by people who are participating in the argument (size of Death Star, extinction of Ewoks, etc).</dd>
<dd>All these issues about references and original research had been raised on the article's talk page long ago and had been left there without argument or comment. It would have been nice if you'd tried addressing them there rather than diving straight into an AfD nomination where these sorts of extensive discussions tend to clutter the process. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:23, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I understand what it's trying to do; I'm contending that there is no demonstration that the discussion has existed anywhere but in the realms of fanboards, and that it therefore fails verifiability requirements. Bryan provided some sources for the facts in the article, but none of these demonstrate that the *discussion* has existed in a verifiable source. I'm pointing out that all the sources listed (bar one, as mentioned) don't even mention the Endor Holocaust, so they do not contribute anything to the verifiability of the topic. I've listed this as an AfD rather than aim to improve the article because my research suggests that the premise of the article is itself unverifiable. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 21:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But now we're back to those external links at the bottom, whose mere <i>existence</i> is evidence showing that the discussion is ongoing in the SW community and reasonably extensive. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=endor+holocaust" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=endor+holocaust" rel="nofollow">Googling "Endor Holocaust"</a> comes up with a great many more, including a mention on the <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/death-star9.htm" class="external text" title="http://science.howstuffworks.com/death-star9.htm" rel="nofollow">"Howstuffworks" site</a> (which is relatively "mainstream" as these things go). Again I draw analogy to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate, which is exclusively an online phenomenon like this one. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:19, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The discussion of the legitimacy of the SWTC source is the most convincing part of this argument (I'm using OR in its technical sense, as an article lacking legitimate sources; perhaps verifiability would have been a better use of the terminology?), however the description of the site as a personal hobby of the author, and one unaffiliated and unsupported by Lucasfilm, in my opinion undermines that legitimacy. In any case, Wikipedia dictates *multiple* legitimate sources to prevent overly hypothetical irrelevancies like this appearing. As esoterica, it belongs in Wookieepedia, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 21:50, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. This has been a major debate among the fan community for years, and has generated multiple technical documents and commentaries on both sides of the debate. The debate does have <i>some</i> official involvement and legitimacy, in that physicist, Dr. Curtis Saxton, who once did an in-depth article (which is in the external links in the wikipedia <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor_Holocaust_90d5.html" title="Endor Holocaust">Endor Holocaust</a> article) about and explaining why he supports this issue, is the author of the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> incredible cross-sections, which are official works from Lucasfilm that give technical analysis for parts of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. Gary M. Sarli, another physicist has even written an entire paper (which is also linked to on the Endor Holocaust wikipedia page) on the issue, explaining, using mathematical models, why the holocaust couldn't have happened. And the fact that <i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy</i> mentions the issue and Howstuffworks.com elaqborates on it, should be enough to show the legitimacy of the debate. This issue has proven to notable. This article is of a similar nature to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> in that the subject may be rediculous, but at the same time is notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Fan fiction and speculation. This can be handled in a condensed form in the Endor article. We don't need to mention every thing any fan has ever said about this. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 09:23, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Once again, this is not merely some random thing a fan speculated. This has been going on for years and is well-known throughout the fan community. It is not original research, it is explaining someone elses original research, and gives the two sides of the debate, while giving reputable sources inthe external links. It is just as notable as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 09:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This lengthy, verbose discussion of a relatively insignificant topic does not need its own article. We can take the bits that aren't speculation or original research and put it in Endor in about a single paragrah. The rest is just fanwanking.

<li>I think you might be missing the point. This is not just speculation, it's speculation about something which isn't even in the real world, having its roots in fanfic. It is unencyclopaedic, and its significance outside of a small subset of Star Wars fans is precisely zero.

<li>I'm VERY aware of that.

<li>Well, technically, direct consequences of the movie are things like George Lucas's immense wealth. I think what you're saying is that if you imagine what goes on after the movie's over, this is one thing a lot of people might imagine. Is that really sufficient justification for a keep? I can imagine a lot of things that might be further fictional consequences of fictional events, but I don't see why an encyclopedia should document them all. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 04:54, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not about 'winning' and 'losing', it's about what's appropriate for Wikipedia. The last AfD listed this as 'no consensus', which means just that: there was no consensus about whether the article should be kept or not, and that in cases of no consensus Wikipedia errs on the side of keeping things, as it should. It appears that there still isn't consensus (unfortunately), but that's a good reason to keep debating it, not stop. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 22:16, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
