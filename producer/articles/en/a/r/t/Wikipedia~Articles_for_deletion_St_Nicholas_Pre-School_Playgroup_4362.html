Unfortunately we seem to have been suffering a bit of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functionality_creep.html" title="Functionality creep">functionality creep</a> as a result of which articles get nominated because the nominator has never heard of the subject…seems to me that an encyclopedia should contain many, many articles on subjects any individual reader has never encountered.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is someone trying to make a point here? If non-notability is a criterion for speedy deletion in the case of people, then non-notability in the case of (very small) groups of people should be a criterion for deletion.

<li>If this was an obscure quantum physics term or ethnic music group, maybe we could talk about systemic bias against certain subjects. But this is a pre-school playgroup, and childcare is hardly an obscure topic. There is a difference between a subject which most people don't know about, like quantum physics and ethnic music genres, and a subject which most people don't <i>want to</i> know about, like playgroups in a certain area. This falls into the latter category, being of no interest to anyone except parents in the playgroup's area (which places it even more firmly in the ad category). --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:25, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but that argument's just not true. Plenty of vanity articles deleted on AfD are 'verifiable'. A small website, or a forum/Usenet posting, or even an article in the local paper can all 'verify' the existence of a non-notable person - all those apply to me just for starters. But we delete them anyway because we do, in fact, consider articles which are devoid of interest to anyone but the people concerned unfit for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Don't be too harsh on yourself. Judging by some of the responses, there are actually people in favour of giving any group of snotlings automatic notability. So I guess there'll be some genuine playgroup articles on AfD pretty soon. Hell, if yours is to be deleted under WP:POINT instead of WP:NOT, then someone could just recreate it saying it was of genuine interest. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
