<li><b>Keep</b> — but I have to agree that this list shoudn't be a directory, it should be a list of important people to the religion who have been very public supporters. Some of these people's articles don't mention it at all. For instance, I only know <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Nesmith_Graham_1b04.html" title="Bette Nesmith Graham">Bette Nesmith Graham</a> is a Christian Scientist because another biography of her mentions it and her setting up of multiple foundations, so I assume she's set up some for the church. A random article I checked, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Paulson_6ac7.html" title="Hank Paulson">Hank Paulson</a>, mentions he's devout but nothing else. I think that for this list to be useful it shouldn't just list anyone in Wikipedia who's a member of the church, as that's more what categories are for. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder"><big>☎</big></a> 16:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Simply tracking which biographies in Wikipedia identify their subject as Christian Scientists should be done with categories. The only purpose I can see served by lists like these to spur pride in a religion (or ethnicity or other group) by celebrating the collective achievements of its adherents, and I do not see how that can possibly concord with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:12, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<p>Also "<i>Important people to the religion who have been very public supporters</i> belong in the article on Christian Science." is an argument to merge.

<li>I'd just like to reiterate though that that was not my intent when I created this. I am not Christian Scientist.

<dd>Wow I did better then I thought at explaining/fixing. And yes I agree on the title problems mentioned below. Although awkward I think "List of Christian Science adherents" would be acceptable, to me in least. As long as we make sure both "Christian" and "Science" are capitalized. The sites I've seen of Christians in science tend to emphasize the importance of that for differentiation and maybe that could be in the article itself.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, the title needs a bit of thought. As I suspected, the official name of the church is <a href="http://www.tfccs.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=1LBRPMPH1FLBVKGL4L2SFEQ" class="external text" title="http://www.tfccs.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=1LBRPMPH1FLBVKGL4L2SFEQ" rel="nofollow">Church of Christ, Scientist</a> with a comma. I've been clicking around their website for about five minutes now, with no luck, trying to find out what phrase Christian Scientists use to refer to themselves. I actually believe the site may be sidestepping this; it usually just says "members," members of what being of course understood. Anyway: IMHO</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>List of Church of Christ Scientists</i> doesn't work because without a comma it's <i>not</i> the name of the church. In fact, there's a serious ambiguity, because a Church of Christ scientist (with a small s) could mean a physicist who is a member of a local <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_acd4.html" title="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</a> congregation.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Church of Christ, Scientists</i> doesn't work either.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Christian Scientists</i> would work if not for the ambiguity problem. One could argue that there <i>isn't</i> an ambiguity problem because a "Christian Scientist" with a capital S means an adherent to Mary Baker Eddy's denomination whereas as "Christian scientist" with a small s means a scientist who is a Christian, but... that argument would be silly.</dd>
<dd><i>List of Christian Science adherents</i> is OK but awkward.</dd>
<dd><i>List of adherents to the Church of Christ, Scientist</i> ditto.
<dl>
<dd>As they use the word "members" would that work? I mean it's still a bit awkward sounding, but possibly better then this title. "List of Church of Christ Scientists" having the comma deal wrong and I suppose is possibly begging a question. (Like "List of Church of Christ Scientists...what? People, churches, organizations, other?)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:08, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>List of Church of Christ, Scientist members</i></dd>
<dd><i>List of members of Church of Christ, Scientist</i></dd>
<dd>I think the second is OK, not great... sounds too much like it's trying to be a list of <i>all</i> of them...</dd>
