It's supported (in its few relatively unbiased assertions, at any rate) by things like <a href="http://www.zdap.com/racereports/viewtopic.php?t=1664" class="external text" title="http://www.zdap.com/racereports/viewtopic.php?t=1664" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://psychoproctology.com/friends.html" class="external text" title="http://psychoproctology.com/friends.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which imply that the using of words like "fuck" is Cheneyism, indicating that this is a style of speaking, akin to <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoonerism.html" title="Spoonerism">Spoonerism</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">Malapropism</a> (albeit nowhere near as idiosyncratic as them, given that it is just simple, common, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a>). There appear to be two things here. They are distinct from each other, albeit that one is little different from the concept of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> we have covered. So it comes down to whether Cheneyism the political philosophy is distinct enough from <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushism.html" title="Bushism">Bushism</a> to warrant being separately discussed in its own right. (A few people, such as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/krauthammer/article/0,9565,785573,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/krauthammer/article/0,9565,785573,00.html" rel="nofollow">writers for Time</a>, appear to have combined the two into a political philosophy that they refer to as "Bush-Cheneyism".) If it isn't, this should be just a disambiguation between <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushism.html" title="Bushism">Bushism</a>.

<p>Since when is the age of an article any indication that it should be kept or not? The <i>subject</i> is what matters, and if the <i>subject</i> is not notable, adding more cruft is not going to make it more so.

<li>I disagree. I found this article started by a fan and edited it to clean it up, clarify elements, and proceed with a proper entry. Like the entries surrounding such members of filk fandom as <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Fish_877a.html" title="Leslie Fish">Leslie Fish</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heather_Alexander_6214.html" title="Heather Alexander">Heather Alexander</a>, 2 is an actual producer of original material. In other words, he's not just some schmuck getting a vanity piece on Wikipedia; he's actually created original art, writing, and has made a living within fandom. As long as he is more than just a fanboy geek, he -and all others who work as semi- or full-fledged-pros- should be considered for an entry.</li>
<li>Also, he didn't start the article and hence this is not a vanity piece. -- <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylvan012_8440.html" title="User:Sylvan012">Sylvan012</a> 04:06, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Who defines "a notable person"?

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Not notable" is a matter of opinion, and a poor justification for the deletion of a page. As a musician, a stand-up comedian who regularly performs, and with his weekly radio program having an audience of thousands, I think he's definately notable enough to stay around. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 04:32, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Also, note: A page about this comedian has already been put up for VfD twice, under a different name; it survived the first vote, however, it was re-nominated and deleted within a month by <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">User:WhisperToMe</a> because he felt 'it did not get enough attention from the community.'

<li>Some history, FWIW:
<ul>
<li>AFAIK the vanity or fancruft text i lk above was the first on the subject on WP.</li>
<li>I recently cleaned it with a harsh detergent &amp; moved it from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North.html" title="North">North</a> to North (band) (subject of this VfD). (And created <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="North (disambiguation)">North (disambiguation)</a>, w/ a lk to it.)</li>
<li>3 days later, someone created North band (note lack of paren) with the same or similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=North_%28band%29&amp;oldid=14349199" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=North_%28band%29&amp;oldid=14349199" rel="nofollow">text</a> (now in the merged history).</li>
<li>I turned North band into a redir as part of the merging it into North (band)'s history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The nearly 2-year-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Poland&amp;diff=1661386&amp;oldid=1298038" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_of_Poland&amp;diff=1661386&amp;oldid=1298038" rel="nofollow">lk</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North.html" title="North">North</a> and later North (band), from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Poland_e8cf.html#Black_Metal_Scene" title="Music of Poland">Music of Poland#Black Metal Scene</a> may be a clue, or an indication of hard-to-verify notability, or irrelevant -- i created North (band) without knowing that i was satisfying a red-lk by doing so.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - and merge <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neolibertarian.html" title="Neolibertarian">Neolibertarian</a> with it. The term "neolibertarian" has two meanings, depending on who is using it. The so called <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleolibertarianism.html" title="Paleolibertarianism">paleolibertarians</a> use it to mean libertarians, who aren't followers of <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_N._Rothbard_7dca.html" title="Murray N. Rothbard">Murray N. Rothbard</a>. The so called <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgism.html" title="Georgism">geolibertarians</a> use it to mean libertarians, who aren't followers of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_George_18f3.html" title="Henry George">Henry George</a>. It is, as said, a pejorative term, and that should be explained in the article, in both uses of the word. I have never met anybody, who calls him/herself a "neolibertarian". As I havent met anybody who calls him/herself a "neoliberal", either, but yet there is a long article about <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoliberalism.html" title="Neoliberalism">Neoliberalism</a>. That, too, is a pejorative term, constructed by socialists to lump together things they opposed, no matter if those things didn't have anything else in common than the fact, that they were opposed by socialists. 213.243.154.41 13:07, 31 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't realize there was a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neolibertarian.html" title="Neolibertarian">neolibertarian</a> article. The two articles, as anon notes, are using completely different senses of the word, and the one used in <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neolibertarian.html" title="Neolibertarian">neolibertarian</a> is much more common in my experience. Incidentally, I don't think it's true that "neolibertarian" is never self-applied: check out <a href="http://www.neolibertarian.net" class="external free" title="http://www.neolibertarian.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.neolibertarian.net</a> . - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:58, 31 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, at least the group which self-applies the term is much smaller than the group of which it is applied by others. An article about "neolibertarianism" should however explain both uses of the word. anon 16:54, 31 May 2005(UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Under Syrian protection is a very POV title, but so is Syrian occupation of Lebanon. The move to "Syrian presence in Lebanon" was done by a Lebanese editor and there are many reasons for why this title is more neutral. The main reason is that no international organization ever called it an occupation, and that many Lebanese Shi'a (which make up 30% of the Lebanese population) are actually very much Pro-Syrian and never termed it an occupation either. <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:11, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This article is part of the Hellenic Genocide page and also ties in with pages on the Armenian and Assyrian Genocides. It presents internationaly recognised facts and figures concerning the holocaust perpetuated by the Turks in Asia-Minor and elsewhere.

The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>This article went through several versions during the discussion period. Despite the revisions, the general concensus remained a decision to delete the content as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. To be honest, the current version strikes me as more dictionary-definition than original research but dictionary definitions are also listed in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. I believe that the current version remains a "delete" decision but without prejudice if someone wants to contribute the current content to Wiktionary.

<p><b>Solution?</b> Actually, there's some valid criticism here. I've had my friends suggest its well written, but I keep thinking that maybe it'd belong more in a different wiki. If I just strip out or minimalize the religious content, would that resolve the conflict (Leave up the pop-culture &amp; insult portions and/or migrate it to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> as defining the phrase?). Would it also be allowable if I just deleted it myself? I really don't want to end up banned or with talk pages that argue I should be: there's plenty of other stuff I write that isn't so "blaise." <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwolfsheep_0066.html" title="User:Cwolfsheep">Cwolfsheep</a> 18:31, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The problem really isn't with the discussion of religious content (see <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_humanism.html" title="Secular humanism">secular humanism</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a>, <i>et al.</i>). It is that this article is original research, and therefore doesn't really belong in the Wikipedia. Not sure about other wikis (this is the only one I work on, so my knowledge is limited). I don't think anyone is even remotely suggesting that you be banned (and if they do, they ought to be pointed to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>). Even though this article isn't encyclopedic, you are a helpful and welcome editor (good work especially on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_voting.html" title="Early voting">early voting</a>) and I hope you stay and continue to improve our encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 19:30, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you try to migrate to Wiktionary, you'll still have to convince people that the phrase "childlike mentality" isn't your own invention. As for putting the material in other articles: there's nothing to prevent you from doing that, but you'll have to deal with other contributors to those articles, who might think your contributions are POV or out of place. As long as deal with such disputes in an orderly manner that's respectful of the concerns of other contributors, there's no reason to fear getting banned. In any case, that's all beyond the scope of a VfD debate. ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 19:38, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nobody has suggested a ban: but I did not know if getting a article pulled would raise any flags or not; its kinda embarassing, but I half suspected this was a shaky article based on subject matter. If you check the "uses," the term is definately not my invention. The only thing that was "invented" was the religious context: I was describing a set of behaviors that I could not directly assign to any other term, and was hoping someone had heard of one. The religious material should go there (probably under a fundamentalist article); the rest of the stuff can stay put, but at that point is more gramattical &amp; would probably belong in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwolfsheep_0066.html" title="User:Cwolfsheep">Cwolfsheep</a> 20:44, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your categorization of what you (and I have no doubt others of like mindset, including your aforementioned friends) call the "religious content" is worded in a strongly judgmental tone (read "POV"), and I don't see how that tone can possibly be extracted from the article without extracting all the content. In other words, it sounds like an opinion piece, an expression of an opinion which you're certainly entitled to hold, but which has no place in wikipedia. Maybe you could start Wikipolitics.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:09, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm not hearing anyone offer any solutions besides just deleting it. There seems to be a tie between "something can be done with it, just not here" &amp; "delete the humanist rant". Bias is for delete. I'm not going to waste 4 more days on getting skewered: I know people get banned for pulling stunts, and I don't want to come across as having done so. If this was a stunt, I assure you I wouldn't have attempted to document it online or without linking to related topics. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwolfsheep_0066.html" title="User:Cwolfsheep">Cwolfsheep</a> 21:33, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think anyone's really jumped on you. It may be unpleasant to have an article you clearly spent some time compiling almost immediately get slapped with a VfD sticker, but I don't think anyone's really railing against you for it, I just think the consensus is that its material is unencyclopedic and/or inappropriate for wikipedia...and I certainly don't think anyone has even <i>thought</i> "ban". Some of my comments may have sounded like skewering, and for that I apologize--I sometimes don't word things very diplomatically. &#160;:-p I don't think it's a humanist rant, I think it's an antireligious rant. Like I said tho, you're entitled to your opinions, they're just not appropriate for WP article-space.

<li>Even if this is true--it really depends on what you consider "killing"--the Soviets never engaged in genocide, the systematic killing of an ethnic group, unless the Ukraine famine is considered intentional, which is certainly not a universally accepted viewpoint, as the article points out itself. And this fact also doesn't make this article have any single coherent point--see my comments above. There are plenty of <i>good</i> articles that deal with Soviet atrocities, and this isn't one.

<li><b>Abstain.</b> There was a strong fashion for Indian spiritual organisations back in the 1960s. Even though this one is no longer notable now, you can't be sure that it wasn't notable in its day. (e.g. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1911_Britannica" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1911_Britannica" rel="nofollow">Category:1911 Britannica</a> for lots of people who get articles in Wikipedia because they were notable in 1911 even if they aren't notable any more.) OTOH I don't know enough about 1960s Indian gurus to know if this organisation ever was truly notable, so I'm not going to vote either way. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 19:12, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a problem with so many Sai Baba's that is likely to confuse the readers.
