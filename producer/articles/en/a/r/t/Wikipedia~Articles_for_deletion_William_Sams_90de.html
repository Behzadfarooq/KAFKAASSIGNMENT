<li><b>Keep</b> From the point of Oz history Port Philip Association is important.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b> and allow to expand. I agree that notability needs to be established, but it needs to be given a chance.

<li><b>Keep</b> have added to page . Keep as he was founding member of Melborne Cricket Club. Investor to Port Phillip Association. Held judicial post in Hobart and Launceston. Page to Duke of Kent etc. Its obvious to anyone with any interest in Australian history why this page should be kept. Why two Americans under 21 should hold sway over this page is beyond me. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wouldn't presume to know what is or isn't notable in US history, or Brazilian history, or Norwegian history....

<li><b>Comment</b> Google is a long way from being a comprehensive reference source on anything, and is of almost no use at all in determining the "notability" of historic subjects recorded largely in paper documents (ie anything before the 1990s) - although I know how difficult it is for most people under the age of 30 to come to grips with such a crazy notion. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentisco_93c7.html" title="User:Lentisco">Lentisco</a> 06:09, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think people are missing the point. This AfD is not challenging the MCB or the PAA, those deserve a page. However one member who helped with it doesn't deserve a page. Especially, when it just states that's all that occured.

<li>I think this is making too big a deal out of a "page", as if it's a great honour. It's not like a page in a paper encyclopedia. It's just a way of organising information. It's just a few KB. It's more convenient to find it this way and can be easily linked to from other articles mentioning him. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:04, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- a notable historical figure. The article has come a long way since I first marked it as needing clarfication for reasons of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is worth keeping for its historical purposes. It may be obscure but who says the event has to be that well known. Keep. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 15:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the notability argument is missing an important point, which is the inclusion of valid historical information. A person does not in themselves have to have any outstanding characteristics to make them worth including, if they are relevant to something which is worth including. This provides context which is necessary to understanding the full picture of an event or time. The "notability" argument is based on the values of contemporary celebrity culture, not in depth research.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:14, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
