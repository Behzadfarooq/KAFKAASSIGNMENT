<p>I find this article to be POV and it's very premise is non-sensical to me, Anti-polygamy does not sound like a good title for a "debate" on polygamy. Furthermore, no other pages currently link to it. spatfield July 9, 2005 16:48 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Kept</b>. According to Wikipedia, this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">does not even qualify for being up for a Deletion vote.</a> If one does not know the issue, they are (as the above Wikipedia link calls most of the voters here) voting on something which, <i>"involves a topic of which {they} are ignorant"</i>. As explained in the segment below, the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article is open to both sides of the debate for true NPOV. It frees up the neutral anthropological <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article from the repeatad <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> agenda and POV. Actually, it is the vast amounts of one-sided POV anti-polygamy arguments that get added to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article frequently which do not actually inform the user about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a>, they are the edits which do not actually apply to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> page, yet would more appropriately apply in a two-sided agenda/debate <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. Instead of this profoundly hasty call for voting for deletion from a visibly hostile POV, voters should be, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia explains,</a> <i>"If you can improve the article instead, do so."</i> Voters here have not even attempted that Wikipedia-directed option based on their own biased POV. There is no fair basis for calling or voting for this page to be deleted. Doing so is only biased POV. This <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article should be left alone, and any informed Wikipedians should follow Wikipedia's guidelines to simply build upon it instead of seeking to destroy it. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 14:30, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I suggest allowing another week for the vote. Today, I placed a comment about this VfD on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> page. I don't expect many more votes, but there are likely to be a few. I don't expect a change in the result, either, but I do want to allow a fair vote. I don't want Researcher99 to feel any more oppressed than he already feels. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 17:50, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To my great frustaration, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is caught here lying yet again. What they have just said here is simply not true, and they know it. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is totally out to oppress as shown in this post they made on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19097386&amp;oldid=19092333" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19097386&amp;oldid=19092333" rel="nofollow">19:12, 18 July 2005</a> and I pointed out their extreme aggressiveness this very day in my subsequent post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19099356&amp;oldid=19097386" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19099356&amp;oldid=19097386" rel="nofollow">19:42, 18 July 2005</a>. Not only was <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> caught lying in those other posts, but they are clearly lying here too about their supposed concern for the oppression they are doing against me and their supposed desire for anything "fair." It is my hope that people will not further assist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis's</a> hostile anti-polygamy POV and agenda. The current dispute with that anti-polygamist should not be exploited to hastily delete the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. That article was offered as an NPOV solution to end the abuse and solve that other dispute. (See the other section here about that.) So deleting the article interferes with a possible resolution of that dispute. If the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article does get deleted because of such false exploitation, there will be nothing "fair" about that whatsoever. Despite their little game of suggesting an "extention" of the vote another week, and the admission of expecting no more votes to change the current vote-tally to "Kept," the revealed lie in the linked-posts also reveals how aggressive they plan to be to exploit that deletion in furthering their abuse. So, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> knows there is nothing really "fair" about deleting this article at all and that they have no desire to stop oppressing me or stop preventing all my obviously-valid edits. To say otherwise is clearly just another lie. It is my hope that the abuse will come to an end and that valid posts can once again be made to the polygamy and anti-polygamy articles in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 20:25, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> with the polygamy article. I agree with Researcher99 that this topic should be covered, but we cannot have an "anti-x" article for every "x" article. Perhaps later if the anti-polygamy section were to grow significantly it would merit its own place on Wikipedia, but for now I think that this is practically a stub. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplodicle_f7f9.html" title="User:Explodicle">Explodicle</a> 01:11, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate your input. The article is a brand-new work-in-progress. Only one day after the article was originally created, hostile anti-polygamist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> made a post on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> TALK page there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-polygamy&amp;diff=17965452&amp;oldid=17965399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-polygamy&amp;diff=17965452&amp;oldid=17965399" rel="nofollow">hinting for someone to call for it to be deleted.</a> This call for deletion was way too quickly and suspiciously made. Regarding size of the article, it could very easily and quickly be filled up to a large article. If anti-polygamists would spend their time <i>building up</i> the anti-article instead of craftily trying to hide their agenda by trying to destroy it, they could quickly help it reach that size. Pro-polygamy responses would then further add to its size. (Plus, the current <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article so already too large. When you try to edit that whole <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, the red-font warning tells you it is alrady too large. So, the time really is now to make that separation to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 02:32, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> himself called for the extension on the vote - do you think further extension would be a fair compromise? I would change my vote to "keep" if this were a bit more in-depth and fit in better alongside the main article, and from what you say, all that needs is time and effort. In the meantime, I don't think we have consensus to resolve the issue. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplodicle_f7f9.html" title="User:Explodicle">Explodicle</a> 04:18, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I very much appreciate your input, <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplodicle_f7f9.html" title="User:Explodicle">Explodicle</a>. Actually, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is not being honest about that. It is one of their tactics, much like a politician smelling possible victory (such as with likeminded anti-polygamists voting their way), trying to come out in front of the final result and pretending to be gracious, when they certainly do not mean it. A couple months ago, I had had to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Polygamy/Archive_2#Sneaky_Vandals.27_Anti-Polygamy_Destruction_of_Polygamy_Wiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Polygamy/Archive_2#Sneaky_Vandals.27_Anti-Polygamy_Destruction_of_Polygamy_Wiki" rel="nofollow">"out"</a> <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> as the anti-polygamist they are. At that time, they were pretending to be "pro-polygamist" as they were committing sneaky vandalisms to actually destroy the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article. They also frequently make obfuscatory claims that are obviously untrue, as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;diff=18440736&amp;oldid=18409264" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;diff=18440736&amp;oldid=18409264" rel="nofollow">here</a> where they claimed that a clearly obvious NPOV statement is somehow POV. regarding enlargement, I would be glad to enlarge the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. But <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> aggressively removed the link to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> from the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article a day after its creation, so no one else knows it exists in order to build it further. When I tried to restore the link, the rv'ed it again. Lately, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> has been plotting daily with new ways to destroy the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, so much so and are not giving me a chance to even catch my breath. Lastly, there are some things on the currently too-large <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> atricle that could be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. But considering that <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> rv's every edit I make, no matter what, I can only expect to see my edits to build up the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article rv'ed too. As shown at the top of this page here, the very call for this "Vote for Deletion" is, itself, highly suspect. That suspect person who created this call for VfD has not posted anything in Wikipedia since last year. All of a sudden they make this call for VfD and only this call? Very suspect. So, with all that, I do not really believe that any extension is all that much of a fair compromise. This suspect call is just another abuse being heaped toward me in a not-yet-resolved problem with <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis.</a> (I was actually trying to help resolve the problem by creating the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article in thefirst place.) I would certainly be glad to enlarge the article over time, with help from others who can find the article. But that will take time. I need <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> and their hostile anti-polygamy POV to be prevented from destroying every work I do and every single edit I make. They now aggressively act as if they "own" the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article and have created numerous problems indeed. That last issue is really the heart of the problem here. I am hoping to have it resolved so normal editing can resume. I also hope my response here has been helpful for you. Thanks again. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 01:17, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anti-polygamy_f98c.html" title="Edit section: For NPOV, the difference between neutral term vs. non-neutral POV agenda/debate MUST be Separated">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">For NPOV, the difference between neutral term vs. non-neutral POV agenda/debate MUST be Separated</span></h4>
<p>When I started the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, I did so with the full invitation for anti-polygamists to add their views there as well. That was the point, actually. So, I had only started the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, but fully expected others, including anti-polygamists, to bring their views there too. If anti-polygamists thought it was too POV there, they were welcome to <i>build upon</i> the article (not delete or destroy) and to simultaneously await any pro-polygamous response too. Instead, however, anti-polygamists who are afraid of their agenda being so exposed in such an open debate of their itemized presented arguments and tactics like that have responded by trying to hide and undermine that altogether. This very "vote for deletion" page is a pure example of that, anti-polygamists trying to prevent their agenda from being so exposed because they are not confident enough that their views and exposed tactics will be able to "win" their debate. Instead, they want to hide behind the seeming "authoritativeness" of directly infesting the neutral anthropological <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article with their POV and mis-information.</p>
<p>It is, of course, fully expected that anti-polygamists would oppress a minority by wanting to prevent Wikipedia readers from learning about the tactics and debate about anti-polygamy. Like I just said, they want the "freedom" to misrepresent polygamy as if authoritative rather than have their debates exposed for what they are.</p>
<p>Again, it must be understood that <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> is a neutral term but anti-polygamists continue to infest the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> article with their POV. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> has repeatedly been outed as a hostile anti-polygamist on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> TALK pages. (Anti-polygamists have further tried to hide those "outings" by "archiving" all the evidence about the "outings." As well, an ANON editor deliberately tried to hide the evidence I had recently presented about what anti-polygamists did to my original version of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=18468386&amp;oldid=18442033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=18468386&amp;oldid=18442033" rel="nofollow">removing the specific segment of evidence from the TALK altogether!</a>]) Therefore the outed anti-polygamist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is here attempting to appeal to a hostile anti-polygamy POV majority in order to prevent the real issues from being exposed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">Anti-polygamy</a> is obviously a non-neutral agenda. To obtain true NPOV in Wikipedia, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> should not be infested with the obvious POV of anti-polygamists as has been happening.</p>
<p>Instead, for true NPOV throughout the issue, anti-polygamists can have a place at the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article to itemize their agenda points and views by putting them in the more appropriate <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. Then pro-polygamists can also list their refutations of those items. That way, both articles are truly NPOV.</p>
<p>In that way, the neutral anthropoligical <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article can teach Wikipedia readers what polygamy <i>really</i> is about without the distraction of the agenda of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> POV. If the Wikipedia readers want to also see the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> view and debate, then they can go to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article and get that information too. (When I created the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, I created an immediate explanation and link to it on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article.) Wikipredia readers should not be distracted with the agenda of the anti-polygamy POV and propaganda, unless they seek it directly.</p>
<p>What I have created with all this also allows true NPOV on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article too. As already explained, anti-polygamists can place their reasons for their agenda and pro-polygamists can respond. Balance, NPOV. In the same way, pro-polygamists can point out the tactics of anti-polygamists and anti-polygamists can respond. True NPOV.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> is the neutral anthropological term. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">Anti-polygamy</a> is the non-neutral agenda and debate. True NPOV accross the board.</p>
<p>In addition to the NPOV issue, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article itself is already too long. Whenever one makes an edit to the full <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, they get the red-font "too long" message. The reason that the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article is too long is because it is too infested with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> agenda. So, by moving the agenda and debate to its own <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, the length can be kept within Guidelines.</p>
<p>Lastly, the POV of those wanting to delete or prevent this solution is easily observable as hostile anti-polygamy POV itself. To refuse to allow the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, as the needed solution to the anti-polygamists destroying the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, is the same thing as a KKK majority refusing fairness and NPOV to African Americans on a Wikipedia article about African Americans. It is the same thing as contining to allow KKK editors to imply all the worst ideas against African Americans as if authoritative rather than allow their POV agenda and debate be openly exposed for review of all Wikipedia readers.</p>
<p>So, for true NPOV, article-length, and true fairness to an oppressed minority, a legitimate encyclopedia <b>must</b> separate the neutral anthropological term of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> from the non-neutral agenda and debate of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a>. Anything less than that is bigoted POV and has no place in a legitimate Wikipedia.</p>
