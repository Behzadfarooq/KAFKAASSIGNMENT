<li><b>DELETE</b> - How is this relevant? This is a page about a particular family in India. I don't think it is of any interest for 99.99% of wikipedia users.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - Just because it doesnt interest you, doesnt mean that it wont interest others. Wikipedia's aim was to create a site that provides information that will unite people all across the world. Paliam is not only a family but it is a famous tharavaadu, just like Earls and Barons in England. 220.238.193.217 20:23, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - Actually, it's pretty relevant. The Paliam family features prominently in Kerala history. This article has been linked to "List of Nair Tharavadus"; another Wikipedia article, which aims to provide information about different Nair tharavaadus.. A tharavadu is similar to a "house" in European countries and the Paliath Achan would be similar to a Baron or a Earl. I fail to see where you got your statistic about this being "uninteresting" for 99.99% of Wikipedia users. Wikipedia tries to provide information about many different things to different people and I don't see how this article is an exception; and I don't say it just because I happen to be from that family - I feel that it is an important part of Kerala history and that it is something that other people would like to know about. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivin_8731.html" title="User:Vivin">Vivin Paliath (&lt;span style="color:green" lang="ml"&gt;വിവിന് പാലിയത്&lt;/span&gt;)</a> 15:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Is this a serious AfD&#160;? The nominator has nothing but a vandalism warning in his talk page. One of the first two voters is an IP; the other guy was making it first edit.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are plenty of pages on Wikipedia that deal with family and clan names (see <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jat.html" title="Jat">Jat</a> for example) and there is no reason not to have them here. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 16:51, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Why keep?</b> Where Vivin talks about keeping this article because it is an important part of Kerala History, there are many more important events, people, instances that are of far greater importance and probably include more people than just of one family in Kerala's history. Please provide better arguments to keep this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the designer of the article titled "List of Nair Tharavadus", my main aim was in accordance with the motive of wikipedia....to build a closer global community through greater knowledge. This is not a vanity page. This is not irrelevant material. Just because you may find it uninteresting doesnt mean that everyone else would. Many would find Quantum Physics boring, but does that mean that it should be deleted as well? Do we want wikipedia being a website with articles being present based on popularity? Many of the most unpopular things in life are the most important, and information and knowledge about the Paliam tharavadu (clan) can enhance our perception of Kerala history. Kshatriya Knight</li>

<dd>We have articles on family like the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">Medicis</a>, but primarily because the family created a bunch of individuals who were notable in their own right. This article claims notability for a family but doesn't list a single notable member of the family? None of the two links you offered even contains the word Paliam, so if they possibly establish notability for one or more <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paliath_Achan_f319.html" title="Paliath Achan">Paliath Achans</a>, the connection to the Paliam family has to be taken on faith. I don't doubt your claims, but the article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by quite a long shot.

<dd>Please check for the word 'Paliath' in those links. I can certainly add a section on the freedomfighter- Paliath Achan but it may take a few days to get hold of the books <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 06:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did and noticed the occurrences. They still don't source the connection between Paliath and Paliam. The only links I found with both Paliath and Paliam are tourist websites that don't use them in the same paragraph. The one thing I can recommend is to rename the entry Paliath Acham, use the 300-odd Google hits to write an article on them, and mention in a paragraph that they're part of the Paliam family. This seems sourceable and notability shouldn't be too hard to establish. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tintin mentioned it to me on my Talk page. I thank you for the information, but still unless it is independently verified it has no bearing on my point. Neither the Kerala not the Kochi article contain any mention of the Paliam/th. I can see that online sources might be hard to come by, so it might be worthwhile to go through online libraries to see if there are historical accounts written on the Paliam family. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess <b>Keep and Move to <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paliath_Achan_f319.html" title="Paliath Achan">Paliath Achan</a></b> is the best solution given the sources. No Paliam on Wikibooks either. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:44, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The family is certainly notable, to the extend that the hereditary PM of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Cochin_f615.html" title="Kingdom of Cochin">Kingdom of Cochin</a> was known as "<i>the</i> Palaith Achchan." Besides, even by themselves, the <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nair.html" title="Nair">Nair</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravadu.html" title="Theravadu">Theravadus</a> are atleast as notable as any of the pages in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Category%7ESurnames_29e2.html" title="Category:Surnames">Category:Surnames</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/j/Category%7ERajput_clans_ae07.html" title="Category:Rajput clans">Category:Rajput clans</a>. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 01:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> and <b>Move</b> to Paliath Achans per trialsanderrors, since this is their claim to notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a geneology database. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 17:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep at the present title</b> but <b>rewrite</b> and <b>cleanup.</b> There seem to be several precedents in - see e.g. <a href="../../../b/%C3%A1/t/B%C3%A1thory.html" title="Báthory">Báthory</a> and <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/l/D%C3%A1l_gCais_8632.html" title="Dál gCais">Dál gCais</a> (the latter of which, incidentally, is hardly better sourced than this one although its style is better). -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 23:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>My guess is that the first one would be made into a dab page for all Báthorys and the second one wouldn't survive AfD if someone paid attention to it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
