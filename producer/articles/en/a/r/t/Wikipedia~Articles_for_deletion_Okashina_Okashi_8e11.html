<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. After discounting newer editors (100 edits or less), I see four commenters for keep versus eleven for deletion. The established Wikipedians who argued for the inclusion of this article said relatively little in so doing -- this may yet other case where outside vote solicitation was ultimately self-defeating, as the dialogue was muddied by editors unfamiliar with Wikipedia.

<li><b>Update 2:</b> a reference has been added for the Strange English Project. As for Hess's own information, that can be found in the Hess article also on Wiki which has the Hess main page. This means what the project is and how many kids it influenced can both be verified using the links and references provided in the article and are therefore not original research. Because of this, I think the comic passes the notability requirement due to its influence on the English education of several thousands of students.

No convention listings, no evidence of any noteworthy traffic, no awards, nothing.

<ul>
<li>The Strange English project was not a commission. It was an idea I came up with at Hess and implemented at my local branch. When the main office learned of it, they thought it was a great concept and spread it internationally via their curriculum publications (which, in addition to being "in house" are also sold globally), putting OO comics into classrooms around Asia. I'm aware of PA's school activities (as well as the one time use of <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Comics_f693.html" title="Dinosaur Comics">Dinosaur Comics</a> in a Japanese classroom), however, this is on a much larger scale, which is why I argue it qualifies as notable. It's a case of a webcomic being officially adopted by an educational organization for the purpose of instructing students of various levels. As far as I know, this is the first instance of a webcomic being endorsed in such a way and on an multinational scale. At the very least, it is an important event, since Hess has over 60,000 students (according to them), all of whom are affected by the curriculum created by the main office. Sorry if this wasn't clear in the article. And you don't have to take my word for it: check Hess's website and Taiwan business listings to see how large they are; Hess is not a small company. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was very much <i>not</i> referring or comparing to PA's school activities (which aren't even mentioned in their article). I am referring to projects like their involvement with the <a href="../../../e/s/r/ESRB_999d.html" title="ESRB">ESRB</a>, and the multitude of mini-comics they've done for a number of different companies, one of which by itself (which, I feel, is comparable to OO's volunteer work) would not even come close to giving PA their own article. That you posted a call to action on the front page does nothing to help me believe it deserves an article on its own merits. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 10:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding is that it's quite normal to do a "call to action" when a comic's respective Wiki page is up for AfD (many non-comic pages have had similar "rallies"). It helps notify people who may not otherwise be paying attention that something is happening, since not everyone is on Wiki as frequently as others. I think your comparison of OO's work and PA's work with the ESRB and others is a bit off. To me, an educational institution is significantly different from marketing (which is the general category the ESRB example falls under). I won't go into it too much here to avoid clutter, but one way they're different: marketing is very short term in its scope and effect, while a school curriculum has a much more lasting impact on those who experience it. That's why I compared OO's Hess involvement with Tycho and Gabe's visits to schools, since it's at least in the same field. Wiki has many articles on types of curriculums and education developments, because they are notable due to their impact. I think it's arguable that the number of notable marketing campaigns is far fewer in number (at least, those notable in the sense of having a lasting impact on society beyond simply inserting a phrase into the public awareness for a time). So, for me, having had OO contribute to the curriculum development of a school that teaches thousands is a more significant achievement than if OO had, for example, drawn some art for an organization to use for ads. You seem to disagree on this point, which is fine. But I hope you understand my reasoning on this matter. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A note on convention listings: according to Emi-chan, she's been invited to host a couple webcomics panels at <a href="../../../u/s/h/Ushicon.html" title="Ushicon">Ushicon</a> in the past. Unfortunately, the main Ushicon site seems to be a bare bones since they closed the con down in 2006. However, I found an independent verification of one of her appearances in 2003 via an anime fansite: <a href="http://www.fansview.com/2003/ushicon/013103b.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fansview.com/2003/ushicon/013103b.htm" rel="nofollow">Ushicon 2003 Panel</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Saying it's not notable enough for wikipedia is ridiculous. Information is what wikipedia is for, whether it's that notable or not shouldn't be a factor. It's not your place to judge what is notable or not. Neopets R God 03:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It isn't uncommon for "notable" achievements to go under the radar at times, so it's perhaps a bit short-sighted to limit it to what is on searchable venues. The vanity is an addressable issue. I haven't read the comic, but the issues brought up can be taken care of without deletion.Yansen 07:19, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, though it would probably be wise to address the vanity issues. I would first point out that by some people's definitions, no web comic is very notable in some sense ( with this coming down to how many internet users are even aware of web comics, to which I don't really know ). Granted I really don't have a good idea of which web comics are "notable" ( in the sense of web comics, assuming that some fair number are to be judged notable despite my first remark ), though apparently a large number are given a glance at the WP's webcomics project page. So while it is of concern that a lot of the editing was done by one of the web comic's authors, this can be remedied ( and in the meantime a marker could be added ). My keep rating is weak both due to the fact that I really don't know what "notable" for a web comic would be, and because I admittedly read the comic ( I'll let you all pick which reason's more important...&#160;:) ) DAG 10:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I am apalled by the double standards applied here. How does basic, unbiased information suddenly become advertisement just because the authors entered it and not a casual observer, who might not have nearly as much to say on the subject? By such standards, any encyclopedic work which contains more than a passing mention on a subject is advertisement. It's also a comic with a large following, so you can't say it's not in any way notable. Even if I hadn't been a fan, I would raise these objections in the interest of fairness.

<li><b>Keep</b> I find it interesting that newer forms of media, electronically produced and published for mass distribution are considered unencyclopedic while obscure punk bands from the 80's that I listened to in high school, that never had a following more than a few thousand are considered 'worthy' of being wiki'd. This isn't some kid's vanity page, it's a serious long running comic strip. If this is deleted then the slope becomes slippery, who decides if 'Dominic Deegan' or even Sluggy Freelance is worthy of wiki? for the record- I was pointed to this page, I am an avid reader of web-comics, I *don't* read or keep up with this comic, and I am an active wikipedian. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan888_e9d9.html" title="User:Jonathan888">Jonathan888</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathan888_ae66.html" title="User talk:Jonathan888">(talk)</a> 16:07, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Assuming by "primary source" you mean the comic itself, the article has at least two reputable third party sources: the Hess activity book, which I have given publishing details for, and the site that shows Emi-chan was invited to host a webcomics panel at a major convention. So the third-party requirement is fulfilled to the extent possible (I would not expect any webcomic to have as many third party sources as, for example, a historical or current events article).

<li>By "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," we mean things like articles in mainstream newspapers, magazines or academic journals, not webcomics fan blogs and the like. Our standards for sourcing and accuracy in an encyclopedia article need to be as least as high as that of a junior high school research paper. If this topic is not covered by multiple, non-trivial, reliable, reputable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, then we should delete this article, because we are not working on building an encyclopedia full of unreliable, error-riddled trivia. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmmm... okay. If I'm reading what you and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> are saying correctly, there may be a slight problem. I don't think it's possible to write a useful article on even as widely-known a webcomic as Megatokyo whilst meeting these requirements, though I could be proved wrong. (The current Megatoyko article definitely appears to have verifiability and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problems, but at least some are down to carelessness). Of course, it's possible to get some of the information from "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy", but I'm not convinced you'd get a significant amount of information that way. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 00:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think I understand what you mean, Dragonfiend. From the guidelines: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers." Since this is a webcomic, summaries of the comic itself are allowed to use the comic as a "reliable source." So I think we can all agree the character and plot summaries that make the bulk of the article all satisfy verifiability since it is possible to read the comic and confirm what's stated (i.e. the summaries refer to a published primary source). The claim about the forum size is also verifiable simply by going to said forum. The Strange English Project already cites a reference published by a "reputable publisher" (i.e. Hess, whose credentials are quite good in the field of educational publications). And the comments made concerning OO's staff changes are based on statements made by the creative team themselves; publicly viewable direct quotes satisfy the verifiability requirement, especially since I used the ones that were archived (this is as opposed to direct quotes that are not publicly viewable, such as through email, or those that are not archived, like forum threads which can be deleted at any time, which are not verifiable). For example, if John Kerry published an opinion on his blog, said opinion could be added to his Wiki article since it's a publicly viewable direct quote from him that can therefore be referenced in the future (but only in its archived form, so it doesn't disappear). The same type of citation is made here. Not every article requires the same type of references in order to be reliable and accurate; in this case, since there are only a few claims beyond plot summaries, the amount of references is few, though their quality - and associated notability - is high. So the purpose of the verifiability requirement, making sure articles aren't "error-riddled," has been satisfied, since no errors are present in the article and it is possible to prove so with the references contained therein. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, actually what we mean by "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," are things like articles in mainstream newspapers, magazines or academic journals. Things like webcomics or blogs or online forums, on the other hand, generally do not have a reputation for fact-checking, accuracy, or credibility. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:07, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case the article satisfies the requirement to the extent necessary, since it has a reference in the Hess book, which could count loosely as an "academic journal." The book underwent a process of peer review and editing, which is the important feature of a third-party source (in contrast, a non-peer reviewed academic journal would not satisfy the verifiability requirement). I don't think there are any webcomic articles that use third party sources for plot and character summaries (since using the primary source of the comic itself is superior to a third party source for that info). So, the verifiability requirement has been met for this particular article. When OO does other notable things, I'll be sure to watch out that editors reference "credible, third-party sources" to verify it as has been done already. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 14:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, your only claim of a credible third-party source is a single clasroom exercise that you created with your webcomics? According to your vanity article, "The Strange English Project began in July 2005. Xuanwu, then an English teacher in the Republic of China (ROC) working for Hess Educational Organization, took OO comics and blotted out the dialogue. ... The Strange English Project itself has become adopted by Hess and is now part of its recommended games and activities..." I'm not convinced that classroom games and activities found in a single book are notable, or that you creating a game about your webcomic is a very good third-party claim of notability. Also, your promise to continue your vanity edits to your vanity article don't give me much hope for this article. Let's delete this unverifiable vanity article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I recommend you re-read my earlier posts, as I make clear why a "single classroom activity" is important when said activity is then applied on an international scale. If you disagree with this, that's fine, but I think you understand why I view a book published by Taiwan's largest English education curriculum provider as a good third-party source. On another note, your RfA made it clear you're supposed to behave with civility, not engage in bad faith comments by using the word "vanity" like a slur. Please be more polite to your fellow editors.

<li>Just as a side comment: I find this whole conversation very interesting indeed. I recently completed an <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Library_and_Information_Science_31a4.html" title="Master of Library and Information Science">MLIS</a> degree, and the one thing which every last professor who even mentioned Wikipedia said was "Wikipedia does not, under any circumstances, constitute a valid source for research, but it does tend to have articles which cover subjects which would not be listed in standard reference books and therefore can be useful." I find it tremendously interesting that there are Wikipedia editors who want to pursue academic respectability -- which they will probably never achieve -- at the expense of the one thing which undeniably makes the whole enterprise worthwhile from an outside standpoint. -- An anonymous <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumpers-L_f146.html" title="Stumpers-L">Wombat</a></li>

<dd>Comicgenesis is not Geocities. It's an online publisher of webcomics, not a free website host. It does have some quality control, and it is essentially the 'amateur wing' of Keenspot. "Strange Candy" (Okashina Okashi) is well-known, with links from Megatokyo at one time; it's one of the more established comics on Comicgenesis/Keenspace. If you felt OO didn't satisfy WP:WEB, then neither would almost any other Keenspace/Comicgenesis comic, as webcomics are rarely referenced or reviewed in print and therefore do not usually satisfy #1, except for those that have won awards (#2); what is your criterion for keeping the entries of any of the others? Do you feel they are also not notable enough to be included in the Wikipedia? I still say keep; I feel that deleting their already-existing entries is contentiously and arbitarily destroying valuable reference material for which Wikipedia is well known. Of course, you're the editors, it's your wiki, it doesn't aim to be complete, and you are of course free to disagree. 81.2.97.157 18:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The problem is that just because it is published by a publisher with some standards for content acceptance <b>DOES NOT MEANT THAT IT IS NOTABLE</b>. We certainly do not have an article for every scientific book put out by <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elsevier.html" title="Elsevier">Elsevier</a>, we don't have an article for every science fiction book put out by <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tor.html" title="Tor">Tor</a>, or even every history book put out by <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_House_0f9b.html" title="Random House">Random House</a>. We also do not create an article for every single dissertation made the post-graduate students at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. These are places that publish works which more-likely-than not are more notable and contain more important subjects than this web comic. Why don't we have articles for these things? Because <b>notability is not determined by the publisher</b> or the fact that something has been published. Notability is not determined by who links to the site.</dd>
<dd>If a webcomic is notable it should be listed. You mention <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> which has won national awards and has been published by a non-vanity press, and is listed as one of the top manga-style publications sold in the country by a third party record keeper. It <i>deserves</i> its own article. I hate to put this comic down, as it seems the author has worked hard on his this article, but it's just not notable and it shouldn't get a free ride Megatokyo's or Keenspace's coattails into the notability column. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I assisted a librarian in creating a set of library instruction handouts that have been used by 8,000 incoming college freshmen students at a major urban university for the past few years. It has used by several tens-of-thousands of students. My hometown newspaper has a circulation of over 70,000 and the advertisment for the locally owned <i>Super-Jiffy-Quick Tire Shop</i> that runs the same "$10.50 off the next tire rotation" coupon every week also doesn't meet notability.</dd>

Applying <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> to a webcomic is like applying <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_bulge.html" title="Battle of the bulge">battle of the bulge</a>. - <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickning1_9f12.html" title="User:Wickning1">Wickning1</a> 15:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Point 1 - This webcomic fluctuates between 3rd most popular and 15th most popular comic on <a href="http://guide.comicgenesis.com/KeenspaceNumPL_1.html" class="external text" title="http://guide.comicgenesis.com/KeenspaceNumPL_1.html" rel="nofollow">ComicGenesis Top 50</a>, ranked by pages served(Ghastly omitted) . Point 2 - Wikipedia editors tend to flag all webcomic entries as Vanity, due to the webcomic owners over-editing the pages for correctness. Point 3 - You can verify it's popularity from the third party <a href="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=okashio" class="external text" title="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=okashio" rel="nofollow">stat tracker</a>. Point 4 - You can verify it's popularity from it's own links to top webcomics (ranked 101 out of 6500, that makes in the top 1%),Point 5 - Wikipedia should no more be used as a staple of content's popularity than google. It's not the end of the world if Wikipedia does delete an entry, but by deleting everything that "isn't popular enough" to an objective value to be included creates a barrier to entry that discourages people from contributing anything in the first place. - <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisai_fcf1.html" title="User:Kisai">User:Kisai</a> 00:47, 26 June 2006 (PDT)

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) Being about the 10th most popular webcomic on a particular free webhosting site is rather trivial when you consider the tens of thousands which are not on that site. If being number 10 on this website were that big of a deal then their would be plenty of reliable sources writing about this webcomic and the creator of this webcomic probably wouldn't have to write an article about themselves. 2) This is not flagged for <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> because the webcomic's author simply corrected some errors in the article. It is flagged for vanity because the webcomic's author created the article and has edited it heavily ever since. Check out the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which clearly shows the webcomic author creating the article and making about 60 edits to it, more than all other editors combined. Check out this diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;diff=19071017&amp;oldid=10948734" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;diff=19071017&amp;oldid=10948734" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which shows the webcomics author making 14 consecutive edits to the article over the course of several months in which they add 20-some odd paragraphs of completely new content. This is the furthest possible thing from someone simply correcting mistakes in an article about themselves; this is the absolute definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> where someone creates a lengthy encyclopedia article about themselves. 3) We don't have inclusion standards for web sites based on their traffic. If an extremely low traffic site has a huge impact on culture that is verifiable through reliable sources (it's written about in the New York Times and Wired Magazine, for example) then we might write an article about it. If a high traffic site is unverifiable through reliable sources, then we can't have an article, because we're building a reliable encyclopedia. 4) Simlar to your first point, being just outside the top 100 on a site that measures a fraction of all webcomics is rather meaningless and trivial. 5) This isn't up for deletion because it "isn't popular enough." it's up for deletion because it violates a large number of guidelines and official wikipedia polices, from <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and beyond. Finally, are you the same "Kisai" that's listed as being one of the two "folks behind Comic Genesis"? <a href="http://www.comicgenesis.com/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comicgenesis.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> If so, that would be a good thing to disclose in order to minimize any conflict of interest issues inherent in telling people how notable the webcomics hosted on your site are. If not, sorry for the mix-up. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per above; Google is not the only search engine in the world, nor is it an absolute authority on notability. Plus, this article might be vanity, but it will definitely not be that way in the future after the article is given time to stabilize. This is a collaborative encyclopedia, and thus we must work on articles to bring them to an acceptable level of quality. I believe a lot of people forget that sometimes and would rather take the easy way out. —Michiel Sikma (<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">Kijken</a> maar niet <a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">aanraken</a>) 06:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
