<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>.</p>
<p>For its size, this debate is astonishingly good-humoured. Clearly, for me to write a closure that deals with each editor's comments individually is impractical, and would not be useful. Nevertheless, it seems apparent from reading this (yes, I did) that those who would delete really do have things on their side. SlimVirgin's points are easily the best argued reason for keeping, but many of those arguing to keep use, for the most part, arguments that really are just weak. Those who say "we keep sexual perversions and Pokemon" are certainly the weakest: as ever, those points belong in other debates and are not very useful in dealing with <i>this</i> article since they are referencing unrelated topics. Several other "keep" interpretations are successfully rebutted: Jayjg's and Yamaguchi's (the latter urging us to keep based on his/her personal speculations), Zer0faults's, and the key parts of DyslexicEditor's; various editors cite these also. Mackensen appears to be making an obscure point about trolls, and anyway relies on a rebutted argument. Perhaps he means that we should keep it to prove to the more trollish parts of the world that we are able to turn their work against them, but we don't need to prove that to them: we have 1,000,000 articles to show them. Stephen B Streater's is almost self-contradictory and the later editor who relies on it equally so. Dread Lord Cyberskull seems to comment solely on the nomination, rather than taking account of all the editors who went before him. (There are various phrasings of most of these.)</p>
<p>Some of the delete arguments are weak too, though, most particularly that the article is associated with "disruption". SlimVirgin makes a point to Blnguyen that we have many articles about people to which things have happened, and that is an important statement. But the various characterisations as a storm in a teacup, a minor incident, self-referentiality, news reportage are signally unrebutted by anyone; noone even seems to make an attempt to disagree with them. Even, (dare I say it) the (non-)notability of the individual isn't really contested, with no impugning of Phil Sandifer intended. The point in response to DavidGerard's comment is important. If this topic has made multiple headlines (it is unreasonable to use a continuous tense here) in a month, say, then perhaps we can reconsider. In the meantime, if Wikimedia needs to report on this at all, <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikinews:">Wikinews:</a> is just down the road. Also observe that there remains the possibility of adding part of a sentence in generic terms to some more-obviously useful article about real-life harassment of project volunteers.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose I am about to outrage approximately 41 people, but really I don't think there's a lot of value in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> at this moment, unless someone really thinks I have this totally wrong and that it needs to be fixed <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">urgently</a>. It got speedied and restored repeatedly (in a rather poor manner), has been through DRV and had probably the most comprehensive, blood-free AfD of any article ever, and trying to turn the handle again right now is unlikely to achieve anything much. I'm not trying to appoint myself as the Final Authority, but the avenues are largely exhausted until such time as something about this shifts so significantly that a large proportion of 108-ish people have their minds changed.</p>
<p>Finally, a procedural note. I didn't participate here, but have followed the debate with interest. I did, some days ago, reverse an early closure of the debate, a course of action supported on the talk page. I don't think that re-opening a debate that (evidently) had reasonable mileage left in it leaves me with a conflict of interest, particularly as I have not otherwise joined the discussion; it was more interesting to follow it as it progressed and weigh the arguments. If you got this far, thank you for reading. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> The subject is barely a published author - based on the works referenced in the wikipedia article, he has written two short articles for an obscure online-only webcomics studies website plus he is co-author of a short 4 paragraph response to someone else's article about comics. The subject has been barely written about by a marginally notable writer - Cory Doctorow writes two brief posts about the police/snuff stories/wikipedia incident on the boingboing blog, which publishes 5-8 new posts or so a day (this might have taken Doctorow perhaps 5 minutes total for both posts); the incident is a very localized and obscure example of thousands and thousands thousands of incidents that are related to issues of academic freedom or freedom of creativity. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:32, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> One mention in a local paper about cops asking a guy questions. Oh no the sky is falling! Wikipedia is not wikinews. Also, something being on DRV and AFD at the same time is beyond retarded. Kotepho 18:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the "quality" of the article isn't relevant: we can establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that Sandifer is a graduate student, that he was mentioned for this harrassment in boingboing, etc. But this doesn't meet the "average professor" test, let alone exceed it--a long-canonical example of the biographical notability requirement. We do not need to use Wikipedia to "highlight important concerns regarding academic freedom" or participate in any other crusades, no matter how worthy we think they are. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 18:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b>, very interesting story, but not encylopedic...yet anyway. I once reported to police on a story I stumbled across at a poetry site by an alleged ex-con just out of prison who gave horrible graphic details on what he was going to do to the woman who landed him in prison, including her name, her town, and the date he intended to murder her (just a few days hence from my reading). Phil's story is a bit more mild, but I can see why police might be concerned enough to check it out. On the other hand, Phil also seems to be the victim of harrassment. At any rate, fascinating as it is, it's not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 19:21, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, changing my mind, if <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> is considered notable as an anti-Wikipedia activist, then Philip Sandifer is at least as notable as the victim of these activists, particularly since this case is receiving notable attention from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cory_Doctorow_79af.html" title="Cory Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> and UK journalists. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 00:26, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, after arguing against the speedy deletion of this article (which I believed to be out of process), I now switch gears and vote to delete this article properly and within process. He's a favourite target of WR trolls and was harassed by the police because they succeeded in complaining about him. In my opinion, his biographical details and what happened to him doesn't make him notable enough to warrant an article. I'd like to note that I greatly respect Phil and think he is very notable <i>within</i> Wikipedia, but I don't think he's notable outside of it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 19:27, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I originally was gonig to vote delete but then came across about 300+ articles on google talking about the situation and subject. It creates an odd situation when we as Wikipedians need to vote how notable someone we already know is. Oddly enough perhaps while he shouldn't be notable, his presence as a Wikipedia Admin is causing it to spread quickly on the internet. I think people should step back perhaps and not view this as a fellow admin, but as a person on the net that now has over 300+ articles written about not only his comics but also now this police involvement and judge it from there. Notability sometimes derives from infamy. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 19:36, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Did you or Zer0faults actually read through your supposed 400+ google search results - even just the first couple of pages to check the names? There is more than one "Philip Sandifer" - There are multiple hits for a healthcare executive, a farmer, a transportation engineer and a "hotshot truck driver" character in a 1950s movie ("Daddy-O"), which seems to have the lion's share of hits. Furthermore, many or most of the hits for the Philip Sandifer we're actually talking about appear to be his postings to things like forums, amazon.com, or email listservs <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Further comment</b> The above comment of mine refers to the search for "Phil Sandifier" made by Jayjg and Rory96. "Philip Sandifier" turns up a better search result but there are are many hits for a Christian musician of the same name and also there are numerous hits of the forum/email kind <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: The slate was wiped clean when the article was transferred? That's good in a way, because here I will say the thing that really bothers me about the article before I offer up the Wikipedia-reason. Stalkers are out for power. They are like rapists, in that what they want is to own the person they're bothering. Having an article about the effects of the stalker's actions would be nothing but sheer joy and reward for the person who wrote the U of F president. Let's not give the arsonist the pleasure of watching the fire. As for the deletion guideline reason, it's pretty simple: charges and allegations are not notability/fame. Phil was accused of being a bad person, and that caused a tempest in a teapot. It is illustrative, and it is interesting, and the article was well written, but it doesn't rise to encyclopedic level. Were Phil kicked out of his program or arrested, then he would become a cause. Essentially, the question is whether this goes beyond the local (and web local ... meaning us) to the regional and whether it represents a new offense or a reiteration of an old one. To me, it does not rise to the level of encyclopedic yet, and we should be happy that it doesn't. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Geogre, we don't know who did this to Phil, so I'm speculating, but my guess is that they're not at all happy with this article, because what they did has backfired, in that they didn't harm Phil at all (the reverse, if anything), and it may backfire even more if this lawyer gets hold of the records. So although I agree with your arsonist reasoning in general, I don't think it applies in this case. In any event, we shouldn't create or delete articles with that kind of thing in mind. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One of the votes below is to move to namespace and preserve it in the accounts of stalking. I understand that Phil could have offended folks with some other activity, that it might not have been Wikipedia related, but it seems to me that we only know about this incident because we're Wikipedians and so is he. I.e. I doubt any of us would have encountered the story through the Florida papers. In my own day, we had a director of composition who was having sex in his office during office hours with a 19 year old student while going through a divorce and had advertised for "bi-curious females" to have a threesome and video session with, and his ex-wife leaked all this to the press. It raised a whole raft of interesting ethical and academic questions, and it ran in the newspapers (three of them) for 2 months and made a mention in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education.</i> Then he got caught double billing the U. and got fired. No one remembers this now, except those there at the time. My point is that my U. refused to act on personal actions and free expression to terminate this guy, so the U. <i>failed</i> to really create news. It was juicy, and it was racy, but the measure of it is after the events have concluded. If we preserved this in a namespace 'tales of stalking' or 'how to save yourself' file, it would be cool. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To second your point: I think WP must recognize that like a news service, an encyclopedia is an <i>observer</i> (of notable news or facts, respectively). In both cases it is imperative for the neutral observer not to create news or facts while observing, just like in science a good sensing device must not influence the phenomenon being sensed. I think, hard as it may be to resist, WP must have a <i>higher</i> threshold of notability for anything related to itself, lest it create a feedback effect and thereby create new facts by its own reporting action. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think besides from the sources, it's primarily notable as a source of the abuses of schools. For the whole argument over wikipedia admins vs. this or that, well I don't know if that's notable here (sure other websites that collect internet drama would like it), but really to me it's about school abuses and police abuse. I've read many other stories where they've done the same thing (however it's been in high school, middle school, and similar things but not about stories in elementary school like someone accidentally brings a hunting knife to school and school policy says to turn the knife in and that's what the kid did once he got off the bus, but the school suspended him and tried to get him expelled for following its own rules). Schools also basically say kids have no rights of free speech (this sentence is my opinion summary of some news articles I saw). I don't want to dig the articles up, but this story is one example. Sure, enemies will try to defame someone, but how an organization responds to it is but. I once had an ISP with a static IP and I got in an argument with people once and my IP never changed and they sent in fake abuse reports 6-12 months after, constantly and I would disconnect my cable modem and the reports came in when it was actually disconnected, and still the ISP just believed it without checking. Same is for Florida University. Oh well, I rant. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 04:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>So why does Phil get an article and your kid who brought his hunting knife to school doesn't? Why don't you, for that matter? This thing about abuses of educational institutions' legal paranoia <i>may</i> be notable (but only when a secondary source runs an article about them, if we try to write an article by collating a load of news stories about different people we're doing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> by synthesis).

<li><b>Comment/Suggestion</b> Perhaps this article should be renamed/moved to something like "Police harassment of online author Phil Sandifer."

<li>This is an encyclopedia, not brandt-watch.org (you can found that one if you like to!).
