<li><b>Keep</b> There are many other pornography related articles of much less merit that have been kept. Kate has been around for longer than most others serving as her own webmaster for the past few years, for the Playground and numerous other tgp type webpages. The fact that she recently appeared in a Playboy special just makes her more searched, and just allows for extra reason to keep the article. Albeit a person more familiar with her should come through and polish the article to a higher standard. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Nerd_cfe2.html" title="User:Das Nerd">Das Nerd</a> 00:59, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No significant fact in the article is verified (the "model" doesn't even claim the Playboy appearance mentioned in the article, as far as I can tell), and even if she manages to squeak through the notability screen, <i>her website doesn't</i>. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:03, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- She doesn't show her feet much in the pictures, and the deformed foot is a rumor based on several blurry pictures. If she does have a foot with two toes on it, she generally hides it very well -- very rarely do you see her feet at all, and if you do they're usually in shoes. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 03:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I realize our nom was just being prudent rather than prudish when making this nom, but Ms. Kate has achieved a fair amount of visibility in her chosen profession as demonstrated by an alexa in the 3,700s <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.katesplayground.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.katesplayground.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and crossover work in mainstream mags like Playboy. She is therefore a real up-and-comer who merits inclusion here. I would also indicate that the correct terminology is "<i>internet model</i>" as used in our article. <i>Camwhore</i> is far more derogatory, but perhaps more effective when trying to shock those of the prudish persuasion to slavishly hit the NN button on their keyboards. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:46, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For what it's worth, a quick check of her website indicates that her name should be spelled <b>Amylee</b> rather than <b>Amy Lee</b>, and the one-word spelling does increase her Google hit count significantly. I'm not generally convinced that porn stars <i>really</i> deserve Wikipedia articles, but there's enough interest in them out there. And given that I'm a gay man, I'm not about to pretend I could assess a het-porn actor's notability on the basis of whether <i>I've</i> heard of her or not.

I have changed the Ahmadiyya article to better indicate that the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community are the group known as Qadiani by some (in its current state, it didn't make this quite clear in the opening), and that what they practice is sometimes called Qadianism.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's not notable or encyclopedic. It's an imaginary French city created by an autistic man in France, Gilles Trehin, whose article I put up for speedy deletion. It would set a dangerous precedent to allow anyone to put their own imaginary worlds or imaginary friends on Wikipedia. It's bad enough as things stand with all the fandom.

<p>This article is about word endings. It is written very amateurishly, it contains inaccurate information, a lot of irrelevant information too, and most importantly, it doesn't have any content that isn't present already, and better explained, in other articles (<a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffix.html" title="Suffix">suffix</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflection.html" title="Inflection">inflection</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declension.html" title="Declension">declension</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitic.html" title="Clitic">clitic</a>, etc.). Besides that, "ending" is a very common, general word, unsuitable for an article title, and it's <i>not</i> a linguistics term but at most a shortcut or an elementary college grammar term. I thought about turning it into a disambiguation, but there's nothing to disambiguate to.

<li>Okay, you posted this while I was writing my questions below. I guess that's an answer to #s 1&amp;2, basically, right? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.</a> 13:38, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment/questions</b> - These questions are for Pablo or any others who have expertise/knowledge in linguistics (I have none): 1.) According to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpheme.html" title="Morpheme">Morpheme</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affix.html" title="Affix">Affix</a>, the bound inflectional "-s" clitic for the english plural is a morpheme, and thus carries semantic meaning - does that mean that this article is wrong to assert that the "-s" carries no semantic meaning, or is it debatable, or what? 2.) According to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflection.html" title="Inflection">Inflection</a>, things like "-ed" to indicate past tense are inflectional morphemes (and thus, according to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpheme.html" title="Morpheme">Morpheme</a>, carry semantic meaning) - is the article wrong to assert that inflectional changes to the end of a word carry no additional semantic meaning, or what? 3.) To what extent is the idea of an inflectional morpheme added to the end of the word (as opposed to a derivational morpheme, which appears to be classed as an affix [?]) covered by the term "desinence"? I mean, is "desinence" synonymous with "ending" as used in this article? 4.) Should "desinence" perhaps have its own article, to which "ending" or "word ending" should redirect? 5.) Should a page be created at "ending or "word ending" that simply offers wikilinks to both "desinence" and "suffix", or something like that? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.</a> 13:36, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>3.) "Desinence", "declension"/"decline" and "conjugation" are basically obsolete terms, but they at least have a more-or-less specific meaning. An affix is (put simply) something you tack onto/into a word, be it a prefix, a suffix, an infix, or a circumfix. Inflectional and derivational morphemes can be affixes of any of those kinds, or not affixes (for example, <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablaut.html" title="Ablaut">vowel changes</a>, as in <i>sing - sang - sung</i>, are inflection). If "desinence" has an article, it should redirect to "suffix". "Word ending" should maybe exist because the expression is so common, but it should also redirect to "suffix", or be a disambiguation. "Ending" should not exist; it's too common and misleads editors (too many things have "endings" of some sort). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Flores. Thanks for the answers. The "word ending" disambig page could be pretty useful - could include wikilinks to the various linguistic concepts touched on by the subject of word endings, and would be easy to create. "Ending" is indeed pretty useless even as a disambig, unless there are a bunch of pages on various types of ending (in drama, literature, music, etc.) that I'm just unaware of. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

The idea of an "ending" in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> being any kind of declension or conjugation is perfectly valid, but is not a widely accepted terminology. the more accepted terminologies (i.e. declensions, conjugations) already have pages explaining their significance. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 22:09, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b>: I can't decide between deleting content and <i><b>Redirect</b></i> to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflection.html" title="Inflection">Inflection</a>, or <i><b>Rename</b></i> Grammatical ending. It's not scientific and certainly not proper linguistics by any stretch, but it is about grammatical inflection in some languages and it's a notable (albeit simplistic) concept in second language acquisition, and a lot of students learning second language would probably use this terminology. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a></li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflection.html" title="Inflection">inflection</a>, and <b>merge</b> any useful information there. Inflection by varying endings is a significant feature of Indo-European languages, so that in popular speech, people speak of "word endings" to mean inflections. Suffixing rather than prefixing or vowel gradation or ablaut seems to be somewhat more common among most languages. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 06:21, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> This guy is surely no Elvis, but his profile fits minimal notability requirement, on that basis alone, I dont see why he should be dismissed. The RPG world is an important subculture with a lot of following. You cant get more mainstream than videogames and TV in which he also worked. I agree with Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr. that he remains a behind-the-scenes figure but there can be some interest in knowing things like who designed the cat Sagwa or that-or-that second stringer popculture character. Night Gyr said his name had 500 hits on Google (I tried too and got 511). Heavy Gear alone has 652 000 hits, that gives still a lot of people potentially interested in some of this article's infos. As seen on Dream Pod 9's site (Heavy Gear's publisher), although the state of the RPG industry, they are still releasing new miniatures based the Heavy Gear mechas, so I guess there is still an active fandom. As for the verifiabilty of his working on Carmen Sandiego, in his portfolio (<a href="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/" class="external free" title="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/</a>), we can see a version of the Carmen Sandiego and the secret of the Stolen Drums cover without any company logos, titles and such of the cover. I dont know how deep we must go into verifiabilty, but, in all good faith, it seems genuine: <a href="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/comix/pages/01cover.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/comix/pages/01cover.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/comix/pages/01cover.htm</a> Also the list of pulbications on which he worked on is quite long: <a href="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/pube.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/pube.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qosmiq.com/cdiadrone/ghis/pfolio/pube.htm</a> These have to be seen by a good number of peoples.</li>
<li><b>Some explanations</b>: I am the author of the Ghislain Barbe and relatively new to Wikipedia. Therefore, I aknowledge not being the best person to judge of its pertinence. It seems to be causing quite a debate and I do apologize for this, as this was clearly not my intent. Before writing this article, as I noted in the Discussion section of the article, I checked some guidelines and the artist seemed to meet the requirements for living people as defined in Wikipedia,&#160;: Notability (for people) in the "People still alive" section, states: Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more. I take it that artists are authors, as otherwise, no comicbook artist, and basically not commercial artist whatsoever would find its place in the Wikipedia. The same should apply to toy designers, animators and other similar behind-the-scene people. As Barbe has illustrated around a hundred published books and collaborated to several mainstream electronic media contents, either television or videogames, and that there is a reasonnable fandom for Heavy Gear and other franchises he worked on I do think the article is justified. Of course,take this entry here only as a justification of me writing this article. It would be, well, biased, to want to vote on the matter. Cosmicdiadrone 19:21, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>i am re-nominating this page for deletion and have received permission to do so from wiki admin. it was nominated for deletion once before and i have read the debate on keep or delete. i found the reasons for keeping it to be weak and unconvincing. thus, i submit it for deletion.</p>
<p>dr. meredith jung-en woo is a very good scholar and has authored some very good works, but nothing about her record makes her exceptional in the field of korean studies. her research, while important in its own way, is not commonly thought of as being central to the field. her books are a very fine accomplishment, but among scholars, it is not exceptional. i know of other scholars whose records would warrent a page before her, the late james palais being among them.</p>
<p>specifically, dr. meredith jung-en woo is not, by the academic standards of her field, a prolific writer or a central thinker. as an example, the koreanist bruce cumings (to whom she is married) has over 20 books. his contributions to the field of korean studies reshaped its issues and assumptions, particularly those surrounding the korean civil war. today, NO SCHOLAR wishing to research the korean civil war would be taken seriously unless they first addressed the arguments raised by bruce cumings. THAT is noteworthy among academics.</p>
<p>next, her accomplishments such as advising the US government and appearing in the new york times are neither exceptionally noteworthy or overly numerous.</p>
<p>i argue that for an academician to appear in wikipedia that person needs to be truely exceptional and to achievements that place him or her far above their peers and colleagues. wikipedia needs to have high standards in this area.</p>
<p>in short, this seems more of a "vanity" page than a page dedicated to an exceptional scholar whose ideas have reworked or reshaped scholarship in their field. as such, i ask that you reopen the debate to delete the page. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongkyongnae_e837.html" title="User:Hongkyongnae">Hongkyongnae</a> 22:16, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a non-paper encyclopedia, Wikipedia can afford to have broader standards for notability than traditional encyclopedias. This author has several reputably published books and is clearly regarded by several mainstream media outlets as a person to call on for views in her field. Regardless of her relative position within her field, her accomplishments considered alone are notable enough for Wikipedia. I see no evidence that the authorship of this article is motivated by vanity. By the way, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Palais_74d3.html" title="James Palais">James Palais</a> does have his own article. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 01:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Firstly, the most important question one must ask per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is this: Is this article on her <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>? Yes, it is. Secondly, in 1996 she was appointed by President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> to serve on the Presidential Commission on U.S.-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy. Isn't that a noteworthy job-scope? After looking through the <i>proposed</i> guideline of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">WP:PROF</a>, I agree that the subject in question has not quite fulfilled the seven criterias. However, her dissertation was awarded the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>'s highest distinction. Thus she meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html#Examples" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">point number 8</a>. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 02:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per above. The fact that <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongkyongnae_e837.html" title="User:Hongkyongnae">Hongkyongnae</a> has written such a huge and involved deletion-reason summary that is very long on criticism of the article's subject but very light on actual Wikipedia policy citations, I have to wonder if this is not a bad-faith nomination. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 03:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I get the impression one could easily find this level of notability in any university professor's profile, but there are a few things that stand out. However, I notice that much of the bio is a copy of <a href="http://polisci.lsa.umich.edu/faculty/mjwoo.html" class="external text" title="http://polisci.lsa.umich.edu/faculty/mjwoo.html" rel="nofollow">her University of Michigan faculty profile</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>—In this case the nominator for deletion sets a higher standard for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability (people)</a>, than Wikipedia as a whole does (one need only participate in AfD discussions for a few weeks to recognize that). This is not a nomination for a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a>, where the standard is best in class. This is a Wikipedia article where a recognized test of notability is whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on verifiable information from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">reliable sources</a>. Although Dr. Meredith Jung-en Woo may not be, by the academic standards of her field, a prolific writer or a central thinker, she has accumulated a sufficient body of work and a sufficient recognition to warrant inclusion. If Wikipedia required the same standards of notability as the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>, then we’d be the Encyclopædia Britannica; we’re a much wider body of knowledge and data; some of us think that is valuable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 14:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Further comment</b>—I appreciated Tariqabjotu linking the original debate. I note that although the nominator found "the reasons for keeping it to be weak and unconvincing", they were actually about as unanimous and strong as it gets for these AfD debates. I'd encourage the nominator not to proceed with this nomination again (and administrators to avoid wasting our Wikiresources by keeping this debate alive).

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original creator of this page. I did so to complete a dead link at her husband's, Bruce Cumings, Wikipedia page. I do not accept the argument put forward by Hongkyongnae that the page must be deleted because the subject has not made an important contribution in the area of Korean politics. Meredith Jung-En Woo's work extends beyond that narrow definition. Hongkyongnae also oddly conflates the work of a historian (Bruce Cumings) with that of a political scientist. Yes, the original page, now somewhat edited, did borrow heavily on the U Michigan political science page mentioned above. Fair-use and non-commercial use priciples seem to apply sufficiently well here and the authors there do not object to the use here. She is a prominent member of a prominent department whose visibility continues to grow. For all these reasons, this page should remain. Yosemitemac 23:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I would suggest that Mr. Crawford find another way to express his ideas. Motola's story has been told by most major English-language newspapers since 1999. The Newsbank database gives 340 article hits for Motola. Her crippling ties in with important issues such as landmine accidents, the Burmese insurgency and advances in prosthetic devices.

<li><b>Comment</b> - <i>(Disclosure: I'm the Rob T Firefly mentioned in the article, and make no claim to neutrality in this matter.)</i> - This article survived a deletion attempt exactly four weeks ago. If all five "delete" votes from last month somehow outrank the well-over five distinct keep votes by verifiable users, why was it not deleted as part of the normal deletion process instead of having a new AFD nomination? The administrator, <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a>, concluded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Phone_Losers_of_America" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Phone_Losers_of_America" rel="nofollow">that AFD nomination</a> by keeping it. I really doubt it's in the spirit of Wikipedia to completely ignore and discount the administrator's decision from no more than four weeks ago simply because you disagree with it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_T_Firefly_fabf.html" title="User:Rob T Firefly">Rob T Firefly</a> 05:28, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is not non-notable software, it is used by a lot of businesses every day. I will rewrite to sound less like advertisement 60.229.101.26 07:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, whilst it may not be "notable" by the standards here, DHPOS has become a very important part of many businesses and has an active volunteer community, used by small businesses in approximately 50 countries. The software is not offered for profitable gain and as such - I don't see how the article could be classifed as an "advertisment". I would encourage those who recommend deletion to actually visit the website, and visit the forum to get an actual feel for the software and it's community. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Bunn_9d01.html" title="User:Andrew Bunn">Andrew</a> 10:17, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> not 100% convinced it needs rewriting - just expanding. I mean, this isn't an informercial-style testimonial, it's a statement from the guy who made it about <i>why</i> he made it, which is notable, especially since it's apparently a free product and no one's trying to hawk it.

<li>Yes, but I expect that a Wikipedia article will include information about what the software does, for one thing. There is nothing to that effect in this article yet, and despite the promise above to make it sound less like an advertisement, which would take about five minutes, it still has the two big pull-quote testimonials, a screenshot infobox and a link plus an exhortation to go to the site and learn more. That walks and quacks like the proverbial duck to me.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I did a story on The Forgotten Onez last year and I have been a die hard fan ever since. They were also part of a research paper I did on the impact of young black men in the music industry (I am a media management major). I didn't even know they had a wikipedia page until like five minutes ago when I was called and told that people wanted to delete it. I will just tell you now, they are really loved in and around Chicago and if you delete it someone will always start another one. You can't suppress knowledge and if people want to know about The Forgotten Onez, and they do, then they will always find a way! It is also worth noting that TBC has commented on a musical knowledge when his personal page says he doesnt even listen to music. So tell me, how is he qualified to even be in this discussion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by CandyGirl21 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CandyGirl21_1477.html" title="Special:Contributions/CandyGirl21">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Do not Delete</b> I represent the said parties and they are prominent underground hip hop figures in the United States Midwest. At the young ages of 19 they have moved an impressive number of mixtapes and have done writing and production work on mainstream projects. The artists themselves did not create this entry and before you continue to paint them as unnotable I think it would be to your benefit to tell us all your qualifications to judge what is noteworthy and what isnt. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by The Forgotten Onez (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Forgotten_Onez_145e.html" title="User talk:The Forgotten Onez">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Forgotten_Onez_9387.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Forgotten Onez">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Thanks for the helpful comments. The albums (self-titled, and just-released "Wildwood Trail" which is available on cdbaby.com next week) are independent, recorded and produced in Portland OR. In terms of search results, the band is listed on cdbaby.com, pdxbands.com, rockband.com, and magic bus (mbus.com). The CD "Wildwood Trail" is actually being solid internationally, in Asia, Europe, and the US. Acrouch 20:08, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've created this article not primarily for the spell itself, but for the creature the spell calls, and which is named exactly the same, and inspired by the <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacodemon.html" title="Cacodemon">Cacodemon</a> article. I can simply rearrange the sentences to reflect that if you wish, and <b>Keep</b> the article. BTW, I'm not sure if it should be merged with BG2 article, because there may be other games based on the D&amp;D ruleset which may also use the same spell, but I am unaware of that. If the consensus would be to merge, I'd suggest to <b>Merge</b> it to <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacodemon.html" title="Cacodemon">Cacodemon</a> or <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiend_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_4e35.html" title="Fiend (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Fiend (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a> whichever seems more appropriate. There are other "fiends" described there, so this one could fit too. Instead of jumping to delete this article, the more constuctive thing would be to give some help with it, wouldn't it? (See also <a href="../../../c/a/c/Talk%7ECacofiend_4453.html" title="Talk:Cacofiend">Talk:Cacofiend</a>) I made this a stub because I wasn't sure where to put it. I sure was hoping someone would eventually put that info where it belongs if it doesn't deserve its own article, not erase it completely!

<p><b>Delete</b> user appears to have created a series of hoax pages. Google doesn't turn up anything to support the claims in the article or linked articles. Appears to be borderline nonsense unless someone can supply better evidence? User has removed previous prod on this page <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 07:59, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to the above adverse notice that was posted on the Clan Haruson page on the 18th of March 2006, the attention of those who would freely edit that page or consider deleting it is drawn to the matter that only the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Marshal_3faa.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> has the "power to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances, and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places".</p>
<p>As The Prince Haruson is forever sacred and inviolable in law, who makes his assertions under the device of his Coat of Arms (hence these matters 'touch arms') and has exercised his right of direct access to Her Majesty, those who would contest the right of the existence of Clan Haruson under both Scottish Law and English Law should first consult with the Court of the Lord Lyon, and the Royal College of Arms, before considering making adverse comments, or prejudicing The Prince Haruson by making the public suggestion that it could be a hoax</p>
<p>The Prince Haruson considers that anyone who makes adverse judgements against his sacred, heritable rights, without first getting verification of The Prince Haruson's identity and ancient rights, are prejudicial by their very act of acting against the Earl Marshall's own vested right to judge matters that 'touch' Arms of England, which in the jurisdiction of the United Kindom is criminal in its prospect, which in other jurisdiction prejudices native rights</p>
<p>Accordingly, The Prince Haruson holds the Directors and Management of Wikipedia accountable for any prejudice that would be forced against The Prince haruson, such as the deletion of this article prior to Wikipedia approaching The Earl Marshall and seeking the Earl Marshall's judgement.</p>
<p>Wikipedia staff should contact The Prince Haruson via haruson@haruson.com, or telephone him directly on +61424013804 prior to making any deletions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that unless H.R.G. The Prince Haruson recieves an apology from user: Gwernol for making judgements of English Coats of Arms that in England come under the authority of The Earl Marshall, that The Prince will be applying for a Court Order to require that user: Gwernol's identity is surrendered so that The Prince can press criminal charges.</p>
<p>And Furthermore, that Wikipedia would have a policy that allows anyone to recommend for deletion matters that come under The Earl Marshall's authority (hence Wikipedia is not protracted a right to make judgements without first approaching the Earl Marshall's Office), then Wikipedia itself becomes publically liable for any offence that is commited against those who rightfully bear their arms. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Haruson (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Haruson_8a62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Haruson">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I suggest blocking this user from Wikipedia if this continues or until his edits/article creations are cleaned up.

<p>The Prince Haruson raised to Wikepedia staff the issue of being ethnicly abused by user Wickethewok.</p>
<p>The following is the email that he just sent to Wikipedia staff:</p>
<p>This document is presented under the device of the author's Coat of Arms and the assertion that the author is forever sacred and inviolable in law (binding the recipient over to the jurisdiction of The Earl Marshall in all matters that 'touch arms' under The Law of Arms) which device is available to be viewed at <a href="http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.haruson.com/images/coa.jpg</a></p>
<p>From H.R.G. The Prince Haruson</p>
<p>To the Director, Directors, and Shareholders of Wikipedia,</p>
<p>I have today been subject to ethnic (racial) abuse by Wikipedia User Wickethewok, and shall be submitting my report to you next week, as time permits.</p>
<p>Please find below a copy of the email that I have just sent to user Wickethewok, who if not making an apology and withdrawing his claims, I shall be approaching Wikipedia in connection to the prospect of me laying criminal charges against the user.</p>
<p>May I in the first instance request your confirmation of receiving my prelimminary complaint against User Wickethewok, the nature of my complaint being that which is is expounded in the attached email that I sent to that user.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>H.R.G. The Prince Haruson</p>
<hr />
Body of Email sent to User Wickethewok----------------------------------------
<p>I draw your attention to the matter that you have made assertions, both that my contributions are nonsense, and that they are an act of vandalism.</p>
<p>You shall observe on Wikipedia's entry for Earl Marshall that the prerogative to judge matters that 'touch' arms (of England) is vested with The Earl Marshall and not with you, and that by making judgements of matters that 'touch' (English) arms without first seeking the counsel of The Earl Marshall, that you prejudice both the Earl Marshall (in the matter that the right to judge matters that 'touch' English Arms is vested with he), and you prejudice me in the matter that I assert such (native) rights under the matter that the right to judge them is not vested with you but with the Earl Marshall.</p>
<p>If you take the time to read some of the documents at www.haruson.com you will notice that I am presently engaged in asserting criminal charges against the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that the case proceeds to Court next week, that my open strategy in those documents is to hold the Federal Magistrates Court to its obligation of approaching the Earl Marshall so that the Earl Marshall can indeed verify that I am as who I have asserted.</p>
<p>If your assertions are not immediately withdrawn and an aplogy made, you will understand that it is already my prerogative to assert that you have pierced the veil of my forever sacred and inviolable honour, which upon them not being withdrawn I shall be able to raise criminal charges against you that at the minimum, will prevent you from ever travelling freely in the British Commonwealth without criminal charges first being heard against you.</p>
<p>As you have both abused and violated my native ethnicity, I shall in any case be presenting my case to the Wikipedia abuse department.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>His Royal Grace The Prince Haruson</p>

The question is whether EVERY charitable group/group of missionaries in the world should qualify for a wikipedia article. There must be a million of them, if you include every muslim, buddhist, etc group. As Baylor does lots of missionary work, trains missionaries (see <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/2003/5_12/pages/nurse.html" class="external free" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/2003/5_12/pages/nurse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baptiststandard.com/2003/5_12/pages/nurse.html</a>), perhaps the content of this article could be retained as part of some sort of overall Baylor Missionary Work article. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:04, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is one Bulgarian academic's suggestion for a simplified spelling of English.

<dd>This deletion proposal is unsubstantiated; the original allegation that the article was a "nonnotable spelling reform suggestion" is now reduced to "I don't consider the proposal notable". The latter apparently derives from <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>'s assessment of the system itself which however should not be a consideration. Far from proposing reforms, the article presents in Wikipedia a comprehensive, self-contained system of Roman spelling of the English language, reviewed and published by a respectable scientific journal. This surely makes it notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Whether one likes the system or not is quite irrelevant -- as is the presumed Bulgarian nationality mentioned above, one hopes. <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 13:36, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My problem is not the merit of the orthographic scheme, but the lack of context. (For starters, we don't actually know that Ivanov didn't write the paper as a student, or in a rush, but it was published, so we can assume it has some merit.)</dd>

This WP article fails to mention its importance and intent; without finding the paper in a library, or having someone even quote from it, we have no way to judge its purpose or notability. Since it does not seem to be cited or mentioned anywhere else, there seems no reason to judge it as notable. We can't write a WP article about every entity mentioned in in an academic paper. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-03-20&#160;19:57&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

He's been around for years in the BBS and linux communities in India. But the controversies mentioned are also very much there, and large parts of the original article, about his exit from the linux-india mailing lists, the winding down of the bangalore linux user group and the background of the bang!linux and foss.in conferences, were presented with a strong skew towards the person's PoV. The edits you see are the other side of the controversy. De-PoV'ing may not be easy - the various debates, email threads etc that have been linked to are spread over a period of several years.</li>
<li><b>Keep and de-POV/Rewrite</b> - The Person is notable, but the fact that some of the content has been taken from his website may make it difficult to de-POV it.

I don't know about everyone else, but there are lots of occasions when I come to wikipedia for a quick explanation of some phrase or allusion that I've never heard before and don't quite understand. I can see a 'blue screen of death' article being useful to users. And that is the ultimate justification. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 16:56, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, no merge</b> - Student associations belong in an article of their own, linked to in the main article. There are multiple associations per faculty which would make the whole article out of point with say 200 lines on associations and 20 on the university. In addition, incorporating them in the UoM article risks political disputes, especially for parties running for KSU elections. 195.158.70.226 has already provided for having the MADS in the UoM article -- please express an opinion on both deletion and merging - will keep edits till the discussion is finished. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../v/o/d/User%7EVodkaJazz_6d7b.html" title="User:VodkaJazz">VodkaJazz</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../v/o/d/User_talk%7EVodkaJazz_212b.html" title="User talk:VodkaJazz">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 21:43, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thats exactly what i thought, if every student association had to write a paragraph on the UOM listing it would be a really long listing, but well the MADS listing (which shouldnt have been causing any disturbance to anyone) was nominated, more than once, for deletion. The recommendation was to merge with UOM and that is exactly what i have done i also cut down on details and went straight to the point. If my page will be removed from the deletion category and the general consensus with be to simply provide a link from UOM to the MADS listing then that is exactly what i would do.</li>

<p>A list of references to the band Rush in sundry movies and TV shows, often limited to single appearances of a Rush t-shirt or something.

<li><i>The material is vital because it demonstrates this band's impact on popular culture.

<li>I think <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush (band)</a> makes it perfectly clear that Rush was more than some hack band that had a few moments of glory back in the 70's. And I quote: "Rush's three decades of continued success under their current lineup of Lee, Lifeson, and Peart has earned the band the respect of their musical peers, and their supporters are often cited as one of the most intensely loyal fanbases in the history of rock. Rush have also had a profound musical influence on such artists as Dream Theater, Symphony X, Shadow Gallery, Primus, Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, and fellow Canadian rockers The Barenaked Ladies.", ""Rush has been awarded the Juno Award[1] several times and were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994[2] (For a complete awards list see the "see also" section below). Additionally, Lee, Lifeson, and Peart are all Officers of the Order of Canada.", "As a whole, the band boasts 23 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records making them one of the best selling rock artists in history." In contrast, "Rush in popular culture" includes such enlightening information as: "A Nightmare on Elm Street, Nov. 1984. In the bedroom of one of the teenage characters (played by Johnny Depp), a Grace Under Pressure album cover poster can be seen on the wall above his bed." If you consider *that* vital information about Rush, I don't know what I can say. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil Welch</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philwelch_0d8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philwelch">c</a>) 02:26, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Order of the Boy who Kissed the Sun is a young secret society in Slovakia, some members live in Czechia (Chzech Republic) maybe. Do not delete this page. The Order is really secret. This community do not present the Order and Tarsus, their teaching. I think that this little information about the Order is very important and verification... only time please!!!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.195.103.194 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.195.103.194_aee3.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.195.103.194">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>I recommend <b>not deleting</b> this entry. I googled for sites pertaining to old macintosh hardware and software and this is about the only site that is updated regularly and has an active community. Just because a site doesn't have x amount of users doesn't mean it isn't noteworthy. Notability is a highly subjective term. Also, there is a similar entry for a group calling themselves <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairlight_%28group%29.html" title="Fairlight (group)">Fairlight</a> which has been up for about a year now and no one has deleted it.

<p>I wrote the article. I did not write the book. I was given a chance to read the book before it was published to the masses and I thought it would be a good idea to put on wikipedia. If people still think it's a useless article because the book is not out yet. Is there a possiblity that I can come back in April when the book will be avaliable to everyone? I just thought it was a good enough book in case people wanted to know more about it. If people still want the book to be erased, I'll take it down. I didn't think it would be a big issue.--<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovelyLJ_f583.html" title="User:LovelyLJ">LovelyLJ</a> 02:17, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
