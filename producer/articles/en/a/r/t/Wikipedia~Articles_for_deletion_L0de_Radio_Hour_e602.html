The result of the debate was default to <b>keep</b> as no concensus could be reached.

<li>Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of votes, however much you may think that this helps the process. Again, the votes are not the ends in themselves (Wikipedia is not a democracy). Both the context and the order of the comments are essential to understanding the intents of contributors, both at the discussion closure and during the discussion. Refactoring actually makes the job of making the decision at the closure of discussion much harder, not easier.

<p>Lol stop changing all the votes to keep, these shoe-sniffing waterheads will revert all my choice witticismz. <b>Warning</b>: this radio show is the work of GNAA members who will likely come to its defense. Please watch out for any sock-puppet votes, vandalism and fallacious arguments. Most of the keep votes are from GNAA members who came to vote after a rallying call in their IRC channel. They also seem to be insulting any delete voters.</p>

<li><b>NOTICE TO ADMIN:</b> I have removed a (possibly farcical) death threat to those voting delete. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 29 June 2005 20:21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>NOTICE TO ADMIN:</b> I have re-inserted the so called "death threat" and heartily encourage that <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> learn the difference between a statement that all persons voting for deletion should consider themselves formally challenged to a duel which they could refuse only under pain of their emasculating cowardice being known to all of the internet, and a death threat, you DFF.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BULLSHIT</b> This radio show is created by an independent entity, me (l0de). The gnaa calls in to the show, this is the extent of their participation. All equipment, music, etc is provided by me. Most insults to delete voters are from me, because these people need to unclamp their teeth from their pillows and get on with life. This wikipedia entry was created by a fan of the show, and is a fitting homage to the spirit of the l0de radio hour. Grave repercussions await its deletion. I am personally issuing a challenge to any one voting for delete, I will duel you, to the death, in international waters. If you so strongly wish to have this deleted, you must back up your words with your life, else they shall be considered inconsquential, and those urging its deletion forevermore relegated to the ranks of shunned cowardice.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know l0de personally, and lolled @ his show many many times.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it is unfair to preemptively scream "trolling" on a VFD for an article because it is loosely related to the GNAA article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This show is representative of the general malaise of today's Net-enabled youth; contrarianism and shock jock talk to stretch the boundaries of what the media can do; what is offensive/what is entertainment/what is music -- all questions posed by this show, taken as a continuing piece of art. The GNAA reference could be deleted; they are an occasional particpant as much as any caller. Skip their self-aggrandizing and focus on l0de's artistry.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The cries of "trolling" and "sockpuppetry" perhaps eminate more from the fact that the show is loosely-affiliated with the GNAA rather than any particular judgement upon its merits. Despite what the vote count could perhaps be, it is possible to dismiss whatever the powers that be disagree with by simply dismissing the individuals making the statements. The l0de radio hour is a fairly cutting-edge program that stands out within the realm of internet media as both extremely funny, shocking, and suprisingly topical. Despite the potential obscurity of the show, it has exiested as an internet entity for several years and will continue to thrive for quite some time

<li><b>KEEP</b> LRH is an impressive piece of internet history, I understand that some groups are planning on transmitting it uninterrupted via shortwave radio out of Canada. It is ridiculous to censure history, Wikipedia should take a bath of all this hippie fascist open-source cronyism and just report history. -HuseinGandhiRokso

<li><i>Delete'</i>. What the GNAA does or does not have to do with the show is irrelevant, though the sockpuppet votes are not exactly supporting the arguments. In fact, the vote above was made by a GNAA member who was honestly arguing the point (I know this because we were talking on IRC as he made it, and I think you can trust me when I say I wasn't trolled...) However, this show is indeed very obscure. I don't see how this can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable|</a>; if the only source of information on the material is the station itself, or its listeners, we should not be reporting on it. <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not for advertising</a>, <i>even</i> if articles are written neutrally. When the station does something that makes it notable in the world (and I mean as in newspaper/major website notable, not "I really think this is revolutionary" notable) we can report on it, because then we'll have some sources with which to back up the claims. Wikipedia doesn't report on the truth, but on all (notable) views of the truth. This station is simply not big enough to be in any sort of view. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:59, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> There are a lot of irellevant radio shows on the internets. This is not one of them. While many internet radio shows are dedicated to how sexually appealing an anime character's breasts are or even worse the fact that anonymous sexual intercourse just seems more arousing with a mascot costume on, this show is about relevant and recent news events and presenting them in a way that the aspberger's afflicted community can relate to. A vote for deletion on this item is a vote to marginalize anyone with aspberger's. These are intelligent people with a voice that must be heard.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This show rules. Wikipedia's mere existence makes me wish I had AIDS. And before anyone comments, yes, I know how many edits I've done.</li>

<p>This is feerie - i'm absolutely not a "Sockpuppet" or whatever ridiculous terminology you simpering pro-censorship Moderator/Dictators use to dismiss the legitimate support this entry has. As I stated before, get the green logs of butt mud out of your mouth for more than 1 second and realize that A) people like the show and that B) its notoriety grants it a space in your bloated blog.
