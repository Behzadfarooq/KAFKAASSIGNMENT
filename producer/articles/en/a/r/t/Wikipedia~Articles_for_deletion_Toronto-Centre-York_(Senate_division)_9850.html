<dd><b>Delete</b> these Senate divisions are indeed meaningless.

<li>I'm fine with the <b>delete</b>; my concern is that can't just kill the one article as there <i>are</i> others. Somebody needs to be careful to make sure that we kill any and all "Senate division" articles <i>and</i> that we unlink any surviving redlinks to them. Big job, kids. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:05, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really a big job. these are the only three that I identified as being problematic. The other live links from the original article were to (a) articles about the territories' electoral (H of C) districts which included references to the senators; and (b) articles about the Quebec Senate divisions, which are legitimate, as far as i know. And then there was only one in the (b) category. The person who started this ill-advsied project didn't get very far before abandoning it. As far as unlinking, I have no problem doing that. This is only my second-ever fD nomination. My first, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Liberal_landslide_ae11.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Liberal landslide">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Liberal landslide</a> went through yesterday, and I dutifully cleaned up the links to that. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:03, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> per Ground Zero and Jord. Any non-Quebec senate divisions do not exist (are not fixed) and should therefore be deleted. Each non-Quebec province gets a certain number of Senate seats that have nothing to do with geographic location within the province. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:25, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have added <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_%28Senate_division%29_c86c.html" title="Ontario (Senate division)">Ontario (Senate division)</a> to the list. I hope no-one objects.

<ul>
<li>From what I know, Senate seats are assigned by province. I'm not sure that a province suffers from the same problems as each "Senate division" within each province (though I'd like this disambig to use something different than "Senate division"). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:34, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Really what this becomes is a "List of Ontario Senators", and includes those "representing" Toronto, Northern Ontario, and Punkydoodles Corners. But is this needed? Do we not already have categories for present and former Senators? Do we need to break them down by province? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 17:45, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see how a <i>List of Ontario Senators</i> would be useful. When I looked at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_Senators_3243.html" title="List of Canadian Senators">List of Canadian Senators</a>, which is in alphabetical order, I could see how someone would like to see a list of the senators by province. Perhaps this list could be divided by province, then by surname. Such a discussion is probably irrelevant to this VfD, but I'll agree with your <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_%28Senate_division%29_c86c.html" title="Ontario (Senate division)">Ontario (Senate division)</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on comments from DeathPhoenix and Cloveious, I think the best approach to this article would be to move it to "List of Ontario senators", instead of deleting, and use it for all present and former senators who represented Ontario and senate divisions within Ontario. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 14:01, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep, these articles are correct. and list Senators from the divisions listed historically, even if Senate divisions are secondary to regional distribution. I think people have a stick up there rear end on this one and it seems to me they are whipped up into a frenzy because they dislike the senate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Senate constituency offices do actually exist inside Senate divisions.</p>
<p>The Senate Consitituency Office for Calgary is</p>
<p>Suite 650, 1207 - 11 Ave.S.W. Calgary, Alberta T3C 0M5 Phone: 403-244-3111</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> it because, People have a right to see a list of Senators that have represented there geographical area, and the dates they represented that area.</p>
<p>Senate divisions were important more historically when people had to go to Senators to get Private bills introduced in the senate and house to get a divorce before, family law was deligated to the courts, and travel and communications were not very good compared to today. I can back that up with News Paper articles from the turn of the Century.</p>
<p>The Ontario division is stated as a Senate division "At Large" representing areas not covered by senators covering specific areas inside the article.</p>
<p>And no, they are not controlled by a boundaries commission like electoral districts, and that won't change until Senate reform happens.</p>

<p>The government of Canada actually took the time to note Senate divisions represented and days when senate divisions changed.</p>
<p>Here is another Government of Canada link to a Senate Committee list <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/Committee_SenMembers.asp?Language=E&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=11" class="external text" title="http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/Committee_SenMembers.asp?Language=E&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=11" rel="nofollow">The Legal and Consitituional Affairs Committee</a> notice how they took the time to list the Senate divisions on there to?</p>

<li>Cloveious, I have repsonded to your comments at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECanadian_Senate_divisions_c513.html" title="Talk:Canadian Senate divisions">Talk:Canadian Senate divisions</a> <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:50, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cloveious, the point is that beyond the level of the province, a Senate division can be called anything the sitting senator wants it to be called (s/he could even call it "Hellsmouth-Sunnydale-Buffyverse", iffen s/he wanted to), but there aren't any formal boundaries and they're still constitutionally deemed to represent the whole province. Even with the divisional name "Toronto/Bloor &amp; Yonge", <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Stollery_7f65.html" title="Peter Stollery">Peter Stollery</a> is not <i>really</i> considered the senator for just one street corner in downtown Toronto, and that divisional name will most likely <i>never</i> exist again after Stollery dies or retires. I fully support a list of senators grouped by <i>province</i>, but outside of Quebec, senate subdivisions really, truly, don't exist except as null placeholders. (It's the political equivalent of buying a coloured faceplate for your iPod — it personalizes your iPod and makes it a little more unique, but it doesn't fundamentally change the iPod into something it isn't.) And if you think we're opposed to this just because we dislike the Senate, dude, you're <i>seriously</i> out to lunch. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
