<p><b>Puerto Rican Espiritismo</b> A common problem among minorities in the United States is that they receive inadequate and ineffective mental health treatment. There are many underlying factors that are at the cause of this problem, but this paper will mainly address the issue of a lack of cultural awareness and understanding. Many of those in the counseling field do not possess the knowledge of minorities’ cultural and spiritual beliefs are thus unable to relate to the patient. This inability results in inappropriate and ineffective treatment for those individuals. Common treatments in the United States that have their roots in Western psychological philosophy have proved to be ineffective in treating those with backgrounds outside of the west. In order to overcome this problem it is important for those in counseling who deal with such patients to become aware and knowledgeable of these differences. This will enable minorities to receive proper and effective treatment. Through this paper I hope to bring to light the culture and beliefs of Puerto Ricans and their belief system called Espiritismo, with the hope that others will become aware of these differences and adapt to provide proper treatment.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-04_bb06.html" title="Edit section: Espiritismo: Background of Beliefs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Espiritismo: Background of Beliefs</span></h3>
<p>Before we are able to understand the practical use of Espiritismo, we must first become aware of the background and basics of the belief system. In the 19th century a French spiritualist named Allen Kardec wrote a series of books about “spiritisme” (Comas-Diaz, 637). Kardec defined this term as a “science that studies the nature, origin, and destiny of spirits and relations with corpeal world” (Molina, 228). After studying in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, Puerto Rican scholars brought this notion back to the island to share with others (Yanez, 1963). The concept of spiritism was first popular with the middle class intellectuals who were interested in it as a basic structure for social and moral development (Molina, 228). But soon the lower class individuals took Kardec’s ideas and combined them with their current beliefs of Catholicism, herbal medicine and other healing processes to create the Religious belief system known today as Espiritismo (Molina, 228). From then on the practice spread to become an integral part of everyday life and culture among Puerto Ricans, and is still alive and functioning today.</p>
<p>The foundation of Espiritismo is in the belief that two worlds exist. There is a spirit world that is surrounded by, but invisible to the human world. Spirits can communicate with the human world and vice versa. Those who have the ability to communicate with the spirit world are known as mediums or espiritistas. Mediums have the ability to communicate because they have developed <i>facultades espirituales</i> (spiritual faculties). They have the power to intervene with both worlds for good or for bad (Comas-Diaz, 637). Humans are spirits that have been embodied and thus live in the visible world. The “disembodied” spirits are the ones that make up the spirit world. The goal of spirits, all of whom are created ignorant by nature, is to achieve <i>Evolucion Espiritual</i> (spiritual evolution). Meaning they attempt to “develop toward full light and understanding until they become a pure spirit” (Comas-Diaz, 637). Spirits must work their way through three levels and ten grades of spiritual development. Based on their progress through these levels they are ranked in a hierarchal order (Comas-Diaz, 637). Those in the top tier are known as higher level and consist of pure spirits who are god-like. They have reached or almost reached full spiritual development and are considered pure in every sense. The middle level spirits are also pure spirits, but they are not quite god-like. They are more like angles or seraphim. The lowest levels of spirits are known as “ignorant spirits” and they are often influenced by evil and “misguided by material things”. In order to move up levels, both incarnated and non-incarnated spirits must undergo pruebas or trials to enhance their pureness. The incarnated spirits are lead by their “guardian spirits” through their pruebas. Mediums communicate with guardian spirits to inform incarnated spirits the path in which they should take (Comas-Diaz, 638). In Espiritismo it is believed that the lower level spirits, “ignorant spirits”, are responsible for physical and psychological problems in humans. Ignorant spirits can gain control of thoughts and actions of humans, basically possessing them. When possessed, the person is under the control of the spirit and forced to do its bidding. This can lead to serious mental and physical illnesses if not properly treated (Molina, 229).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-04_bb06.html" title="Edit section: Puerto Rican Context of Disorders">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Puerto Rican Context of Disorders</span></h3>
<p>Knowing the background of espiritismo and its role in the beliefs of Puerto Ricans, we can now begin to examine how this system can be used as an effective form of mental health treatment. In order to effectively treat patients from a Puerto Rican background they must take into consideration the differences in the view of psychological disorders. It is common belief that the symptoms and effects of certain disorders vary from culture to culture and understanding these differences is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment. In the case of Puerto Ricans who practice espiritismo, and many other Spanish speaking cultures, people do not separate physical and psychological health. When experiencing emotional and psychological problems, sufferers often describe their symptoms in terms of “somatic disorders” (Comas-Diaz, 639). So for example, instead of complaining about emotional discomfort, such as anxiety or depression, Puerto Ricans would describe symptoms of headaches and sleeplessness. The most important difference between the diagnosis and treatment of followers of espiritismo and those of most western denominations is that in espiritismo the patient is viewed as suffering at the hands of someone else. In other words they are not responsible for their psychological problems, that it is actually the work of ignorant spirits and beyond their control. Their problems are the results of external factors. In most western practices of psychotherapy the patient is seen as being sick, and their problems are the results of their own inadequate behavior. Thus it is up to the patient to reform their own behavior in order to control the problem (Comas-Diaz, 641). By knowing the nature and context of disorders among the Puerto Rican population, we can now examine the use of espiritismo as a form of therapy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-04_bb06.html" title="Edit section: Diagnosis and Treatment using Espiritismo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diagnosis and Treatment using Espiritismo</span></h3>
<p>It is a common belief among those who practice Espiritismo that humans are composed of spirit and matter. Because of this, illnesses can are inherently material (physical), spiritual or both. If the cause of an illness is material then a suffering patient will be referred to a modern health professional to receive treatment. If the problem is believed to be spiritual then they will be seek help from an espiritista. There are a wide range of problems that are considered spiritual. They range from “problems with significant relationships (spouses, children, etc.), psychosomatic concerns, sleeping problems, auditory and visual hallucinations, and nervous conditions such as anxiety and depression (Comas-Diaz, 637). In Espiritismo it is believed that ignorant spirits are the cause of these problems and to treat them, a person will most often visit a spiritual center to consult a medium. The patient will be brought in a room that consists of a long table furnished with a cloth cover. Seated at the head of the table is the group leader and around him sit other mediums. Usually present on the tables is a goblet of water, flowers, cigars and statues of different Catholic saints (Molina, 229). The room is often decorated with pictures of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. The first stage of a healing session will usually being with a reading from the book, El Evangelio Segun Espiritismo or The Gospel according to Spiritism, by Allen Kardec (Molina, 230). Then a prayer will be read from the book A Collection of Selected Prayers, which is designed to ask for the presence of spirit guides, the education of ignorant spirits, and support for the health of the patient. This process is called invocacion (Comas-Diaz, 638).</p>
<p>The second stage of healing involves finding the cause of the problem. This step is used to diagnosis the problem so that a proper method can be determined to cure the individual. There are different methods used to diagnose these types of disorders. Espiritistas can use cartomancy, which is the use of cards to reveal the past, present and future of a person. Another method of diagnosing is called spirit writing. This is a technique in which the medium makes a mark on a paper and interprets the meanings of the marks. Also the problem can be diagnosed by “spirit communication through a cup of water”, which the medium uses a cup of water to read the spirits messages (Comas-Diaz, 638). Through these processes a medium is able to identify whether the cause is spiritual, material or both. Once this is discovered then the medium prepares to be possessed by the ignorant spirit so that with the help of the other mediums, they can educate the misguided spirit and relieve the patient of their troubling symptoms (Molina, 230). There are two functions of the medium being possessed by the ignorant spirit. The first is to find the underlying feelings against the patient to better understand why they are brining harm to them. Most often a spirit is seeking revenge for harm that the patient has cause them either when they were alive or in a previous life (Molina, 230). The second and more important factor is to communicate with the spirit to enlighten them to a better way of reasoning, so that they do not continue to cause harm to the living.</p>
<p>While the medium is possessed the patient is told to complete certain rituals and activities to help guide and enlighten the ignorant spirit. These include lighting candles and reciting prayers. After the mediums are finished giving light to the ignorant spirit and they are satisfied that they have moved on, they work on strengthening the patient’s character so that they are no longer easily influenced by other spirits (Molina, 230). The session is complete when the group leader feels that the ignorant spirit has been effectively removed from the patient and their character has been sufficiently strengthened. Before the patient leaves the group leader leads them in one more prayer call, “At the end of the meeting” (Molina, 230).</p>

<p>The next question that arises in the discussion of providing appropriate mental health to Puerto Ricans is how to incorporate the use of espiritismo into traditional psychotherapy, to provide proper treatment for this population. The first step is to recognize the differences between the two systems. We must be aware of the cultural views of disorders and how they differ across societies. As stated earlier the main difference is the view of the patient. In espiritismo the patient is a victim of outside influence from ignorant spirits. “Sufferers are dependent on external forces, with no personal responsibility for their behavior” (Comas-Diaz, 641). In psychotherapy the patient is view as being responsible for their behavior and believed to be in control of it.</p>
<p>Some of the key similarities between the therapies are noticed when looking at the overall structure of their design. Espiritistas or mediums are “trained, socially accepted healers” (Comas-Diaz, 640). Psychoanalyst’s can be viewed in the same way. The patients are also similar because in both therapies they are someone who is seeking help because they are suffering from some disorder or another. Finally according to Comas-Diaz both therapies are centered on “systematic contact between the sufferer and the healer in which the healer attempts to change the sufferer’s behavior to relieve distress” (Comas-Diaz, 640). Within each therapy the main goal of the healer or analyst is to bring light to unconscious conflicts that are causing the patient psychological problems. By making the patient aware of these conflicts they are able to confront them and work them out. The similarities between these two forms of therapies are best illustrated in the works of C.G. Jung. There are many clear connections between his works and the beliefs found in espiritismo. Since Jung is one of the founding fathers of psychoanalytical therapy, and many of his terms and concepts are at the root of the practice, by understanding the connection to espiritismo, one would be better able to grasp its culture and realize its therapeutic value. Thus those who practice Jungian therapy could generalize their work to incorporate the Puerto Rican population.</p>
<p>From a young age C.G. Jung developed a strong interest in the unconscious and spent most of his life trying to understand it. Though his work is viewed as being rooted in western philosophies, it is easy to see the connection to such Caribbean practices as espiritismo. Many of his concepts when viewed under a cultural context can be applied to therapies like espiritismo. Jung himself can be viewed as a healer, similar to an espirita. According to Mario Molina, “Jung’s process of becoming a psychotherapist has some similarities with the way in which a Puerto Rican becomes a spiritist healer” (Molina, 231). Molina goes on to point out different instances in Jung’s life in which he encountered spirits, visions, dreams, and possessions all similar to the experience that a medium goes through while developing their faculties. Much of his work is centered on his attempt to describe these spiritual encounters scientifically. He defines spirits as “unconscious autonomous complexes which appear as projections because they have no direct association with the ego, they are pathological fantasies or new but yet unknown ideas” (Molina, 231). Later he coined the term “archetype” to describe these figures in the unconscious. Jung often referred to the collective unconscious as the “land of the dead” (Molina, 233). So one could see the connection between Jung’s collective unconscious and the “spirit world” in the belief system of Espiritismo. Jung also defines the act of possession by a spirit in psychological terms. He claims that when one is possessed, they are having “an invasion of a complex from the collective unconsciousness” (Molina, 234). These “complexes” act in a similar manner to ignorant spirits, where they gain control of a person’s thoughts and behavior, causing distress in the individual.</p>
<p>After knowing the connections between the two therapies in terminology, we can begin to see the similarities within the treatments. Already stated was the process in which an espirita “works the causas” of a suffering patient by identifying the cause of the problem as spiritual in nature, then contacting the ignorant spirit in order to educate it so that it can move on. The main goal is to create communication between the patient and the spirit in order to find the cause of the problem. C.G. Jung had a psychotherapy technique called “active imagination” that when viewed in context seems very similar to the medium practices (Molina, 240). The process begins with the patient suppressing their ego thoughts so that the unconscious can come forth. This is achieved by doing different relaxation exercises such as lighting candles, meditation, hypnosis etc. This is very similar to the beginning rituals of a counseling session with an espirita. In the case of active imagination, once the unconscious begins to come to light, the patient is told to give an outer form to it. This is done through poetry, artwork, music or direct dialogue. Once the unconscious has been given form, the patient is to bring back the ego and confront the unconscious. This compares to a medium being possessed and the patient confronting the ignorant spirit. Both therapies center on personifying the problem in order to communicate with it to work out a resolution. Once the ego confronts the unconscious the problems are discussed and once an understanding has been reached, the patient can be relieved of their distress. Both techniques can be summed up as “a healer (therapist) that bridges a gap between ignorant spirits (archetypes and complexes within the collective unconscious) and the patient” (Molina, 240).</p>
<p>Understanding the similarities between Jungian psychoanalysis and Puerto Rican Espiritismo gives us the hope that advances can be made in the treatment of minorities with mental health problems. Since Jungian psychoanalysis is a widely studied and accepted practice, by showing its similarities to Espiritismo one can hope that its practice can be better understood and accepted. Espiritismo is just one example of many different cultural therapies that aide in the area of mental health among minorities. It is important for therapists who deal with a minority population to gain a better understanding of the culture of such people so that more effective treatment can be issued. By knowing about outlets such as spirit centers and mediums, therapists can work in junction with these agencies to treat the minority population effectively. The therapeutic power of Puerto Rican Espiritismo can not be ignored and should be further researched to get a better understand of its powers so that maybe one day they can be generalized to a greater population.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-04_bb06.html" title="Edit section: Battle of Flamborough Head">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle of Flamborough Head</span></h2>
<p>The most famous battle in the career of the American naval hero, John Paul Jones, fought during the Revolutionary War on September 23, 1779, off Flamborough Head, England.</p>
<p>Commodore Jones left France in the Bonhomme Richard, commanding a fleet of six ships on a cruise around the British Isles. When he reached Flamborough Head, he had four ships remaining. There he encountered a merchant convoy from the Baltic, bringing naval supplies to the British. The convoy was escorted by two British naval ships, the Serapis, commanded by Pearson, and the Countess of Scarborough, Piercey commanding.</p>
<p>Jones chose to engage the British warships before pursuing the Baltic convoy. His own Bonhomme Richard engaged the Serapis, while the Pallas fought off an on with the Countess of Scarborough. The Vengeance did not participate in the battle. The Alliance left conflicting accounts of her role in the affair, but present scholarship suggests that the Alliance did more to hinder Jones than help.</p>
<p>The Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis engaged in various naval maneuvers for an hour and a half during which Jones realized that Serapis was a nimbler ship (she was in fact newly copper-bottomed) and had the heavier guns. He thus resolved to grapple with the Serapis, to try and board her, his only chance at victory. When Serapis' bowsprit became fouled in the Bonhomme Richard's rigging, the two ships became attached to each other, stem to stern, their guns (cannons) literally face to face.</p>
<p>It was at this point, when Capt. Pearson called across to ask if Jones wanted to surrender, that Jones gave his infamous reply: "I have not yet begun to fight."</p>
<p>The two ships then fought an unprecedented and epic battle for two more hours, firing cannons, dropping grenades, and shooting muskets from the masts, before Pearson finally struck. The Pallas also captured the Countess of Scarborough.</p>
<p>Jones may have won the victory and enduring fame. But his ship did sink two days later, and Pearson, in defeat, was able to save the Baltic convoy which escaped.</p>
<p>-- This is a revisionist history. JP Jones, a known pirate, a murderer and pediophile. The fact that he inadvertantly aided a great nation during a time of war does not change these facts.</p>

<p>Teresa Magbanua y Ferraris (1868-1947) earned the distinction of being the only woman to lead combat troops in the Visayas against Spanish and American forces. Born in Pototan, Iloilo, to wealthy parents, she earned a teaching degree and taught in her hometown. Having come from a family of revolutionaries, she immediately volunteered her services to the motherland and became a topnotch horseman and marksman. Fifty years later, her heroism was once again displayed when she helped finance a guerrilla resistance movement against the Japanese in Iloilo.</p>

<p>Jan De Nul was established in 1938 as a Civil Engineering and Maritime Construction Company. In 1951, expansion towards <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dredging.html" title="Dredging">dredging</a> started and has evolved into an important activity in which Jan De Nul has become specialized and ranks at the top.</p>
<p>Jan De Nul employs 3000 employees worldwide and has become a world leader in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dredging.html" title="Dredging">dredging</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reclamation.html" title="Reclamation">reclamation</a> works and specialised services for <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offshore.html" title="Offshore">offshore</a> pipelines, rock dumping, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvage.html" title="Salvage">salvage</a> and heavy lifting. In Belgium, Jan De Nul is known for its civil engineering works, marine related civil works, buildings and water purification plants and is specialized in turnkey projects. The Jan De Nul Group also offers large-scale environmental services which include soil remediation, confined waste disposal, sludge treatment and organic waste recycling by means of its subsidiary company ‘ENVISAN’.</p>
<p>The Jan De Nul Group’s massive expansion policy with respect to its new <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dredging.html" title="Dredging">dredging</a> fleet capacity is unequalled in the dredging sector providing the most modern dredging fleet in the world. The company owns and operates :</p>
<ul>
<li>8 cutter suction dredgers with total installed <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">diesel</a> power ranging from 2,380 to 27,240 kW including the world’s most powerful self-propelled cutter dredgers such as the "JFJ De Nul", the "<a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>" and the "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Polo_5cb9.html" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>". In 2003, the world’s largest self-propelled rock cutter suction dredger, the "JFJ De Nul" was launched and commissioned. The ship has a total installed power of 27,240 kW and 36 % more power on the cutter drive than the "Leonardo da Vinci". Two medium sized stationary cutter suction dredgers have been ordered at the <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tianjin.html" title="Tianjin">Tianjin</a> Xinhe Shipyard in China and are due for delivery in 2006.</li>
<li>17 trailing suction hopper dredgers with hopper capacities ranging from 2,339 to 33,000 m³ including the "<a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasco_da_Gama_3d28.html" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>", the world’s first mega dredger and four new trailing suction hopper dredgers launched in 2003: the "<a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_di_Giorgio_74b2.html" title="Francesco di Giorgio">Francesco di Giorgio</a>" and the "<a href="../../../t/a/c/Taccola.html" title="Taccola">Taccola</a>" with 4.400 m³ capacity and the 11.300 m³ "<a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Beaufort_9008.html" title="Francis Beaufort">Francis Beaufort</a>" and "<a href="../../../f/i/l/Filippo_Brunelleschi_7e8e.html" title="Filippo Brunelleschi">Filippo Brunelleschi</a>". A deep dredging facility up to a suction depth of 130 m has been installed to set a new record in deep dredging. With her 60,000 dead weight tonnage, the 33,000 m³ '<a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasco_da_Gama_3d28.html" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>' provides a carrying capacity of some 80 percent in excess of the largest hopper dredgers available on the market at this time.</li>

<p><b>Partai Rakyat Demokratik</b> or known as <a href="../../../p/r/d/PRD_e690.html" title="PRD">PRD</a>, literally means <b>Democratic People's Party</b>, is an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesian</a> radical left-democratic <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party.html" title="Party">party</a>.</p>
<p>The party was founded at early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> by Indonesian young intellectuals and activists led by young leftist activist named Budiman Sujatmiko. Its early members included college students. Since its early ages, the party had bravely criticized the authoritarian and repressive government of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_69d3.html" title="New Order">New Order</a>. It quickly showed radicalism with its <i>Manifesto 22 Juli 1996</i> or July 22nd 1996 Manifesto, which criticized the political condition of Indonesia by that time under the corrupt dictator <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a>.</p>
<p>By 1997, PRD got more active in advocating the poor peasants at Java using its sub-organization, <i>STN</i> or <i>Serikat Tani Nasional</i>, means National Peasants Union. The activity was to advocate the peasants to hold their rights and land when they are pushed by the government or government-supported giant developers in and for ambitious projects. Also by these times, PRD blatantly supported the independence of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timor_c0fb.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, its leader, Budiman Sujatmiko even met up with <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xanana_Gusmao_4f3d.html" title="Xanana Gusmao">Xanana Gusmao</a>, the East Timor leader for independence and the new nation's current President.</p>
<p>Mad by the critics and activites performed by the party, the government committed repressions and pressures over it by using the polices and the military if necessary. The government and the military simply stigamtized <a href="../../../p/r/d/PRD_e690.html" title="PRD">PRD</a> as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subversive.html" title="Subversive">subversive</a> movement. Despite the leftist ideology of the party, PRD was never been a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a>, it was more like a socialist that didn't use guns and violence in its movement. Since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> to first half of 1998, many members of the party and any activist related to it were arrested without proper procedure, were kidnapped, were physically abused, humiliated, and imprisoned without trial. Despite destroying, the government's repression quickly boosted the party's popularity, especially among opposition and activist community.</p>
<p>By 1998, the wave and demand of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> began to take place, which demanded the government to perform reformation in many aspects, especially in politic. The process was used by many opportunists, including the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> and Islamic right-wing <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalists</a> to create chaos and disorder, which in turn brought murders, abuses, pillage, plunder, and raping, especially to the minority race of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesian_Chinese_85c8.html" title="Indonesian Chinese">Indonesian Chinese</a> people, which were mistakenly scapegoated in this mass anger. But by middle of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, the struggle of the party and also other uncountable oppositions born its fruit, the dictator Suharto resigned, which marked the collapse of the New Order regime.</p>
<p>After the Refromation, PRD continued to criticize the more-democratic government of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and sometimes also involved in boycotting the election for protest. The party is currently led by former woman labor crusader <a href="../../../d/i/t/Dita_Indah_Sari_d534.html" title="Dita Indah Sari">Dita Indah Sari</a> after its former leader Budiman Sujatmiko received scholarship and continued his study.</p>

<li>This text has a rather obvious political bias ("bravely criticized the authoritarian and repressive government"), and the sources cited, mainly the party's own web site, are of no use for the task of neutralizing it. A lot more, and better, sources are needed for such an obviously contentious subject to get off the ground. We do not need to start yet another article with a perennial NPOV dispute over badly sourced content. Please supply multiple sources that are independent of the party itself. We aim to enforce a <i>strong</i> sourcing policy for all subjects here, <i>especially</i> contentious ones. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nicolas Vanier, a French traveller and an author of a number of books and films about his travels. Ithe beginning of 2006, while crossing Russia in a dog-drawn sledge, he was accused by several animal protection organisations and Russian media in behaving cruelly towards his dogs.</p>
<p>His adventure, "l’Odyssée Sibérienne" (ٍSyberian Odyssey), was organized under the high patronage of President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>According to Russian animal protection group Vita, "the huskies are in an extremely bad condition, with legs covered in blood up to their knees. Three of the 10 animals could not continue the trip and had to be left along the way". At least one of the dogs died, Russian state agency Novosti reported.</p>
<p>When the dogs were offered hay to lie on during a stop in the city of Tomsk, the animals started eating it hungrily, bringing witnesses to tears, said an open letter of a number of Tomsk citizens.</p>
<p>Several Russian organisations of dog experts stated: "<a href="../../../l/a/i/Laika.html" title="Laika">Laikas</a>, whom Vanier is using in his adventure can keep moving on snow, but not on ice".</p>
<p>Still, press-secretary of Vanier refutes such allegations, pointing out that the way Vanier treats the animals is "naturally traditional", the dog which died was killed by another dog because of a quarrel. His proponents also claim, the accusations of underfeeding the dogs are irrelevant, as soon as the dogs should be underfed to keep moving the sledge.</p>

<p>Green Bay Professional Packet Radio (GBPPR) [<a href="http://www.gbppr.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gbppr.org" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] was formed in 1999 by a small group of digital ham radio enthusiasts in Green Bay, WI. Digital amateur radio communications started in the 1980's primarily lead by TAPR [<a href="http://www.tapr.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tapr.org" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] to lead the development and marketing of TNC's. By the GBPPR came together the throughput speeds of typical amateur digital communications where generally still in the 1200-9600 baud range, and by the rest of current the digital communications standards these speeds where lagging. By 1997 TAPR attempted development of a 128 Kbps 900 MHz Frequency Hopping radio, suggesting this is the future for amateur packet radio and the answer to the lagging speeds.</p>
<p>GBPPR's answer to the need for speed was to adopt and convert off the self Part 15 wireless Ethernet devices explicitly for ham radio. These devices already operate on amateur radio frequencies. GBPPR developed the first affordable homebrew bi-directional amplifier for use with the converted hardware and began a detailed website to encourage and help other digital ham radio enthusiasts. Other well noticed work included: 915 MHz BDA schematic, 2.4 GHz BDA schematic, Interactive Wireless Design Utilities.</p>
<p>Shortly after making print in ham radio publications such as CQ magazine (3/01), QST, and websites such as slashdot (3/28/02) the ARRL formed a High Speed Multimedia Working Group (HSMM) [<a href="http://www.arrl.org/hsmm/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arrl.org/hsmm/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>] and began encouraging widespread use of spread spectrum modes of communications such as IEEE 802.11 on amateur radio frequencies.</p>

<p><b>Urban Jazz Coalition</b></p>
<p>Comprised of drummer Jim Bridges, bassist Phil Raney, guitarist Joe Gothard, keyboardist Brandon Howard, percussionist Hector Maldonado, saxophonist Keith Newton, and trumpeter Lee Savory, these accomplished musicians have worked with a wide range of orchestras and bands.</p>
<p>The result is a high energy jazz/R&amp;B/soul sound that is compared with the likes of Spyro Gyra, &amp; The Ohio Players and called “a blend of smooth jazz textures and fiery funk” by JAZZIZ Magazine.</p>
<p>URBAN JAZZ COALITION’s release Into the Night and its’ chart-topping lead single “San Juan Nights” helped propel UJC into a new stage of popularity with national airplay at contemporary jazz stations across the U.S., appearances on BET on Jazz and nationally syndicated radio shows.</p>
<p>The buzz generated by Into the Night led to an invitation to the Mercedes Benz Silver Cup competition. Judges Russ Freeman (The Rippingtons) and Michael Fagin (CEO of JAZZIZ) selected Urban Jazz Coalition as the winners of a JAZZIZ recording contract based on their solid song-writing, and show-stopping live performance.</p>
<p>Urban Jazz Coalition’s release Contempo garnered critical acclaim, international airplay and further recognition for their hard work, excellent writing and performances, and the energy generated from the music.</p>
<p>This led to further opportunities to showcase their dynamic live performances on bills with jazz heavyweights Spyro Gyra, The Rippingtons, Larry Carlton, Rick Braun, Paul Taylor, and Jonathan Butler, as well as songs from Contempo being used on NBC’s daytime show “Starting Over”.</p>
<p>With their performing, song-writing, recording and radio credentials established, Urban Jazz Coalition began the recording of Long Street to much anticipation. UJC did not disappoint with one of the brightest and most exciting recordings to date, further establishing themselves as a major presence in urban jazz.</p>
<p>Flush with rhythmic grooves, funky bass lines, a smokin’ hot brass section, and beautifully written songs, UJC’s evolution and growth is apparent upon first listen. Horn-driven gems “Rising Park”, “Momma’s Eyes” and “Just Believe” and the funky title track make a seamless transition into the wonderful piano work on “Intimate Journey” gospel influenced “We Fall Down”, Latin jam “Luqillo Beach” and unique covers of “Pleasure Seeker” and“People Make the World Go Round”.</p>
<p>The success of Long Street led to a series of show-stopping concerts across the nation with Boney James, FourPlay, Norman Brown, Peter White, Pieces of a Dream, and Brian Culbertson.</p>

<p>Please see the description here for ideas describing the expression "dry run": <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dry1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dry1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dry1.htm</a> Basically it means a test run-through like a "dress rehearsal".</p>
