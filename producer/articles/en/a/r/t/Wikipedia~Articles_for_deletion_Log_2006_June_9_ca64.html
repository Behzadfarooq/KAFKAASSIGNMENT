<p>Fundamental concern is that this is a POV-fork used as a platform to present questionable, obscure astrological research that would not pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> on a more frequented page. The one entry here that has received sufficient attention to warrant Wiki-coverage is the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_effect.html" title="Mars effect">Mars effect</a>, which has its own page. The main <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article has a <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html#The_objective_validity_of_astrology" title="Astrology">section</a> which can be expanded somewhat to include any other critical points. We have an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology_and_astronomy.html" title="Astrology and astronomy">astrology and astronomy</a> to boot, which we can use if we really need comparative analysis. The page is also a gawdawful mess which is constantly being reverted over. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 16:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Cited sources appear unreliable, and in any case this is more than adequately covered at <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html#The_objective_validity_of_astrology" title="Astrology">Astrology#The_objective_validity_of_astrology</a>. I see no evidence that the complexity of the argumewnt warrants a separate article, and past history indicates that this is just a venu for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:25, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The history of the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> page and this one indicate that there was a need to create a separate article exactly because of the issues being argued. The Astrology page was getting too big, hence the creation in April 2005. The title is already implicitly questioning the objective validity of astrology, so if it's a POV-fork, it can only be a <i>scientific</i> POV-fork, which is not what the described issue is. The "fundamental concern" referred to in the opening is a concern only of those editors who oppose the presentation of arguments for the objective validity of astrology. The main Astrology article cannot be expanded to give sufficient coverage to this topic: the objective validity article is already too long in itself. In fact the possibility of creating an <i>astrological research</i> page has just surfaced due to the amount of material still not included and the size of the article. The <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology_and_astronomy.html" title="Astrology and astronomy">Astrology and astronomy</a> article doesn't deal with the objective validity of astrology. To think that the complexity of the argument doesn't warrant a separate page is to ignore numerous researchers spending lifetimes on attempting to determine astrology's objective validity, and then leagues of other researchers arguing about the results for decades. I agree that editing the page is a "gawdawful mess which is constantly being reverted over" -- mostly by Marskell and Jefffire, without discussion. Let me also point out that this AfD was also brought about without input from the other editors. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article only got big because there was a drive by proponents of astrology to make <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a> arguments to counter the scientific perspective. This is not what Wikipedia is for. The objective reality section in the main article appears to me to be both balanced and sufficient. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate your point; however, the implication is hard to accept without specific examples. This is an extremely complex subject as I'm sure you realize, and a few paragraphs cannot do justice to it in my opinion. What's the point of deleting over a year's worth of hard work? If the article doesn't conform to certain policies or guidelines, I invite you and all editors interested in and knowledgeable about this subject to come and join us in our work until it does meet all required standards. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 00:19, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>I don't think it [the objective validity of astrology] is extremely complex</i>: How deeply have you studied astrology to be able to make this statement? It took Geoffrey Dean (PhD DIC ARCS analytical chemist, science writer, astrologer, and also the foremost skeptic on astrology) and company (50 astrologers and scientists) 7 man-years of effort to compile just 77 years of research on natal astrology alone (which is just one branch of astrology). The result was a 600-page, highly condensed, encyclopedic book. They summarized over 300 astrology books, 400 journal articles and 300 scientific works. He writes: <i>"[Astrology] today [in 1977]... has a vast burgeoning literature"</i>, and <i>"The subject is very a big one and the result is a very big book... about 250,000 words."</i> Researchers have been arguing about the Mars effect for decades. Simple topic?</li>
<li><i>None of the evidence presented here stands up to that</i>: To what, the scientific method or objective validity? What are you basing your opinion on? As it stands now, this is a blanket statement without presenting evidence.</li>
<li><i>POV title</i>: Most astrologers don't question the objective validity of astrology - scientists, skeptics and debunkers do, so, if anything, the title is SPOV. Numerous suggestions have been made with respect to the title. What is yours? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 15:46, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That astrologers don't question the objective validity of astrology is completely irrelevant and a poor reason for the title change.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia readers know that astrology is a controversial subject and expect to read details about both sides of the controversy. This article, on who has attempted to validate or invalidate astrology, provides this. In the article readers expect to see names like Gauquelin, Hill, Carlson, Dean, Kelly, Urban-Lurain, Tarnus, and Nanninga. That is what makes any encyclopedia worth reading. Don't take away the knowledge and the views that have been gathered for this article. This information needs to go somewhere. If this article didn't already exist, it would need to be created. Most of the objection here is over sources. Probably the most objected to source is the peer-reviewed British journal <i>Correlation</i> published by the University of Southampton. Although this source is used by both sides pro and con, it has been described (by Jefffire) as no better a source than a tabloid. Ask yourself before you vote if this is reasonable. The anti-validity side has used many questionably sources, such as web articles and blogs. Instead of creating a controversy over sources, the anti-validity side should participate in the examination of the methods and findings, as the validity side has done.<a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 18:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Both sides are already presented at <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.

<li>The main <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article presents opinion but does not explain how those opinions came about. This is an interesting and complex issue that involves many people with strongly held views and half a century of research. The pro-keep editors are strongly in favor of bringing the two sides of this controversy (since they have much to say about each other) closer together, working through POV issues, and merging the information based on consensus. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 01:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Consensus is that, per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, the article should reflect orthodox opinion, which is that astrology has no objective scientific validity. That is a very simple conept to get across, and is stated in carefully neutral terms in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The page is in pretty poor condition and needs to be improved substantially, but there does need to be a centralized page for some of the information and arguments contained in it, regardless of how bogus they may be, and the main astrology article is not the place to do it.

<li><b>Keep</b> though the title should definitely change. Perhaps "Attempts to prove or disprove objectively valid in astrology" or "Research into the empirical validity of astrology." The title as it stands appears to set up an expectation that objective validity will be proven in the content. The comments by the editors when they remove or edit sections indicate this expectation - all these calls to 'prove it' and the responses of astrologers who think they are 'proving it'. It strikes me as very odd that people think an online encyclopedia, where contributors are largely anonymous and of any possible educational background, is the place to decide upon the 'objective validity' of a phenomenon. Give only the data that reflects the state of affairs of the astrology world and let people do as they will. The article much needs work to remove exactly what is strikingly POV, but it does reflect attempts to find some type of validity to astrology - some of which appear to be important enough to astrologers and skeptics alike, having a significant contribution to how people think about astrology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 00:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me there are two approaches in this controversy, there are the <i>validationists</i>, who claim to have found no positive results, and there are the <i>empiricists,</i> who claim to have found positive results. The validationists want to compare astrology to some authoritative modern standard such as self-reporting questionnaires (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality_tests.html" title="Personality tests">personality tests</a>) and the charts or interpretations of the charts are always matched 1:1. The belief here is that a chart at any point in time is a set of fixed values with only one necessary outcome and (when questionnaires are used) that people can accurately assess themselves. The empiricists carry on the astrological tradition of collecting exemplary cases and looking for strong chart patterns. The modern approach is to collect a lot of charts and use statistical analysis. The belief here is that a chart at any point in time is a set of variables (because this is what you see in astrology texts), each of which can have numerous related values, but the values approach each other when closer to the most exemplary cases, thus there are patterns. How about structuring the article in this manner, showing the validationists versus the empiricists? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 14:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's fine to make this distinction. But I think the whole issue over keeping or deleting the contents of this article is the product of a categorical mistake. The title leads editors to believe that the purpose of the article is to give evidence that proves or disproves astrology. I think the content (merged or retitled) should be kept because it reflects the state of affairs on studies of astrology, and that it falls under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>'s <b>Popular culture</b> category. The same mistake is being made on articles dealing with topics pertaining to philosophy of science or sociology (such as pathological skepticism) rather than scientific research. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:33, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you may be right about this being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <b>Popular culture</b>, with regard to the sources anyway. One study was extremely lucky to get an article published in <i>Nature</i> by some fluke, when the whole controversy was very immature at the beginning. That's not likely to be repeated. Most of this controversy takes place in books, and articles in <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i> or astrological society journals. It rarely goes above this level. A few weeks ago Objective validity of astrology was very POV with 90% arguments against astrology. This has changed now. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 02:33, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, now instead of being very POV with 90% arguments against astrology, it's very POV with mainly apologia in favour of astrology. It's a POV see-saw, and at root there is a basic problem that there is not that much which can be said about the scientific view of astrology - science views it as bunk. Of course astrologers don't, but that's what the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article is about. What's been published is not "research" in the sense it would be understood by any scientist, but opinion; there is no shortage of that but to represent it as research is silly.

<dd>Aquirata, at this point, the article is being <i>deliberately</i> used to present a laundry list of any possible study you and Piper can find that astrologers have performed supporting your POV. Because the main Astology could not and should not accomodate the content, this constitutes a fork. It's an indiscriminate collection of info, a soapbox giving undue weight to one POV, reliant on dubious sources, and riddled with OR phrasing. That is, it violates all of NOT, NPOV, V and NOR. We need to it tie up in a sac weighted with rocks and throw it over-board. <i>Perhaps</i> something like it will need re-creating—but this page, with this content, is not going to get us there. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. "Objective validity" is the language of science, but science pretty much universally rejects the validity of astrology. I see no reason why it can't be treated like other belief systems. We do not have an article on the "objective validity of Christianity" (thankfully), and the ones we have on things like creationism make it perfectly clear that, while proponents may use the language of science, science as a whole rejects the idea. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your analysis is wrong, take a look at the original version of this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology&amp;oldid=12726640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology&amp;oldid=12726640" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which I created and you will see that it had fairly balanced sized sections on the for and against sides. Both sides of the argument were taken here so they could be given the fair treatment to both sides that a controvertial subject deserves without dominating the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 20:05, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This article is so far from balanced it isn't even remotely funny. It violates just about every policy in the book. Undue weight, reliable sources, NPOV...you name it. An utter disgrace. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 20:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is an argument for cleanup and balancing not for deletion. Pages exist which describe both sides of an argument, see <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_God_57c6.html" title="Existence of God">Existence of God</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_and_against_drug_prohibition.html" title="Arguments for and against drug prohibition">Arguments for and against drug prohibition</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 08:54, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was just a comment on the page now. As it stands the only notable part is the Mars effect, which has its own article. Coupled with it having become a POV fork is the main reason for it's deletion. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 10:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again this is not an argument for deletion. It once summarised argument for and against under those categories as the two pages above do. It should be returned to that state. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 11:14, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is rather what I had attempted to do, but was prevented at all points by pro-astrology editors. In any case what are the notable points are now found at the main Astrology article, so I see no need to retain this article. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 14:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I actually think this is one of the more interesting lists I've seen, although it certainly needs work.

<li><b>Comment</b> The modern system of taxonomy was created in 1758. It appears that this may be a partial list of the 10,000-ish species that were <i>classified</i> by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linnaeus.html" title="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in that year. It looks like the original author intended to start with Linnaeus's original list, which is composed of animals discovered <i>prior</i> to 1758, and then create lists for each successive year based on what year they were described. See Animals Discovered By Year, which contains a link to this page and redlinks to pages for every year since.-- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 03:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Someone should contact the author to indicate that putting the list in context, per <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a>, would increase its general interest, and that references are essential for material of this kind.

<li><b>Delete</b>. See also the somewhat hopeless article Animals Discovered By Year. There is a horrible confusion here between "discovered" and "(taxonomically) described".

<li><b>Keep.</b> The movie <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondhand_Lions_810e.html" title="Secondhand Lions">Secondhand_Lions</a> has a relevant line in it that goes something to the effect of "Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most". “That people are basically good. That honor virtue and courage mean everything; that money and power mean nothing. That good always triumphs over evil. That true love never dies. Doesn’t matter if they’re true or not. A man should believe in those things anyway. Because they are the things worth believing.” Keeping this article doesnt only have to be about how enduring it is, or how rigorously backed up it is. There are sufficient minimums, and there is reasonable argument that they have been met. Mans inhumanity to man is one of the great themes of human history. This article is also about the idea that man should have humanity, and even excellence, toward his fellow man. Engr.student 04:27, 9 June 2006 (UTC) <b>Note</b>: vote is user's second edit.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I continue to see posts from people that have absolutely no involvement with what is happening refer to this as a non-event. Well, of course people that are not involved and don't understand technology will say such things. The fact of the matter is this is not a Slashdot-only event. Sure, it gained widespread coverage as a result of postings on Digg and Slashdot, but this is becoming a worldwide event. People from all over the world are taking part in the fight for someone to get stolen property back to its rightful owners. I would suggest that if you do not understand technology, do not understand the Internet and its potential, that you do not post your opinion here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the original editor of the entry and read the incident on Slashdot. I had included it here as documenting a current event. In fact, compared to other <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenons</a>, this has arisen rather quickly and may be the fastest growing meme. Wikipedia also documents several other memes and can be found accordingly, such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>, Amir Massoud Tofangsazan and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>. One of the original tenets for deletion was a lack of verification, which I had duly provided. If this is rejected on the same grounds or for lack of substance, the other articles should also be up for deletion, including some rather frivilous ones like <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Feiss_b080.html" title="Ellen Feiss">Ellen Feiss</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Grandma_Hardcore_aaeb.html" title="Old Grandma Hardcore">Old Grandma Hardcore</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katilce_Miranda_4fa9.html" title="Katilce Miranda">Katilce Miranda</a>. -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanx_e026.html" title="User:Evanx"><sup><b><font color="brown">Evanx</font></b></sup></a><small>(<a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvanx_162a.html" title="User talk:Evanx">tag?</a>)</small> 02:36, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article really places us in a VERY deep quagmire. I do think the article was put up a little too quickly by the author.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's a shame if a major news source's recognition of this event is the main factor in whether this article stays. It can just as easily be deleted later as now, and I don't think failure of a major news source to ever cover the event should be reason enough. true_blue2 04:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nobody said it doesn't fit the definition of an Internet meme.

<li><b>Delete</b>. NN. I actually read the source page via its slashdot link, before ever knowing it was on WP.

And while the incident <i>might</i> merit a stub or at least a mention in another article in five years, there's no reason to believe that the website will even still be online by then. And the whole thing seems to me like it's really just a whole hulla-balu about nothing.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Although the article is regarding the website, it was meant to convey the influence of internet vigilantism and present a valid case.

<p>There has been a <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EEric_Zorn_ed9f.html" title="Talk:Eric Zorn">discussion</a> as to whether to merge, keep, or delete this. The discussion revealed a few things. This "law" was made up by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Zorn_28df.html" title="Eric Zorn">Eric Zorn</a> and he mentioned it in his blog. It has not been used widely elsewhere. He himself then created the page here in order to publicize it, and even referred to his use of wikipedia for publicity purposes a "whim and a stunt" <a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/06/land_of_linkin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/06/land_of_linkin.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I think based on the fact that it is a neologism that has yet to catch on, combined with the fact that it appears to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and evidence that the originator is trying to use wikipedia to publicise his own work, I do not even think it is worth a merge - just delete it. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 01:54, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: People on the list would be making the same choice as New Yorkers, they just have different motivations. It's also easier for famous people, as they are often wealthy enough to fly, be driven around or rent cars for short-term use, so they are not giving up much. Both groups have circumstances that allow them to not own a car, which is impossible or at least an enormous burden in many areas. Also, while most New Yorkers, and other people without cars, probably don't have a car for practical or economic reasons, it is likely that a significant percentage do not own a car for ethical reasons. It's also strange to pick a single issue like this. I don't see how it is much different from a list of people who recycle or compost, except that they are more widespread. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's not at all analagous to people who recycle, as recycling is not a deliberate departure from an ingrained social norm, whereas veganism is much more analagous (which is why I keep citing it) because, like choosing to live car-free, it is a lifestyle change that departs from a very dominant, entrenched culture and is arguably difficult (and therefore notable when accomplished) for that very reason. I believe <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_vegans.html" title="List of vegans">List of vegans</a> is a directly analagous precedent and if it is allowed to stay then List of car-free people should also be allowed. thoreaubred 07:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, "bad faith" would be misusing terms like "bad faith", divorcing it from its real meaning in an attempt to use it as a content-free insult. Bad faith would be the annoyingly common logical fallacy of taking legitimate but vaguely related articles -- lists regarding deep personal beliefs, philosophical underpinnings, and reasons for historical importance important to understanding the life stories of individuals -- and attempting to compare and align one's personal pet cause with them, a form of intellectual-burnishment-by-association (or perhaps cargo-cultism). Bad faith would be asking ludicrously broad and essentially unanswerable rhetorical questions to avoid confronting the obvious flaws raised by debate. Bad faith would be the general trend of trying to justify what amounts to propaganda with endless browbeating of anyone who opposes you. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 22:30, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your dishonest, hypocritical rhetoric is exasperating. People like you are the reason that serious people are abandoning Wikipedia every day, because they're tired of having to defend every new article against an onslaught of overzealous rule-fetishists wielding empty, shamelessly dishonest rhetoric and talking points like that which you have displayed. I give up, because trying to maintain a debate in the face of such dishonesty is too exhausting. I was wondering at what point I would finally give up on Wikipedia (like so many others) and I think this is it.

<dd>Ah, and the bad-faith hits just keep on coming! Bad faith would be the use of empty and hyperbolic adjectives to add meaning where there is none ("dishonest"? What have I lied about? "hypocritical"? Which of my principles -- stated or otherwise -- have I violated?). Bad faith would be making apocalyptic and unprovable statements about the consequences of, well, telling you that you're wrong. Bad faith would be ham-handed attempts at guilt-tripping. Bad faith would be the temper-tantruming of "do what I say or I'll take my ball and go home!" If the list in question demonstrates the level of contribution you'd bring to Wikipedia and if this AfD demonstrates the level of discourse you'd bring to discussions of edits -- well, Sunny Jim, I'd say, "Sorry, and don't let the doorknob bang you on the ass on the way out." --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:33, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> And I'm unimpressed (though perhaps not desperately) by people who put words in others' mouths, as you are the first person to mention "fascists". Perhaps you should look that word up. What I called people was heavy-handed overmoderators, mobs, gangs, groupthinkers, belligerent, misguided, failed librarians, rule-fetishists, and so on, as well as implying either illiteracy or simply a conscious choice not to bother reading the logical arguments that have already precluded many of their fallacious, disingenuous points.

Therefore, being fed up and just about done with Wikipedia, I would rather have the satisfaction of violating its two reasonable policies than its 50 ridiculous ones (the latter is done effortlessly be being a serious, sincere user of the site; only the former can be done deliberately). As for your second comment, I don't make any "common error" (I'm so impressed with all the wikimavens around here talking about the "common errors" and "common fallacies" that must plague anyone who dares to disagree with <i>them</i>.) Actually, I base the <i>observation</i> (not presumption) that people aren't listening to my arguments on the fact that every so-called argument they offer up has already been precluded by mine. It's not that they're disagreeing with me--actually it's exactly that they're <i>not</i> disagreeing with me, as they are mindlessly repeating reasons that I have already demonstrated to be invalid. Disagreeing with me would require rebutting even one of the several strong arguments I've made for my case, and no one here has done that. Oh wait, why did I type all that, it's not like you're gonna bother <i>reading</i> it or giving it the slightest bit of thought, as I'm just making the <i>common error</i> of disagreeing with you. thoreaubred 10:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> the reason for not redirecting is that users will rarely enter "F (Grade)" when they are searching for information on the grade.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi, I concur that a user is unlikely to enter "F (Grade)" when searching for this information. However, I'd think it would be plausible that someone would enter F Grade into the Wikipedia search or Google when looking for this information. Having a redirect would allow for more relevant search results. Cheers, <a href="../../../l/b/b/User%7ELbbzman_23b1.html" title="User:Lbbzman">Lbbzman</a> 02:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This article was deleted earlier, but now it's been un-deleted. I think it should stay <b>deleted</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think a Wikipedian might be reasonably likely to type in "F (Grade)", knowing that "F" would take them to the article on the letter itself.

<li>As a friend of the band I attempted to bring their pages up to Wikipedia standards. If I can offer any defense on their behalf: Two Seconds is a signed band in the San Francisco Bay Area, receiving airplay on major radio <a href="http://www.live105.com" class="external text" title="http://www.live105.com" rel="nofollow">Live 105</a>; they are playing a radio festival tomorrow sponsored by the radio station, sharing the bill with acts such as <a href="../../../a/f/i/AFI_27fb.html" title="AFI">AFI</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strokes_a398.html" title="The Strokes">The Strokes</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Ferdinand_8b2b.html" title="Franz Ferdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a> and <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo_%26_The_Bunnymen_fe26.html" title="Echo &amp; The Bunnymen">Echo &amp; The Bunnymen</a> (see information [<a href="http://www.live105.com/bfd/default.html" class="external text" title="http://www.live105.com/bfd/default.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>], with the band's name listed). They played the <a href="http://www.noisepop.com" class="external text" title="http://www.noisepop.com" rel="nofollow">Noise Pop 2006</a> festival with <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoosh.html" title="Smoosh">Smoosh</a>, a band signed to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barsuk_Records_af88.html" title="Barsuk Records">Barsuk Records</a>. They are making an impact on the local scene; however, if Wikipedia only desires to feature articles about nationally charting rock bands, then it is understandable that this article would be deleted. I have only contributed to this article as an attempt to help Wikipedia, not to violate <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. - <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlagkick_7e25.html" title="User:Slagkick">Slagkick</a> 20:27, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, I'd like to say that I looked throught the article's history, and I think you did a nice job improving this article. I hope you decide to stay and contribute to other articles. However, from what I've seen so far, this band appears to be strictly local at this point, and does not qualify for an article at this time under WP:BAND. If they should ever meet the notability guidelines, then I think you'd find more support for their inclusion. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, I wasn't aware of the guidlines of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am contacting Sierra and Lily with the notability criteria to see if they can offer any support to meet the criteria, I know they have a second album in the works, though I don't know if PopSmear Records counts as a "one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)". (and sorry about the disorganization, I'm new to editing the wiki and it was my first article) <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudd103_2015.html" title="User:Rudd103">Rudd103</a> 18:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Its not so bad, its just that they don't meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. That sounds harsh, but there's a de facto level of inclusion as a sort of bar to keep to keep wikipedia about stuff that would warrent an entry in an encyclopedia. There's nothing keeping them from eventually gaining enough notability to warrent an article. Who knows, one of the articles on band that is deleted off of wikipedia could become big one day. Its impossible to tell right now, so rather than guessing, they don't get an article yet... <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:16, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I haven't heard back from them. I'll keep a copy of the article on my computer, is there an accepted or best way to re-post the article if I get new information that meets the notability requirements? <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudd103_2015.html" title="User:Rudd103">Rudd103</a> 17:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> this short actually has 2 major Dutch actors attached; Jack Wouterse is one of the most sought after actors in the Netherlands the last ten years. (And he was the favorite leading man of shot Dutch director Theo van Gogh.) Bracha van Doesburgh is one of the fresh faces in Dutch cinema. Also actor Edo Brunner is pretty well known in Holland. --Goonie12 23:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Followed the 'official website' link (in the history tab) and went to their website; actually this doesn't look like a home made movie. It’s obviously shot on film (hence expensive), and everything looks really professional. Further I have to agree with Goonie12, it has some pretty big names attached. --Camelz 00:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, but following the Vienna link, for example, there's no information there, just an address. On <a href="http://www.skyscapearchitects.com/tsc/" class="external text" title="http://www.skyscapearchitects.com/tsc/" rel="nofollow">this German-language link</a> I find a mention of Habibollah Allahdad in a <i>supporting</i> role on an architectural project by Armin Mohsen Daneshgar. In fact, I followed all the Google hits for "Habibollah Allahdad" and found a review of a watch, membership in an online photo-sharing site, and some message board entries. Nothing to justify an article. However, if, as <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> suggested, you were to provide references with real content to support the article that would be fine, but there doesn't appear to be any content to refer to. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 14:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> At the very least, this list would only be useful until the end of the tour and following that, it would be non-notable, not that it is notable at the present time anyway. Most artists (including Shakira) have a backlog of tour dates on their website, which is where it would be appropriate to look up past tour dates if that were what someone were looking for. I added a link to the tour dates on shakira's article page and unlinked to the article Oral Fixation World Tour in anticipation of this article being deleted. <a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMBob_54e5.html" title="User:MBob">MBob</a> 23:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I really disagree. You're biting the newbies, in this case me! I'm new and unfamiliar to Wikipedia and I am working as hard as I can to get this article up to the standards. Mr Greg Wain complies to the following:</li>
</ul>
<p>"If an academic/professor meets any one of the following conditions, they are definitely notable. If an academic/professor meets none of these conditions, they may still be notable, and the merits of an article on the academic/professor will depend largely on verifiability.</p>
<p><b>The person is regarded as a significant expert in their area by independent sources.</b> <b>The person is regarded as an important figure by those in the same field.</b> The person has published a large quantity of academic work (of at least reasonable quality). The person has published a significant or well-known academic work. <b>The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea.</b> <b>The person is known for being the advisor of an especially notable student.</b> The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them."</p>
<p>I understand you may disagree, but please I'm trying as hard as I can to compile all the information to stop this article being deleted. Please, please I beg of you, don't delete the article. It hurts me that all these administrators seem to enjoy using their power to burn the little guy. Like I said before, I'm new and I do not possess the expertise or understanding that you have of Wikipedia. I just hope you guys understand...

<li><b>Provisional Delete</b> JonoL, you quote the correct Wikipedia guidelines above. However I don't see how Mr. Wain meets these. A fundamental policy of Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> which states that the ultimate criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia is <i>verifiability not truth</i>. In other words we need <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that provide evidence for your claims of notability. In particular, the notability claims seem to be around the "Wain-Mayer" model of emotional intelligence. Has this work been peer reviewed? It appears from the article that it has just been distributed around a set of schools. That alone would not meet the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">professor test</a>. However, if this work has been published in a reputable scientific journal, Mr. Wain would meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability test</a>. In that case I'll happily change my vote here to Keep. Good luck, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 12:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> no-one is proposing that it be speedy deleted. This is an Article for Deletion discussion, not a speedy deletion proposal. You are correct that this does not fall under the A7 speedy deletion criterion, but those are not the criteria used in AfD discussions. There is (so far) no evience that Greg Wain meets any of the notability guidelines and if he does not then the article is subject to debate and potential deletion. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:20, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page should not be considered a vanity page. Greg Wain is a figurehead, headmaster, and currenlty holds a position of authority. He should be considered relevant. Note: for further information on Mr. Wain, Google 'Greg Wain'.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: "An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:</p>
<p>There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community). It is an expansion (longer than a stub) upon an established subject. Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance.</p>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being: of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or currently small or a stub, or obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)"</p>
<p>Greg Wain is well known amongst the private school and Gold Coast community (this community exceeds 200,000 persons). This article is an expansion of the The Southport School 'wikipage', and hopefully the discussion here establishes his importance.</p>
<p>I look forward to any feedback.</p>

<p>As much as I don't wish for this statement to be true, it may be. Some administrators have proposed Greg Wain's deletion. I'm hurt and when I look at articles like the zero movement, which is one of Coca's Cola's thousands of marketing campaings I wonder why Greg Wain must be constantly scrutinised. I fail to see how a marketing campain which showed a few ads of some guy on a bus ARE MORE significant the Greg Wain, but who am I to decide?</p>
<p>I'd like to thank all the administrators who posted comments on this page. I appreciate the time you have taken to help a new Wikiuser. I have learnt some valuable lessons.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to everyone for reviewing the Greg Wain article and leaving their comments. Best wishes <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonoL_ac79.html" title="User:JonoL">JonoL</a> 00:01, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is an interesting test case. Do those articles constitute wide acclaim and newsworthiness for the man himself, or simply for his cause? Can this article ever be more than a stub? If his website is notable enough for inclusion here, I would recommend changing this article to redirect to a more comprehensive article about the cause, the website, and its efforts.

<p>This article seriously does not appear to be encyclopedic in any way. It seems more like it's a clan web site which the clan are "hosting" via wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_8397.html" title="User:Plasma">Plasma</a> 12:40, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I seem a bit angry here but its NOT a website, we have our own website which is clearly stated in the external links, its encyclopedic in the fact that it states information about the clans past and present. --Zementh 12:59, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>So what if you already have a site? It doesn't change what is present here. To put it this way, would you expect the Encyclopedia Britannica to contain this kind of content under any conceivable circumstances? You may find places like <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> to be more appropriate for this kind of material, and even then I'm not sure. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, for encyclopedic material, not for writing about your personal gaming clan. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_8397.html" title="User:Plasma">Plasma</a> 13:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think a google search of "james curcio" and the list of publications makes the bard college entry clear enough. The earlier suggestion that anyone with any marketing sense would use a wikipost as 'viral advertising' is a little silly since the amount of traffic that comes off wiki is negligiable at best. The <a href="../../../j/o/i/Join_my_cult.html" title="Join my cult">join my cult</a> entry appears to contain most of the relevant information that this entry contains however so deleting it makes sense.68.37.90.124 07:50, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I refuse to use google as a means by which to establish notability. Many non notable individuals get many google hits. Just because they have a large web presence (ie someone who works with technology would obviously gain more hits as easily as someone who is notable on their own merit.)

<dd>Strothra, denial would be an obvious response. As such, I have requested informal mediation, which will probably become formal mediation at this rate, and I'll probably be shouted down by people with more edits. That will guarantee that those people will always have more edits than I. This is sort of sickening. Why not create value instead of delete things that could be fleshed out? Why is it you are more willing to delete than follow up on the verifiable links that I pointed at in the talk page for the article? Why not look through the Google hits and see what is of worth in there, and which verifies things? Sure, you can delete this article but if you are following process like a robot and these are the results, the process is broken. I'm giving it 24 hours before I apply for formal mediation, and let someone else sort this out. Sad. Very sad. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 02:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I highly doubt that it would become formal mediation unless you were the one to initiate that process especially when it concerns this article's AfD which so clearly merits an AfD tag. Although, if you wish to request formal mediation I can help you with that process in requesting arbitration. The links in the article to not establish firm notability requirements nor are they verifiable. For instance, blogs are explicity considered unverifiable and improper citations as per <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. Wikipedia has standards to which articles should comply. Also, please further note that userpages are not part of the article space and thus cannot go through the deletion process. If it's not an article then I wouldn't try to have it deleted unless it contained clear personal attacks or threatening material. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 13:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> In my mind, at least, he meets two of the criteria. He is a notable editor in the Linux and ICT4D communities, as former editor of the Linux Gazette and a newly appointed editor of the Digital Divide Network.

<dd>Once again, the edit conflict I had with this individual had nothing to do with the nom. It wasn't even close to being the most serious edit conflict I've ever had. This article has no citations whatsoever. The only thing that even begins to establish notability is an external link to a BBC article in which he was interviewed. That's why I nominated it for deletion (refer to the nomination above). This is actually a very similar situation as the Chuck Olsen article which I nominated expect that one was actually deleted. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:14, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Taran AfD came after I was already putting <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocketboom.html" title="Rocketboom">Rocketboom</a> related articles up for deletion based on the same principles of Cite and verify which is how I was led to the article regarding him. I had noticed that A. Carvin, who has more than one username, had a history of creating these articles which were not cited and actually followed his article creation history. That's not really wikistalking but noticing a trend of bad article creation. Carvin is a notable individual and I never put his article up for AfD because his article establishes his notability. Anyway, if you wish to continue this please do so on my talk page or on the AfD discussion page. I would also like to ask you to please actually state why you believe he is notable and how the article establishes that rather than just saying that he's notable. Remember, this is a discussion not a vote. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 16:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have NO idea who NoDivide is, and I take that as a personal insult. Whatever happened to 'Assume Good'? Yes, I disengaged per informal mediation, but nobody else can defend me BUT me. I don't know where you get off, but I do know where I get ON. Your POV is far from objective, and if there were an avenue I would question your authority to suggest AfDs. But, in an odd twist of fate, there is none. Your assumptions (1) Assume Bad, (2) Are completely wrong, and (3) demonstrate the level of personal bias you have shown so far. Delete the article if you wish, but at least do your homework instead of all this conjecture. Any response to this should start with, "I'm Sorry" and should end with, "I won't make these sort of assumptions again".

<p>As the topic of the article, I cannot and should not vote. I will point out that this article has been edited, and that for a judgement to be formed the entire history of this page should be considered. Informal mediation (see my talk page) has suggested that I disengage. This is what I am doing at this time - from the Wikipedia, completely. I do not feel contribution here can be done by myself at this time. Again, look at the history of this page. If this note disappears, it will reappear. My comments are on record.

<dd><small>I'm not going to get into an edit war over it, but it's common practice to remove discusion which is not related to the article. For instance, if we're just talking about whether the nom is in bad faith or not, that's not relevant to the article placed up for deletion. There are many AfD discussions that are like that.

But I don't even know why porn stars have a different test for notability. They should go through the same test as everybody else. Some porn stars are unquestionably notable and ought to stay, but if many porn stars do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, it just reflects how notable they are in the real world. WP is not a porn directory, and the notability of porn stars should not be measured in terms of how notable they are in the <i>porn industry</i>. Their notability should be measured in terms of how notable they are in mainstream society. That being said, she's never won any awards, and 16 videos which your average person doesn't even know about and a spread in some random porno mag definitely does not make this particular person notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 22:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> I have fought before for this article and brought it back from the dead once. The only thing going agaisnt this is the lack of sources. But, I think that is due in part ot language barriers and restraints involving tech. communication. This article does stress the importance of humanitarian aide, and that seems notable. One of the claims is that he helped 500 patients in one day, I question the exact number, but it's pretty well infered that he assisted a great deal of people. It's really hard to keep a record of humnatarian aide, but if we have an article on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Farmer_7ba1.html" title="Paul Farmer">Paul Farmer</a>, I think this could stay up.

<dd>I thank you for offering the extension.

I found proof of Sinha's existance and death. I can't find all the proof necessary to prove some of the claims. The creator of the article left a message on the talk page, and I've tried to get in contact with him but to no avail. So, I'm withdrawing and going to a no vote.

If you believe the article is superfluous than maintain the gender-neutral perspective on the main Revan page. However this article will be backed up and reposted. If Wikipedia is to be neutral, it should maintain either the gender-neutrality or allow this page to stay up. Anyone can post on wikipedia--if the article is about a non-canonical character, that does not mean that it's content is superfluous. If the content offends you, then you have a choice not to go to it.NOTE: I do find it offensive that you deleted the portions of the post that indicated how the article was different: The Mandy War Section is different, the Revan as Padawan Section is different, the vast majority of this page, content wise, is different.

<li>The fact that this is a fictional character has nothing to do with the AfD, and threatening to willingly violate Wikipedia policy isn't an especially good idea. The problem is that the Star Wars canon, which is what is most important in this issue, states that Revan is male <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Revan#Gender" class="external autonumber" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Revan#Gender" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=420#11839253" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&amp;start=420#11839253" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Hence, Revan (in the Wikipedia article) should be referred to as male, with an aside about the possibility of him being female. Wikipedia's neutrality has no bearing on this issue. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so basically you're saying if someone wants to look up information specifically on a Female Revan, you're saying that the main article is sufficient? Look at the difference between the articles There are parts of the male character article that have no reference whatsoever including the height for the listing, that was why the hieght listing was changed for both the female character listing and the male. Again, no reference added for that. At least merge the information between both articles to at least maintain accuracy. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarShadow_4a87.html" title="User:StarShadow">User:StarShadow</a></p>
<p>I disagree Starshadow. Revan is Revan is Revan. Having an extra article is a waste of space. The information about Revan's past is the same, regardless of gender, so what's the problem.Hitokiri Akins</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> this article was the result of multiple people editing accurate content that was added to the Darth Revan page--many of the sections that are in this Female Revan article were at first added on to the Darth Revan page but were ripped out. Now, this artcile was created in order to put inforation up. Again deletion. This isn't neutrality, this is pure censorship. The reason wikipedia doesn't get respect as a source is because this kind of thing happens. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">StarShadow</a> June 9, 2006 18:47 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> Having an article here that states that Revan is supposed to be male, even if it has a section on the option of being female, is NOT neutrality. It's sexism. Female heroes can and do exist. Keep the article up--then, at least, it will be somewhat closer to maintaining the ambiguity of Revan's gender. --DJP 18:54, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> Let's talk about sexism. How many people who voted for deletion page right now are guys? And how many of you are girls? The bias will reveal itself if you simply answer the question, at least if you're not afraid to answer the question. I'm a girl. Putting up that page after I was countlessly deleted was my only offense, that and being insulted.

<dd><b>comment</b> I'm female. I want that article to stay partially because I'm a feminist girl-gamer, but also because there are people who might need the reference material. If you're going to delete this page, you'll have to delete the original Darth Revan page as well. Or add a section to it on the female option in the game that is of equal length to the male one: the section they have now is pitifully small compared to the rest of the article that has Revan as male. --DJP 19:14, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> I've read this article and the other Darth Revan article. This one is well written and well researched as well as offers the female perspective of the character. The game this character originated in was designed to allow the player to choose the gender and to allow a distinct and seperate story line for each gender. To be fair to the players and creators of Knight of the Old Republic, this article or one similar should be allowed to tell the female side of the game. --LanaRevanStar 19:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep it While "canon" claims the character is male, a cruise through KOTOR fanfics and discussion boards indicate a strong following that holds the "heretic" view and hotly disagrees with Lucasarts. Over 85% of KOTOR fanfic depicts the character as a woman, despite the "canonization," or gender of the player. Also, articles on a Male Revan omit the references to gender neutrality and the female-only content. Perhaps it should go to Wookieepedia, but full-blown omission is a bad idea. Multiple attempts have been made to add the female game path perspective to the "standard" page; attempts that have met with hostility and deletion. If Wilkipedia's going to have KOTOR and Star Wars entries, then the controversy <b>must</b> be addressed.Allronix 19:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)[[

<dd>Well since I cant vote for it either way, I'll ask this: Why is there a need to delete this entry when it doesnt impede or invalidate the MaleRev article on Wookiepedia? Is it so wrong to want a FemRevan entry source? To be fair, if your going to delete this entry, take down the MaleRevan article as well. Or merge both of these together, along with all the baggage Lucasarts created over the issue, that way we can all be one happy KOTOR family again.

<dd>This is quite obviously sexism. Notice how a LARGE portion of the people saying that it should be deleted are men? The Darth Revan page was edited BEYOND recognition just to say that Revan was MALE. This page should balance out the idiocy put on the Darth Revan page. And just because George Lucas says that it's canon doesn't mean that it goes. Lucas can't write any good lines for the fricking movies (remember Padme and Anakin in Episode III?), so I don't think he gets a say in what Revan is gonna be. There's a reason Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG game: So people can customize their character, from gender to type of Jedi. No one can give us the "We don't need two Revan articles" bull because it's obvious that it's the word FEMALE before the word Revan that's giving everyone the problems. Female Revan is as much of a valid character as Male Revan is. And whoever said that it DOES affect the storyline - how so? I don't see that much of a difference. FEMALE Revan defeats Malak the same way MALE Revan does. I say this is unfair and that the article should be either kept or merged with the existing Male Revan one. It's not like a Female Revan article is going to overstep the other one. Besides, women need a chance to shine in Star Wars. Notice how Luke and Han and Obi-wan and Qui-Gon are ALL men, along with Ulic and Exar Kun? The only three women that have big names are Ayla Secura, Leia, and Shaak Ti, and they don't even get the attention of most people who have only seen the movies. Does someone have a PROBLEM with forcing it to stay that way? If so, give me some really good reasons for it.I don't really care if someone places Revan as male of female because that's ridiculous. As I mentioned before, KotOR is an RPG. It's supposed to be customized by the player. One side has as much meaning as the other. My gripe is with the people who say that Wiki has room only for one Revan. Think carefully. The person who wrote this article spent a lot of time, as I've heard mentioned. Would anyone want to throw that away just because someone thinks that having articles for Male and Female Revan is ridiculous? DelasaerChval 20:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is my final post here. None of the people who posted there were sock puppets, they were people however who were upset at having the page deleted and decided to post. Many of them are first times posters. Every time the Darth Revan page has been edited to reflect the gender-neutral story, it has been shamelessly edited and the content destroyed. That is far from objective. Before considering the deletion of this page, consider that no one put it up for deletion until now. Consider also looking through the history of the Darth Revan page and seeing how many times a user has tried to edit the page to reflect the gender-neutrality page before it was written over. Also consider how many of the people who have posted here for the deletion of this page are, in fact male, and have edited the male Revan page how many times. It seems, that this article is not being considered for deletion on it's strenghts or weaknesses, but it is simply an affront by those who feel offended by a female version of a gender-neutral character, although the article specifically states the inconsistency within Canon, while the other article does not. The Darth Revan article not only is incomplete compared to the Female Revan article's sections, specifically on the Mandalorian Wars and the references to Mando'a, but it is far less thorough. It does not, detailed with regards to Revan's upbringing, it is not detailed with regards to mythological influences. And furthermore, for fan creation, it is little more than what the Darth Revan page is. Of course, I'm probably going to get edited on this edition anyway. But I ask, what is the point of putting information if people simply will delete it? What is the point of having an encyclopedia if it will not tell the whole story, just only what one side of the fans want to read. As a practice it is wrong and unethical on a number of different levels. Just as far is it is from objective. None of these people tried to participate in the imput of the Female Revan character article, as I have tried with the Darth Revan article. They haven't even posted comments on the comments page. Looking over this page suggests that most of them haven't even read teh article in its entirety before voting for a deletion. Is that fair from the perspective of those who want an online encyclopedia? The reaction itself indicates that those who want this page deleted are unwilling to have any other truth or version of this character except that which reflects their page. No one asked for their page to be deleted. And it should be noted that the administrator to asked this page to be deleted reverted to unnecessary name calling in the editing of the page. If he is truly objective, then who can say that the people who are writing in and calling for the deletion of this page are not his buddies as well, except they have posted longer. To be fair, none of the other people who have written on the Female Revan site have posted either, and doubtless they will have their say too. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">StarShadow</a> June 9th, 23:17 (UTC).</dd>

<p>This article is too biased, and it is poorly formatted, to the point that I believe that it is a lost cause. For example, the following line is of concern to me: "The academic program holds a strong reputation". I'll ask but one question, WHO'S OPINION IS IT THAT THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM IS GOOD? There is no indication as to where this 'strong reputation' originated. Also, the article is badly formatted, and feels more like dot points. If a proper article cannot be produced, none at all deserves to be on this site. I vote for <b>STRONG DELETE</b> 19748 08:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I belive that what I'm doing is called 'meatpuppetry' and that there is nothing wrong with it. All these people are fighters. I don't know them personally, but we intend to sweep through wikipedia purging it of all its greivances and blemishes. we are the purifiers, and we have banded together. As for the user page scandal devised by Cvene64 to bring us down, we want to use other's templates only, to further our pages. There is no law against that, but we haven't yet started to change the pages to our own designs because of this little scandal. Wikipedia states that you must not assume that a person is a sock puppet before you assume that they are a meatpuppet which is a group of people who combine to bring a page down. These are not single use accounts. We are all new here, and we are in a group so that we can defend ourselves from people who are out to be a detriment. We intend to grow and expand our horizons on this site, but this is our first crusade. We will purify the site of this page.

<li><b>STRONG Delete</b> Brothers of purification, I agree with this crusade. The purgatory must be enacted. NUM QUAM POSTEA! No more will this article blemish the site. My other brothers have jumped the gun and told you they want it to be deleted. Let me outline WHY:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1. The article is clearly bias. There is no doubt about it.</li>
<li>2. The article looks like a note point summary of some kind. Wikipedia IS NOT about note point summaries.</li>
<li>3. The populous are accusing the BP (Brotherhood of Purification) of not acting and changing the article. As Brother Shaanxiquake said, we know nothing about the school! I am from Bahrain! Why doesn't the populous change the article? Let me guess, the article is incorrect so this AFD was instigated. Now everyone in the populous is going to argue to bring the BP down, saying that the BP should fix the page. When the AFD is finally removed, the article WILL NOT HAVE CHANGED ONE BIT, and it will continue to be a blemish. The BP is bringing forward incredibly valid points. If no one will fix the article, it must by neutralized. The site must be purified.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is in this vein that I call all the bretheren of the Brotherhood of Purification (the number is growing) to merge as one and yet retain their unique individuality, to bring down this pathetic page which obviously has some sort of fan base from the school itself. Don't pretend you weren't from the school, populous! I've looked at members' of the populous userpages, and they mention this school as part of their education! This is obviously some sort of school push, but it will not be tolerated. Wikipedia does not accept people FROM THE SCHOOL spreading lies and deceptions, or even more importantly defending an article worthy of nothing. The Brotherhood of Purification will see to it that this pathetic display is neutralized forever, because it serves no purpose and people continually whine for others to fix it, and no one does. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurification_41db.html" title="User:Purification">Purification</a> 09:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> . UBopp 01:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC) Unless Wikipedia is instituting across-the-board censorship policies, there can be no argument for deleting this article without advocating a major reduction of freedom of speech as it is permitted in the rules of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>, <i>"...freedom of speech as it is permitted in the rules of Wikipedia"</i>? Sorry, there is no inherent "freedom of speech" on Wikipedia, or any other website for that matter. Deleting this article would not violate "freedom of speech" if you are referring to your constitutional rights (presuming you are American), because the 1st Amendment only guarantee's that the government will not abridge your right to "free speech". It says nothing about the media, or society at large, moderating you, I, or anyone else. Just ask the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Chicks_777c.html" title="Dixie Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a>... Besides, Jimbo's executive actions on some articles Brian Peppers should be proof enough that there is no absolute "freedom of speech" on Wikipedia; all articles are subject to removal by executive action if Jimbo et. al. deem it so. But, enough of a civics lesson for today... If you are speaking about <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> that may occur by deleting this entry, you may have a point. In that case though it would be beneficial for anyone with the opinion of "Keep" to post some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources proving that this individual meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The criteria in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> are clearly not met, or no mention of their being met is made. I also wonder precisely why there are so very many "strong keep" votes, which are otherwise rather rare, by so many users who are either anonymous or lacking userpages? Having investigated as much during the writing of this comment, I have found that a few of them are extremely new, with very few edits. I have nothing against new users, mind you, but could some be sock puppets? Ubopp, for instance, has made all of one edit - to this page. Mtxoracle has made only one edit to article space and two to this page. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> 23:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> criterion the <i>keep</i> "votes" are being cast under would apparently be #8, <i>notable performer in niche</i>, where "gay porn" is the niche. Again, I'm not "voting" one way or the other, but I would really appreciate if someone who does know about the niche state what specifically makes him notable in the niche. Note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28erotic_actors%29_1be2.html#Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (erotic actors)">this specific issue</a> (that 100 films was probably too high for gay erotic actors) was the very first comment on WP:PORN BIO. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: If the article can be cleaned up and actual information (other than physical attributes, etc.) can be uploaded, then Matthew Rush is a good candidate for keeping around. Mr. Rush's career, according to the aforementioned proposed outline for adult film stars that <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> alluded to, is a valid Wikipedia entry. He won an AVN (Gayvn Award to be specific) award in 2002 for Best Newcomer, and as it has been mentioned before, he has what seems to be an exclusive "lifetime" contract with the higest-grossing gay film company in the country. If any of the editors who have voted "strong keep" can update this information, it might be worth it in the long run.<a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverdrive10_c173.html" title="User:Overdrive10">Overdrive10</a> 04:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Matthew Rush is definitely among the more notable porn stars in the industry, due to his appearance in high-profile Falcon films and in the touring play.

<li><b>Retain.</b> Themadmac An organization with roughly 200 members in a community hardly seems 'non-notable' to me, and the article's lack of amendment by third parties seems to me to be indicative of its quality rather than KriZe's perception. By the logic that pages regarding matches played in the future are reason for deleting main articles, Wikipedia's entries for the National Football League and several other sports organizations, at various levels pro and amateur, should be deleted as well. And to answer your question, KriZe, YES, the league's games and the organization's events have received periodic coverage both locally and nationally - most notably in 2004 when the organization's founders were covered by Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, and other publications. Besides, I always thought Wikipedia was about [u]adding[/u] information, not selectively deleting it.</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Thomasjmarshall The article may be borrowed from their website, but its still informational and should be kept.</li>

<li>The Bank of Montreal is probably supporting it <i>because</i> its CEO is one of the co-founders, but its founder doesn't make it notable (do we even have an article on the CEO of the Bank of Montreal?) --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 07:57, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That may very well be true, but the fact remains that a CEO answers to a board of directors and the bank approved support for the programme.

<p>I came to Wiki looking for info on this rather obscure but interesting company. I saw that the existing article had been proposed for deletion, and admittedly it was pretty useless (seemingly copied from marketing collateral). So I decided to try and make it a little better. Google revealed a couple of previously published stories, one in Crain's New York Business (Jan 27, 2003) and another in the Wall Street Journal (December 3, 2004). There was also a useful answer posted on Ask MetaFilter (<a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/16697" class="external free" title="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/16697" rel="nofollow">http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/16697</a>), which actually had much better info than Wiki. I hope the additional info improves the article, but it would be useful to have more recent info (which I don't have).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Telematique (<a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelematique_c0e5.html" title="User talk:Telematique">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Telematique_02c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Telematique">contribs</a>) 14:45, June 9, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> - see main article. There is enough criterion to differentiate it from other <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> web sites. It played a major role in the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> and to this day is one of the most frequented web sites in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a>. If web sites such as DVDR are listed, then this should definitely be listed. There are NO other wrestling forums that have gained as much of a cult following as TSM and crossed over to mainstream as much as it has. They became so well known that they had to close signups for a long time because there were so many people signing up who were not living up to the expected standard---whatever that be (and actually signups still may be closed for all I know). Anyway, the subject of this entry is totally notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.171.203.233 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.171.203.233_6630.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.171.203.233">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is not something that wiki needs. It is a boring entry for a rather boring website. Seeing this kind of stuff at wiki almost gives people the message that anything they find remotely interesting is worth putting up at wiki. That should not be the case. Especially for something like a website that barely exists and whose claim to fame, if it ever had one to begin with, was years ago.

<li><b>Delete</b>: This website isn't notable by the usual <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standards, but within the community it serves might be notable. The question then becomes whether individual sites within a notable online community are notable based on their association with the community. I would say not per Rory's comment above about association not transferring notability. This has interesting parallels to the discussion about the MetaWiki article below.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 07:33, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's a good question. I'd have to say that since Wikipedia is a general interest encyclopedia, than notability within a community does not mean it's notable enough for Wikipedia. That's a whole other debate though. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 13:11, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - as it stands, virtually every "keep" vote is either insisting that the website is one of the most popular wrestling websites (no proof has been offered for this claim, though) or by arguing that the website deserves an article if the "Death Valley Driver Video Review" website deserves an article. This is not a reasonable argument, as the Death Valley Driver Video Review article has been nominated for deletion three times to date due to a lack of notability. Wikipedia should not be a staging ground for a series of juvenile "forum wars". <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 12:06, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Its Alexa ranking is 85,000 which is way more than RajahWWF.com. If that's not a reasonable argument then neither is that "its a boring entry for a rather boring web site." Tons of proof has been offered about its notability, including that it was one of the leaders of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Wrestling_Community_cc98.html" title="Internet Wrestling Community">Internet Wrestling Community</a> boom; the only problem is that many people such as you are unwilling to achknowledge the arguments that have been fully established for it to stay.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 12:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But 85,000 is far, far higher than 411mania (25,777), wrestlingobserver.com (26,543) and pwtorch.com (21,819). The website in question is clearly not one of the more popular wrestling websites on the Internet, as there are similar websites with 60,000 more visitors. Moreover, the (dubious) argument that the website was central to the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_wrestling_community.html" title="Internet wrestling community">Internet wrestling community</a> is of little merit, as that article has also been proposed for deletion in the past. The same is true of your above claim that Scott Keith has an article, so the article should remain - the Scott Keith article has also been proposed for deletion in the past. This website is in no sense notable, and the fact that it influenced or was frequented by similar pseudo-notable article subjects should not save it from being deleted. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 20:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is entirely invalid. There is a very good reason why there is a deletion <b>process</b> here on Wikipedia. If there were'nt, anybody could just delete an entry they didn't like, but because there is a process, the deletion must be approved in advance. Your argument relies on the assumption that just because an article was proposed for deletion in the past, it isn't notable, which is ridiculous.<a href="../../../j/b/1/User%7EJB196_2243.html" title="User:JB196">JB196</a> 19:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've basically argued for why she is not notable. 32 videos and nomination (didn't even win?) by some unknown French magazine is what I would call NOT notable, even by porn standards. As far as number of videos and awards go, the proposed <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN_BIO</a> requires at least 100 videos or <i>winning</i> (not just being nominated) an award given by a major porn organisation. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:08, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The keyword about WP:PORN BIO is <i>proposed</i>.&#160;:-) As I mentioned in another AfD, it is far more strict than the treatment that regular actors get on AfD. If you're a regular actor and have an IMDb entry with two or three minor parts with brief screentime listed, you have a very good shot at being kept on AfD. If your only role is an occasionally reoccuring character on any TV show, no matter how low rated, you have an excellent chance at being kept. As far as the magazine being "unknown", I don't know. It could be well known in France. Also, if she was even nominated for the most recognizable adult actress award, it seems like she would have had to have been considered very well known. Other awards, like best performer and such could have relatively unknown people, but it wouldn't make sense to have anyone non-notable nominated for that award. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know why you'd think regular actors have less strict criteria for keeping. The difference is in the movies themselves. Regular movies, especially ones with national or international distribution, are more notable than any one of the porn movies that most of these porn stars have been in. By extension, of course regular actors are usually more notable than porn stars. Having a minor role in, for example, <i>Da Vinci Code</i>, is going to be more notable than being the star of, for example, <i>Teen Pussy #1</i> through <i>Teen Pussy #15</i>. Now if this particular porn star or any other porn star had minor roles in regular movies, that would make them notable. It's not how many movies they've been in or how many magazine spreads they've done. It's the <i>kind of</i> movies they've been in and the <i>kind of</i> magazines they've been in. These movies and magazines are not notable. That's the problem. It's the same thing with any other kinds of professions. You can take, for example, a computer programmer that has written several hundreds of programs, he wouldn't be as notable as the guy that wrote, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winamp.html" title="Winamp">Winamp</a>, if the programs he wrote are not themselves notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 04:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Crissy Moran is quite prevalent in online porn. You see her everywhere, even in MySpace adds for dating websites. Her career is a testament to the power of the web where she might not have movie exposure like other porn stars (by her own choice I might add) but she is still as well known. Sablestorm 08:30, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There are adult actresses on here that are far less notable, yet their pages are still up. The reason Crissy doesn't have tons of videos is because she has moved away from doing hardcore scenes, she said so on her forums. She has done photoshoots with popular models, she has shot with highly-regarded photographers, and her site receives tons of hits every day. She may not get the type of exposure that others get because of her lack of boy/girl scenes, but she is clearly one of the most beautiful women in the adult industry. She is completely underrated by so many people. When I see some of the other pages for pornstars that remain un-deleted, I can't believe this one is even being considered. One more point, the major adult website Twisty's named her "Twisty's Treat of the Month" this year. That sounds pretty special. She also recently did a shoot hor Hustler, and she is being considered for the front cover. The article for on here is also horrible. It hasn't been updated in forever with some of her recent accomplishments. The article does not do justice to her at all and needs to be rewritten by someone with a deep knowledge of her career.--71.246.103.73 13:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Satisfies WP:PORN per "Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche." The niche is internet pin-up. Similar to <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Margolis_3eb7.html" title="Cindy Margolis">Cindy Margolis</a> (though substantially less notable), Crissy is notable not for her presence in videos, but for her photo shoots. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 21:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page is entirely POV, and entirely un-encyclopedic. The author, Dalereynolds, has in the past few days made a number of edits, all of which have been commercial links for Dorinha Wear. A jeans brand is an acceptable subject for an article, but the article as it is is unacceptable.

<p>This band article was tagged for speedy deletion, but the band contains members of other, notable bands, so I'm listing here to get consensus. I'm unsure whether or not this band passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUS_d39c.html" title="WP:MUS">WP:MUS</a>, or whether material should be merged.

<li><b>Keep</b> Defintely passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUS_d39c.html" title="WP:MUS">WP:MUS</a> for several reasons: 1. Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network (#3 most added on CMJ), 2. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable (Thursday's last album has sold over 400,000 units! If that isn't notable, then what is?), 3. Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture (All Music Guide, Amplifier Magazine, Big Takeover, Lost At Sea, etc..etc...) 63.163.57.36 01:43, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>... Everyone commenting except the author and one anon feel it's a delete. But there aren't very many commenters, so I looked into it myself to substantiate the claims made. This article seems to suffer confusion whether it's about a concept or a website. As a concept, there do seem to be some citations of it, and it's published elsewhere. But it's pretty clear the author of the papers that were published is the author of the article, and the cites aren't very deep. So it fails based on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No original research</a> grounds. As a site, it is almost unnoticable, and fails the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web notability tests</a>. SO, it looks like a delete to me. If the author and has made other significant contributions to Wikipedia other than this area, and wants it userified, I'd do that for them. But it's a delete, no doubt about it in my mind. Something tells me there will be a fair bit of inward cleaning to do, too. --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:03, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(1) This research has been published outside of wikipedia (see refs). Bizzare? This is your POV. (2) Reference to Alexa rating doesn't support your claim. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_internet.html" title="Alexa internet">Alexa</a> estimates some share of the traffic of a website. This share is created by a sample of users who chose to install <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_toolbar.html" title="Alexa toolbar">Alexa toolbar</a> on their computers.

<p><b>Del</b> A chaotic essay (on language dissemination) that does not define the term, unreferenced, obscure language. Example: <i>Outside of polysemic distinctions to indicate the sense of a word, we have a dissemination that is ongoing and escapes the univocality of any attempt to indicate a definite semantic from its polysemia</i>. May be I am lazy, but some google search for "dissemination of language" and "language dissemination" did not reveal anything phylosophical. I suggest other voters to observe some diligence.

<p>This page is completely original research and self-reference. To meet Wikipedia's policies, this article should not be included unless notable media sources have covered it and those articles can be cited. So assuming that doesn't happen, this article should either be <b>deleted</b> or moved to the Wikipedia namespace.

<li><b>The alexa rank of metawiki is not 600</b>. Alexa considers *.wikimedia.org to be the same site, so for example all traffic to *commons* is included in that number. Also, upload.wikimedia.org is included, so it's an excersise for the reader to determine why wikimedia.org doesn't have a rank as high as wikipedia itself. Metawiki is actually very low traffic. I'd highly doubt that it would cross the 100,000th point on Alexa by itself. The varrious funraisers logos and such which are pulled from wikimedia.org sites by the wikipedias are what causes a lot of this number.

<dd>If the entity is notable then it shouldn't be difficult to find notable (not some random Wikipedian/Wikimedian's blog) non-Wikipedia sources to verify everything that's discussed in the article. But I really don't think that Meta-Wiki is an encyclopedically notable site. It's notable to Wikipedia, but not so much to the general public (which is what the Wikipedia namespace is for). And since as far as we know it hasn't been reported on in any notable source, anything that anyone writes there is gonna be ORIGINAL RESEARCH from their experience with Wikipedia/Wikimedia. On the other hand, if a newspaper was to interview a Wikipedian and report on it, then we could turn around and write about it and cite them. That's at least supposedly the standard for the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, but for some reason those rules are being ignored for all the peripheral Wikimedia-related articles. And it violates NPOV for Wikipedia to hold its own projects to a different standard than those of others. So for all those reasons, it's pretty clear it should be deleted from Wikipedia (and moved to a Wikipedia namespace project page if need be). <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The analogy fails. If Wikipedia is the building, Meta-Wiki is at best the scaffolding, not the architect. Theory of relativity is to Albert Einstein as Wikipedia is to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, not to Meta-Wiki. "Meta-things" do not automatically inherit the notability of the things themselves; there is no stipulation on Wikipedia's notability or verifiability guidelines saying such, and common sense suggests that "notability isn't inherited" is indeed a correct and necessary thing to keep in mind in this situation, just as much as it is for any other ("a certain lavatory of the White House" does not inherit the notability of "the White House").

The notability of an article must be established <i>in its own right</i>: simply saying "Meta-Wiki must be noteworthy because Wikipedia is noteworthy" is weak reasoning. If it's as notworthy as you imply, it should be fantastically easy to find reputable sources galore to add to the article, and then the issue will be settled.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think as Wikia gets larger wikimedia will become much more important. Further Meta wiki has articles on wikipedia philosophy and their are frequent questions on that topic from outside. Nicholas Carr for example has written on these sorts of issues about a dozen times.

<dd>Quite sad. The keep proponents here originally said that it met the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Myself and others showed that it clearly does not. Many then claimed that it should be kept in spite of this due to an allegedly high Alexa rank. But we showed that this rank was inaccurate because it shares its domain name with the much higher traffic Wikimedia Commons. So now that there's apparently no good argument left for defending inclusion on its own merit, <s>they've</s> some of them have turned to character assassination and completely baseless allegations of bad faith. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 17:38, 12 June 2006 (UTC) Note correction - I was a bit haphazard when I originally wrote the comment above, so just to clarify, my criticism was never intended for those who simply have an honest difference of opinion, but for those who have made ad hominem attacks - specifically User:GeorgeStepanek above and User:Computerjoe when he prematurely closed the debate on the basis of similar allegations, which were overturned - see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=57976420#Wikimedia_Meta-Wiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=57976420#Wikimedia_Meta-Wiki" rel="nofollow">Deletion Review</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 20:07, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps, but his point is valid.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think anyone who has become involved this discussion is seriously contemplating the complete removal of the information from this site. The question is rather: what would the best place for this material? In it's own article? Merged into another article? In the Wikipedia namespace? Maybe a merge and redirect is the best option, but <b>merge and redirect do not require an AFD.</b> At the very most one would start a discussion on the relevant talk page—and possibly not even that. Suggesting that the article should be merged or moved is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but <i>creating the AFD in the first place</i> looks very much like it. Why go through this whole process—and face all this argument, dissent and controversy—if you don't have to? It only makes sense if the real motive <i>is</i> to generate controversy and dissent. I stand by my comment, and my vote. This AFD should be disposed of, and the discussion taken to the article's talk page, where it belongs. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepan</a><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_Esperanza_f30c.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek/Esperanza"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">k</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 08:02, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'd say individual Wikimedia projects are "automatically" notable, "duh," (quotes added for self-sarcasm), though individual <i>subprojects</i> (e.g., specific language versions of Wikipedia) may need to be evaluated according to their accomplishments and popularity, and may need to be merged to appropriate subarticle. Can't really <i>hurt</i> to have a separate article for Meta, that's all I'm saying. Perhaps merge later if that's necessary. Either way, should be kept in some form. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
