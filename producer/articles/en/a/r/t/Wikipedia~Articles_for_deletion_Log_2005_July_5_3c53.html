<li><b>Comment</b> - the copyright notice isn't invalid. Submitters always retain copyright, they just agree to license their work under the GFDL.

<li><b>Reply to comment</b> - Apoliogies if that is true. And, if true, then the only remaining problem is with the policy on autobiographies/vanity edits.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ranks #8,872 on Amazon. A pretty high number compared to some we see. Seems notable. Info is from his website, but he is the author, so if he puts it here he is releasing it. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> 5 July 2005 16:56 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Generally I would prefer to see someone other than the subject himself start a biographical article but once the article exists, I think the same notability standards should apply without regard to how the article began. Here, I think he is notable and the informations is verifiable, so i would keep the article. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 5 July 2005 18:52 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm voting because I'm an end user who hoped there would be an entry for him on Wikipedia. I saw several references to him in some consciousness studies literature, and looked him up to get a better idea of who he is. So he is notable enough that a Dean Radin entry could be more than a vanity entry. If this is deemed a vanity entry just because it's an autobio, keep it unless there's something comparable written by a 3rd party. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStripmind_904d.html" title="User:Stripmind">stripmind</a> 5 July 2005

<li><b>Keep</b>, as this person is somewhat notable, passes my <a href="../../../b/a/j/Bajoran_wormhole.html" title="Bajoran wormhole">Bajoran wormhole</a> test. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipolicy</a> doesn't preclude notable persons from writing NPOV articles on themself. Adding more info to this should be easily done, as we can contact the Radin if there is something on his website we'd like to use, and he's likely to allow it. It's not customary to write about oneself but about 1 in 3 wikipedians who commented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on the subject oppose any rule against writing about oneself, and there is in fact, no such rule that I am aware of at this point. I think that [[Wikipedia:Criteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies|these criteria}] should apply to this article, and those criteria suggest that [[Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies/Academics|these criteria] specifically apply to academics, as an alternate to notability criteria applied to more mainstream folk. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 2005 July 5 20:04 (UTC)

<li>Move to his userpage if he wants it but <b>delete</b> from the main article space. Based on the available evidence, he is an average academic. A business person with similar experience, exposure and credentials would not generally get an article. (One published book is not, in my opinion, enough to tip the scales to inclusion.) I'll also note that while some did oppose a strict rule against autobiographies, a strong majority supported it. It's not an absolute rule but it's a useful guideline that we should break only as a rare exception. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 6 July 2005 01:32 (UTC)

<li><s>Is this original research?</s> There is no mention of a paradox of this name in any of the quantum mechanics books in our library, nor do any of my colleagues seem to recognize this name. Furthermore, as currently written, the nature of the paradox is obscure, as pointed out by the nominator. Before calling for a <i>delete</i> I would ask the editor to <b>cleanup</b> at least in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Give <b>references</b> to prove that the effect has been described and named before.</li>
<li>Early in the article state <b>exactly</b> what the paradox is.</li>

<dd>Bambaiah, a better name can be found for this article, I am not yet sure of what that better name would be. The first part, about the collapse of a spherical wave function to a single trace in a cloud chamber, is due, I believe to either Wilson, the inventor of the cloud chamber, or one of his contemporaries, maybe Bohr, presumably in the 1920's. The "paradox" is obvious: how does the spherical wave function of a decaying nucleus turn into a straight ray in a cloud chamber? I will try to change the article to state this in an even more straightforward manner. I'm trying to find a reference; as that will then provide the correct name under which this is more commonly known under. You and I have had arguments in the past, and I'm sorry if I insulted your intelligence, but lashing back out with language such as "Is this original research?" is inappropriate and out-of-line. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 06:32, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

I mean this purely as a practical matter: since the effect that is being talked about is not usually known by the name that it has been given, people are unlikely to look for it in a pedia by this phrase.

Its most ardent supporter was also the guy who wrote it, and as yet I could not be certain it is not a spoof as suggested by others. But it is important that this subject be addressed by wiki. It is correctly stating that this is an important class of issue for people to think about, even if they do not know it. Don't know what other related articles exist.

In addition, the phrase itself is basically self-contradictory, as Islam has further inspired the creation of Sikhism and Bahia, so if one is being logically consistent, it would be "Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Sikh-Bahai" if I follow the reasoning. <a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a> July 5, 2005 05:42 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Generating tolerance of Islam, regardless of the merits of that, is surely rather foolish when it undermines intellectual clarity. "Judeo-Christian" is usually used to refer to the tradition that supports and influenced Western morality and law. The influence of Islam in this sphere is minor. I'm all for increased tolerance of Islam, but I don't think we should get that by rewriting history to imagine that the Western Judeo-Christian system carries an equal influence from Islam. However, the fact that this term is PC garbage is irrelevant to this discussion. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 5 18:22 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, you are really quite wrong there. Islam is the only reason we still have many classical texts, such as Plato's republic, and the Elements. Algebra is named after <i><a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Jabr_wa-al-Muqabilah_52d6.html" title="Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah">Al-Jabr</a></i>, and Algorithm is named after <i><a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Khwarizmi_2adf.html" title="Al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a></i>, an Islamic scholar and the text he wrote, such was his contribution to mathematics. And there is a good reason our numbers are called <i>Arabic numerals</i>. The christians burnt the original texts, they were the destroyers there, the texts survive only because copies were preserved by islamic scholars. Likewise all science effectively died under christianity for some one and a half thousand years, it only continued in islam. During the crusades, it was the Christians who persecuted people of other religions, in some places even subjecting them to the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>, and massacres such as the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albigensian_crusade.html" title="Albigensian crusade">Albigensian crusade</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>, Islamic areas merely taxed non-muslims, which was significantly more tolerant. We can't have got such tolerance from the Christians as they had none. N.b. I am not islamic, nor jewish. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 18:28 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I really don't see the relevance of algebra and numerals to systems of morality and law. The contributions made by the Islamic world in science nonwithstanding, the influence of Islamic thought and tradition in shaping Western common and civil law systems and the Western conception of morality -- the contexts in which the term Judeo-Christian is most used by far -- has been minimal. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 5 23:08 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd classify as a hopeless endeavor any effort to cast Islam as less significant to Western thought than its Abrahamic precursors. At a minimum, I think all will agree that Islam has shaped the West by opposition -- Christian thought of the last 1400 years uses Islam as THE anti-model. The moral and legal order of the West would not exist as it does without its favorite antithesis. This is not to disparage Islam -- most Christian criticisms of it in pre-modern times was made in ignorance. To ignore Islam's role in shaping the Western world is as much of a folly as it would be to ignore the Roman role in shaping the early Christian world. And, of course, as above, without the saving grace of Islamic scholars, the Renaissance might well have been impossible. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 6 July 2005 04:12 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>===&gt;<b>Allow me to comment</b> As far as my original statements go, I think that some people here are either ignoring germane evidence, or misreading what I'm saying.</p>
<ul>
<li>"10,300 is not a bad Google total" You're right, but <b>10,200 of them were from the past year</b>. That is precisely what makes it a neologism. Neo=new, and who of us have ever heard this word used in commonday speech, or read it in the newspaper? Until that is the case, it is a neologism. It was not created out of academic or scientific necessity (such as a newly-discovered element, for instance), but rather political jockeying to infer that Islam and its associated culture are as deeply integrated into Western society as Judaism and Christianity's. The contributions those faith traditions have made in art, law, politics, language, and others pale in comparison to Islam's, which are not themselves without merit or worth mentioning. They simply aren't as fundamental. In point of fact, as was described above by Xoloz, the West has been defined as an opposing socio-cultural group versus Islamic society for centuries. This dialectic has been made almost universally by Westerners, Muslims, and third-party objective analysis. I have never in my life read any source, academic or otherwise, that would insinuate the histories of those two large social categories are intimately intertwined in the same way that Jewish and Christian culture have been. The assertion is untenable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"language like "PC garbage" and "Islamic apologist" has no place in deletion nominations" I certainly don't see why not. I'm building a case against the inclusion of this article in a (virtual) encyclopedia, and my main complaint is that it is politically-motivated (PC) and it is certainly not NPOV (garbage). The objection to the term "Islamic apologist" puzzles me: several of these sites were, in fact, apologetic in nature, in favor of defending Islam. I would imagine the authors themselves would claim the same. There is certainly no reason to disregard a site simply becuase it is an Islamic apologetic source (in fact, I referenced one in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html#The_Tanakh_and_the_Protestant.2C_Roman_Catholic.2C_and_Eastern_Orthodox_Old_Testaments" title="Books of the Bible">this article</a>, since it had a good overview of objective information), <b>but</b> the motivation of the authors in using this term is clearly to pursue a political agenda, rather than present objective fact. Since they are using this neologism for non-academic purposes, their use as justification for keeping this article is suspect at best.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It's good that tolerance of Islam is still regarded as PC garbage. It would be horrid if people became "tolerant" to all religions, wouldn't it?" The reason that I put "tolerant" in quotes here is not because I desire intolerance, but rather, the word itself is used in a politically-motivated context, and has significantly different meanings to different people using it in the same discussion. Since "tolerance" can mean anything from embracing, to accepting, to simply not discriminating against (and discrimination is <b>also</b> vague word of this type), it is a vague word in regards to "religious tolerance". I'm not actually advocating any kind of attitude toward Islam or Muslims at all, and I'm not critical of any attitude toward that worldview either. My criticism is directed toward the kind of political manipulation and thought-control implied in trying to shoehorn Islam into a category of influence where it simply does not belong. As with all immense social groups ("Pacific Islanders", "Sub-Saharan Africa", etc.), the cultural traditions that exist today are the product of interaction with several other such cultures. None of us would argue that black, urban America have influenced American culture, which is itself a large component of current Western culture, but the traditions of the past 70 years of black, urban culture pale in comparison to centuries of deeply-ingrained thought produced by Judaism and Christianity. There is no need to overlook or discredit the impact of Islam on Western society, but certainly no need to inflate it, either, unless there are some kinds of ulterior motives at work. It is a knee-jerk reaction to perceived criticism of Islam, like below:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"During the crusades, it was the Christians who persecuted people of other religions, in some places even subjecting them to the Inquisition, and massacres such as the Albigensian crusade, and blood libel, Islamic areas merely taxed non-muslims, which was significantly more tolerant." This has nothing to do with anything. The user here goes from extolling the virtues of Islamic society and its contributions to the West (<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">including citing Arabic numerals, which were a product of Indian, pre-Islamic society, and were only exported to the West due to the efforts of an Italian</a>) to an historical criticism of Western, Christian society. You can harbor and express any discontent you have with Western Christianity, but how is it relevant to this discussion? It's not. This mini-diatribe is precisely the sort of knee-jerk reaction I mentioned above. Nowhere in my description am I critical of Islamic society, and there is no justification in terms of this vote for criticizing Christian society either. It's entirely out of place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"His suggestion for a "logically consistent" expanded neologism is highly flawed -- Islam has 800 years more history and 600 million more followers than Sikhism, as well as a much more extensive involvement in Western history." Of course, but this isn't merely a numbers game - Sikhism has more followers than Judaism, and Zoroastrianism has existed for approxiametly as long, but neither has any definable significance in Western culture. Islam does play a larger role in the historical shaping of Western society, but it is much smaller than Judaism and Christianity's by far. This is exactly the point that I'm making. Also, I find it highly doubtful this term was invented by Antonin Scalia. <a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a> 03:48, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>My only reply to your comment is that, as you consider "Islamic Apologists" to be "PC", so I consider those who characterize Islam as insignificant in Western History to be "PC." The term is incredibly subjective -- you're entitled to use it as you like, but (as the criticism you garnered suggests) I would submit that such language does not aid in fostering a consensus. Typically, dispassionate language builds consensus more easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I question your assertion that calling something "garbage" is equivalent to calling it "POV." Clearly, much value can come from "POV" works, e.g. any religious text. POV works do not belong here, but that does not make them "garbage". I think the word "garbage" upset many readers. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 07:31, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I simply don't see how the argument is even relevant. I don't see the phrase as stating that Christianity is as close to Islam as it is to Judaism. As the article says, "it is used when referring to something shared by all Abrahamic religions." Even if one generally has need to refer to such things less frequently than one has need to refer to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeo-Christian_b255.html" title="Judeo-Christian">things shared by only two of the religions</a>, it can nonetheless still be encyclopedic. I put no stock in most of the links being "within the last year" because 1) even a recently coined phrase would be encyclopedic if it has caught on sufficiently; the date is not realy the point, 2) web pages are very fleeting by nature, so I'd imagine this statement is true of many Google searches, and 3) I don't even trust Google's "dates" for webpages anyway, I have no clue what they're based on. And yes, if your objection is "that it is politically-motivated and it is certainly not NPOV", then SAYING that instead of "PC garbage" and "apologists" would be a really good idea. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 17:28, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The 737-225 and 737-233 are not actual aircraft, so they should not be merged. The others should be merged or place on a Boeing 737-200 first tier customer list.

Just because Air Canada owned them doesn't mean that they get renumbered Boeing customer numbers (see the book <i>Boeing Aircfaft from 1916</i> by Peter Bowers for a complete explination). I have spent about 10 minutes going over the 737-200 production list and there are not any 737-233s or 737-225s, for that matter.

<p>It's an organization, it's a magazine, it's a website . . . but when I start to examine what this is about, it just seems to be a magazine that took two years to prepare and of which a grand total of one (1) issue has appeared, backed up by a tremendously inoffensive/vague mission statement and a website that merely serves to advertise the magazine (and whose content has been plagiarized/recycled for this article). But perhaps I'm missing something here. Right now, however, no other WP article is linked from it or to it. I'd suggest zapping this until either (a) half a dozen issues of this magazine have come out or (b) any issue of the magazine gets itself in the news. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> July 5, 2005 06:16 (UTC) <i>....

<li><b>Comment cum clarification cum revised proposal</b>: I hadn't heard that there was an Iggy Pop song with this title, but I'm not surprised to learn that the title is used elsewhere. Since there was no article for the film <i><a href="../../../r/e/p/Professione%7E_reporter.html" title="Professione: reporter">Professione: reporter</a></i> when I looked yesterday, I wondered if there was one for its anglophone title, <i>The Passenger</i>. It was thus that I landed on this article. I subsequently started <i><a href="../../../r/e/p/Professione%7E_reporter.html" title="Professione: reporter">Professione: reporter</a></i> and thought I might turn <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Passenger_7b22.html" title="The Passenger">The Passenger</a> into a redirect. Thinking that that might be construed as vandalism, I refrained. Rather than dragging <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo_Antonioni_3ecc.html" title="Michelangelo Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a> into the conversation, I thought I'd recommend zapping <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Passenger_7b22.html" title="The Passenger">The Passenger</a> and (if/when it was zapped) re-creating the page as a redirect. Right then: I now propose to zap the content as it is now and to create a disambig page with (for now) two options: (i) "The Passenger" (Iggy Pop song) (or similar), and (ii) <i><a href="../../../r/e/p/Professione%7E_reporter.html" title="Professione: reporter">Professione: reporter</a></i>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> July 6, 2005 02:42 (UTC)

Since he died in Operation Enduring Freedom, the article content would fit well there (that article is also in severe need of an update, as it's got no new casualties since January 2004). Since he died with 16 other troops, his incident would certainly make that list; the list has incidents where as few as four soldiers were killed.

<p>A made up martial art with many fraudulent claims. Cannot be verified from external sources. I suggest we delete that page. 130.231.240.17 5 July 2005 09:09 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that this was a fairly formidable article up to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saito_Ninjitsu&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=13281836" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saito_Ninjitsu&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=13281836" rel="nofollow">this point</a>]. But for all I know, the whole thing might be garbage/nn. Few Google hits that aren't WP, copied from WP or the referenced link (which is presumably the only school that offers this stuff). Note that the article was created in good faith by <a href="../../../e/c/o/User%7EEco_5b36.html" title="User:Eco">User:Eco</a>, who also created a number of martial art articles, including the one on <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu.html" title="Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</a>. In this, he mentions Saito Ninjitsu as a very dubious art. I conclude: the article in its current form is garbage, in its old form is basically fancruft, non-verifiable and non-encyclopedic. I vote: <b>Delete and Redirect to Ninjutsu</b>. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoritz_f530.html" title="User:Moritz">Moritz</a> 5 July 2005 09:32 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> Makes sense to me -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 5 July 2005 13:58 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Insignificantly notable newly created martial art with a (very likely) bogus history. Delete as unverifiable. I don't trust many of Eco's contribs to MA articles, while done in good faith, to be factually accurate. To me it seems he has used only few random webpages and the like as a basis of articles, without any verification with established scholarly sources of Japanese history. Needless to say, Saito Ninjitsu cannot be found from any of the 40+ books I have about classical Edo-period martial arts nor from websites generally held as reliable sources (koryu.com etc.) <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 7 July 2005 11:47 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article says "has yet to show any proof", admitting unverifiability. Unverifiable means automatic delete.

<p>I usually don't mind fancruft, but I don't see the point with this one.

<li><b>Comment</b> Feel free to read the full proceedings at VfU and the VfD linked above, but it should be noted that the consensus was that the first VfD was improper or at least confusing. Most voted to delete as a recreation of deleted material. However, it was not brought up until the very end that the original delete was a speedy, not a VfD. I will be actively working to improve this article this week, as will a number of other users. With that said, I am not sure how notable this individual is in the grand scheme, and the article may be more trouble than it's worth (there are several people who are strongly committed to pushing a non-encyclopedic, POV version of the article.) I inserted myself into the VfU proceedings since I felt process was not followed, but since VfD is about content, I will abstain. No vote. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 5 July 2005 15:03 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Not only is Edip's prominence well known, he is the intellectual successor of Rashad Khalifa whose ideas have sent and continue to send shock waves through the Muslim world. The God Alone (Quran alone) movement is headed in great part by the ideas of Edip whose work in this area is prolific. He has been a significant contributor in much of Rashad's major ideas in his later years.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is good to see the article restored finally. And "ragib" i believe that you are a sunni or shia Muslim who doesnt like Quran Aloners and thats why you want this article deleted. Is that so or am i wrong?

<li>Khizar, I've said it before and I'll say it again...you're really shooting yourself in the foot with this one. I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>, as it is official policy here. Ragib is welcome to his opinion, as are you. What you are not welcome to do is attack another user...if anything, that is likely to turn community opinion against you. Just calm down and build up the article...as long as it remains neutral (as I believe it now is), the community feels that Yuksel is notable, and this contains information about the full spectrum of his work (not just Qur'an Alone), then I'm sure it will be kept. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 5 July 2005 18:30 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - No one considered Edip noteworthy before he discovered Wikipedia and commenced on a campaign of self-glorification. Even the editors saying that the article should be kept base their view on Edip's own claims to be a best-selling Turkish author, which I do not regard as substantiated. If a Turkish-speaking Wikipedian (who is NOT connected in any way with Edip Yuksel or the United Submitters) shows up here and says that "Yeah, that guy, he's notorious in Turkey", then I'll say he's notable. Given that Edip proudly lists as publications material that was put out by the United Submitter press -- which is tantamount to vanity publication -- I do not trust his assertions re publications in Turkish. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 5 July 2005 22:44 (UTC)

<li>Khizar- Zora for the last time it was me Khizar Zamurrad Janjuah who set up his article. It is entirely my work. Edip has nothing to do with it. So blame me if you wanna but leave Edip out. Hes compltetly innocent of anything that went on here. Do u hear me? And i dont agree with ur point. He is famous more than Ali Sina, who doesnt even show his face? Aint it dumb to allow a person's article whose very identity aint even known? U dont know who tht guy is. There might be an organization behind his name which maybe chritsian or anti islam anti Quran orientied. But no anyone whos against Quran he has to be promoted no matter whether hes famous or not. N Edip who has struggled all is life, is so famous, has published so many books, has had so many live debates on TV and aint even scared to give out his phone number, picture and location u consider him of no worth. This makes me mad u know. Here Zora, take a look at this from Ali Sinas article: Sina quotes:
<ul>
<li>"Islam is not a religion of love but a doctrine of hate." [2]</li>
<li>"The ultimate goal of Islam is to rule the world; Islam is political and political Islam is fascism." [3]</li>
<li>"Islam is a house of cards that will collapse if sufficiently pushed." [4]</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>How come sina is allowed to make such quotes n self promotion and on Edips article u dont allow his views to be expressed in a neutral form? Wht kind of nonsense is this? Can u explain this to me? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.130.89.24 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__84.130.89.24_0cca.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 84.130.89.24">contribs</a>) 5 July 2005 22:58 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li>Another note: while I keep hearing how notable and famous he was before he started on his Qur'an Alone campaign, I haven't seen anyone try to expand the article with any of his views or commentary on that score. I think this article has potential, but I'm getting the feeling that those who might know more about it are reluctant to expound on that for fear of drawing interest away from Qur'an Alone. I may be wrong, but that's my impression. avalanche361, if you know more about this topic, please feel free to add to the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 6 July 2005 22:14 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Note: It is quite possible we won't see a lot of Muslims contribute constructively to this article. The anti-hadith views Edip are espousing are widely regarded as heretical, so mainstreamers may choose not to associate themselves with him -- or, contrariwise, choose to throw tomatoes. Edip is also keen to discuss and draw attention to mathematical miracles within the Qur'an, which most middle-of-the-road Muslims see as a distraction (at best) and/or part of a campaign to remove two verses from the Qur'an (at worst -- this latter view of the text is, again, widely seen as heresy). I don't know why Qur'an-alone people would avoid the article. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 6 July 2005 22:40 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Khizar- Hi Brandon. Well i suggest Muslims should think about the fact that a law cannot be proven to exist unless someone tries to break it. Now since GOD states in the Quran that He'll protect it He thus made it a law. So actually now that people tried to inject false verses GOD in His Infinite Wisdom and Mercy showed through one of His messengers RK by the mathematical pattern nbased on no 19 in Quran that these two verses do not belong into Quran. Now one may ask "why was it allowed for 1400 years". I can only say that i dont know the exact reason but maybe GOD knew that most of the people in that time were corrupt anyway and didnt deserve the real Quran whereas for those little who were honest He had other ways of informing them of the true Quran which we today dont know off and it is unimportant. Whats important is the signs of GOD that we have right now. Ive also written an article on this at <a href="http://19.org/forum/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=975&amp;start=0&amp;rid=222&amp;S=c0b2aa7e5cd4fd8be07ed18a92c9249c" class="external text" title="http://19.org/forum/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=975&amp;start=0&amp;rid=222&amp;S=c0b2aa7e5cd4fd8be07ed18a92c9249c" rel="nofollow">The difference btw Quran/Dhikr ans the Mushaf</a></p>

<li>How am I using WP as a soapbox? Your statement "For the foreseeable future, BJAODN articles should transwikied to Wikicomedy!" seems to be a move at changing VfD policy, and therefore could be included in using WP as a soapbox.

<li><b>KEEP</b>: This article is about the evolution of the ranks and insignias as seen in the Star Trek productions from the 1960s to the present. While Star Trek itself is fictional, the insignia worn by the actors is not and has evolved over the past forty years in several television series and over ten motion pictures. This article is well written, referenced, and is not original research. To delete this would mean that all other fiction articles, such as articles about the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenium_Falcon_c708.html" title="Millenium Falcon">Millenium Falcon</a>, and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantasy_Star_4a35.html" title="Phantasy Star">Phantasy Star</a> (to name a few) would be up for deletion as well. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 5 July 2005 16:31 (UTC)

<li>There is no Starfleet, and hence no Starfleet ranks. That means they're fictional. Though I don't know who would be deranged enough to interpret this vote as a precedent to remove all other article about fiction, I'd be very interested in getting some names. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> July 5, 2005 16:39 (UTC)

<li>The insignia worn by the actors is real enough. Paramount costume department is paid well enough to make them.<s>On a side note (and I ask this becuase I really don't know not to be smart!) are VFDs supposed to have comments to the votes?

<li>I don't think reanactment really changes the status of anything that's fictional... As far as the vote goes, it's like most others as far as I know.

<li><b>Keep</b>, it'll give these people something to do on Saturday nights. No, seriously, as much as this article scares me... and as many totally obscure and non-encyclopedic things that I'm sure the Trekkies could throw at us... the organization of Starfleet does not seem to be one of them. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 5, 2005 16:41 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - well written, well sourced article about factual material. Someone could write a dissertation on this. Sure, it's fancruft, but it's an encyclopaedia article about fancruft, not just a synopsis of an episode of a TV series or an article about a single character in a book or movie (see for example <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riddle_60ba.html" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 5 July 2005 17:10 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - it makes its fiction explicit, explains when things come from TV and when they're fan conjecture, is well sourced and referenced. To me, a model of what an article on a fictional topic should be. Now if only we had the same depth of coverage of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">My Talk</a> July 5, 2005 17:18 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I would vote for the deletion of an article like this for most fannish pursuits, but Star Trek has had a very real, very tangible impact (often negative, in terms of stifling other efforts) on the business and culture of science fiction in film and television over the span of 30 years. By that benchmark, Star Trek minutae are just as much cultural footnotes as any other <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>-era details. I wouldn't cry if someone merged it into some larger topic and redirected, but I don't think it's necessary. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 5 July 2005 17:21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wouldn't have writtne this article, nor am i likely to contribute to it nor to consult it often, although I am fond of startrek. But I see no more problem with this than with any detail about a fictional universe, and less than many. However this article does demonstrate why, IMO most articles about details of fictional univese (such as characters, places, and the like) would benefit from a consistant notation linking them to their primary subjects and in effect taking them out of the main articel namespace. Something like <b>Star Trek -- Rank insignia</b> or <b>Middle Earth -- Cats of Queen Berutheil</b> might be a good standard. If subpages were not so strongly objected to, this might be a goos sue for them. This idea has been briefly discussed over on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fictional_Series_General_5ef2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fictional Series/General">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fictional Series/General</a> but no decision has been made. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 5 July 2005 17:22 (UTC)</li>

I love both of these made-up worlds, but I want my encyclopedia to stay rooted in this one.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Star Trek is one of the most well-known franchises in science. <i><b>I can't think of a single other work of fiction</b></i> that has seen 10 movies, 5 television series (700+ epsodes in 28 seasons), and I have-no-clue how many novels. Actually, I'm curious if there is anything close to Star Trek... The Simpsons only has 17 seasons but no movies. Fancruft strikes at the heart of "what is notable?" and my answer has essentially been: whatever someone wants to write about; the more people that would read or write it the more notable it is. Notability is not in the eye of any one person, but only one's <i>assessment</i> of notability. The article in question has <b>OVER 600 EDITS IN 5 MONTHS</b> and I can't think of much more of a slap in the face to the uncountable hours people have spent on this than to delete it. So to explicitly state something like this is non-notable and uninteresting to 45 editors (mind you that's only writers...readers is uncountable) is arrogant beyond measure that it's insulting. (And for the record, I've only made 8 edits to this article.) <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> July 5, 2005 18:58 (UTC)

<li>I guess I'm not of the opinion that a certain number of edits or editors is a criteria for inclusion (and for a very good reason). So how about staying away from the pure <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">personal stuff</a>, hm? /<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 18:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nice straw man. Nevermind that I laid out my definition of notability but attack numbers used to apply my definition to this article: the point is that 45 editors find it notable and, so far, there are only two people here that don't. Clearly, it is not my definition of notability that needs readjustment. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:30, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As far as WP:CIVIL goes, saying that your VFD is insulting is not being uncivil. Maybe you need to take a look around and see where the vote lies: aside from your vote, there's only <i>one other delete vote</i>. I still find your VFD insulting and your attitude about me being incivil, also, as arrogant.

<li>As per <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet_%28place%29.html" title="Hamlet (place)">Hamlet (place)</a>, a hamlet in New York has no government and is generally considered part of the town within which it is located and does not even have defined boundaries.

<li>It's notable to people who live there, even though it doesn't have a local level of government. Have a look at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Category%7EHamlets_in_New_York_6e41.html" title="Category:Hamlets in New York">Category:Hamlets in New York</a>. The unique status that "hamlets" have in New York implies their semi-official recognition. I don't think the google test really applies to any sort of significant human settlement (nevertheless "Mycenae" and "Onondaga" gets &gt; 4,000 hits); how could there be a popularity test when we have a long <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_with_fewer_than_ten_people.html" title="List of places with fewer than ten people">list of places with fewer than ten people</a>?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 6 July 2005 06:23 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I've seen questions without answers before, but never answers without questions (OK, maybe "forty-two"). Unless I'm missing something this seems useless. If people want it as a list of "encyclopedic topics" not covered by Wikipedia they need to look at it more closely. I've already redirected a bunch, and many others should not ever be articles (no article on $2.56???? Or St. Denis (accept St. Dionysus)????? OMG!!!!).

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are four options here. One is to rewrite the article to refer to the better known David Keane who IMDB shows when you search it for a David Keane. Another is to create a disambiguation article if David (Daithi) Keane is deemed worthy of an article. Another option is to have the main article about the better known David Keane with a reference stating For information on David (Daithi) Keane, please see our article on David (Daithi) Keane. Another is to delete this article with no articles on either man.

<p>This is a non-standard (i.e. original research) categorisation of a class of tesselation.</p>
<p>Although the history includes many other editors, careful examination reveals that they mostly performed copyediting rather than adding content (except for a picture or two of a puzzle that fits the definition in the text).</p>
<p>It should be noted that <b>over 100</b> articles (about 200 including images) created by Karlscherer3 were deleted simultaneously in a single VfD, by a 90% majority (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games</a>). There is also a current VfD at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_MoreKarlScherer_de95.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/MoreKarlScherer">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/MoreKarlScherer</a> concerning an additional 8. The only reason this was not included amongst them was because I had failed to previously notice them. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 14:19 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note how in the history it credits Karl Scherer with discoveries in this field, despite it being Karl Scherer who added this content - i.e. original research/vanity.</p>
<p>The term "convex tiling" is not appropriate in the context of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tessellation.html" title="Tessellation">tessellations</a>, since it would mathematically be more accurately termed <i>planar tessellation</i>. The term cannot be found in any standard maths textbook, or on google<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22convex%20tiling%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22convex%20tiling%22" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> for that matter. The phrase hardly even makes sense; it apparently applies to a tiling <i>of</i> a convex area, not a tiling <i>using</i> convex polygons.</p>

<p>Comment from the submitter of the "Fugly" entry: Searching for define:fugly in Google lead to the empty entry in Wikipedia. I responded to the invitation, that such pages constitute, to create an entry for the next person. If Wikipedia is not a dictionary, then you need to change your relationship to Google, so that Wikipedia entries are not return for define: queries and perhaps Wictionary searches are performed instead.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> and/or merge. This is borderline. I agree with the above, but on a technicality I would say that this deck type <i>has</i> been popular in tournaments for many years. That is, many green and green/white weenie styles are based on one or more types of elves which at least include the llanowar. Still, I think a single article (which may already exist) giving an overview of the many deck styles and their use in tournament play would make more sense (much like an article giving an overview on chess openings). As it stands there's only a small amount of information here which could easily be a section in some other Magic-related article. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 5 July 2005 20:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The discussion to date seems to hang on two points:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> page exists so this should as well.</li>
<li>It will (we promise) continue to be maintained.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However neither one nor the other of these points adresses the central issue of <i>this</i> articles continued existance
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> page exists for a specific purpose. It, like <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>, is deeply rooted in the community <i>regardless</i> of its merits for inclusion. (Any VfD on these pages would fail, and even I am not <i>that</i> much of a deletionist, <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F</a>.)</li>
<li>Regardless of how willing editors are to update, this does not belong <i>here</i>. In general, refer to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> for why there also exist <b><a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="n:Main_Page">Wikinews</a></b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Thus, to restate - not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 02:35 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> exists for a reason beyond <i>that it is rooted in the community regardless of its merits for inclusion</i>.
<ul>
<li>The only reason an entry like this is not considered encyclopedic by print encyclopedias is because, by their very nature, they cannot keep them current. Encyclopedias, however <b>do</b> contain pages listing events by year, as does <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_%272005_in%27_articles.html" title="List of '2005 in' articles">Wikipedia</a>. Therefore, <b>due to Wikipedia's nature</b>, these current events pages <b>are encyclopedic</b>, otherwise we draw some arbitrary line upon which events become encylopedic, so as to add them to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> pages.</li>
<li>Therefore the issue becomes precisely one of keeping such pages maintained. Far better, in my opinion, to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_archive_Current_Events_113a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to archive Current Events">archive</a> pages of this type which become inactive, and leave a redirect behind so that they can be reactivated if people are prepared to maintain them, rather than drag them through a VfD.</li>
<li>Further to that, note <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> does not apply here as this page and other's like it do not deal in first hand news reports.</li>
<li>And finally, in light of huge list of current events pages as posted by <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a>, I would suggest that this page <b>is encyclopedic</b> as defined by wikipedia community. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 8 July 2005 08:45 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</dl>

<ul>
<li>In response to the above, yes, current event pages have precedent, but I believe that does not mean we should have one for each country. Our sisterprojects are there for a reason; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> is the place to store news events. Major news events such as the London bombing will end up with encyclopedia articles anyway, of course, because of notability. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 8, 2005 10:08 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikinews does not have anything like the equivalent of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2005.html" title="June 2005">June 2005</a>, with lots of links to Wikipedia articles. Think of timelines as a different entrance point into Wikipedia (categories are another entrance point, a topic-oriented entrance point). <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 8 July 2005 10:11 (UTC)</li>
<li>So at what point do we write these articles? Where do you draw your arbitrary line in time beyond which an event can be encyclopedic? One year, one month, one day, one hour, one minute or one second? Should we then delete any mention of events happening in July on <b>any</b> page? As <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> states, timelines are encyclopedic, therefore this page is, otherwise Wikipedia has to set some policy on an arbitrary point at which events become encyclopedic. Consensus seems to be to record events as they happen, witness the updating happening constantly around us. Have people who are voting to delete considered the precedent that will be set if this page is deleted? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 8 July 2005 10:42 (UTC)</li>

<li>Have I considered the precedent this would set? Yes. Would I be pleased with that precedent? <b>Yes</b>. We draw <i>arbitrary lines</i> around ourselves all the time.

I would suggest, as a discussion starter, that <i>with the exception of</i> <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_event.html" title="Current event">Current Events</a> no news item under six months old be considered encyclopedic. So keep your shirt on, Pcb21, I haven't gone mad!&#160;;) The purpose of Wikipedia it to contain <u>knowledge</u>, not to hold <u>information</u>, and it takes time for knowledge to develop out of information. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 11:40 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, and as to my short-sightedness, I like to think I'm taking the long view. How many pages have been added in the last month? How many in the last year? How many new <i><b>administrators</b></i> have been added in that same amount of time? What's the backlog on VfD right now?

<li><b>Keep</b>.

This is lunacy. This month's current events page will become the backbone of our <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005.html" title="July 2005">July 2005</a> article, which itself will be an invaluable resource (containing links to our articles on particular topics hot at the time, as well as to more primary sources) for future people researching this period.

The fact that it's a low Amazon sales rank (please note: sales rank above is incorrect, as it fails to take into account the <i>much</i> higher rank of the paperback) when it's a 6-year-old coffee table childrens book is not shocking.

<p>User:194.158.208.242 unhelpfully contributed some strange physics articles, on topics which are already better covered.

<p>This article is about music album that may be released someday, but for now it is just speculation on future events. Further, the bulk of the article is an email sent from a band member to the band's manager, which is an unencyclopedic source. Once this album is actually released, with known track names, it would be appropriate to have an article if the album is considered notable. Until then, the article is unverifiable, non-notable, and a likely piece of vanity. (No offense to the band- I hope <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrice.html" title="Thrice">Thrice</a> thrives. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 5, 2005 22:11 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is a great deal of information about the album, and since a well-written article trumps concerns of notability, I would say hang onto it. Why rewrite this after the album is released? There are plenty of other album writeups that were created before the album was released, and kept. The band is signed with a major record label (<a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a>), thus notable, and this album is going to be notable when it is released anyway.

<p>I don't know anyone who had heard of "Currently Stationary" or any of the List of phrases inspired by currently stationary. This seems very likely to be some person's attempt to make this blog popular for no reason. "Currently Stationary" does not pass the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Test_bb8b.html" title="Google Test">Google Test</a>. There is only 1 non-wikipedia site that refers to it: <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/engrish" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/engrish" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/engrish</a>. And that site only links to the page because "Currently Stationary" has the word "engrish" in it. By clicking the link I found out Answers.com only copied what was on Wikipedia for the definition of "Currently Stationary". So there are really no outside references to "Currently Stationary" other than the Wikipedia entries. Also, I am inclined to believe all the major additions to the webpage are by the same person, who keeps changing his or her IP address (usually begining with 203.24.100.***) or creating new accounts to make it look like he or she is several different people. While it does seem "Currently Stationary" is in fact a real blog. It has no pages linking to it using <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>'s link feature. Type "link: <a href="http://currently-stationary.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://currently-stationary.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://currently-stationary.blogspot.com/</a>" into the google search bar to see what I mean. Perhaps there are at most 10 people who have read this blog and think its important, but that certainly is not enough to warrant a wikipedia entry. -<a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyad_899b.html" title="User:Hyad">Hyad</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> — schools usually have a physical infrastructure built to last many decades, an organization of dedicated professional teachers and administrators, and a sizeable population of students.

<li><i>Reply to comment'</i> I dont understand what you mean by that. Because we just now decided that we wanted a wikipedia entry, and we are just now receiving major attention from other blogs and news sites, this makes us a "neologism"? We have been around for quite awhile, but unfortunately, greenlighting is already a popular term; we were overshadowed almost immediately. Greenlighting is a popular movie production term that has garnered a very large internet following. Perhaps you have heard of project greenlight. Also, if you google greenlighting, you can see that it is a common term for giving something approval. It is very hard to be "heard" when so many people are already using the term in mainstream communication.--Maiael 5 July 2005 22:29 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So, the term was applied to this activity for the first time a few days ago, but actually is normally used for something else? I have heard of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Greenlight_fd5d.html" title="Project Greenlight">Project Greenlight</a> and if greenlighting is actually a popular movie term, this article needs massive revision. I applaud your efforts in creating a new meaning for a word over a couple of days, but until it has been in common use for some considerable period of time, it is inappropriate to include it in Wikipedia. Add it to one of those online slang dictionaries first. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 6 July 2005 13:48 (UTC)</dd>

Like it or not, "Greenlighting" is a topic of some significance in some way, and deserves a wikipedia article. Also, a great deal of <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoaxes.html" title="Hoaxes">hoaxes</a> have wikipedia articles. (also see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hoaxes.html" title="List of hoaxes">list of hoaxes</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordell_Walker_552c.html" title="User:Cordell Walker">Cordell Walker</a> 6 July 2005 00:32 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an interesting case. The article itself, and the content therein, had a major effect on shutting down the hoax. The perpetrators basically folded after their scheme was revealed here. Despite that, the backers of this hoax are still attempting to control the content and existence of the article -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a> 6 July 2005 01:03 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Wait and see.</b> If this hoax gets picked up and widely circulated, it's something that people will be looking for authoritative information on, and WP ought to carry an explanation. If it never makes it into the public consciousness (defined, at a guess, as appearing on a well-viewed talk show or in a wire story picked up by multiple mainstream newspapers), but rather dies a merciful death, the article should die just as quickly. (I don't find the 'neologism' guideline to apply at the moment -- it's not an attempt to introduce the term, but a description of events relating to someone else's introduction.) <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEritain_131a.html" title="User:Eritain">eritain</a> 6 July 2005 07:10 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - It doesn't seem to have gotten much attention outside of SA, the Metafilter discussions (apparently started by an SA member), and Wikipedia itself. The <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kaycee_Nicole_5ef6.html" title="Kaycee Nicole">Kaycee Nicole</a> hoax was much more widespread, and even it only has a stub.

<p><b>Why?</b> Why are so many of you so opposed to having this on wikipedia. Is it going to make your copy of the hardbound Wikipedia too thick? Is it going to slow down your internet surfing abilities? Greenlighting was important to us. We wanted to see just how much attention we could get by creating this, and we received quite a bit. I am sorry that some of you feel that this is non-notable, but we feel that it is. Actually, there is a community of over 50,000 that are aware of this hoax and a vast sum of them approved of it. I think it is important that it is documented so that people who find out about this at a later date, or people who want to find out what it was all about, or even people who want to find out if its a hoax or not, can found out exactly what happened. --Maiael 7 July 2005 03:29 (UTC)</p>

<li>Do you have any evidence to back up your statements that it received much attention, or are the claims of the attention it received as made up as those of greenlighting itself? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_Carroll_598d.html" title="User:Chuck Carroll">Chuck</a> July 7, 2005 03:47 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't have access to the referrer logs as I am not the admin of greenlighter.org. Since I have no control over being able to prove how many sites linked to greenlighters.org, and the numerous, very very numerous, forum topics started about us, such as the pbonline forums, genmay, metafilter, and other big names, I guess there isn't much I can do other than argue here. So do whatever you want with the Wiki. It's not worth arguing with internet <b>scholars</b> anymore. I hope ya'll get paid for this.</li>
