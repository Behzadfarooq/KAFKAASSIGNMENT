<li><b>comment</b> I thank Butseriouslyfolks for the correction. I located the source for the article and inserted it; it is an online version of two standard reliable sources considered as reliable as the DND. The portion online indicated additional children but did not include the name, so I added the second son on the authority of the reference here. I have also added context--go check the article again. She was closely related to the English Royal family. There is an interlocking series of these articles for the Royal family and its close relatives, of which this article is a link. There is no reason for the chain to be disrupted. It can be said that the chain needs to be looked at again and many articles done more carefully, but that is true of many of the articles in WP. if not all of them. I I have just notified the previous 3 editors on the page of the AfD, using the standard templates, which do not indicate any suggestion of how to vote. <s>(The nominator really should have done this, but failed to.

<li>these works are the standard sources--all historians use them, except for really specialized work. further can be added, but this gets into specialized literature and unpublished material very fast.

<li>I think that's ok. For better or worse, history has essentially ignored the deeds of the women of that era, rendering most of them non-notable. Users will still find information about the women as they are mentioned in the articles about the men. There's no need for interlocking articles of this nature.

<dd>I do not think it is OK, even in tertiary sources like WP, since the basic information can be found and verified, but to actually find citable <i>specific</i> secondary source information on the women, while not impossible, is so difficult that I am not going to pursue it here, on the principle of WP:SNOWBALL. I'll stick to actual children of Kings, as she was only a niece. Anyway the title of her husband was entered wrong--I discovered that he is known in contemporary reference sources (the 2007 DNB) as Thomas Mowbray, 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The relevant page has been moved, and you might as well merge her to the right guy. I haven't changed the links above, because the redirects will work--If they should be changed --as links in articles are being changed, then change them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot agree with the implied suggestion that any great-grandchild of any king should be included solely because of her relation to the royal family, without any requirement that the subject be notable in the subject's own right. Wikipedia is not a directory of members of the extended royal family. Giving her husband a royal connection may be the most significant act history has preserved from her life. Her husband's article would also be the logical place to refer to the couple's children. IMHO. -- <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 04:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Right</b> in this case the dynastic relationships are critical in English history of the period--and they are furthermore the basis of Shakespeare's history plays. It is not easy to clarify the relationships without discussing the women as well; especially in connection with their dowries of landed property and their second or third marriages, the heiresses all throughout the middle ages &amp; early modern period were central to the formation of major family fortunes.
<dl>
<dd>In 21st century society such relationships may not be very important, but they were in that earlier period. It isn't mere genealogy in the modern sense.
