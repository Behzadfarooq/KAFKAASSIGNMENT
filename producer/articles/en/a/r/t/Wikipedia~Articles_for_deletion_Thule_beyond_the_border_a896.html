<p>MMORPG currently 'under development' that right now is pretty much just a licenced engine and some promises. <b>Delete</b> as advertising. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I'm the owner of the site www.thule-online.co.uk and also host the game server. May I add that the game is actually fully working and has been for 3 years, you may join the game for free. The "under development" bit is a NEW game we are designing using the same engine but completly redesigned. I added this entry as I'd like to add some game faq's and let our players edit the contents, hints &amp; tips etc for the game. 22:45, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That contradicts what is said in the article. The article says that <i>Astonia</i> has been finished for years, but <i>Thule</i> is still under development. ("It will eventually (loong into the future_ be completely independant from it's inspiration with regards to storyline and gameplay.") Unless this changes, <b>delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball. I will reconsider my vote if the claims in the article are wrong, and it indeed is about a finished game. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 23:31, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if the article is kept, please reupload the screenshot as a PNG instead of a JPEG. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 23:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain it this way:</p>
<p>We bought the game engine of a game called Astonia V2. Astonia V2 is no longer operating and has been superseeded by Astonia V3 a much improved version. We purchased the license to V2 engine. our intention is to use this engine and make a whole NEW game. Meanwhile we are using the old "world" as a template and have expanded massivlely on it by adding our own quests gfx etc. If you were to view the forum activity you'll see that this is very much an active community and an active game which is fully working. I can understand the confusion between the "under development" and "fully working". i will reupload the image as png if the entry is "accepted" ...never though it was this hard adding an entry to wikipedia!.....</p>

<ul>
<li>There are still a couple more problems with this topic. First, it fails the (not yet active) inclusion guideline <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, having only about 500 forum members. More importantly, it fails the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy, since there seem to be no independent sources writing about this game (correct me if I'm wrong). Third (but that can easily be corrected) it reads a bit more like an ad than like an encyclopedia entry. The way it looks like right now, the game might be worthy of a Wikipedia entry in the future, when it has become more notable, but I don't see that it's there yet. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 00:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Never mind...please delete the entry. I don't desire a wiki entry this much...too much hassle. 06:27, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>How can anything fail a not yet active anything? The game is active (ie. up and running), the community is active, permissions are active. It's under development in that it's being continuously developed, quests added, graphics improved, engine developed, etc., as is the case for most active online roleplaying games. It's in their nature. I notice in the complaints regarding this entry a lack of proper research though. How big does a community have to be to be included though? This is not just a piece of software, the software is being used by other games as well, and may or may not be used by 5000 people. It's worth reading that whole page though: "The bound of 5000 users is only one of the criteria for notability, and is intended for software of general use (e.g., a text editor); notability of specialized software is better established by the other criteria." It's quite clear we're not talking about a text editor. Other criteria could be an active and growing community.--84.208.123.136 12:39, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

As the lead developer on Thule I am shocked over the ignorance shown by the moderators here. We have 539 registered users. That is those who is registered, we have several more who play the game but do not visit the MB, but then again some who visit the MB do not play as well. As for the game it is quite as Gekko says fully operational and we move each day further and further away from what MoA was. We have a build server where we update the game, and thus I think we can safely say that the play server is not under development. It just gets updated..:P See how easy it is to twitch the meaning of words just like you yourselves do? Anyway I see no point in continuing this argument as it seems you guys have already made up your mind. Arild N. Lund</p>

<p>Id like to add that this article was speeddeleted due to copyright infringment. That issue has been sorted out as the owner wrote the article and also added a note on the webpage. Why you guys are suddenly discussing other nonrelated "powerfreak" issues is beyond me.</p>
