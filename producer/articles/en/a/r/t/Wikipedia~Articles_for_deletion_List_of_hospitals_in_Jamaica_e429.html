<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. Much the stronger argument, as well as numbers, to the Keep commentors. The idea of nominating this one article to try to set a precedent for other, perhaps stronger, articles also seems a bit fishy. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 06:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Comment, no vote</s> Keep</b> - I see you chose a particularly weak article (none of the hospitals are wikilinked). Although I may favor the deletion of some of these articles, I am ambivalent about your deliberate exclusion of the rest from this AfD (although I thank you for being honest and noting it). Why not bundle this nomination with the other articles? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is that itself not a pretty clear indication that there is no consensus for deletion? I have no problem with you nominating this individual list for deletion, but I think it might be inappropriate if you use this as precedent for other lists. If the same criticisms apply, nominate them all at once--especially since you know about them. If the same criticisms don't apply, then any claim of "precedent" in the future is inapplicable. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is better dealt with as a category, with only the notable/major ones getting articles. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 05:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a particularly poor example of these hospital lists (possibly why it was chosen as a test case?), but the same principles apply. Many hospitals have wikipedia articles, and the number of them that do will no doubt slowly increase with time. A complete list, with both red and blue links, is the best way to keep track of which have yet to be created - a category cannot do that. This is no worse than many of the other similar list categories. DGG's reason for favouring delete actually casts doubts as to the efficacity of deletion: <i>"This approach worked nicely on towers"</i>. What happened with towers was that individual articles on towers were turned into <i>just such lists as these</i>. These should similarly be kept as lists, so that any hospitals which may be deemed <i>not</i> worthy of having their own articles have somewhere where any information on them cound be merged. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 09:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this may be a poor example of an article, but the principle idea behind it is sound. Hospitals are reasonably capable of being notable. Grouping them by geographic region is also a reasonable method of sorting. I am not surprised this article is in poor condition, Jamaica is probably far behind in priority to most Wikipedia users. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is useful as a development list, a valid use for a list. As per notability, some are notable, some may not be, that is not reason for deletion of the entire list. â€”<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>Ï‡</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 21:17, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The arguments of MER-C and DGG seem predicated on the assumption that hospitals themselves, like radio towers, are not notable. I'm not sure I agree with that assumption.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 22:10, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't advocate the "we have X, why not Y" argument, but a precedent of sorts is the somewhat ridiculous decision to keep school articles. There are far fewer hospitals than schools, hospitals are large, very prominent within their communities and surrounding areas, etc etc. I am not strenuously arguing for intrinsic notability, but I don't think it should be dismissed out of hand.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 04:53, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To answer the question of differentiation between hospitals: History, location, services offered, events that happened at the hospital are a least some of the criteria I would apply.

<li>Unlike masts, which usually evoke feelings of antipathy, hospitals, by virtue of their nature, services, and their quality of care are usually of great interest to the public, and so are often subject of public information and/or news articles. Their building structures are usually well known beyond their catchment locality. I would draw the line at "clinics" (definitions may vary). The underlying subjects are notable, and the lists are capable of so being too if they impart useful additional information so I would vote <b>Keep</b> However, the system of these lists is a hotch-potch. The Jamaica list would benefit from being sorted by geography or by specialty, like some of the others. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
