<dd>How does it pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>? It reads: 1) The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. 2) The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation. 3) The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this newsgroup is very notable on the Internet. Admittedly it probably doesn't pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but it's still notable and ought to be in an internet encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 02:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep only if cleaned up before close of discussion, otherwise delete</b>. I don't think <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies here, as Usenet exists outside of (and greatly predates) the World Wide Web. And there's no question that alt.usenet.kooks meets notability based purely on its role in Internet history. However, I'm not a big fan of articles that are given almost a year to get cleaned up but then never are. If nobody's willing to bring it up to spec, it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 02:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"needs to be cleaned up" is not a criterion for deletion. There are plenty of articles in far worse shape, many of which have been in worse shape for longer periods of time. There isn't a deadline at which all of Wikipedia's content gets shipped off to the printers, after all, what's the harm in taking our time? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Past a certain point, the fact that a cleanup tag goes unheeded is itself inherent evidence that perhaps the subject isn't as Wikiworthy as we'd like to believe. In such a case, it may be preferable to simply delete the article <i>without prejudice</i>, so that someone else may come along later and produce a better article from scratch. And if nobody ever does, well ... --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:59, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A newsgroup is not a web site, so WP:WEB may not be easily applicable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and hopefully a cleanup after one long year.

<li><b><u>Provide proper references</u> and cleanup before the end of afd or else, delete</b> as per Aaron. After 10 months or so since last afd - no claims to notability, no verifiable reliable sources, failure of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Apparently we're just going on the hearsay of people. This is VERY bad precedent for other articles. We've already made a huge exception for this article. I don't see why we should have infinite patience for it, especially if "we'll take our time over cleanup/it'll get cleaned up eventually" actually means nothing gets done about critical issues. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Google suggests the subject is notable and there should be enough out there to verify all these claims that someone apparently just rattled off from memory. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 16:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Zero hits on Google Scholar and Google Books btw. This is hardly <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WELL_4590.html" title="The WELL">The WELL</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:37, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Even <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WELL_4590.html" title="The WELL">The WELL</a> would probably only have a 50-50 chance of survival if anyone cleaned out the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">Wikipedia:Walled garden</a> hagiographical parts of it and put it up for AfD. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:11, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, nonsense. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WELL_4590.html" title="The WELL">The WELL</a> was an important <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_community.html" title="Virtual community">virtual community</a> (not so much today), and has had entire <b>books</b> devoted to it. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:36, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Not so much today" is kind of my point. If there had been a Wikipedia in 1992 and someone nominated <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WELL_4590.html" title="The WELL">The WELL</a>, it would have been closed as a blatantly bad-faith nomination within about 90 seconds. But in 2006? It's more like "Oh yeah, the WELL. I remember them; they're still around? Wow..." If someone quietly slapped a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag on it, there's an off chance it might get deleted before anyone else that cared even noticed. As for the books, they were all written by longstanding WELL members, so someone could argue they're just part of the self-referential walled garden, and time has passed and the WELL hasn't kept up, etc. (I'm just speaking of it as a potential <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> example; I have no intention of putting it up for AfD.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 02:59, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, not-notable. If this was really such an important part of internet history (whatever that is) surely some reliable source would have written about it? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I struggle to discern anything in the article which even begins to suggest notability - a place where 'kooky' usenet posts are discussed? Let's see some sources. --<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 18:07, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - per <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> and <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 19:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Keep'</i> AUK is one of the groups that most of Usenet knows, due to the *ahem* strong personalities that get brought to it. (and I haven't even gotten started on the Kooks!)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Definitely an important part of Net Culture. Whether "Net Culture" itself is all that important is a separate issue, but if it's covered, this belongs. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:36, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
