<li>It is encyclopedic because it's very relevant as part of his radio show. Savage references them all the time. In fact, he's even in the process of releasing a new book which labels each personality with a disparaging (most anyway) name. Another thing...saying that they're "offensive slurs" is YOUR POV. Most of the people who listen to Savage dont think they're offensive even when he's putting down someone they like.<b>Keep</b><small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.35.15.107 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.35.15.107.html" title="User talk:24.35.15.107">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.35.15.107_9f24.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.35.15.107">contribs</a>) 08:40, 19 February 2006.</small></li>

Most of the stuff on the page is punning nicknames, not new words. If the page survives on its own, and I really don't think it should, it needs a lot more context. When Savage uses these nicknames, how does he use them? Does he say something like "Rush Limbaugh, or as I like to call him, Hush Bimbo" or does he say the nickname without ever using the person's real name at all? Also, some of the names seem to indicate faults he finds in the person, but others don't convey any obvious meaning at all. What does calling Sean Hannity "Harvey Wallbanger" mean? That Hannity uses his fists a lot? That he drinks a lot? If his fans want to get really encyclopedic, they'd try to: (1) establish when the name was first used (2) what the name means (if not original research), (3) document whether the name was used more than once, and if so how often (otherwise definitely not notable), (4) whether the use of the name has spread beyond his fans (otherwise hardly notable), and so on. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 05:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I hadn't heard of Savage until I read the article, so you can't include me in that list.
