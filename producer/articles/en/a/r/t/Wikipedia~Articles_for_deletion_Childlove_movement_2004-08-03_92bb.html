<li>Since when are "merge" votes synonymous with "delete" votes? If anything, they're votes to keep at least some of the content, and should be counted as keeps (as you note Cecropia wishes, and as I state below). But then the total would reach the result you aren't voting for. Not exactly honest tallying. tsk, tsk. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 00:23, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please note that decisions to delete or keep are admin decisions (which explains why some "tough" decisions aren't made for days and days). Admins are given much more discretion in this than in RFA, but consensus to delete is about 2/3 with consideration given to the content of the comments, also in regard to what to do with the material is the article is not kept (remove entirely, merge part or all of the content with other articles). Since I have participated in this, I won't be making the final decision one way or the other, but just wanted you to know, since a tally is being kept. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 01:27, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>We have sunk to an all-time low by allowing this "article" to be posted, complete with its image of the cover of a child porn magazine. Let's get off the POV/NPOV bandwagon and just speedy delete this. No redirect, no nothing except for maybe reporting this pervert to the proper authorities. If this stays, I go for good and I hope that others will consider doing likewise as well. Sysops, take note. If I blank my pages over this, I <i>demand</i> to have my history removed as well.

<li>*sigh* Lucky, in my limited experience on VfD, I've found you to be a valuable contributor. But a vote like this is rather disappointing. As for the article itself, the "childlove movement" itself certainly exists, and regardless of what we think about it, as encyclopedists we have a duty to write about it from a neutral point of view. Of course, we should <b>keep and rename</b> the article to "childlove", which gets 26,600 Google hits, but that's beside the point. The point is, if this were any other topic with the same characteristics, it would deserve an article, and your objection is based solely on the topic itself, not the content or any other objective criterion.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your statement, writing about the childlove movement is, of course, not illegal. Nor is the movement itself. Nor is pedophilia. Child sexual abuse <b>is</b> illegal, but advocacy in favor of changing its definition or legalizing it is not, and writing about such efforts certainly is not. So what do you want to report? And to what authorities? Your final statement shows that you probably feel very strongly about this subject and are letting your emotions cloud your judgment (which is ok). But I think it's rather foolish to put your potentially very productive future at Wikipedia on the line over ONE article, which objectivly should be kept. Of course, you know that user histories cannot be removed and that threats about leaving the project are not very useful. Please don't make threats and demands. Please don't leave Wikipedia because you don't like one of its articles. If you don't like the content of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">Childlove movement</a>, fix it by bringing it to a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcegikmo1_4637.html" title="User:Acegikmo1">Acegikmo1</a> 04:16, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No way should this be <b>renamed</b> to <b>childlove</b>. That is, at the same time, overly euphemistic, POV and inaccurate. The proper term for this kind of "childlove" is paedophilia, plain and simple. And "childlove" could mean the love of children non-sexually, of the non-sexual advocacy for children, or even the love <i>of</i> a child. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 05:51, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article is about something real but distasteful. It is hardly the only article on Wikipedia that many find offensive with good reason but they remain. The existence of such movements is important to know. Having said that, the article need not be a propaganda piece for pedophiles. So I say <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> the relevant content with <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophilia.html" title="Paedophilia">Paedophilia</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 03:18, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Keep. Perhaps the pictures should go, but "nauseating" isn't criteria for deleting an article. This <i>is</i> nauseating, but what good can come from deleting it? Lucky 6.9, maybe you need a break from Wikipedia if you're saying that people should be arrested simply for writing an article. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 03:33, Aug 3, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't realize that we were advocating for 'child porn on Wikipedia', but writing an article about the pedophile movement.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><del>Delete</del>: <b>Abstain/Conflicted (see below)</b> I have been over my feelings on the need to delete these images before. We are not compelled by mission to include this article. My grounds for deletion are notability. First, remember the Google bias: people who manage to get talked about on the web get Google hits, even if they are few but dedicated people <i>or few people who are widely reviled.</i> Secondly, if one takes a subfractional libidinal preference from all the scattered populations in the Anglophone world and add them together in one place on the web, you can get mighty numbers without actually reflecting anything that is even substantial enough to be called "fringe." I believe the "notability" of this movement is notoriety, on the one hand, and an artifact of the online world. Were this article to survive VfD, I would strongly urge paring it down severely. We surely are not compelled to devote this much space and attention to such a non-notable "movement." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:11, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment/Expansion: Obviously, this is a topic on which many voters find neutrality difficult. I almost wrote, "Hands up, all the parents." Parents are going to have monumental difficulty. Even setting aside my feelings, though, while I agree that a neutral portrayal of <i>what</i> the advocacy groups do (as we have Klan and Nazi-related advocates), and I realize that this article is an attempt to cover the matter without having it at a magnetic name (as I understand the material above, this is not the name of the movement, because the movement by name attracts pedophile apologists and edit wars), I think we're better off referring the reader to the pedophile equivalents of Simon Wiesenthal for the images. We are not advocacy or counter-advocacy, so I don't think we need to include the magazine covers even as a warning, and as documentation they are likely to offend or titilate our readers. If we agree to take the risk of attracting pedophilic editors who attack the article or use it to find brothers, I think we need to pare it down. I think merging with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a> is a bad idea, as that article surely does attract potential edit wars. It is still my desire and belief that we need as minimal a coverage as possible. My vote is to clean it, but not via Clean Up. The fact that listing it on general Clean Up is liable to draw someone with a motivation to sneak in pedophilia is one argument to delete: the article is simply so difficult to maintain that it needs to be permanently protected, which makes keeping it on a wiki really difficult. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:40, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li>Don't worry about this article <i>attracting</i> pedophile editors. It was started by pedophile editors (or their sympathizers) as a warm and fuzzy discussion of the movement. It was originally titled "childlover." A number of editors (just look at the history) have been trying hard to move this to NPOV. And NPOV <b>is</b> possible in the writing. Of course the <i>content</i> is going to be POV from both sides. <i>C'est la guerre</i>. It is not practical to change the images to the "Simon Wiesenthal" equivalent. (1) That <i>would</i> be POV because "childlovers" would say "that's what a sick person does, that's not what <i>we</i> advocate." (2) they would probably be pornographic or close to it, which the current images are not, and (3) the current images speak eloquently: they show what childlovers (not closet pedophiles) are interested in. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 18:10, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Does a reader who has heard someone refer to the term and so enters it here deserve a blank screen? This is the kind of issue that tests our mettle as purveyors and sharers of information. There's a riddle that goes, "Q: Why do criminal lawyers defend guilty drug dealers? A: They don't defend guilty drug dealers, they defend the law and the process so that it will uphold and protect innocent men when <i>they</i> are charged." The moral (and I pun that word deliberately) is, we cannot afford to begin whittling down the margins that protect the information flow when we come upon something distasteful, or even abhorrent. If we do, they'll come for <b>us</b> next, sometime on down that slippery slope. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_302c.html" title="User:Gary D">Gary D</a> 04:19, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lucky, I came here primarily because of your talk page. (the odd things I have in my watchlist) I'm going to read the article now, line by line, and see if anything is exploitative or unencyclopedic... My verdict: It's encyclopedic, BUT <b>the magazine pictures should go</b>. You don't see pictures of covers of PC Gamer and Computer Shopper on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a>, and you don't see pictures of the covers of Atlas Shrugged and The Wealth of Nations on <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism.html" title="Objectivism">objectivism</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a>. The remainder of the article is encyclopedic; as distasteful as it is, it does appear to be an actual movement. I say <b>merge with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a></b>; that is the primary article in the situation, and any information on the <b>movement</b> should go there. In fact, there's already a section in <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a> for it, "Advocacy of pedophilia". This can include the history of such advocacy, and link (as it already does) to appropriate groups. Ethics can be successfully merged. Furthermore, <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boylove.html" title="Boylove">Boylove</a>, etc., are more accurately redirected to <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>. Redirecting to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">Childlove movement</a> implies <i>boylove</i> et.al. are movements instead of concepts and actions. So, in short: Merge with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 05:10, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

The article itself, however, under the careful editing of several people, has become what a Wikipedia article should be -- informative, impartial reporting on a topic. I already respected the work of the editors involved, but now I respect them even more. You are to be commended for exceptional efforts in exceptional circumstances.

<li>If someone 'neutral' (hard to find someone neutral on an issue like this) edits it, and the article is then locked, I would have no objection to keeping it. Yes, it discussed a movement that performs illegal, and for most people, horrific acts of abuse, but that is no reason to delete it, since having the article doesn't advocate the acts. If you're going to delete it because you disagree with the 'Childlove movement', then you mayaswell go and delete articles on the Nazi party aswell. I can see this article being useful, since if someone needed information on this (a sociology/psychology student, for example), Wikipedia would be a better source than just searching on Google, which could result in some undesirable hits. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksun_f33c.html" title="User:Darksun">Darksun</a> 09:42, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't think of a way, either. But I have to ask: how is this in any way either an endorsement of, or an enticement to, pedophilia? Trust me, a real pedophile has seen much, much worse, even in other covers of that magazine, no less the illegal stuff. Now if you're not a pedophile, and you saw the cover with the smiling boy, you'd think it advertised a water park or a beach resort.

<dd>In Wikipedia, we don't <i>expect</i> articles to be NPOV. A controversial article is going to be full of POV--it almost has to, unless it is very, very short. An NPOV treatment of this article would say "The childlove movement is a political and social movement of people who advocate that adults should have legal sexual access to children." Period. Anything much more has to be POV because it will divide between advocates and opponents. What we <b>do</b> expect is that the material be <i>presented</i> in an NPOV fashion and that it be balanced. The magazine cover with minimal caption is NPOV. If you say "This cover illustrates the admiration that childlovers have for children" or "This cover shows what pedophiles really have in mind," <i>that</i> is POV, even if some people would think one or the other statement was true. == <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 07:21, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I could deal with title change to "Movement to change the legality of paedophilia" and some changes to the article itself, (it reads like an argument in defense of the movement, rather than an encyclopedic article) but the current title is inherently POV and irresponsible, and should not even exist as a redirect <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"></a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">siro</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><font color="#627562"><i>χ</i></font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">o</font></a> 12:52, Aug 3, 2004 (UTC)

As far as it reading like an argument in defense of anything, drink some chamomile tea, sit down calmly, and take a good, thorough read. It reads exactly like one would expect a description of any movement to read - specifically, it contains the movement's goals, reasoning, and so on, and some objections to the movement from outsiders. It is not POV, it is not promotion, and it is not irresponsible. Its really disturbing to me how people are so upset about this article that they can't seem to do anything other than call it names and then not justify their opinions.

<dd>Comment: I think splitting it back into girllove movement and boylove movement maybe a good idea. We can keep childlove as a pointer to these two articles.

<dd>I don't understand what purpose could be served by splitting this into <i>boylove</i> and <i>girllove</i>. They both describe the same notable behavior--the desire to have and justify sex with prepubescent children.

<dd>So, I ask again, why don't we have a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_rape.html" title="Child rape">Child rape</a> article instead of this mealy-mouthed "love" crap?

</li>
<li>Abstain. As someone who identifies himself as a boylover, I've been watching this page transform from something that describes what boylove is in a fairly NPOV manner (it was named "Boylove" back then), into something that perverts boylove into being a gang of pedophiles arguing they should be allowed to have sex with minors. Having been part of online boylove communities since the mid-nineties, I don't recognise myself nor any of my boylover friends in the current revision of the article. Many in the community (myself included) do in fact argue that abstaining from sex is the preferable and morally correct lifestyle of a boylover. Personally, I'd sooner chew my hand off than lay a hand on a boy. The term "Boylover" was in fact adopted by the community to get away from the kind of stigma put on "normal" non-monster pedophiles by the current article, so I suppose it's all very ironic. I'd vote merge, since the current content is more suited for a general article on pedophilia, but I'm abstaining since I hope one day the article can be brought back into line with how the community views itself. This community is very real and deserves fair treatment. (Please understand my posting "anonymously" on this subject) 213.145.178.57 22:17, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your viewpoint. I do agree that there is a lot of prejudice against pedophiles, but I am willing to make the discinction between an active pedophile and a recovering pedophile. Just as, in the 1950s, groups of addicts getting together to recover from drug addiction were arrested, it may be possible for groups of recovering pedophiles who are seeking recovery today to get arrested, so strong is the anti-pedophile sentiment in our soceity today. I very strongly oppose any group which encourages pedophilia in any way, shape, or form, but support pedophiles getting together for the express purpose to encourage each other to not act out on their horrible sexual desires. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 05:41, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Boylover communities also strongly object to the notion of being sick, since it's not exactly productive (and, depending on your sources, not exactly true). I absolutely resent being called "recovering". I am what I am, and I can never change it, but I <i>can</i> decide how I act. Also, I object to your using "pedophilia" as if it was a form of activity. Anybody opposes child sexual abuse, which is what sex with children almost always is, so call it that. Anyway, I was just offering my viewpoint, I'm afraid this thread will turn into a flamefest that will be completely off-topic to the subject at hand, so please, how you would like to distinct people to fit into your world view is not pertinent to whether or not we should keep, merge or delete this article. <i>Addendum</i>: Looking back through the revisions, I see the last "good" revision is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Boylover&amp;oldid=4514368" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Boylover&amp;oldid=4514368" rel="nofollow">00:20, 7 Jul 2004</a>, IMNSHO. This is an accurate and NPOV description of boylove (which is a good achievement considering there is no official definition or requirements for affiliation). Renaming the title to cover both girl- and boylove is strange, since a term like "childlove" is not something that's very much in use at all, and as has been pointed out here, sounds ambigious. I would probably recommend writing a seperate, though brief "Girllove" article and refer to the Boylove article from there. Also, make "Boylove" an alias for "Boylover" and likewise for "Girllove". Alternatively, extend <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> to cover the movements and not be the purely clinical treatment it is today. As for the current "Childlove movement" article, upon further review, I feel like it has completely hijacked the Boylover article and I'm completely offended that it claims to represent me and the community I care so much about.</dd>

<dd>Seriously, I'm not thrilled about this article, but the existence of an article describing a movement to repeal certain laws and transform societal taboos that will probably never be repealed or transformed doesn't harm children. Kids aren't going to go on Wikipedia, see this article, and say, "hey! I can meet some cool grown-ups here to have sex with!" (unless the people who wrote the article are right), and adults aren't going to see this article and think, "ohmigod! I never thought of having sex with children before! What a great idea!" Likewise, pedophiles aren't going to see the article and suddenly lose control and molest thousands of children. Of course, if you want to start a "child safety" group that's certainly your right, but I'd hope that you at least plan to use the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> pages rather than go after articles all vigilante style as Lucky advises above. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 07:06, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ah Seth, we need you on the project - which would hopefully be very quiet. My concern is misrepresentation of the truth and the promulgation of the idea that sexual activity is alright with children <i>if</i> X, Y and Z. I'd see a project doing some to the reconnaissance and helping to facilitate a true NPOV using the usual wiki mechanisms as you say. Have a look at the recent edits to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">Child sexual abuse</a>... and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexuality.html" title="Child sexuality">child sexuality</a> is a complete can of worms that needs some very careful science-based editing - I'm waiting for the resident <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediatric_endocrinologist.html" title="Pediatric endocrinologist">pediatric endocrinologist</a> to return from diabetes camp before nagging him to help me! <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErich_gasboy_b37c.html" title="User:Erich gasboy">Erich</a> 07:32, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may have noticed already that I'm a little concerned with the tendency toward censorship and violently emotional, rather than rational, display that has been evident in this particular vote, so please bear with me while I tiptoe down this here slippery slope. What exactly is it that you're proposing? Where exactly do you draw the line? What, specifically, do you aim to protect children from? How, specifically, do you aim to do so? I'm assuming you're going to restrict your actions to articles specifically oriented toward pedophilia in our time and culture, but really, why stop there? Freud, for example, frequently argued that children, babies even, are very sexual beings, though he did stop short of saying that children should have or be allowed to have sex. Throughout most of human history puberty has been considered the marker of when it is permissable for a child to engage in sexual activity. Should we include a proviso on any article that discusses historical attitudes toward sex and age stating that this is not acceptable in our age? In some cultures that survive today, pre-pubescent children are <i>expected</i> to engage in what we would consider sexual activity (in the particular society I'm thinking of, its more of a ritualized coming of age thing), and grow up to be perfectly healthy. If we write articles on this interesting bit of sexual anthropology, should we include a note saying that, according to modern psychology, this society harms their children? I'd be glad to join the project, to censor the censors, as it were, but I'm remaining skeptical and cynical, and staying far away until there are strict guidelines as to its scope, methodology, and goals. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 09:16, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seth, i suspect we'd not disagree much at all. My motivation for a project comes from:
<ol>
<li>the belief that this page contains an important debate that will not end after the fate of this page is resolved and</li>
<li>a fear of the ongoing insidius POV insertion of our the pedophiles</li>
<li>Overall, I think by bringing together the advocates, censors and censors' censors we'll end up with a better outcome. sound reasonable? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErich_gasboy_b37c.html" title="User:Erich gasboy">Erich</a> 22:41, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Seth, I'm afraid I do fundamentally disagree with your approach, which might be appropriate to an article on cultural attitudes toward children and sexuality, but this article is not about that. It is about a modern movement among adults that wish to change law and culture in order to have sexual access to children. It's as simple as that and should be approached on that level. They say that there is evidence that even babies may have sexuality and that <i>may</i> be true, <i>but they cite this to justify their having sexual access to children</i>; they say that age-of-consent laws are arbitrary and that <i>may</i> be true, <i>but they cite this to justify their having sexual access to children</i>; they say that some young children may be competent to agree to sexual behavior and that <i>may</i> be true, <i>but they cite this to justify their having sexual access to children</i>; they say that young children may engage in sex play, and that <i>may</i> be true, <i>but they cite this to justify their having sexual access to children</i>, they say that some parents would heap guilt upon children for having sexual thoughts and that is bad, and that <i>may</i> be true, <i>but they cite this to justify their having sexual access to children</i>.</dd>

<dd>Since when have scientists, mental health professionals or the intellectual elite been wholly <i>objective</i> in their anaylses of moral issues? <i>Au contraire</i>, science is often very sympathetic to the moral climate of the day (for a good example of what happens when scientists defy moral authority, see <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo_Galilei_17f8.html" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>).

<dd>Insidious, eh? I haven't been keeping up with the various pedophilia-related articles, so I suppose I can't judge. Regardless, and I don't mean to be a jerk here, its certainly within your rights to create a child protection group, though to my knowledge a group aimed at censoring edits by and supporting a particular, well-defined group of people is unprecedented. If you do start this group, I'll certainly check in, and if, as I've stated above, you have <i>clearly</i> outlined goals, methods, and a <i>strictly</i> defined scope, I'd certainly consider joining. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 22:55, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you can see, Seth, I am in favor of <i>keeping</i> this article. I think we need to know what a real movement of a group wants, why they want it, how they hope it get it, and why they think they are entitled to it. As to a group to look at children's issues, some might want to use it for censorship, but I see nothing <i>inherently</i> wrong, any more than there are groups who interest themselves in other specialized issues. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 15:43, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not necessarily saying that there is anything inherently wrong with a group to protect children, though as you can see above I'm not exactly sure what the group is supposed to protect children <i>from</i>. What I am saying is that it is, again, as far as I know, something new in Wikipedia's history to create a group whose sole purpose is to watch and censor the edits of one particular, well-defined group of people (which I gather is what the planned group will be about). Singling out a group of people like this is fairly disturbing to me. My second concern, and its not that I honest-to-God believe this will happen, but that I want to be sure it doesn't, is that the group have immaculately defined boundaries so that members don't feel justified going into unrelated articles (say, articles on Freud or ancient Greece) and saying "this is harmful to children!", followed by VfDs and edits. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 18:09, Aug 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Zanthalon actually gets to the point when he criticizes scientists and casts this as a <i>moral</i> issue. Pedophiles (and also, I understand, supporters of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">Bestiality</a>) have come to say, "well, society has been against civil rights and feminism and homosexuality, and was wrong, so society must be wrong here and we are right." Why? Is everything that someone wants to do that society prohibits really good? Why? Because you want it? You are trying to back your self-serving theory with science and then portray yourself as <i>more moral.</i> Civil rights, feminism and homosexuality all have one thing in common: the argument that a group of <i>adults</i> are prevented from having the same rights as others similarly situated. Pedophiles are fighting for the right to have access to other people's children in the guise of "liberating" them. I grew up when Jim Crow was legal in the U.S. South. Black people (and many whites) were fighting for the right of all people to walk into a lunch counter, purchase a sandwich and sit down and eat it. They weren't fighting for the right of any group of people to walk into someone else's home and "liberate" their food. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 15:32, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"They weren't fighting for the right of any group of people to walk into someone else's home and "liberate" their food."</i> Yes, ownership is the issue here. This society does not treat children as human beings, but as property, just as men once treated their wives as property, slave owners treated their slaves (who were not, after all, even fully human) as property and landowners treated their peasants as property. In each case, the enfranchised claimed that some sort of "special status" entitled them to rights (to political and economic power as well as to ownership of the disenfranchised) that the disenfranchised did not have. Examples of such "special status" in the past are <i>landowner</i> or <i>white</i> or <i>male</i>. Now the "special status" of the enfranchised is <i>adult</i>. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanthalon_91fa.html" title="User:Zanthalon">Zanthalon</a> 16:54, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again you move to the heart of the issue. Minor children <i>are</i> a/the property of their parents in several meanings of the word. They are <i>not</i> the property of their parents in the sense of other property, that they may be bought and sold, or their persons or labor rented out at their parents' whim, but they are property in the sense that parents must protect and provide for them, and have the right to control many aspects of their lives, and it is expected that they will do this in a manner that is in the child's best interest. Many societies (and the U.S. especially, it would seem) are loath to step in the way of the parent's judgment on discretionary matters affecting their child.</dd>

<dd>Now let's be clear: there are organizations which attempt to intervene on behalf of children when they think the parents err, but the bar is, and should be, high where contravening the parents' wishes is concerned. But what these organizations all have in common is that, even if their concern or interest is debatable, they are expected to genuinely be interested in the child's welfare, <i>without enhancing their own self-interest</i>. We would not tolerate an organization that "rescued" children from an unfit parent in order to provide child labor to make cheap products for the organization's profit. Similarly, pedophiles are at interest in their concern for children's rights. What standing does an adult who wants to use a child sexually have to assert that the child is <i>not</i> the parent's "property," but is, in effect, their own? -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 05:05, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, it was my doing. This was not the article under dispute anyway, but I suppose it having been made a referer may perhaps include it as disputed. I don't believe in editing wars, and it won't happen again. That said, I tried hard to make the reinstated page completely objective, <i>but</i> focused on the boylove movement, not pedophilia as a clinical case or the kind of NAMBLA political activism of the current "Childlove movement" article (there are seperate pages for both of those). You have to understand that this article tries to document a social and widely online community and movement, and as such it has to be largely about how that community or movement views itself. In covering that aspect, some may perceive it as being "sympathetic", as was pointed out here. However, it also covers how the community is viewed from the outside, so it does attempt objectivity. I suppose we are at the limits of what is possible with a format such as Wikipedia -- covering this subject encyclopedically is not possible because of the strong moral feelings people have, and their firm beliefs about what is true. "Field experts" are disregarded. So the only way of covering the Boylove community is in such a way that readers <i>from</i> the community doesn't recognize it in the article and are left offended at the suggestion that they are criminal by association or clinically ill, when crime and illess is not even relevant. So, although my vote cannot count because I am not logged in as I post this, I now appeal to everyone to vote to delete "Boylove" as well as "Childlove movement". I hope to write a few sentences of the subject in <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> perhaps, and we'll see if that is acceptable. 213.145.178.57 09:06, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has been up for almost two weeks now (minimum time=five days) and I think we need to begin to move toward resolution. Two points from the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Guideline for administrators</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion policy</a> tell us that this article isn't going to be deleted. First, there needs to be a "rough consensus" to delete, generally accepted for purposes of deletion to be ~2/3. Second, is the boldfaced admonition: <b>When in doubt, don't delete.</b> So there is a prejudice on Wikipedia against deleting articles, and any admin that deleted this article now would be looking at a messy RfC.</p>
<p>Now this article, if the tally is correct, shows a plurality (21/8/18) to <b>Keep</b> the article. Even if we consider all the <b>Merge</b> votes to be <b>Delete</b> votes, we have a vote of 26-21 (55.32%) to delete, not even close to a rough consensus. So the question logically is: "do we prefer to keep this as a separate article, or delete it as a separate article and merge the content into <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophilia.html" title="Paedophilia">Paedophilia</a>?</p>
<p>Please, let's take this one step at a time. After we've decided this point, then we can discuss the mechanics of implementing the consensus. I'm leaving an Absolute Delete option, so deletionists don't feel disenfranchized, but please be aware that there is no consensus for absolute deletion, and your vote may be thrown out where you could have an opportunity to go for keep or merge.</p>
<p><i>Note: "Delete" with or without merge implies keeping a redirect, so there is no need for a separate category for these that would muddy this vote further.</i></p>
<p><b>Keep this as a separate article</b></p>

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>I think that any discussion of the future of this article needs to include a comprehensive discussion of the disposition of other articles dealing with this topic as well. I think that much of the trouble here began not just as a result of the controversial nature of this article, but as a result of not having an overall strategy for addressing the various issues in play here. Rather than approaching things in a logical fashion, more articles got tacked on here and there.</p>
<ul>
<li>IMHO, there should be <i>one</i> article, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> that deals with the medical, psychological and forensic definitions of the word pedophilia. There might be an argument for keeping the <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebophilia.html" title="Ephebophilia">ephebophilia</a> article as well. The other articles (chronophilia, nepiophilia, etc.) should just be redirected to the main article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../r/i/n/Rind_et_al..html" title="Rind et al.">Rind et al.</a> page has been overwhelmingly rejected as a candidate for deletion, but I think that it desperately needs to be renamed, or expanded to include other controversial academic studies or books (like Judith Levine's <i>Harmful to Minors</i> or Harris Mirkin's <i>The Pattern of Sexual Politics: Feminism, Homosexuality and Pedophilia</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This article should include all articles dealing with the "pedophile rights movement" and perhaps should be renamed such. All other articles (Girllover, Boylover, Childlover, etc.) should redirect here, and the newly established Definitions of Pedophilia should be incorporated into it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I'd prefer to keep, but ultimately keep or merge doesn't make a lot of difference to me. If it is merged, it is almost going to have to be a section in <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> with the same title (which means more people will probably see it), and it will result in a pretty long article, but if it makes people happy I'm all for it. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 08:50, Aug 14, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would recommend adding the following text to <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a>, "The apparently synonymous term childlove (along with the more specific terms boylove and girllove) have been floated as less pernicious sounding. Some advocates of decriminalizing pedophilia, as well as some pedophiles who choose sexual abstinence, have promoted these terms in hopes of reducing the social stigma of both the desire for and the practice of adult-child sex." and then delete this article. <b>REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE DELETE WE SHOULD GET RID OF THE PICTURES</b> <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> 18:40, Aug 17, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>comment: I agree, although I would rephrase that as "The terms boylove and girllove have been floated as less pernicious sounding. Some advocates of decriminalizing adult-child sex, as well as many pedophiles who choose sexual abstinence, have promoted these terms in hopes of reducing the social stigma of the attraction to children or the practice of adult-child sex." Reasons: 1) The terms are not necessarily synonymous. 2) "childlove" is a word invented by wikipedians to come up with a general article title, and is not used in general. 3) "Pedophilia" is not criminalized, adult-child sex is. 4) The terms are used mainly to describe attraction (hence the "love" part), not necessarily desire for sex. I realize the term is from <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_pedophilia.html" title="Definitions of pedophilia">Definitions of pedophilia</a>, and in fact I am one of the editors of that article. So I like the sentence to begin with, but the rewrite is a lot closer to the truth and has a lot less biased language in my opinion (in fact, I'll update the definitions article). <i>Disclaimer</i>: I am a boylover (one who has chosen a life of abstinence) and although I as such know plenty about the terms and the communities behind them, you can't know if my rewrite of the term is part of a grande conspiracy to enslave your children. You have only my word to believe when I say I would really, really like the truth to be covered about this topic. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayboy_b087.html" title="User:Clayboy">Clayboy</a> 23:38, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm voting keep only because there's too much "worthy" content to go into the paedophilia article. This is something we should mention, not throw a blanket over and ignore, but there's just too much useful material that it couldn't be crammed into the paedophilia article. The image of the girl is rather questionable, though — I suggest that that be removed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:57, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think that this article presents an interesting documentation into the existence of movements whose stated goals is to have some specific practices that most of society considers "bad", "digusting" and harmful to others. Removing the said documentation won't make those people go away. I'm unsure about merging this into the main pedophilia article. The main pedophilia article documents some emotional and sexual urges and practices; this article documents some attempts at making these practices legal. This is the same difference as documenting homosexuality, and documenting movements which pushed for the legalization of homosexuality and the repealing of so-called sodomy laws (caveat: I'm not claiming pedophilia and homosexuality are closely related phenomena, just that they are practices that were at some points judged disgusting and immoral, up to the point of sentencing those who practiced them to very hard sentences). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 15:58, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
