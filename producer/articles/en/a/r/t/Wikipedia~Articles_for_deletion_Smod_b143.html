<p>Non-notable modification for HL2 - could use a mention in the HL2 article, but I don't think it deserves it's own article. I'm also concerned the page is being used as a readme file/advert for the add-on. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 19:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> since certainly a few HL2 players <i>have</i> to wander in here every once in a while: Is this a significant or well-known mod to the game? I can't pretend I know enough about the game or its mods to know myself. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 06:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Answer</b>This is a significant mod that has been featured in magazines, has a forum dedicated to it that has had 200,000 hits and is an invaluable resource to many. Please leave the page up since the internet can handle it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.160.12 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.212.160.12.html" title="User talk:71.212.160.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.160.12_08bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.160.12">contribs</a>) 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Witty Reparté</b> Which magazines? Can we have sources? And my cat has a forum dedicated to him that has had almost 5,000 hits in the past six months - but it doesn't make it notable! take a look at <a href="http://topsites.moddb.com/mod/?game=61" class="external text" title="http://topsites.moddb.com/mod/?game=61" rel="nofollow">this top 100</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 14:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional Info</b> The author is japanese and hasn't submitted it to any english sites anywhere, but many English sites had already gotten the site, simply by browsing the Smod community forum, and is still spreading among. Despite being relatively difficult to get and the total lack of english information available from the author the mod has gotten 200,000 hits in six months on one forum. If it wasn't a noteworthy mod it might not have got this amount of attention.</li>
<li><b>Additional Info</b> The community finds this page useful and it should not be deleted. This is the second most popular mod for HL2 after Garry's mod and therefore justifies an entry in wikipedia. If you have any doubt look at <a href="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=148509" class="external text" title="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=148509" rel="nofollow">Facepunch</a>, <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=366420" class="external text" title="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=366420" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> or <a href="http://www.hl-improvement.com/forums/index.php?board=29.0" class="external text" title="http://www.hl-improvement.com/forums/index.php?board=29.0" rel="nofollow">H.I.T.</a>. It has also been featured in <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.pcgamer.com/" rel="nofollow">PCGamer</a>. I suspect someone is just trying to make trouble by proposing this popular mod's deletion. Please remove the page from the delete category--Fitzroydoll 12:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The three links you have just posted are all forum posts by the people who run Smod, and PC Gamer features HL2 mods all the time as part of it's publication - what we need is proof it's popular beyond a forum link or anything like that - a top 100? Or a review that places it in the top few mods? I resent the implication that I'm out to make trouble - hardly! <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 23:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This goes to show how little you know about this game and why your personal opinion that it should be deleted should be ignored. Not one of the thousands of posts on those pages is by the makers of SMOD, that's all by players and fans. In any case my post was for the benefit of moderators who will hopefully observe from this that SMOD is very popular and that its page should remain in the Wikipedia.--Fitzroydoll 08:31, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As an avid fan, follower, and player of the Half-Life games, I can say with great certainty that this mod is in fact <i>very</i> popular, and therefore notable. Smod was a <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/features/motw/smod.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.planethalflife.com/features/motw/smod.shtm" rel="nofollow">Featured Mod of the Week</a> at <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.planethalflife.com/" rel="nofollow">Planet Half-Life</a>. It's already been mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html#Mods_and_expansions" title="Half-Life 2">HL2 article</a> for some time now. It's unfortunate, though, that the creator doesn't speak English, meaning that you wont often find it submitted to English mod sites where you can easily compare their ranking. Regardless of this, the mod has become well known throughout the HL2 community due to its outlandish, over-the-top, and amazingly impressive effects. As mentioned before, its a commonly known HL2 mod and it has been mentioned in PC Gamer before. The mod has been released for quite a while now, making it well established, and it is updated very frequently (The last update would be July 25, four days ago). The article could use a little work, but if you have no knowledge of the game, mod, or the community, then you'd be making a very large (and false) assumption saying that Smod is non-notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 09:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC) I also agree with Marphy black for the same reasons --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETOMNORTHWALES_9ce5.html" title="User:TOMNORTHWALES">Tom</a> 10:47, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Result: <b>Keep</b> it is - although I request more reliable sources? <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 21:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - SMOD is one of the most noteworthy mods for HL2. SMOD is a mod so popular that people have actually modded the mod to make new mods. Including myself. The mod is extremely customisable, allowing people to totally change the location, appearence and function of weapons and enemies in the game. This has allowed people who have no coding (programming) ability to make mods for HL2, by heavily customising SMOD into a unique experience. And yes, SMOD has been in PC Gamer magazine. Also, because the mod's documentation is in Japanese and there is no english readme file, this wikipedia article is one of the few places that people can read what features are in the mod, other than people's descriptions on forums, or the Mod of the Week article on Planet Half-Life, or the PC gamer article. your evil twin 30 July 2006</li>
