<dl>
<dd>This article about an apparently non-notable lawyer who teaches at a Canadian school has touched off a flame war concerning his grading policies. Multiple edits have been made to the article over the last few weeks, but no new verifiable information has appeared. "prod" and "verify" tags have been inserted and removed. Threats have been made (see article history). As someone uninvolved in the issue, I suggest just deleting the article. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 04:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm in two minds about this, but a google search suggests that he really is a full professor. If so, that alone <strike>should</strike> may be enough for notability. But let's delete it to take the heat out, if people are actually making threats and no one is contributing anything worthwhile.

<li><b>Comment</b> This looks like a borderline case to me as far as <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> goes. If he is a full professor at a prestigious university, that is a distinction that <strike>would probably</strike> might get him over the line. I've been assuming that the University of Ottawa would be pretty prestigious, but I realise it's not Oxford or Harvard or something, so it's open to argument. Notability is borderline. Article seems irredeemable at the moment. My vote stays as it was, just commenting. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:30, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For what it's worth (and remember how I voted) see criterion 8 and then point 9 of the examples, which says "Receiving full professorship at a prestigious university, or receiving a named professorship at a reputable university, may be considered an award or honor under criterion 8." Note also that it is says, "may" not "shall", which makes the whole thing even more borderline (hence I've re-edited my edits above), and that I'm only answering the question, not acting as advocate for the "keep" case.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:43, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Let me address a few points. First of all, the University of Ottawa is in Canada's capital and is, "Canada's University". It is one of the more important Universities in Canada behind McGill and University of Toronto. Second, Yvon Duplessis is a full professor, who has been published in many French journals. Wikipedia should not be biased against this despite the fact that these journals have smaller circulation due to smaller language population. Third, it is true, if you research on QuickLaw or WestLaw (I may not reproduce it here for copyright reasons) you will see that he did indeed litigate the Supreme Court decision Entreprises E.A. Bourque (Québec) Inc. v. Hull (Ville) [1996] C.S.C.R. no 368. Fourth, I have heard from other professors that he does indeed grade on a 120 point scale and the average grade in most of his classes is usually below 50%. Although not enough to be notable on its own, it is an interesting anecdoate and highly irregular. The man is a graduate of Harvard and I have been told he is related to former Quebec Premier <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Duplessis_1aee.html" title="Maurice Duplessis">Maurice Duplessis</a>. This is a <b>Strong Keep</b> not because he is highly notable, but because he clearly passes the de-minimus test to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/b/User%7EAnber_f9d4.html" title="User:Anber">Anber</a> 07:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see. You are saying that although he is not highly notable, he is notable enough. Why not just say that, and make all our lives easier. If you want to impress us, then do so by being clear in your communictaions.

<dd>"Canada's University" is the institution's advertising slogan. It proves absolutely nothing. Furthermore, "I have heard" and "I have been told" do not meet the Wikipedia standard for a verifiable source. HistoryBA 13:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It`s borderline but much less borderline than a lot of Wikipedia articles. I agree with the writers who say that the context of a French Canadian professor should be considered when interpreting Wiki rules because there should not be a systematic bias against an equally notable segment of the population at large who just happen to be less recognized on internet sites. Remember the internet overwhelmingly more English than it is French; Mr. Duplessis has been published in many print Media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I noticed that nobody has refuted his involvement in the Hull Supreme Court Case. Coupled with his full status (part of the prof test) and also his bizzare tendencies this seems enough (barely)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: A case upon which there are only a handful of unique G-hits and nothing notable off of Lexum; may I ask why you consider this case any sort of a landmark, and why Duplessis was any more notable than the other attorneys involved in the case? So he litigated a case before the Canadian Supreme Court; do you have any notion how <i>very</i> many attorneys do that every session? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 03:24, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
