<p><b>Delete</b> - an indiscriminate and highly subjective list with no standardized criteria for inclusion. What constitutes becoming "famous" after death? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 09:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. List particularly fails to discriminate between people who became famous <i>because</i> of their deaths (notable victims of hate crimes, those who had laws named after them) and those who became famous <i>after</i> their deaths but because of what they did during life (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Drake_2052.html" title="Nick Drake">Nick Drake</a> being a prime example).

<dd>That's not quite the way I meant. As it currently stands, the list includes (but divides between) people whose manner of death made them notable and people who simply became famous after they died.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list has criteria for inclusion and is categorized in a useful way. It seems an important article to assist in finding the name of someone when we only recall the general circumstances of their death and becoming famous.

<p>I think this is a very, very fascinating and informative list. It isn't nearly as subjective as many people have stated. It is just the type of page Wikipedia needs. <small>— Jordangg40 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jordangg40_6e66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jordangg40">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> If changing <i>famous</i> to <i>notable</i>, the criterion for inclusion becomes perfectly objective: being the subject of an article in the Wikipedia. Of course it must be cleaned up (the different sections overlap, for instance), but this is what editing is for, not deletion. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 10:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point here is not entirely over the definition of "notable", it's over the entirely subjective and dubious judgment of who and who didn't "become famous only in death." This can <i>not</i> be established simply by changing the article title, and this is why it doesn't belong here.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 23:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The idea behind changing "famous" to "notable" is not primarily that it include only people in WP (although that is implied)--rather it is to list people who are notable (by WP standards) only or largely because of the circumstances of their death. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>In that case, the entirety of the section entitled <i>People whose achievements were only posthumously recognized</i> would seem to lie outside the ambit of the list. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree. That should be deleted or turned into a separate list (including, I assume, mostly writers, musicians, painters, etc.). Posthumous recongition for <i>achievements</i> is separate from notability gained to the <i>circumstances</i> of their death (e.g., unusual deaths, killed by a famous person, first person killed by etc.). I have deleted the section in question, would you agree to let the article remain and be cleaned up?

<dd>I'm still not totally convinced - I feel there's a better title even than one which replaces "famous" with "notable", and a couple of the remaining names still don't quite sit too well - but I'll have a closer look and see what I can see. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the title List of people who became notable only in death is somewhat problematic (and quite long). I'm thinking List of people notable for their death might be an alternative (it's two words shorter), but it may be less descriptive. I would appreciate your suggestions, if you have any. My feeling is that this information (cleaned up, of course) should be present on WP, but I'm just not sure how to incorporate it. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is certainly the kind of thing which is very interesting and would be nice to have somewhere (particularly if "interesting" were the only criterion for inclusion here - a lot of those "Miscellany"-style books have lists like this). The suggested alternate title, though, doesn't fill me with great joy because not all the list does what it says on the tin. Those who are notable because of what happened to their corpse, for example, aren't really notable "for their death" so much as "for what happened next". There was an AfD ages ago for something like "List of Notable Deaths", which would be interesting as a comparative point, but I can't remember the title of the article to find it here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see your point. Perhaps "in death" is better after all. However, even if the title is not perfect, I think that as long as the introduction clearly spells out what the article is about, there should not be too much of a problem (or rather, there should, but it should be consigned to the article's talk page where multiple people can try to come up with a better title over time).

<p><b>keep</b> As one of the main editors of this list, but not it's originator, I found the list had potential but at the time I found it, it was totally pointless, subjective, &amp; filled with original research &amp; POV entries. I developed some guidelines to help make a "cutoff point" for fame to make it more objective &amp; also debated the word "in". The aspects which came out of it are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Credentials for making the list were:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Lasting fame (must be dead by 3 years at least)</li>
<li>National or international fame (no local fame)</li>
<li>Victims are grouped if of the same event or chain of events</li>
<li>Reason for their lasting fame is noted with their entry<br /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The debate over the word "in" is also in the discussion area. "In" could mean "because of" &amp; it could simply mean "in the state of", which covers both those who's means death was the reason for fame as well as those who were only posthumously famous.<br />
I had every itent of making this a meaningful list after coming upon it in it's horrible state. Those were attempts to put guides on it to make sure it was a useful &amp; consice list. I do think it has a meaningful purpose &amp; I found it because it partially filled the thing I was looking for. So please, this is not a list for deletion but cleanup &amp; refinement. Some greater objective criteria needs to be put up. The originator refused any attempts to write out criteria, but I really think it needs some. My proposed criteria are right there for scrutiny &amp; discussion. --<a href="../../../d/u/e/User%7EDuemellon_5403.html" title="User:Duemellon">Duemellon</a> 15:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
