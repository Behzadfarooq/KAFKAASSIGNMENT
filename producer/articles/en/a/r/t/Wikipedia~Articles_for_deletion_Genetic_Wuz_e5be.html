<li><b>Deanna (Revolution Radio)</b> - I enjoy playing Genetic Wuz. They have a unique sound which portrays the younger musicians in Europe who are having a go. I'm sick of commercial music. Its rubbish! Genetic Wuz is fresh and creative, which in my opinion shows up a lot of the commercial music we play it along side. I think this album is taking the next generation of musicians in another direction - young people are wanting to be different, to stand out, more than other generations have in the past. Of this, I'm a massive supporter. <small><i>Unsigned edit by 84.92.81.108 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.81.108_8dbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.81.108">contribs</a>)</i></small>

As I said half of the entry is a reveiw from a music magazine (a mag is media guys) and at the bottom of the entry is a link to a radio station that plays the album quite often (plus one of the DJ's posted her own opinion). There should be no more discussing: keep the page (<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> says so).

<dd>The sockpuppet remarks are directed at the jillions of unsigned new users voting here with no other contributions. Those are considered sockpuppets. As to your other point, airplay on one station and an article in one minor magazine does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. Regardless, the sockpuppet tactics will backfire because articles supported by sockpuppets generally tend to attract real delete votes on principle. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 20:36, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The problem is that we don't have evidence of the notability of this group. They may be played on radio stations, but we've got no way of knowing it. Just getting on a few radio stations may not be enough. Had you read my comment, I said that I was familiar with Crossrhytms. I event went so far as to try find its circulation numbers, but I failed in that attempt. I stick by my original statement--it's a niche magazine for those heavily into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Christian_Music_8d53.html" title="Contemporary Christian Music">Contemporary Christian Music</a>. Finally, an English wikipedia will tend to be somewhat US-centric due to the number of English speaking internet users in the US versus the number of English speaking internet users outside the US.

<li><b>Commenting again</b>. Okay I can see you guys (except for a few of you) don't think this band is important enough to mention on the (non-paper) wikipedia at the moment though I have tried to establish that such things as the fact that it has had frequent radio play in the UK and that it has had a larger feature in a magazine. Maybe you guys don't think that is enough. It is obviously one music geek Vs. quite a few SW and comic book geeks (not trying to be offencive by the way, Kross admits it). Okay here is the thing: Sick of the sock puppet larck (what the heck is up with the not liking new people). You do know there are lots of people that use this site that don't have users right? well whatever guys it is up to the boys upstairs to decide i guess (wish i was one). oh yeah Sasquatch has been the biggest dude yet (except for DJ Dea of revolution radio) --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant_Fletcher_ac8b.html" title="User:Grant Fletcher">Granted</a> 13:22, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Every little band with a 7" has their own Wikipedia page.

<li>I would just like to mention that you are not a nerd. Nerds do well in school and then end up making lots and lots of money, such as Bill Gates and even the giver of life to this sad and pointless being, namely Start Wars, George Lucas. You on the other hand have achieved nothing. Nerds are good and what they do best, for example, figuring out how to get to the moon. Something worthy of society, whereas you have done nothing except written down a few people who don’t exist.

<li>Not only is it his first edit ever, its his *only* edit. Same with you. Question: Would the encyclopedia have entries for every small time musical group, especially one that hardly registers any hits on Google? Didn't think so.
