<p>A musician with "massive success" but no entries on allmusic or artistdirect; Zero Google hits for "Kharisma Records"; Only five hits for '"alex vera" "keep it real"', and the top one is a myspace page. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> as non-notable musician. This page is most likely part of the "massive music campaign" mentioned on his recently-launched website. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 00:16, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>A quick look at his website makes it clear that this was made up in an attempt to sound notable. It says that he has just released a demo which he is using to try to get a record deal, not a massive success by any means. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 00:40, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Though there's quite a few results in a Google search for "Alex Vera," the only relevant ones are for his own website and MySpace. Likely to simply be self-promotion. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 00:20, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Do not delete- per the notability defintion 'Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above.' His co-writing with Essra Mohawk makes him qualify for non-deletion. Contact her at essra@rockersusa.com to verify if you must. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 65.34.177.39 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.34.177.39_0f0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.34.177.39">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>Don't delete: I agree with the above comment. Also I know he has had a song called 'Holiday' on the Winter Music Conference 2005 Compilation CD. Site www.wintermusicconference.com. Per above definitions from link mentioned by Bobby1011, Has been prominently featured in any major music media. He's been published, I say keep the article. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 71.196.33.3 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.196.33.3_37e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.196.33.3">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>A track on a minor compilation CD which you have to pay to get on is not really "featured in major music media." Not to mention, the website does not list the artists on the CD, so it cannot even be verified that he is on it. In addition, the contributions with Essra Mohawk are also unverifiable (he doesn't even mention them on his site). What is verifiable (if we treat his site as a reputable source) is that he's putting out a demo in hopes of landing a record deal. This fails the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as already mentioned. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 05:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>He mentions it in the link entitled 'career' that he has collaborated with Essra Mohawk.</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> why bother deleting when this will probably be added back in here within the year if this guy's popularity increases? Jason777 13:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think this qualifies as he has the notability by ONE of the criteria listed at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> 'Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above.' His co-writing with Essra Mohawk is the only thing he needs as the definition at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSICsimply</a> states needs one requirement. Keep.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_Myspace_test_d025.html" title="User:Stifle/Myspace test">myspace test</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 09:34, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> you're wrong. If you read the MySpace test page <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_Myspace_test_d025.html" title="User:Stifle/Myspace test">myspace test</a> it says: 'most notable concepts, people, bands, etc. at least own their own domain.' He does own his own domain it's www.alexvera.com. The MySpace rule applies only if MySpace is his ONLY domain, in this case it's an additional domain and not his only one. Madonna has a MySpace page too, www.myspace.com/madonna along with Marcos Hernandez www.myspace.com/marcoshernandez and Gorillaz www.myspace.com/gorillaz. Does this make them ineligible too? Read before you answer and I say keep the article.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Crazyeights (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crazyeights_efa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crazyeights">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Having a myspace in itself is not a disqualification to being notable. But when you have a myspace and a new domain name which isn't finished yet, this begins to cast some doubts. Also let it be known that this is Crazyeights first and (as of now) only edit to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 16:39, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This may be my first edit to Wikipedia but that should have no bearing over my knowledge and input to this matter. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Crazyeights (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crazyeights_efa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crazyeights">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore let the record show that www.alexvera.com is NOT a new domain name as you mention, per www.godaddy.com it was created on January 16, 2001. Being that the domain name was registered more than 5 years ago does not make it a new domain name. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Crazyeights (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crazyeights_efa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crazyeights">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wasn't really interested in this conversation but since I saw lots of posts on it i just wanted to contribute. Alex Vera also has another domain alexandervera.com created on: 12-Apr-02. -Jessika Diaz</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Also, he is listed under <a href="http://www.rockmusiclist.com/rock_lat.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rockmusiclist.com/rock_lat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockmusiclist.com/rock_lat.htm</a> Rock and Roll Discography Reference.
