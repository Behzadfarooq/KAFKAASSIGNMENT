<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>There are many conflicting claims in this discussion and little <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> evidence. On the strict vote count, I find 8 clear "delete" votes, 8 "keep" votes (three had to be discounted as such new accounts that they can not be reliably differentiated from <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> accounts), one that was too ambiguous to call and one explicit "userfy" vote.</p>
<p>I was unable to substantiate most of the claims made by the "keep" voters. Even after reading through the comments and opinions presented, it is not clear to me that this person does in fact meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>Further, it is unclear whether the subject of this article participated in edits to the article or not. Someone using the subject's name for a username <i>did</i> create an account just in time to participate in this discussion (and has not been back since). Based on the pattern of edits, I have a suspicion that the account may itself be a sockpuppet. I have so far been unable to confirm or exclude that hypothesis. If the subject did participate in either the editing of the article or this discussion, please note that such participation is <b>strongly</b> discouraged. Wikipedia has two inviolate rules - articles must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and must be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Both those objectives are exponentially harder when the subject of a biography is participating.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion to override the strict vote count on this decision. Noting that <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhonnor_2922.html" title="User:Khonnor">user:khonnor</a> contains nothing more than a link to this article (and was created <i>after</i> this discussion was started), I am going to move the article to his user space. If/when this article is nominated to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>, I strongly request that the participants restrict their comments to the facts and evidence necessary to establish whether this person meets the appropriate <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:50, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Again: I have released on multiple net labels and have gotten coverage from multiple influtential publications like NME. This whole debate is very frustrating due to the fact that users are vandalizing my page with non-factual information when it was originally factual. The fact that one user changed my hometown from Saint Johnsbury, Vermont to "Vermont, Illnois" proves how little dedication and knowledge that the user has of the afformentioned scene and my music. Please take the time to look at the history of this stub and the petty revisions users have made in reaction to wwcarpen/everythingrecords/aghost.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this page is deleted it will be created again by a fan, and if this is not possible more issues will arise. My music has conceived a fan-base larger than I can control. Does this not qualify me as a legitimate artist?</p>
<p>In reaction to: "*<s><b>Abstain</b>. Don't really know. It's now verifiable, but it's not all that impressive. Don't much care.

I have deleted your comment due to sheer ignorance of the scene and misinformation plus I found it quite offensive. I have (reluctantly) corrected the mistakes you have made to my page (and forgiven your personal evaluation of my creative work) and this is worth less of my time every minute.</p>
<p>A worthless pedantic mess.</p>
<p>This username was created to protect mine and my label's namesake. Stub existed prior to my posts. And thankfully users Westifer and Steinsky logged their user names. Are they going to be elected for VFD because they are (however distantly) to aghost and wwcarpen?</p>

<dd>this isnt just an integrity of the artist issue this is about the wiki community deciding they know more about an artists persona than the artist themselves.

Stick to the policies; age is not a factor here. Notability is. If being featured on MTV is insufficient, then everything is insufficient. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 02:45, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is absurd; quit the ad-hominem attacks and spite. "Handwriting"'s been reviewed on Pitchfork (among other places previously noted). The lack of a presence on AMG is AMGs problem. I don't care whether or not the artist had a part in making the article, it is objectively notable. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKine_d5f0.html" title="User:Kine">Kine</a> 16:50, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And to quote <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WikiProject Music guidelines</a>: "A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, dj etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: ... 4. Has been prominently featured in any major music media".</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Khonnor is a notable, and becoming more and more so, musician. He complies with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> #4 for having his release “Handwriting” featured/reviewed in over thirty publications, including more wide-known New York Times, NME, and Pitchfork Media. Not to mention being the feature in an episode of MTVe produced documentary series This Is Our Music. Wouldn’t MTV be considered the most prominent music media powerhouse? He also follows under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> #6. Being notable in IDM is very iffy, seeing as IDM has become quite a general term. When artists from Aphex Twin and µ-Ziq to Telefon Tel Aviv and Boards of Canada have been considered IDM -- it is almost as general as the term “alternative” or “indie.” He is, however, notable in the netlabel scene. Netlabels, although exist almost exclusively in digital format, may not seem tangible, but are definitely quite prominent. With three releases as Grandma on Monotonik, one release on 8Bit Peoples as I, Cactus and others (including Clown Connecktion, although I am not completely sure that is him). And now with a “physical” release on a “real” music label, although not a netlabel, would deem that he is quite a musician. Having over five decent releases, with a good-sized fanbase of listeners, how does any of this not make Khonnor a musician and notable for being on Wikipedia? If anything, his stub should be expanded. --Jordan Burman 09:13, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
