<dd>For the benefit of those not party to this particular in-joke, can you please explain why the line "The A4018 is an British A-road which runs from Bristol city centre to Cribbs Causeway via places such as Westbury-on-Trym." on a page by itself is something we cannot do without? I'd be all for keeping this as a separate article if the road actually had some shred of importance attached to it, however, it doesn't even have that (to which I can personally attest, having travelled down it several times). Thanks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User:82.15.28.195">82.15.28.195</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User talk:82.15.28.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.28.195_2384.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.28.195">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I believe the lifts in my high-rise office building have at least a shred of importance to the thousands of people who also work there. Not only do they number more than the residents of Westbury-on-Trym (which, BTW, is hyphenated), the lifts probably carry more people than the A4018. Since we do not, and clearly should not, have an article for Ty Glas Towers lift no. 6, by logical deduction there's <i>less</i> reason to keep this as a separate article. Merge/redirect into a series of articles a la <a href="http://uk-roads.co.uk/roadlists/r10/" class="external text" title="http://uk-roads.co.uk/roadlists/r10/" rel="nofollow">Roads By Ten</a> might seem sensible, but keeping separate articles is going to lead to a serious case of stubitis - lots of stubs but no actual content. Similarly, if the best reason you can come up with for keeping it is effectively "Well, why not?", then keeping <i>as is</i> most definitely <i>cannot</i> be the answer. Of course, this may be different where you come from, but here on Earth this is certainly the case. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User:82.15.28.195">82.15.28.195</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User talk:82.15.28.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.28.195_2384.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.28.195">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu.html" title="Mu">Mu</a>. It's difficult to compare, due to te fact that in the UK we number roads by classification (M &gt; A1 &gt; A2 &gt; B, Ax &gt; Axx/Axxx &gt; Axxxx) whereas in the US there are three parallel systems. There are the national networks, the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_highway_3f4b.html" title="US highway">US highways</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_highway.html" title="Interstate highway">Interstate highways</a> (confusingly, neither <i>has</i> to cross a state boundary), of which you can't have one of each of the same number in the same state (<a href="../../../i/-/5/I-5.html" title="I-5">I-5</a> runs along the west coast, <a href="../../../u/s/-/US-5_c81a.html" title="US-5">US-5</a> is in New England). Then there are the state networks, some of which skip the numbers of any nationals in there (e.g. there is no CA-5, as California defines route 5 in its system to be I-5). Then some states delegate county routes, which may in some cases duplicate both national and state numbers. I think there is some effort to get down to major county roads in California, being so large and having such an extensive road network, but some of these may be more important than state-level roads in other states (maybe they have fewer roads in the state, maybe the state doesn't delegate to counties, or whatever). Being "a numbered road serving X, Y and Z" isn't much. ISTR one case surviving on merit of it being the shortest <i>signed</i> numbered route in the state (some are unsigned - think C-roads). Note that "worthy of record"&#160;!= "worthy of own article". "worthy of record" &lt; "worthy of section" &lt; "worthy of article". I figure the best we could do for this would be something akin to the List of B-roads floating around, i.e. "A4018: Bristol - Westbury-on-Trym - Catbrain - Cribbs Causeway - M5". One sentence on route and name of interesting place does not make an article, and I fear there is nothing more to know about this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User:82.15.28.195">82.15.28.195</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User talk:82.15.28.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.28.195_2384.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.28.195">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>The less-informed might wish to know that A-roads are like second-class degrees. They are not a single class, but two subclasses. In much the same way that you can't hold a 2:1 and a 2:2 on par (this being the effective boundary between a "good" degree and an "average" one), you have primary and secondary As. Primary As are typically worth writing about. Primary As into four digits typically have good reason for being so. Secondary As in two or three digits may sometimes be former primaries that have been de-trunked. Some 4-digit A2s might be worth writing home about (e.g. the A3400, a.k.a. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henley-in-Arden_228a.html" title="Henley-in-Arden">Henley-in-Arden</a> to <a href="../../../m/4/2/M42.html" title="M42">M42</a> on what used to be the primary <a href="../../../a/3/4/A34.html" title="A34">A34</a>). Others, like this, are of predominantly (perhaps even purely?) local interest. Precedent is not to keep topics of purely local interest, and I'm not convinced that a case can be made that this road is of serious non-local interest. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User:82.15.28.195">82.15.28.195</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.28.195.html" title="User talk:82.15.28.195">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.28.195_2384.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.28.195">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Meanwhile, the more-informed will be aware that there was debate here recently about whether <i>B</i>-roads should have articles - and that debate ended in an approximate stalemate. If B-roads are right on the border of notability, then A-roads are surely over that border. BTW, you do your case no good by not signing your comments - four tildes is all you need to type (~~~~). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 22:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
