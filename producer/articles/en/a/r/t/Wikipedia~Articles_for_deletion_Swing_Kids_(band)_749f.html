<li><b>Keep</b> The article was written out of consideration for other pages involving <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Pearson_8f39.html" title="Justin Pearson">Justin Pearson</a> and all other bands he has been in. Swing Kids are somewhat lesser known than his other bands but are more seminal in nature and referenced on many other Wikipedia entries, including the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_Emo_f618.html" title="Hardcore Emo">Hardcore Emo</a> genre. What's worse is most of the links incorrectly linked to the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_Kids_d44b.html" title="Swing Kids">Swing Kids</a> movement of nazi-era Germany instead of the band before I wrote this article mere hours ago. It is an incomplete stub and I am still in the process of doing research. The patience and understanding of the Wikipedia admin community would be greatly appreciated here. As far as notability is concerned, the Swing Kids feature members of other notable bands and have toured internationally. Their records were released on an independent label alongside other notable bands.<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtyv_318a.html" title="User:Curtyv">Curtyv</a> 04:54, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Speedy Keep</b> They are very notable, and all the members have formed other notable bands afterwards. First off Justin Pearson is in that band. If you don't know who he is, well he's also in this band called the The Locust. According to the guidelines found here <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, this band CANNOT be deleted off of Wikipedia because this group ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or <i>one of the more important indie labels</i> (such as <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_One_G_d1fe.html" title="Three One G">Three One G</a>) (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</li>
</ul>
<p>So based on these grounds, I call for a Speedy Keep - <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseRobotRise_c242.html" title="User:RiseRobotRise">RiseRobotRise</a> 11:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. For one thing, RiseRobotRise may be confused; we're not debating the notability of The Locust, but of Swing Kids. That an unrelated band may register on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s radar might be interesting but is certainly irrelevant. For another, while this Pearson fellow might have his fans, 280 G-hits isn't a lot, and calling <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_One_G_d1fe.html" title="Three One G">Three One G</a> (run, as it happens, by Pearson himself) one of the "more important indie labels" is an enormous stretch. I'd be interested to see sources for the inference that Pearson is the most prominent emo musician in San Diego. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this was such an influential band the members have gone on to do so much: Jose Palafox (of Struggle and Bread and Circuits), went on to be a UC Professor, earn his PhD and lecture on punk rock and the hardcore music scene. Justin Pearson who would release their recordings on his own Three One G record label, is in numerous other bands today along with starting and runing his own business. This was an extremely innovative and influential band.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 144.91.49.233 (<a href="../../../1/4/4/User_talk%7E144.91.49.233.html" title="User talk:144.91.49.233">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.91.49.233_c127.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.91.49.233">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>The Locust has toured internationally (this includes Europe and Asia). Tour dates are not posted on their website currently, but I was able to find the following two links. <a href="http://site.yeahyeahyeahs.com/tour/?eventdate=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://site.yeahyeahyeahs.com/tour/?eventdate=all" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - Partial tour with <a href="../../../y/e/a/Yeah_yeah_yeahs.html" title="Yeah yeah yeahs">Yeah yeah yeahs</a> in several midwest states in 2003. <a href="http://www.killmetomorrow.com/tour.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.killmetomorrow.com/tour.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> - European tour with Kill Me Tomorrow in 2005. <a href="http://www.goldstandardlabs.com/locust/locust_info.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goldstandardlabs.com/locust/locust_info.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> - Brief Bio of The Locust from Gold Standard Labs who released most of their records before signing to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epitaph.html" title="Epitaph">Epitaph</a>. Swing Kids tour dates would be tough to reproduce since they broke up about 10 years ago. However, there is video footage of Swing Kids playing in Belgium (to an audience of hundreds no less) on the Three One G DVD which was recently released.

<dd>No, we we're talking about other bands on 31G, trying to make a point that 31G is a more important indie label. Also if you scroll above, you'll see that more then one member of the band went on to form other projects stated by other user. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseRobotRise_c242.html" title="User:RiseRobotRise">RiseRobotRise</a> 04:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> deletionists soon screech about it if a band doesnt pass wiki:music as if it were some immutable law of the universe, therefor if a band passes it, and this clearly does through virtue of notable members, the same rule should apply. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 11:21, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Eric Allen, a member of Unbroken (perhaps one of the most important hardcore punk bands of the mid 1990s), was also in Swing Kids. This alone makes the band of high importance.</li>
<li><b>Comments:</b> (1) This is a VfD on the defunct band Swing Kids, not on its members nor its members' subsequent bands nor a member's independent record label. We're only considering those to the extent that they bear on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) From that guideline: "Many editors also believe that it is (a) fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, without straying into <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (all of which are formal policies). Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included; meeting one or more of these criteria does not mean that a subject must be included." An "audience of hundreds no less" in any country doesn't meet the "audience of 5,000" guideline. Show evidence that SK were widely featured as being so innovative and influential, and we'll have reason to keep this article instead of redirecting it to the more-proven-notable topic <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Pearson_8f39.html" title="Justin Pearson">Justin Pearson</a>. (3) Mystache and Fishal aren't quite correct: The existence of articles on related topics linked to one another doesn't really indicate notability for any of them unless either they've survived AfD, or they contain citations to reliable sources proving notability. A whole bunch of fiction or trivia could be added as a "walled garden" of articles to give WP's credibility; people have tried this. Notable bands/musicians/etc, like notable fiction or religions, can have associated topics that are too minor or just not documented enough to keep as their own article. Some of this information is worth keeping, just in one article instead of five. No change of vote, pending evidence more directly relevant. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
