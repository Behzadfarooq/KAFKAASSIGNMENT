Its spin-offs from (of which this is the most popular example) less so.

<p>This list is unmaintainable. Right now it just seems to be a list of a few games, which bears no connection to in-game music at all.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this kind of lists are very important. Why? Because if somebody is interest in game music, it may be a hard task to find new interesting songs. If you want to find new good PC (or other format) songs, you do not find a list like this from the Internet (there are some charts for C64 and NES but not for PC or Amiga or some smaller machines). So Wikipedia can offer a list that gives good ideas for anybody interested in this kind of music. Without this list a person is quite lost since there are so many games and it is hard to know which ones might have interesting music. There is a danger of subjectivity in this list, since anybody can add his personal favorites. But with most of titles we can see, that they contain a music of relatively high quality and thus the problem cannot be so serious (the list is much better as it is now than no list at all). Sure the list is not POV, because there are common opinions about these kind of things. --User:Jarkka Saariluoma 15:32, 22 Jun 2005 (GTK+2)</li>

<li>Words like migrações seem Portuguese, and an experiment with Babelfish translation suggests that it is Portuguese... and that the article is about the history of tattooing. Darwin comes in because of a passage in "The Descent of Man" in which he says "Not one great country can be named, from the polar regions in the north to New Zealand in the south, in which the aborigines do not tattoo themselves." "Procurando" apparently means "searching for..." It does not seem like a bad article.

<li>They're my criteria for articles, all articles. I've been voting on VfD since before the first web comic showed up here, I believe, and all artworks have to answer the same questions, IMO. If anything, we should be more strict about web art, as it is by its nature far more ephemeral than even vanity press publications. For me, an artwork should be either first, greatest, or influential, and it should be something that appears in alien contexts (i.e. something mentioned elsewhere and by someone not in the web comic business) so that we will have a need for explanation. Otherwise, it doesn't matter whether we're talking about video game music or sculpture: the subject is not notable enough for encyclopedic treatment. --<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:11, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

A birthdate of 1945, having three dead siblings, being an uncollected artist and lesbian is not encyclopedic in itself. The set of 1945 birthdates is great. The set of people with three dead siblings is great. The set of being an uncollected artist is great. The set of lesbians is great. None of these sets are inherently encyclopedic.

I've included it on this page, and my hope is that with the addition of other images of plates and information from people with knowledge about them, we might know more about the history of license plates and license plates designs. I did not create this site for vanity purposes; I merely hope that this could be a collaborative project among many Wikipedia users. In fact, I don't have any more images of Mississippi plates to put on this page. Absecon 59 22:40, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> if not turned into something worthwhile very soon. Right now about the only encyclopedic part is "The state of Mississippi began requiring its citizens to register their vehicles and display their license plates on their cars in 1912" which could easily be mentioned elsewhere. More than 3/4 of the space of the article is taken up by listing off years with no addtional information (how is 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918... encyclopedic?). A little of the info on post '77 plates may be salvageable but right now it's mostly grandular subtrivial facts on the colors used.

<li>This minor issue demonstrates the problem I have with the article name. Any border you draw around a particular aspect of racism will encompass a different South. Better to work on those dozens of more coherent articles (<a href="http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/yps1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/yps1.html" rel="nofollow">Slavery in Texas</a> would be an excellent model). <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:53, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> factual content to other articles. As it stands, the name of the article presents a POV problem. Racist policies, practices, conflicts, images, etc are more verifiable than Racism per se. (i.e. would we write an article about "Pessimism in the Baltics" or "Apathy in the Swiss Alps"?) The ways in which these polices, practices, conflicts, images, etc. were and are experienced in the American South is covered in several articles and requires a certain amount of POV to aggregate into a blanket topic. It might work better as a category, though. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 16:53, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia might very well have an article on "Apathy in the Swiss Alps," if the Swiss had ever codified mandatory apathy into law, as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_7557.html" title="Jim Crow">Jim Crow</a> laws did. I'm not saying the article title is perfect, but I see no reason to rename before the article is expanded. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:50, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Until</i> the article is expanded it has no value at all. As I said before, the codification of racism into law <b>is</b> verifiable. The <i>racism</i> that brought such things into being is more difficult to restrict to verifiable info or limit to the Southern U.S. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:57, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that racism de facto is more difficult to verify than racism de jure; however, racism de fact <b>is also</b> verifiable (in oral histories, cultural histories, documentary film, and scientific studies, etc.) To deny de facto racism merely because it is harder, but possible, to document would be a gross injustice. The article is in serious need of cleanup, but the topic is too crucial to allow deletion of the article. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:19, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think we agree in principle. The important thing is the clean-up. I see the name of the article as a potential obstacle to that effort which might be better to undertake in other articles. But that is only my opinion - it should be left to the editors who do the work. What do you think of the idea of making this a Category name instead of an article name? <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:24, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that this is a strong possibility in the future. Even in my initial vote, I feared this was too expansive a topic for a single article. If this is made a category, though, questions of semantics (racism, racist, racialist, race relations, etc.) might spark the same debate that has begun here in earnest. I think the issue premature till the article expands. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:28, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep, unfortunately. I understand why the nominator entered it into the VfD derby, as it's an honest question whether having the redirect implies official endorsement of the content of the phrase.

<li>Just like to point out that this article does not meet the wikipedia definition of "ad" which I will include below: "Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Further all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs." As you can plainly see this article does not violate that rule.17:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Define notable. I changed the entry accordingly and its now functional and useful.

<li>I am the author, and I was not on any type of drug and was not writing the article to be funny or as a joke. I have taken out the information on the page and probably will not be returning to Wikipedia to write an article again. Note that there were several articles under the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> category that said there were fantasy worlds, etc., so that is why I wrote it. Hopefully the Wikipedia administration is happy with getting rid of me as a writer and user of this website, because you have lost my support. <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlockading_1fc2.html" title="User:Schlockading">Schlockading</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Schlockading_bce3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Schlockading">contribs</a>)</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> We have some articles on micronations, however, the presence of articles on micronations with no physical presence and no notoriety in the world at large is controversial at best. What's more, this <i>didn't</i> say it was a fantasy world; any article on a fictional topic <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7ECheck_your_fiction_d85c.html" title="Wikipedia:Check your fiction">needs to be up-front about it</a>. An article that doesn't is indistinguishable from a hoax. I apologize that some of the voters here neglected to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and resorted to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_attacks_3e76.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 22:21, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Yes, I would like to apologize for any apparent personal attack, although the attack on what was written is not something I back away from. <i>As written,</i> it looks like a drug dream, as it says that there has been a history of constant warfare on a thing invented in 2001, that it is a planet that didn't exist until it was discovered, etc. The logical impossibilities and outright absurdities in the article are unmistakeable. I would recommend working very carefully on the text, regardless. As for micronations on Wikipedia, I've been consistently against them, and the few that have survived have spurred extremely bitter (and long) debates. They have generally only survived by giving reference to an exceptional number of "citizens" and real world recognition. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:38, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As it was said in English language "Caucasophobia" is yet neologism. It is present in Russian language for along time though, and it is form of discrimination which is different from ordinary xenophobia (Check Russian search engines for Кавказофобия please). Being different from ordinary xenophobia the Caucasophobia shell be specified for a same reasons why anti-Semitism or phobia of Poles are considered (rightfully) a separate issue. Besides the term is already widely popular among critics of President Putin's regime, and is widespread in Russian publications(both mass-media and academicals) . Eventually it is used more and more often in English. Even if contains of “caucasophobia” will be deleted now it will become necessary to write something about it again. So what’s a point of removing the term only to put it back within few years if not few month?. <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJumber_e4c8.html" title="User:Jumber">Jumber</a> 10:18 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>All what you have said does not change the fact that in English language (we are an English wikipedia, aren;t we?) it is a neologism. When this "eventualy" happen, then welcome the article. And the point is that wikipedia is not <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>.

<ul>
<li>The word is existing in English language already including very serious publications. Lets say someone will find it the “Migrantophobia, Caucasophobia and Anti-Semitism” address by Dr.Kohiro Matsuura director general of UNESCO or at the <a href="http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/101802Russia.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/101802Russia.shtml" rel="nofollow">materials of UCSJ</a> or tons of other materials(see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-15%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=Caucasophobia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-15%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=Caucasophobia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a>). Then some person who is studying the issue will turn to wikipedia to find out what caucasophobia actually means.. And will find nothing at all. Unless you will write the article again. It would be easier reediting it though.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> This is a word transliterated from a Russian original that garners 1,000 Google hits (per Aecis), which seems a lot for a Russian slur. The fact that it isn't an everyday word in English is irrelevant. It is useful to have articles written in English describing non-Anglophone topics.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The neologism issue is something of an "idol of the marketplace" à la <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, a logical confusion based only on the imperfection of language. Noone is disputing that the topic is generally legitimate, but only that "Caucasophobia" may not be acceptable as an English word, in which case something more long-winded but descriptive should suffice, e.g. Prejudice against Caucasians in Russia. Mikka and others have also argued that some of the content is incorrect or exxagerated, in which case it should simply be improved, not deleted entirely.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 07:34, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Is it possible to make an article under the Greek name in the English Wiki? If so, both "Caucasophobia" and Prejudice against Caucasians... could be redirects, the first on the ground that it is a reasonable transliteration.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not the specialist in Russian affairs(I came here through Nick's artistic page); but I see here are two problems: one is with some people who argue that the anti-caucasian discrimination does not exhist,and others argue that the world does not exhist at all. Now the word DOES exhist in English language so English wikipedia should have at least few sentence about what it means. Then users can be redirected at the page about discrimination of Caucasians. Conteins of that last page can be discussed. Erin23

<li><b>Keep</b> You should not be surprised that "new people" are coming in; the contains of this article and the fact that it is about to be deleted was send around to few human rights groups who check the situation with Caucasians in Russia, and to some pro-Caucasian activists so you may expect some new guests and their opinion...But are we "guests" after creating the account?).About the discussion: I am surprised that someone was bold enough to put it at the deleting list! I mean-the word "caucasophobia" does exist, it does makes sense, it is available in the literature, and is even available in some dictionaries. As matter of fact it has two meanings: one is term to describe prejudice against Caucasian minority in Russia and another is a term used by American right-wing to describe the anti-white racism, which according to them is existing in the American society(would it be imaginary or real). To delete an article about the existing word simply because it hurts someone’s feelings is purely a vandalism! About the article itself: it is absolutely accurate observation if you ask me, but I can understand the hurt feeling who prefer to believe that problem does not exist. Anyway there are lot's of links provided to back the point, and most make sense(too bad many people here do not understand enough Russian).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Solution</b>: to keep the short explanation of Caucasiophobia here, and to create a link to the article about anti-Caucasian discrimination, where we can move this article and also some parts of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> section.And short note about "<b>conspiracy theory</b>". Accusing Western law enforcements and intelligence agencies ploting to conquer the World is a theory. Accusing <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_109a.html" title="FSB">FSB</a> and it's ancestor, the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> in the human rights violations isn't a "theory". It's a fact. Only recently FSB was officially blamed for two major criminal acts: the terrorist attack against Chechen poet <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yandarbiyev.html" title="Yandarbiyev">Yandarbiyev</a> in Qatar and attempted poisoning of the Ukrainian presidential candidate <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Yuschenko_9d43.html" title="Victor Yuschenko">Victor Yuschenko</a> with dioxine(spelling?).

<li>One minor detail Chechen "poet" Yandarbiyev was an international terrorist linked to Taliban and Al-Qaida ... he was official emissary sent by Chechen separatists to Mullah Omar and co. BTW To any sane person it is clear what "FSB being blamed for blowing up apartment blocks in Moscow in 1999 and 2000" is a conspiracy theory exactly of the same nature/credibility as conspiracy theories about CIA being behind September 11 attacks (the "evidence" for this is also abundant on the internet).

<dd>Wrong assumption. Also, please be advised that wikipedia articles are not message boards to express opinions; they are about facts. Shall I start the Russophobia among Caucasian people that came to Moscow, but treat Muscovites as natural resource? Among any two nations that live by there are categories of people that hate each others. Former Soviet Union bragged it had over 100 nationalities. Shall we have 100x100=10,000 articles (and yes, multiplied by 2, for both direction of hate!) about how belarussians hated ukrainians, ukrainians hated belarussians, chukchi hated evenks, kyrghyz hated uzbeks, .....?

<p><b>Important note</b>: The content is changed according to the useful information(from your posts) and your suggestions <i>The text now begins with</i>: In North America where Caucasian refers to light complexioned people indigenous to, or descended from Europe, word caucasophobia is used mostly by American White supremacists, White separatists and afrophobes to describe the "anti-white racism", which according to them, is existing in the American society.</p>
<p>In common usage in the Europe, Asia and former USSR countries "Caucasian" is a collective term which refers to anyone descended from native ethnicities of Caucasus. Confusingly, in direct opposition to the most common colloquial English-language meaning of the word (so called "white-skinned" person in English meaning), the Russian language embeds certain stereotypes of Caucasian people. Typically, they are considered "dark", with nearly identically similar negative connotations to the Anglo-Saxon prejudice of "darkness" (<a href="http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html</a>) . Some people from the Caucaus refute these prejudices; others ignore them.</p>

<li><b>Rename</b> "Racism in Russia" would be better name for topic and more in line with many other Russia topic articles named "Economics in Russia", etc. A broader article could usefully compare with attitudes towards Central Asians, Chinese, Blacks, etc. in Russia. Note Кавказ means Caucasus (noun), so Кавказофобия should translate to Caucasusphobia.

It might be true, but even on the site itself, I can find nothing to verify this. Besides, I think there's a bigger Yahoo! travel directory, which would make this NOT the biggest as the page claims.

<dd>Dear Dr. Delfino,</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Welcome to this discussion. I am glad you are taking this step to communicate with the editors. However, I must politely ask you to <b>cease your rampant epidemic of point of view and self promotional edits</b>. Although your workplace tell all may contain details of a "skanky" co-worker, you should not use this superficial nexus to link your book storefront. I'm sure you are aware of your recent edits so I don't need to point to more specific instances of misbehavior. I look forward to working with you on your disputed SLAPP-related entries. Collaborative work with source participants will produce expert and comprehensive coverage. However, once again, cut the nonsense.</dd>

The fact that an article on a notable topic comes from someone clearly out to push a point a view doesn't make the topic unworthy of inclusion in the encyclopedia. SLAPP laws are controversial from a public policy standpoint, and as a such the plaintiff in a landmark case on the topic is necessarily notable. Mary E.

<li>From the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> page: "Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy. Its primary method of finding consensus is discussion, not voting. That is, majority opinion does not necessarily rule in Wikipedia. Various votes are regularly conducted, but their numerical results are usually only one of several means of making a decision. The discussions that accompany the voting processes are crucial means of reaching consensus. For example, a very important Wikipedia process is reaching consensus on what articles are not encyclopedic and should be deleted from Wikipedia entirely. The discussion by which that consensus is reached occurs in the context of a "vote" on the Wikipedia:Votes for deletion page. That page is slightly misnamed since the discussion is more important than the actual voting."</li>

   A unique criticism, however, is that the system actually exhumes evil

<dl>
<dd>The article establishes the parameter for the topic as, an <i>in depth</i> exploration of the <i>unique criticism</i> that, Wikipedia <i>exhumes evil</i> by design. It couldn't be made more clear to what pseudo-intellectual depths the article must go in order to investigate the issue under a pretense of neutrality. The exploration of <i>this view</i> consists chiefly of a lazy wave of the hand in the general direction of a group of people, ominously called "internet [[fundamentalists]]" - well, let's just say it (and he does) - "Christians" - well, alright (which he doesn't say), "Me". This is how far an in depth exploration of the topic will take us at first thrust. I shudder to think how much farther in that direction things might go with a little more work.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is followed by a section entitled <i>Man-Based Thought in Information</i>, the relevance of which is not obvious, unless the point is to grant access to someone's (presumably not the author's) struggles with epistemological issues in a world without God. Finally, we are treated to an arm-chair analysis of what we might have learned from reading all this.</dd>

<dd>My first inclination was to try to improve the essay - because I can sympathize with its theme. Any religious person who is never frustrated by the official and coercive agnosticism, enforced through Wikipedia's editing policies, is not religious in any sense that I can identify with. But the only way to contribute to this topic would be to join with the author in carving out article space for a forum controversy, for the sake of further elucidating his point of view. I recommend to the author that he should create a blog, link to it from userspace, and direct people to it who might be interested in his explanation of why Christians will find it difficult to participate in Wikipedia, and why he thinks this is not an accident. This would free him from the pretense of agnosticism, and enable him to write much more credibly about the problem. However, the best way to improve this article is to delete it from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on the grounds I may be biased (I don't know the guy, but I certainly know his work), but Roger Moss was <b>very</b> well-known in U.S. historic preservation circles, at least in the 1980s and 1990s. His book about historic American paint colors was pretty influential at the time. I don't know what's going on now. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 18:34, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I take it back. I <i>am</i> going to vote.

<ul>
<li>Also, google "Roger Moss historic American paint colors" and there are 70,900 hits (except I forgot to turn off French and Italian, so that may be wrong, still...). Add "Sherwin Williams" to that phrase and you cut it down to about 40,000, but Moss was involved in getting that paint company to put out a whole line of what, at the time, were pretty outré but historically accurate colors, Arts and Crafts stuff, really deeply pigmented . And the line <i>sold</i>. Still does, as far as I know. Even has imitators. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 19:06, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And yet another <b>comment</b>. Okay, now I'm getting pissed. I've been out of the preservation loop for a few years, but after doing a little checking around, it's obvious to me that Toast up there and other anonymous contributors to the article as it stands now are writing it because they can't stand the man. It has nothing to do with the executive director of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia for the last 36 years who just got a life-time achievement award for his works in Philadelphia preservation, or the man who has written multiple influential books and articles about preservation, or the man who was one of the first to start collecting historic architectural drawings for the Athenaeum's library, or... I could go on, but I would prefer to save it for the article, which should be wrenched from the POV-slimed hands of these disgruntled folk. <b>You should not delete this article. This man is notable.</b> And yeah, you do make a lot of enemies in the preservation field in the U.S. The concept of stewardship is all too often viewed as unAmerican. I feel myself going off into a rant. I will stop. But seriously, please do not delete this article because of misunderstandings as to who Moss is, or where the article comes from. For you article "authors", go write a letter to the editor or something. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 21:31, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Then why does this not come up while Googling the person? He is not notable and doesn't meet any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. Also, if he is so important why does he seem to only have two how to books in the collections of major libraries? That defines not notable!

<li>I forgot to answer your question, and I do not want you spiraling out of control with worry. If we list influential stewards of our historic and cultural heritages - like Moss, their professional achievements - like Moss's, and their educational legacies - like Moss's, we will end up with a pretty fine encyclopedia. At least until the asteroid hits us. So you can calm down until then. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 16:50, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Moss belongs in the phonebook and a couple of library card catalogs for his how to books, but thats it. After he is dead, nobody but his family will care, so he will have a negilable legacy, if any. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 19:50, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> on the grounds that he is a notable figure in the historical preservation movement, and on the grounds that some of the delete votes appear to be a coordinated sockpuppet effort (similar to the VFDs on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Mississippi_License_Plates_38e4.html" title="Historical Mississippi License Plates">Historical Mississippi License Plates</a> and several others). <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 20:48, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I could have been in Who's Who or the Directory of American Scholars, too but I didn't want to pony up the money for it.

<li>Interesting, then, that my library school reference work textbook says the series "has a long history of reliability". Sure, there are plenty of books you can buy your way into, and these may be some of them, but I'll rely on a long established series of respected reference works rather than your word. Note that I don't suggest that people use an appearance in a work such as this to be the sole criteria for inclusion, but this added to the other evidence and arguments presented is plenty convincing. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:02, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Admittedly these things aren't too easy to google, but it seems to me that NBC is going to be on channel 10 on about 1/12 affiliates. "Live at 5" has become a common phrase used to describe live news (is there any other kind?) that comes on at 5 (quite common). This leads me to believe that we probably have more than 1 NBC 10 Live at 5 programs in the nation. <b>Delete</b> this.

<li>As a matter of fact you have a page here, with a photo of your own self, links to your articles and image of the Bolshevik star you have earned in your youth. You do not reveal your real name but its your own business after all. You don’t do it, Nick Gabrichidze does.. So? If the current position of Nick Gabrichidze page is frustrating for you it can be simply relocated as his user page: still it will be linked to surrealism, (most editors there seem to like his work), necessary political threads and pop art, so people would keep coming..
<ul>
<li>It is your business, but not a valid point. First of all we are not sure if Gabrichidze actually wrote the article himself, or posted it himself. It could be a text written by some Gabrichidze-friendly critic ( jumber&#160;?), or some gallery which has his exhibition coming. Besides even if he did, it is normal; even if it is not common in wikipedia technically speaking.. Possibly you are not familiar with an art world. Most galleries ask artists to write artists statements themselves, so what you see later in the newspaper as a "critical article" is mostly work of the artists themselves; unless press wants to bury their carriers of course. Besides Gabrichidze is listed as surrealist and aggressive self-promotion is a trade mark of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a>, particularly of Salvador Dali. <b>Note</b>:<i>typos corrected.

<dd>Not obviously. Notable artists and scientists do make headlines. We don't have articles about each and every professor in the world. They are normal people, who do their noral job. The guy that owns pizza hut across my office is just as deserving as Bush before the face of God. Biu obviously there is some difference betwen them. Another reson is <b>verifiability</b> of information about him. I don't believe a single word of the wikipedia article how good he is, unless a solid reference is provided.

<li><b>Keep</b> For an living artist he made a tremendous achievement. There is no point to wait for official monography to come out, it does not happen until 50 years of artist's demise usually. If his works are present in the catalogs plus are available publicly as a murals then keep it. There are references and catalogs available at search engines(not only Google) plus many images from his websites. I checked it, and I have visited some of this artists display's before, particularly in Amsterdam’s public library in April-may 2002, very interesting if you ask me. I think his images are also available as posters(I recognize it) in my area(I live in Europe now, but I have seen it even in Venice, California I guess). For a university professor it wouldn’t be enough, but for the artist-more then enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>And please, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> do not take issue with deletion of this page so much to the heart. It is just an art page, matter of taste after all. If people like his art he will be considered(if is not already considered) great, if people will like it not then... Besides unless someone will prove the opposite, there is no grounds to claim plagiarism. For the lovers of “conspiracy theories”: I registered purely to defend nick. I do not know the artist personally, but have seen his displays and murals, and I am in the mailing list of one of galleries which works with Nick. I was actually informed by them through email that now Nick has a wikipedia page, came here to check it out and found out that page it marked for deletion (I guess if Nick will keep up his good work I will create a new page for this artist myself, even if this one will be deleted). I opened an account to edit this page, but in a meanwhile I found out that page of other Amsterdam’s cultural phenomena, the Boom Chicago theater is inaccurate too, so I edited it as well. I hope the fact that I am fun of Nick Gabrichidze’s art does not disqualify my vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> To be honest I am writing this sitting next to Peter, and using same PC, so in theory you may consider our vote "one vote", but I am different person, so I think it would be fair to count two. It's up to you of course. Anyway, I am professional model, my name is also Erin (there are some other Erin’s here, among Nick Gabrichidze “fun-club” I see, can I send you an email?)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my first post at wikipedia but I hope to find some time to edit modeling, and also "cat walk" section.. Unlike Peter I DO know Nick Gabrichidze personally; I was honored to be his model for a while (See my profile please). I am a one who introduced Peter to Nick's artwork, and projects. Anyway I guess it makes my vote even less valuable, but from another hand if there is a discussion about keeping a university professor at the wikipedia, then his students would vote "yes" or "no" I guess.. So why can’t model vote for the artist she worked with? I have visited most museums in europe,and beleive me, seeing the original works of great masters makes same impact as seeing the original work of Nick Gabrichidze. HIS WORK IS GREAT. I know my statement is purely emotional, there is no logic in it; so I do not want to argue about it, but I have a right to say my opinion here as far as I understand, so I use this right. And to get some proof that Nick does what he does, best thing to do for you <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> would be to see it by your own eyes. Te next public project by Nick Gabrichidze will be changing an interior of Holland Casino in Amsterdam, opening is at July 28 here is a link <a href="http://www.hollandcasino.nl/nl/vestigingen/amsterdam/kunstplein_5?ie=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hollandcasino.nl/nl/vestigingen/amsterdam/kunstplein_5?ie=1" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. You are welcome to show up. Nick will be at the opening himself, you can introduce yourself to him and I am sure you will get a free drink and will enjoy rest of the evening and both show and paintings..<a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnutson_e603.html" title="User:Knutson">Knutson</a></p>

So could other guys who vote for "delete" spare some of heir time and present us with some arguments? I am sure they can find some, after all Nick isn’t Da Vinci,;) yet.. It’s just so arrogant to post one word like "irrelevant" or "vanity" and go away.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> My private opinion: thinking that request for VfD from <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> is little biased in that case judging by his actions the discussion about same person at another thread. I am ethnic Caucasian(Azeri )myself and I am shocked how deep the hostility goes sometimes(i mean the other thread not here). I checked many articles about other artists and found even less sources of notability; as matter of fact this has much more then 75% of artists. I wonder if the user who started this thread would ever have such a big interest in fine arts if not Mr. Gabrichidze's mention regarding <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasophobia.html" title="Caucasophobia">caucasophobia</a>; would be interesting to see how frequently <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> is participating in editing art pages.. Everybody has a right to put a deletion request at this board as far as I understood, but I guess to give ones self this right, this person should have at least some professional competence in the matter. I would not give myself a right to request the deletion of pages about microbiology because I am not a microbiologist. And the fact that one user has put two pages regarding the same person for deletion within less then few days; from those two at least one(not this one but another, about politics, the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasophobia.html" title="Caucasophobia">caucasophobia</a> one) with no grounds at all, gives away serious level of prejudice. But could be I am wrong. I am not going to argue about it here anyway, I just wrote my opinion once. The request for deletion is biased.I do not know how good is Mr. Gabrichidze as an artist though, I am not an art critic. He makes lot of hits at search engines but for me it is not an illustration of anything. But until someone will come out with some competent comment about his art, not “my daughter can do better” I will stand for "keep him here". I am new user I know.

<li>Slightly? I'm sorry, it seemed to me that it was completely fixing this one-sentence travesty and making it into a legitimate article that was the issue.

<li><b>comment</b> - actually, it looks like a work that combines some legit folklore research w/New Age gobbledegook about contacting fairies personally. Can't find any book excerpts online, but considering "Spae wives" has its own index entry in the above book, I suspect copyvio.

<dd>I am fairly sure you are being sarcastic about "anti-Polish sentiment" in this case, but it is still interesting to me that there is strong majority to keep <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_deal_with_Poles" class="extiw" title="m:How_to_deal_with_Poles">m:How to deal with Poles</a> in its <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_deletion#How_to_deal_with_Poles" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_deletion">RFD</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:53, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose there are two main reasons for the "keep" majority. For all I know, Metawiki is not anywhere near as popular as Wikipedia itself, so less people tend to pay attention to what's going on there in the first place, and even those who do are less inclined to get involved in a row, because it "matters less" - admittedly, that would include me. Another reason might be that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_deal_with_Poles" class="extiw" title="m:How_to_deal_with_Poles">m:How to deal with Poles</a> passes as self-ironic Polish humour on Poles, even when its real subject are non-Poles.

<li><b>Oppose</b> The very point of that archive is to avoid starting the painful RFC, AtbCom or any other process. As a part of the Polish wikipedians' notice board, this place is intended as an archive of disputes, where other contributors (in most cases without much consideration or conscience, I believe), accuse people of nationalism or bias solely because they are Poles. While such behaviour surely deserves RFC, we decided that trying to talk things over <b>before</b> we start listing all the wrongdoings, gathering support and all that, would be much better. Also, if the disputed part is unrelated with the dispute itself (that is if the <i>nationalist</i> remarks are not relevant to article content disputes, then it would be much better to keep it out of the talk pages. Finally, as the recent problem with Nohat showed, taking such things to user talk pages doesn't work since in most cases such remarks are either treated as offensive or simply erased, without comment. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 23:58, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That Nohat has the dubious privilege of being the first person on this list is only an accident of timing, not any part of anti-Nohat conspiracy.

<li>I'm sorry, I'm not finding anything anti-Polish in what Nohat wrote.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is very nearly a duplication of RfC, but with an added assumption of anti-Polish bias against the accused.

<li>Halibutt argues above: <i>"The very point of that archive is to avoid starting the painful RFC, AtbCom or any other process."</i> I can't see at all how a page like this is supposed to achieve this noble goal, or any other constructive goal for that matter. It is not designed to help establish a consensus, but to polarise. It serves as a soapbox for letting of steam on, discharging emotional frustration by pillorying opponents who one should rather deal with on a factual level.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Its mission statement, as worded in the page itself and above, is to archive <i>"disputes, where other contributors [...] accuse people of nationalism or bias solely because they are Poles."</i>, the underlying assumption being that "<i>[m]any Wikipedians assume bad faith solely because the wikipedians they oppose are Polish."</i></dd>
<dd>I do not doubt that such cases do occur; but such statements are rarely made to one's face. Thus, that someone disagrees with another person only because of national resentment can only be inferred. With the odd exception, such motives cannot be proven - but neither can they be disproved, which makes it virtually impossible to defend oneself against such claims. That is why insinuations like that are poison to any reasonable debate, as they are about a <i>person</i> rather than just about an argument. To make it worse, as Halibutt says, <i>"[s]uch views are promoted by numerous people here, <u>whether conscient or not</u>"</i> [emphasis added], meaning that even when someone thinks they are not guided by national resentment, they are possibly just not aware of it.</dd>
<dd>Let's assume someone says "2x2=4" and I go and tell them "you really mean 2x2=5, you just don't know you do". Or, to be more precise, A says "2x2=5", B says "2x2=4" (or vice versa) and A replies "you only say so because you hate me". B then replies "I don't hate you, I just don't agree", against which A uses the ultimate killer argument "you do hate me, you just don't know it". Such pretensions not only do not conduce to, but effectively forestall any amicable settlement (or <i>"załatwienie polubowne"</i>, as Halibutt called it on <a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html#How_to_deal_with_Poles" title="User talk:Piotrus">User talk:Piotrus#How to deal with Poles</a>). And they are certainly more "painful" than any request for comments or arbitration could ever be.</dd>
<dd>Of course, they are unfortunately ubiquitous, Wikipedia being no exception - but that is no justification to spread them any further. If we allow a page like this to stay live in the Wikipedia namespace, it sets an example that others are going to follow before too long: Jewish editors might claim a right to set up a similar combined soapbox/pillory for alleged ("latent") anti-Semites (such as Poles), Americans for anti-Americans (such as French), Armenians for anti-Armenians (such as Turks) etc. We shouldn't allow that to happen. If there are conflicts, let's try and solve them on the talk pages, or in arbitration if necessary, as tedious as this may be.</dd>
<dd>While I think that the page is within the limits of what is commonly accepted for user pages, I would nonetheless vehemently advise anyone against userfying it - as it would cast a very poor light on the person hosting it.

<li>The difference is that the very point of RfC and ArbCom is to force the sides to obey some rules or agree to a solution of the problem. In other words, it means that in most cases reporting users on WP:RfC is equal to requesting their punishment or a ban. It is not the best way such problems should be dealt with, I believe. Asking the ArbCom to block people solely because they make nationalist remarks seems like the worst possible option to make them reconsider their views or apologise. But perhaps it's just me. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 11:30, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that RfC is just that: a <i>request</i> for <i>comment</i>. RfC is—or is supposed to be—an opportunity for different sides of a dispute to present their concerns and criticisms, and to seek community opinion. (Here, <i>community</i> refers to all Wikipedians, and not just Polish ones.) There is no mechanism for binding arbitrated settlements within RfC itself; it is meant to report and describe the disputed behaviour and seek outside comment. Any resolution achieved through RfC is enforced through social pressure alone. The ArbCom is not involved in the RfC process, and does not impose blocks, bans, or other restrictions. In other words, RfC is supposed to be all the things that you've described the Black Book as. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 12:46, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Come on guys. Talking is a Polish way of dealing with problems. This is true that there is a considerable number of anti-Polish biased comments on Wikipedia. If we start reporting them all on RfC you will say that Poles just make a fuss. But the problem will remain. I really don’t see a difference between a comment made in face of someone and a generalisation, if the comment itself refers to all the people of one nation. As I understand, Witkacy tried so far all the possible methods to solve the problem except RfC. Now comes the time for discussion. Please, do not underestimate the value of our discussions, after all our talks were one of the main causes of failure of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. Please, do not assume bad will or that the talks will not be constructive. Give this page a chance. I really think it’s important to talk things out before reporting them to the highest stage. Why the page is here? Because it concerns all the Poles, not just Witkacy. However, if you insist on moving this page, I would readily offer to be its host, and no, I would not consider myself put in a bad light by defending the good name of my folks, Thorsten1. I don’t know, why you assume that everyone, who would not agree with a Pole, would be there, as I understand the dissidence of opinions is not the subject of this page. I also want to remind that this page was not established against any group of people or single persons. If there is any thing in initial description you find improper, please, be constructive and suggest your changes, but do not dismiss the entire idea. As the title appeared objectionable, may I propose mine “Night talks of Poles” instead? --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 04:20, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry Sylwia, but I can't agree. At the risk of repeating myself, I fail to see how this page is supposed to help find a consensus: Offenders who find themselves pilloried will be even less likely to play nice; if anything, they will become more defiant.</dd>
<dd>You say that <i>"Talking is a Polish way of dealing with problems."</i> Fine, but talking is also a Polish way (not <i>only</i> a Polish way, of course) of <i>creating</i> problems - this page and discussion being a textbook example...</dd>
<dd>You said you <i>"don’t know, why you assume that everyone, who would not agree with a Pole, would be there"</i>. Let me try and explain this once again: If I am not mistaken, the whole trouble began when Nohat mentioned the mere existence of Polish nationalists; he did not say anything like "all Poles are nationalists". This statement was all it took to get him blacklisted as a Polonophobe here. From this it follows logically that anyone who does not believe that the Polish nation, as about the only nation in the world, has not produced any nationalism at all, is a Polonophobe. Anyone who does not promulgate the opinion that all Poles are angelic creatures, innocent of any wrong-doing by definition, runs the risk of finding themselves in your "Black Book".</dd>
<dd>You say that <i>"there is a considerable number of anti-Polish biased comments on Wikipedia"</i>. Fair enough, but then there is a considerable number of "anti-<i>anything</i> biased comments" on Wikipedia; Poles are by no means the only ones to suffer under biased or unfair comments. Why, there are even Polish "anti-Rest of World biased comments" (<a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_betrayal.html" title="Western betrayal">Western betrayal</a> anyone?;-)) In response to this, should we really all form cosy national corrals in which we can whine about the wickedness of the outside world? Should we backbite and stigmatise our opponents as anti-whatever-ists from some collective soap-box?</dd>
<dd>You appeal to the principle of assuming good faith regarding this page - this is absurd, as the page itself is an instutionalisation of assuming bad faith in other users. You say you <i>"would not consider [your]self put in a bad light by defending the good name of [your] folks"</i>. Well, the conviction that you constantly need to "defend the good name of your folks" seems to be a part of the problem here, rather than a part of the solution, but that's not really the issue. I am not surprised that you would not consider yourself to be in a bad light - but that's not issue, either. The issue is that <i>others</i> may see you in a bad light, and, to make matters worse, might identify you with "your folks" on behalf of whom you claim to be speaking. Thus, if the comments of the non-Polish users in this vote are any indication, I feel that this page is going to accomplish the very opposite of its stated purpose, i.e. to "defend the good name of the Poles". Finally, to legitimise a page like this by sublime appeals to the Polish merits in overthrowing communism smacks of exactly what makes less Polonophile people shake their heads in wonderment. I really think that removing this page would be a win-win solution for all parties: both for the "good name" of the Poles, and for Wikipedia at large. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:15, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thorsten, you fail to see..? Yes, I’m afraid you are. Simply because you didn’t give this page a chance. Instead you wrote a long "proof" of all the evil, which according to you hides behind it. We say that a devil has big eyes, you managed to prove it, I grant you. I am sure that Poland as every country has its nationalists, there is nothing to argue about (however it was not, what Nohat said, though I can assume, he didn’t mean it). Moreover, if I thought that the issue of the page was as you described it, I would never give it my support. The problem of this discussion is elsewhere. There was nothing in intentions of this page, what you wrote about, but you chose to see it differently. Are those facts of just your assumptions? May I just ask few questions? 1. “<i>Offenders who find themselves pilloried will be even less likely to play nice; if anything, they will become more defiant.”</i> How do you know we would? Very likely we would decide to ignore such offends in future. 2. “<i>talking is also a Polish way of creating problems”</i> well, I agree, there wouldn’t be biased anti-Polish comments if there were no Poles. Can you give a real example of a real problem? 3. Do you think it possible to give people, who find themselves lost in discussion, several examples of better counterarguments than calling their advisors nationalists? 4. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_betrayal.html" title="Western betrayal">Western betrayal</a>. Can you tell exactly what makes you so uneasy about it? You just made me read the latest discussion there. Many Poles giving their opinions, bringing facts, but no name calling. So is the title so hurtful or the existence of the unpleasant history itself? BTW I read your comments there and once again I cannot agree. Sorry, but one cannot discuss with history by saying, what if… Were there really plans of using a nuclear bomb in Poland or is that just one more black scenario? We don’t know, what Poles would do? Well, we certainly know, what they did, as well as what the West did. Can you at least see that going this way of thinking we might say: How do we know that Jews or Poles wouldn’t create extermination camps, if they were in Nazi’s place? Whatever question we might ask, those things never happened, therefore are no good arguments against facts. But never mind. Question 5. <i>“the conviction that you constantly need to "defend the good name of your folks"”</i> Why constantly? Can you tell, what do you mean? 6. <i>“The issue is that others may see you in a bad light”</i>. That’s exactly to what I said before that I wouldn’t care. Don’t you think?</dd>

<dd>As to the rest of your message, I refuse to answer. I read it couple times and I sincerely hope you didn’t mean it, you didn’t want to say such things. What I asked for, was just giving this page a chance, without prejudices, without black scenarios foreseeing things, which were no one’s intention. What I was given instead was a saddening message of your prejudiced feelings about Poles. Once again, no single fact, just a very unpleasant narration about your picture of us. It was enough to say that you oppose and spare me the rest, really. I am a Pole. Please, accept my best wishes. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 05:00, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sylvia, I think there is no point in prolonging this; all points have been stated clearly and the argument is by now going round in circles. Your response shows that you have been misinterpreting several of my statements, some deliberately and apparently in attempt to add fuel to the fire, others perhaps involuntarily. And some of your statements leave me utterly confused: How do Nazis, Jews, and nuclear bombs come into this? If you have something to say on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_betrayal.html" title="Western betrayal">Western betrayal</a>, please do so at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWestern_betrayal_ed09.html" title="Talk:Western betrayal">Talk:Western betrayal</a>. I merely mentioned that article as an example that some Polish editors are arguably also affected by bias - not because I wanted to enter any debate here. As for your declared good intentions, I can well imagine that neither you nor anybody else who got involved with this page actually realised they were doing anything ungood - after all, I do assume good faith. Alas, your good intentions do not alter the fact that, by now, the overwhelming majority of the votes consider this page a display of bad faith. Of course, you may put that fact down to everyone here being a closet Polonophobe, if you really can't think of another explanation. Finally, I wonder where you see <i>"a saddening message of [my] prejudiced feelings about Poles"</i> and, <i>"once again"</i>, <i>"a very unpleasant narration about [my] picture of [Poles]"</i>. I do not remember ever making any generalised statements about Poles (or any other nation or collectivity, for that matter). But probably I'm just not aware of my anti-Polish sentiments, right? So if you wish, go ahead and add me to your blacklist while the fun lasts. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:09, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
