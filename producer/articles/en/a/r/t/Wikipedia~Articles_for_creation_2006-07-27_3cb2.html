<p>The Titans Hunt storyline is the basis for a story arc featuring DC Comics <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Titans_9366.html" title="New Titans">New Titans</a>. As the Titans were readying for their anniversary party several members were attacked and abducted by the Wildbeast Society. Even Titans affiliates such as <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqualad.html" title="Aqualad">Aqualad</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Eagle_2a21.html" title="Golden Eagle">Golden Eagle</a> were attacked ending in the death of the latter hero. A group of people hired by Stephen Dayton, father to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changeling.html" title="Changeling">Changeling</a> Garfield Logan, went to search for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Titans_9366.html" title="New Titans">New Titans</a>. This group consisted of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathstroke.html" title="Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> the Terminator, <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arella.html" title="Arella">Arella</a>, Raven's mother and Dayton himself. Along the way <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troia.html" title="Troia">Troia</a> accompanied them as being one of the only Titans who escaped the hunt. After an arc of several issues <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantasm.html" title="Phantasm">Phantasm</a>, a disguised Danny Chase, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantha.html" title="Pantha">Pantha</a> an experiment of the Wildbeast Society also joined to look for the Titans. Several facts were revealed during the end of the storyline. <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arella.html" title="Arella">Arella</a> had actually carried the soul of the Godess <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azar.html" title="Azar">Azar</a> within her, a fact that was revealed when she went up against the head Wildbeast in her home in Arizona. Also that <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> had infiltrated the Wildbeast Society when they tried to capture him, defeating and stealing the armor from one of his attackers. This allowed <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Chase_fed8.html" title="Danny Chase">Danny Chase</a> the chance to escape being kidnapped and spurned his change to <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantasm.html" title="Phantasm">Phantasm</a>. It was also revealed that <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jericho_%28comics%29.html" title="Jericho (comics)">Jericho</a>, the mute son of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminator.html" title="Terminator">Terminator</a>, had actually become the leader for the Wildbeast Society and was mute no longer. In a scene between Dick and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jericho_%28comics%29.html" title="Jericho (comics)">Jericho</a> Cyborg was seen in a rocket in which Jericho sent into space. The rocket practically destroyed <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">Cyborg</a> as he was known. In an epic battle that lead the group to the Remains of <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azarath.html" title="Azarath">Azarath</a> the Titans were found bound to a machine. It was then revealed that <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jericho_%28comics%29.html" title="Jericho (comics)">Jericho</a> had in fact been posessed by the souls of Azarath. It seems that during Trigon's final moments after he was killed by those very souls, his essence merged with them creating a twisted version of the once pacifistic people. While <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven.html" title="Raven">Raven</a> was cleansed of Trigon's evil energy the combined souls inhabited that of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jericho_%28comics%29.html" title="Jericho (comics)">Jericho</a>. At first they could do little more than plant insidious thoughts inside the mute, but as their power grew so too did their control. Jericho released his souls upon the Titans, many of whom ended up being posessed. In a climactic battle <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jericho_%28comics%29.html" title="Jericho (comics)">Jericho</a> was killed by his father but the Souls of Azarath were still undefeated. They posessed <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven.html" title="Raven">Raven</a>, turning her back into a red skinned <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatar</a> of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trigon.html" title="Trigon">Trigon</a>. It was then that Raven's mother and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Chase_fed8.html" title="Danny Chase">Danny Chase</a> used their combine might and the power of Azar's teaching to forever cleanse away the evil of Trigon. In the midst of battle Raven's body was destroyed as were Arella's and Danny's, who ultimately merged with the now cleansed souls of Azarath to become <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantasm.html" title="Phantasm">Phantasm</a>. This story arc also introduced the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Titans_d9b7.html" title="Team Titans">Team Titans</a> and Baby Wildbeast.</p>

After numerous phone calls and many letters to potential witnesses, the charming Precious and her resourceful assistant are about to start confronting people directly. Just when this happens, they are sidetracked by the insidious activities of Madame Ramotswe’s husband’s apprentice, who has taken up with a rich older woman. Precious’ husband, “the excellent” Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, owns another modest business, the reliable Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, which employs two apprentices. Meanwhile, during the rest of the book, Precious tracks down the mystery of a pumpkin that appears on her porch one morning. Madame Makutsi takes dancing lessons and gets partnered with a man who has two left feet and a secret of his own. Mr. Matekoni has to fire one of his apprentices. And Precious has her natural serenity rattled by a visitor who forces her to confront a secret from an earlier period in her life.</p>

<p>Himiko (卑弥呼, c.175?–248?), also read as Pimiku, was a female ruler of Yamataikoku, an ancient state-like formation thought to have been located either in the Yamato region or in northern Kyushu of present-day Japan. Few records are available and little is known about her, and the location of Yamataikoku is the subject of a great, often emotionally charged, debate that has been raging since the late Edo period.</p>
<p>According to an ancient Chinese history book, Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms, Himiko was a shaman who controlled people through her paranormal abilities. The Nihonshoki, an old Japanese history book, notes that Himiko was actually Empress Jingū Kogo, the mother of Emperor Ōjin, but historians disagree. Some speculate that she is conflated with Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess.</p>
<p>The Chinese chronicles book (that was compiled in 297 CE) refers to the inhabitants of the Japanese islands simply as the Wa, literally, "The Little People".</p>
<p>Furthermore, it describes a fragmented political structure of more than a hundred or more separate tribes, nominally ruled by a female shaman, Queen Himiko.</p>
<p>Some have, due to intuition, proposed that Himiko would have been a ruler of Jomon period, an archaeological age when the religion was a goddess religion, as indicated by figurine evidence, and the population generally was Austronesian/Malayo-Polynesian, ancestors of e.g the today Ainu peoples. However, that timing is patently incorrect, since the latest discoveries of Jomon remnants are from c 300 BCE, five centuries earlier than Himiko's lifetime as anchored by said Chinese records. Moreover, much of the other evidence, including her name, links Himiko to proto-Yamato people, who just migrated there in late Jomon era and started Yayoi period, into which Himiko and her people are tentatively classified. Traditions of Jomon culture, such as reverence to female godheads and a priestess-led society, as well as very large villages and still small, tribal groups being units of political power, in a proto-agricultural economic setting, may have influenced the societies of Yayoi settlers and be one of reasons of the cultural structure of Himiko society.</p>
<p>According to an ancient Korean history book, Samguk Sagi, Himiko, as queen of Japan, sent an embassy to King Adalla of Silla in May 172. However, Chinese history books record Silla as having been established on 356, which casts doubt on this claim.</p>
<p>Himiko never married and it is recorded that her younger brother assisted her as a political advisor. She is said to have had one thousand female servants and to have never appeared in public.</p>
<p>In ca. 188 CE, Himiko ascended to paramountcy and in 248 CE she died. There are indications that a tribal king, posthumously now known as Emperor Shujin, raised military host against queen Himiko or her successor (reportedly another shaman, her niece or other relative), ultimately conquering their position and establishing male rule with headquarters in central Japan.</p>
<p>The precise pronunciation of her name is unknown. The Himiko reading derives from her name as represented in kanji, which was written 卑彌呼 prior to mid-20th century kanji reforms. Himiko may have been a chinese corruption of himemiko, princess-priestess, or lady shaman. The name is said to mean "Sun Daughter". There are assessments that she is the real person upon whom the myth of sun goddess Amaterasu is built.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-27_3cb2.html" title="Edit section: mimmo paladino">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">mimmo paladino</span></h2>
<p>--60.50.55.6 04:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC) Mimmo Paladino came to the forefront of the international art scene in the late 1970s as one of a group of young artists that spearheaded an expressionist resurgence in painting and sculpture. By reviving figuration and symbolism, this group aimed to restore myth, mystery, and magic to contemporary art. An Italian critic dubbed this international trend the Transavantgarde, and its Italian practitioners included Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, and Mimmo Paladino.</p>
<p>Paladino lives in the small hilltop village of Paduli, Italy, not far from the village of Benevento where he was born in 1948. He attended art school from 1964 until 1968 at the Liceo Artistico di Benevento when minimalism and conceptualism dominated the international art scene. Paladino assimilated issues and ideas from these two movements and combined them with his desire to revive the expressive and emotive powers of art. In works such as this one, he paints haunting figures and forms that are inspired by the art and artifacts of many cultures from antiquity to the present. Fragments of things such as hands, heads, furniture, plants, and masks, are lushly painted to coalesce into an inscrutable whole. Paladino’s visual language is neither narrative nor linear. It is fluid and ambiguous because he feels that art should ask questions, never give answers. In this painting, even the title Sette, (Seven), adds to this quality of the unknown by referencing the number seven from the ancient kabbalah.</p>

<p>Dwnd is the wonderful "indian" term for Pump Water, when read upside down the word pump reads Dwnd. Say it with an Indian accent for a more exotic feel to pump water. Dwnd has changed my life by giving a new meaning to the word Pump.</p>
<p>So Pump usually can mean a whole array of thing such as.. I pumped the water from the well. Now I dwnd the water from the well. I want to pump you so hard, now it's I want to dwnd you so hard. Now, it has also replaced the word DUDE from our vocabulary. Use the word Dwnd wisely. It is pronounced d-woonn-d. Peace out. The hub.</p>

The 2 Rupee coin was introduced in 1982 as an experiment to replace the 2 rupee note. The 2 rupee note ceased circulation in 1990 after India has various coins commemorating it's freedom fighter and leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Chhatrapati Shivaji and many others. The coins circulating in the Indian economy include the 25 paise, 50 paise, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, and Rs. 5 coins.</p>

<p>Jesuit Priest, Classics Master, 1913-2004</p>
<p>Charles Walter Fraser began life as a country boy born in Gundagai to Walter, a solicitor, and Eva, nee McKenzie, a musician and painter.</p>
<p>After an education at St. Ignatius' College, he entered the Jesuit order, and among other distinctions, became resident Classics Master (Latin and Greek) at the College for the greater part of a century. Novelist and Critic Gerard Windsor wrote that method, care, discipline, precision, together with a dry, ironic manner, made him legendary. In addition to Gerard Windsor, a striking number of his classics students went on to literary careers - the historian and critic Robert Hughes, the playwrights Nick Enright and Justin Fleming, the poet Peter Boyle. Among the classical authors, the supreme works to him were those of Plato's trilogy on the death of Socrates, Apology, Crito and Phaedo. He regarded Socrates as second only to St Paul as the greatest mere human who had ever lived, and the Apology third after the Bible and Thomas a'Kempis's Imitation of Christ as the greatest books ever written.</p>

<p>The <b>Institut Aspen France</b> <a href="http://www.aspenfrance.org" class="external free" title="http://www.aspenfrance.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspenfrance.org</a>, founded in 1983, is an independant, non-partisan, non-profit, international center for discussion and dialogue. It has been located in Lyon since 1994 under a partnership agreement with the local authorities of the Rhône-Alpes Region. The Institut Aspen France is affiliated with The Aspen Institute, which was created in 1949 in Aspen, Colorado and whose head office is in Washington DC. The Institut Aspen France is part of an international network, with other Aspen Institutes based in Berlin, Italy, Japan and India.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The goal of The Aspen Institute is twofold:</b></p>
<p>- Help leaders from the economic, political, academic, and non-profit sectors, trade unions and the media to better identify the challenges they must face in working together to seek solutions to contemporary problems;</p>
<p>- Facilitate, in an informal context, the meeting of leaders from different geographical, cultural and professional worlds.</p>
<p><br />
These two goals are achieved through international conferences and seminars covering the main political, economic and societal issues of our times. The Institut Aspen France also organizes meetings in the Rhône-Alpes Region to encourage an exchange of original ideas to benefit of territorial development in the heart to Europe.</p>
<p><br />
Since its founding, The Aspen Institute has left its mark, enriching the reflections of several generations of leaders around the world and exercising an indirect but constructive influence on the principal international debates.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Projet Montreal is one of the political parties in the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Born in 2004, it is led by environment, housing and transportation activists. Its platform is based on sustainable development. It believes the city needs a better mix of social housing and condominiums in downtown neighbourhoods. It embraces population and housing growth as a way to curb car use and suburban sprawl. It has official party status and a current membership base of 1500 people. Its chief is Richard Bergeron. During December 2005 municipal elections, Projet Montréal secured a city council seat in the Plateau neighborhood, winning 12% of all votes cast citywide in a three-way election against two established parties.</p>

<p>Figuring in most of the OCC episodes aired since he joined the fabrication team at OCC, Rick is often portrayed as the quite perfectionist whom everyone seems to like. Having been employeed for more than 2 years at Orange County Choppers, Rick Petko (age 37), is widely acknowledged by his co-workers as an amazing metal-worker, often seen fabricating things others have no idea could be build.</p>
<p>Rick seems to be a favorite of Paul Teutul Sr, and Sr. has on numerous occations portrayed Rick as a rolemodel for fabricating, meeting on time, getting things done etc. as opposed to the work-ethics and morale of his son Paul Teutul Jr. Rick is also Paul Teutul Sr. main choice when it comes to a showdown in the shop between father and son in competing for building bikes. This choice is mainly based on the fact that Rick and Paul Sr. shares the same taste in motorcycles, which is the raw oldschool look, as opposed to Paul Jr. cutting-edge style fabrication. At the emotionel level there has yet to be aired an episode where Rick gets upset or raises his voice. This is highly unusual compared to the environment which consists of the everyday-fights between Paul Sr. and Paul Jr.</p>

<p>The Photochemical Reflectance Index is a reflectance measurement that is sensitive to changes in carotenoid pigments (e.g. xanthophyll pigments) in live foliage. Carotenoid pigments are indicative of photosynthetic light use efficiency, or the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by foliage per unit energy absorbed. As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Applications include vegetation health in evergreen shrublands, forests, and agricultural crops prior to senescence. PRI is defined by the following equation:</p>

<p>Kolibri was a video game for the Sega 32x/Genesis console released in 1995. The game was a 2D shooter that followed the exploits of a hummingbird as he fights his way to defeat a dark crystal that fell from the sky. Levels are set in natural environments usually requiring the player to complete certain tasks to progress to the next stage. Later levels require a great amount of attention to detail for the player to figure out just what needs to be done to progress.</p>

<p>Sir Cathaoir Rua O'Dochartaigh (anglicised to Cahir O'Doherty), chieftain of the Inis Eoghain, in the rebellious province of Ulster, was the last of the gaelic chieftan's to be killed by the English forces. Sir Cahir was married at fifteen to Lady Maire Preston, daughter of Lord Gormanston,a member of the gentry and so he learned to mix in two very different worlds. He has been described as being brave and a person of great presence who acquitted himself with dignity in whatever society he found himself in. Physically, he was powerfully built, red-haired and over six feet in height. In 1608,he led a rebellion against the english who were helping themselves to Irish lands. The crown granted him his territory, but with reservations, however, he wanted the english entirely out of his principality. Eventually, greedy eyes decended on his fertile lands and he took Culmore and sacked Derry on his way to do battle at Kilmacrennan. Three days later, he was shot dead there by an english sharp-shooter as he rallied his troops. He was easily recognised because of his height and his red-plumed helmet. His head was cut off and displayed, as was the custom, at Dublin Castle. His body was quartered and sent to the four corners of Ireland. Sir Cahir left an infant daughter, who was spirited away within the clann, and the line then continued under his brother, Sean. Many of the clann fled to Spain, where the present head of the clan, Dr. Ramon Salvador O Dochartaigh resides.</p>

<p>A "movax" has come to refer generally to any one of a number of specialized robotic excavator-mounted side-grip hydraulic vibratory pile drivers used to drive and extract sheet piling or other types of piles. A combination of robotic articulation and side-gripping ability allows a single operator to drive and extract sheet piles, as well as to pick a sheet, move it, thread it, and place it.</p>
<p>A movax uses a high frequency hydraulic vibrator, running at 3000 cycles per minute, with about 55 tons of dynamic drive force. It is typically mounted to a large excavator, and takes advantage of the excavator's own hydrolics for additional down force. With this power, the Movax can be used to drive sheet piles, I-beams, and pipes in virtually any type of soil condition</p>
<p>A movax is controlled by a cab-mounted computer which allows the operator to select a precise angle to drive/extract piles, even horizontally. A skilled operator can pick up, position and drive a pile in one fluid motio. With computer-assisted automatic steering and side grip ability, the movax/excavator combination automatically corrects the straightness of the sheet pile during the driving and extracting. When a movax drives the first pile into the ground, the distance is put into memory. The 'auto' takes the pile to the right distance near the guide and sets pile into the upright position, reducing the typical "walking" of the pile wall typical with other methods of installation.</p>

<p>The Lift is a band hailing from Siena College in Albany, NY. Although thier sound is considered Pop, it includes some funk influence and has the traditional instrumentation of an alternative quartet. They have shared the stage with pop hit Lifehouse and the upcoming Zox. The band is comprised of three Ramsey, NJ natives; Mike Kelly, James Tumulty, and Mike's twin brother, Dennis. Mike sings and plays guitar, James plays keyboards and dennis is the drummer. The bassist, Matt Restivo, resides in Commack, NY on Long Island. You can find out more about the band at <a href="http://www.theliftband.com" class="external text" title="http://www.theliftband.com" rel="nofollow">their offical website</a>.</p>
<p><i>History:</i></p>
<p>The Early Days: Mike, Matt, and James came together in 2003, meeting in the comfy confines of the first floor, east wing of Ryan Hall. Originally, they formed an acoustic trio and called themselves Elastic. They were a cover band who would play at open-mic like events on campus, host late night jam sessions in the residence quad, and even made a couple of appearances at El Dorados bar in Troy. Having a small following on campus, they left their freshman year wondering what the next year had in store. Although each member of the band played Guitar, Piano and Bass, they each respectively choose their strength, and developed musically over that summer. Matt learned Bass, James took over duties on Keyboards, and Mike remained the lead singer and guitarist. The return to Siena and mix of new instruments sparked a new light for the soon to be band. It wasn't until November of 2004 that Mike came up with the first original idea for this band. Shortly thereafter came their first hit, Pretty Sand. The original songs just kept coming and coming, and the people exposed to the music seemed to be more and more impressed. It was around March when they decided on the 'short and sweet' name, The Lift. Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Around this time, the Ramsey natives received word that the mother of their close friend, (Cindy Foy), was diagnosed with breast cancer. The diagnosis hit home for the band, as Matt's grandmother and aunt were both treated for breast cancer back in 1998. Realizing that both their friend and their mother needed support, the band looked for ways they could help out. They decided to record and sell CDs for a $5 donation to the Breast Cancer organization called CRAAB. Teaming up with the Women’s Center, they planned the “Concert in the Quad” for early April to culminate the fundraiser and total the sales. The Demo &amp; Concert in the Quad: Spring break came quickly and the band found themselves with six solid songs. From March on out, Mike’s twin brother Dennis joined in on drums. They decided to set up their own recording equipment, and spend their spring break recording and producing. In a mere five days, the band was able to record, and make over 250 CDs, all from scratch. When they arrived back at school, the band went door to door in dorm to dorm, selling their self produced demos for a $5 donation. The Women’s Center offered to match the funds that the band raised. From the last two weeks in March and first week in April, the band was able to raise over $1050, allotting for a grand total donation of over $2100 to CRAAB. The Concert in the Quad was a huge success, with over two hours of music, an information table on how students can help (set up by the Women’s Center), and free hot dogs while they lasted, it was obvious all who attended had a blast. Finishing the tracks: Although they had finished their shows for the semester, that did not stop the writing of new original songs. Before Mike, Matt and James left for their study abroad programs in June, the band had completed 9 tracks thus far, not quite enough for a full album. At the end of June, Matt and Mike left for Buenos Aires, Argentina, and shortly after James left for Belize. Although not able to truly communicate in Spanish, one of the first things that Mike and Matt did was purchase guitars. They would also rent piano rehearsal rooms where they could brush up on their piano skills. It would be in Argentina where the final four tracks for the soon to be new album would be finished. Their single Black Coffee, and fan favorite The Only Thing were both finished in la casa de Maria in Argentina. Arriving back home, the band had their eyes set on one thing, the studio. Recording: January arrived and the time came to record all of the old six over again, while adding the 7 new tracks. They arrived at Siena a week early, and stayed with their friends when they needed to sleep. Their producer, Chris Stein, had previously attended some rehearsals and both he and the band were anxious to get to work. They recorded almost the entire album in about six days. Although the bulk of the recording was completed, it would be some time before the final product was ready to be sent out. The vocals and smaller parts were completed over the next month. The months of March and April were spent mixing the record. In April, the band was a huge hit at the local favorite, The Landing Zone, where the owner said, “The Lift was the best thing that The Landing Zone has ever done.” Throughout these months, the band worked on the Album Art and other minor details so that the album could be replicated as fast as possible. The music for Once was finally completely mixed down and ready for the next step in mid April. Opening for Lifehouse: The Lift’s next live appearance was at Siena’s battle of the bands called Musical Mayhem on the Friday Night of Siena-Fest. Having received first place, they also got the opportunity to open for Lifehouse the next night. The band woke up at 7AM that morning to meet at the ARC and take care of some set up stuff. After that, Mike and Matt traveled to Saratoga to meet with the person who was going to be mastering their album, Larry DeVivo. Larry is well known in the music business, having toured with the Allman Brothers, and mastered the record of the 90s hit band, the Spin Doctors. The Saratoga native began mastering the album that day, as the band prepared for their first show on the big stage. They took the stage that night at 8PM, and nailed their set in front of over 900 people. The band was honored to be featured on the front page of Siena’s newspaper, The Promethean, about a week or so later. Once debuts!: After the album was picked up from Larry, the band sent it and all of the necessary art work to a company called Discmakers where over 1,000 copies were to be replicated. This process took about three weeks, and was completed on June 2, 2006. The album was released that day and has since been sold all over the world. The band realized that they had to play shows all summer both to pay off and promote the album. They managed to rack up a 15 date summer tour schedule touring all of New York and New Jersey, including some of the most famous New York City venues such as The Knitting Factory, Coda, The Lion’s Den, and others. Currently: The band is working on promoting their new album, and focused on progressing as a band. They have recently sent out press kits to over 75 radio stations in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and have already gotten airplay from Boston College’s radio station.

<p>Paragon is the name given to Games Warehouse Limited's interactive SWP machine found in pubs across Great Britian. Currently in its third incarnation, Paragon offers pubgoers entertainment and the chance to win modest cash prizes (between £1 and £40) for an initial stake of 50p. The payout percentage which the machine operators hope to maintain is typically 30%. Newer Paragon cabinets have a choice of twelve playable games which are selected from a database of around 30 games of which the rest are idle but can be activated at the discretion of the landlord and/or engineer or remotely. Thus, unlike the market leader itboxx, each Paragon machine may have an entirely different selection of games available to the public. Most games are based on the Q&amp;A format although recently the terminal has embraced other forms of <a href="../../../s/w/p/SWP_bf25.html" title="SWP">SWP</a> including Hangman style games, visual puzzles and word games.</p>

<p>Many of the popular and profitable (for operating companies) games appear across the board of SWP cabinets. Examples of these available to Paragon are: Bullseye, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_Up_e222.html" title="Word Up">Word Up</a> and Pub Quiz. However unique Paragon games are recognised for slick graphics and hidden features or <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Eggs_a4fe.html" title="Easter Eggs">Easter Eggs</a> which players familiar with the games can exploit to their advantage. For the latter reason there is a growing <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_loyalty.html" title="Brand loyalty">brand loyalty</a> amongst the public. Such games currently include:</p>
<p>Pints make Prizes. A hangman style game where players must complete one of three generated words or phrases in specified categories several times over. Each third of the screen (represented as a pint glass) is self-contained although bonuses may be won which expedite the filling of each glass. Prizes are awarded in a sequence of progressive accrual with frequent bonuses to help along the way.</p>
<p>Cops &amp; Robbers. A cartoon-style pursuit game reliant on speed and knowledge. Prizes are awarded to players who can collect enough icons from the streetscape. This game has been panned across the spectrum of SWP players for being over too quickly and rarely offering any prize over £1. However, the game has remained for a relatively long period proving it must be generating revenue as a popular game amongst the selection.</p>
<p>Space Quest. A kind of planetary <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snooker.html" title="Snooker">snooker</a> in that a series of ricochets can be both beneficial and disastrous. Space Quest has accelerational 'gravity' and each ball maintains its own mathematical path until colliding with another when both diverge along the relevant planes. Questions must be answered after each shot to add the appropriate points towards a predetermined target.</p>
<p>South Park. Another Q&amp;A game in which players chooose from a selection of categories with the aim of reaching a predetermined points target and a simple endgame. As a licensed <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> product there are many related themes within the graphics, questions and gameplay.</p>

<p>Many regular and occasional SWP players consider this termianl to be the least homogenous of the rival cabinets see also <a href="../../../i/t/b/Itbox.html" title="Itbox">itbox</a>, Gamesnet, ind:e and Fatbox. This may be due in part to the essentially simple interface and accessibility of gameplay in typical Paragon games. However, criticism of the Paragon cabinet include the screen's propensity to be askew and the over-simple, even childish nature of some games. While there is considerable crossover of games between rival platforms, each has some exclusive content.</p>

<p>Actuarial credibility is a technique used by actuaries to smooth estimates. It is closely related to Bayesian methods in statistics. In a typical application, the actuary has an estimate X based on a small set of data, and an estimate M based on a larger but not-quite-as relevant set of data. The credibility estimate is ZX + (1-Z)M. Z is a number between 0 and 1, calculated to best balance the noisiness of X against the lack of relevance (and noisiness) of M.</p>
<p>For example, an actuary has accident and payroll historical data for a shoe factory that suggest that the accident rate is 3.1 accidents per million dollars of payroll. She has industry statistics (based on all shoe factories) suggesting that the rate is 7.4 accidents per million. With a credibility, Z, of 30%, she would estimate the rate for the factory as 30%(3.1) + 70%(7.4) = 6.1 accidents per million.</p>

<p>"Vegetable Man" is a song by Pink Floyd, written by Syd Barrett, and recorded in mid-1967. The song has often be referred to as a fairly harrowing account of Syd Barrett's psyche at the time, given that the lyrics simply refer to what Barrett was wearing at the time of writing, followed by the chorus "Vegetable man, where are you?"</p>
<p>The song was originally intended to be the b-side of the third single, which was to be another Barrett composition called "Scream Thy Last Scream", with "Vegetable Man" as the flipside. However these songs were deemed too uncommercial and "Apples And Oranges" b/w "Paintbox" were released as the single, which failed to make the Top 40. Both "Scream Thy Last Scream" and "Vegetable Man" remain unreleased officially to this day.</p>

<p>Pakistan Engineering Council in its 49th Engineering Accreditation and Quality Education Committee meeting held on April 20, 2006 in PEC Secretariat Islamabad has accredited IQRA University's Electronics Engineering Program. The students enrolled in this program will now be eligible for registration with PEC, an essential requirement for employment in Government and Semi Government organizations.</p>
<p>Pakistan Engineering Council higher officials visited IQRA university Karachi, on February 20, 2006 to evaluate the infrastructure, Library and Laboratory facilities. During the visit the quality of teaching and the facilities were found on required standards. Team especially appreciated latest audio visual aids available for teaching, state of the art Engineering Laboratories equipped with sophisticated and high tech equipment, R &amp; D culture as most of the faculty is engaged in Research activities. This may also be added here that PEC granted accreditation in its first visit which is unlike its traditions, which indeed reflects upon the highest standard of teaching and facilities being maintained by IQRA University.</p>

He became talk of the media and mass when he announced and offered his own formed formula to the entire world writing on Sep 2, 2006 an open article to many (<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indymedia.html" title="Indymedia">indymedia</a>) media-n-mass announcing to United Nations Council, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Religions of many countries that Grants &amp; Missionaries should come up with Counseling Centers, Rehabilitant Centre, <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylums.html" title="Asylums">Asylums</a> for such community whose behaviors seem to echo unusual and is not easily accepted in society of modern civilization which had come or struggled a long way trying to eliminate many <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboos.html" title="Taboos">taboos</a> since Ape or <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a> age , some those are still prevailing in present society.</p>
<p>According to the author discriminating or reserving bias with such community (homosexuals, <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gays.html" title="Gays">gays</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbians.html" title="Lesbians">lesbians</a> is very inhuman. Violence should be replaced by empathy and counseling so that new born may not get effected or affected by such awkward off line of thoughts. It appears from his writings that the author ruled out that such characteristics are in built right from the genes in birth . As per his impressions one either get liking otherwise obsessed , tempted finally to addictions to such kind of behaviors as one do get to cigarette, alcohol , drugs, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuals.html" title="Bisexuals">bisexuals</a> , <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swapping.html" title="Swapping">swapping</a> , <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgy.html" title="Orgy">orgy</a> , <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang_bang.html" title="Gang bang">gang bang</a> sex etc in childhood or later age-n-stage of lives. He felt curbing through counseling is the best proposal or solution than hate or punishment remedies of law-n-society. He also suggested the government universities , parents, teachers should openly educate children by introducing verbal or written syllabus educating the bad effects of such activities.</p>
<p>Moreover the author is also misunderstood by his own father who was a stubbed Hindu by religion while never approved his son’s vision who came out with an absolute non-mythological , non religious thoughts in a book ‘Brhmaand Pujan’ which means Universal Prayers - Cosmolatry Spiritual Enlightments. Naresh Sonee writing shows concerned for every religion. Decoding every religion logically his thought are brief yet clear to sum up his expression and intention he dreams - ‘Gods &amp; Goods of every religion should be regarded ,accepted , shared and exchanged whereas <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myths.html" title="Myths">myths</a>, orthodoxy , hatred , discrimination should be eliminated . <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">Peace</a> and Progress should be the perfect and prior aim or mantra of every religion who all should merge-n-mingle happily with an intuitive inbuilt caption - ‘Live-n-Let other live’.</p>

<p>Poetry of a Suitable Boy for Gays-</p>
<p>Some men like Jack and some like Jill<br />
I'm glad I like them both but still<br />
I wonder if this freewheeling<br />
Really is an enlightened thing,<br />
Or is its greater scope a sign<br />
Of deviance from some party line?<br />
In the strict ranks of Gay and Straight<br />
What is my status: Stray? Or Great?<br />

<p>Poetry of an Un-Suitable Boy for Lesbians, Gays-</p>
<p>Devoted for my beautiful friends –Homos , Lesbians Gays</p>
<p>In this world every man should be Ram every women Sita<br />
I'm glad I like them both but also respect Koran, Bible, Gita,<br />
Along with every scriptures of all religions,<br />
Those preach me ways of good reasons,<br />
Enhancing my wisdom and visions,<br />
Sustaining high ethics, logical missions,<br /></p>
<p>I wonder if all such are my free wheeling<br />
Or a foolish un- enlightened nonsense weavings,<br />
Or is its greater scope a sign , fine?<br />
Rebelling out from obsolete sect of parental line?<br />
In this confusing ranks when Gays, Lesbians are so update,<br />
Why nonsense like me take birth-n-bury earth with weight?<br /></p>
<p>You mischievous God I understand in front of them I’m no Great?<br />
Why the hell people like me are so obsolete&#160;?<br />
Then speak out Lord-What is my status: Stray?<br />
Am I confused standing out in middle of four way&#160;?<br />
Does my voice as global citizen reflect some sense full weight, bright?<br />
Or God do am I here to open a revengeful gate instigating a fight?<br />
Gods if you’ll are true-n-alive , Help these lonely people, Have your say,<br />
Before all of your poor fellows get drift-n-drown by waves far away,</p>
<p>Help them Gods, Save them Gods, They are no fraud,<br />

Oh different religion-n-regional Lords?<br />
Where are you all hiding at least give your wisdom nod&#160;?<br />
Are they brilliantly right&#160;? Or Am I blurred and wrong&#160;?<br />
But finally answer my desperate question –It’s no time for hymns-n-song,<br />
Straightly tell me once- till when You’ll would take us for ride&#160;? How long?<br />
For what the hell you send&#160;?<br />
For heaven sake tell us where it end&#160;?<br /></p>

<p>Finally I pray to Destiny – The UNIVERSE the ultimate powerful forces of Nature to -Bless Gay-n-Lesbians to join the main normal streamline as Ram-n-Sita or other Global Gods experienced.

<p>Since playing bass with female post-rock band Electrelane, Tracy Houdek has recorded experimental electronic pop as a solo multi-instrumentalist in the band Houdek. Her self-produced music on Sweet Ohm Recordings has a retro-futuristic sci-fi edge with soft effected vocals reminiscent of Broadcast and is heavily influenced by Joe Meek and Delia Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Sidestream smoke is created from the emissions of a smoldering cigarette. This type of smoke will suspend in the air longer because aerosol particles in the smoke are smaller than those in mainstream smoke. Smaller particles mean better absorption in human lungs. That, combined with the toxic chemical properties of this smoke make it more hazardous to breathe in than mainstream smoke.</p>

It has a population of approximately 50 permanent residents. Common family names found in Watervale over the past 50 years include Bradley, Burns, Hayes, Quinn, Shea, Trainor, Walsh and Wisener.</p>

<p>Dan celebrated his 20th anniversary in Chicago radio in August of 2005. An afternoon mainstay in Chicago sports radio for 15 years, McNeil's candor, quick wit and unpredictable approach are his trademarks. Under Dan's stewardship, ESPN 1000's afternoon drive program consistently has been among the highest-rated programs among adult men for several years.</p>
<p>McNeil, 45, was an original cast member of "The Score," for which he served as an afternoon host until his resignation in October of 2000. During Danny Mac's nine-year run, he developed a reputation as a well connected, college and pro football addict whose feel for radio production separated him from the pack.</p>
<p>"I'm lucky not because I've got a job every guy would want, but because I recognized I wanted it around seven or eight," McNeil says. "I was a decent amateur athlete, but I knew I wanted to be Oscar Madison when I grew up. I was writing for my high school newspaper one month into my freshman year and I was the nerd doing play-by-play into a Ross portable cassette recorder while watching Blackhawks games on the tube. I got a jump on everybody years before sports radio was born."</p>
<p>Following his college years at Ball State, McNeil interned at WGN Radio in the summer and fall of '85 as a producer for "Sports Central" and for Chicago Bears pre-game, halftime and post-game shows. Mac then took a position as a staff writer/columnist for his hometown daily paper, The Times of Northwest Indiana.</p>
<p>In January of '88, McNeil got his first big shot in Chicago when he was hired as executive producer of Chet Coppock's weeknight sports yakker and Chicago Bulls broadcasts on WLUP AM 1000. "Dangerous Dan" quickly developed his own following as a sidekick and fill-in host, as well as a contributor to the station's popular Dahl and Meier show.</p>
<p>Dan has three sons and resides with his wife, Sheri, an insurance defense attorney, in Northwest Indiana. His fundraising endeavors include autism research and treatment, neuroblastoma research and the Highland High School athletic department.</p>

<b>Bush hid the facts</b></p>
<p><br />
In <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> , when you are opening a new notepad document and follow these instructions , weird facts are happening&#160;:</p>
<p>-Open up a new notepad document -Type "<a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush.html" title="Bush">Bush</a> hid the facts" (without quotes) -Save it with a name of your desire and close. -Open it.</p>
<p>Chances are , that the user will probably see a line of blocks , unless he/she has installed the Chinese language character pack.</p>
<p>On the first place , people think that this has to do with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">conspiracy</a> , or true facts about <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. The truth is , that this is one of the most "unknown" bugs of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>. There is a pattern which does that. A sentence of 4 words&#160;:</p>
<p>word 1 = 4 letters word 2 = 3 letters word 3 = 3 letters word 4 = 5 letters</p>
<p>This means that even if you type random text based on this formula , the same thing will happen. for example ( hhhh hhh hhh hhhhh )</p>

<p>Derek James Bibby was born at Hooton, Cheshire, on June 29 1922, the son of Major Sir Harold Bibby, who was created a baronet in 1959. From 1935 to 1969 Sir Harold was chairman of Bibby Line; he was also Deputy Lieutenant for Cheshire and High Sheriff in 1934-5.</p>
<p>After Rugby and Trinity College, Oxford, where he read Economics, Derek Bibby joined the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> in the New Year of 1942. He was commissioned a few days before his 20th birthday, and his unit was posted to 331 battery of 133 Field Regiment of the 53rd Welsh Division. For almost two years they were employed on exercises at artillery ranges around Britain. On one occasion, Bibby managed to land himself in trouble by organising a rugby match between officers and other ranks in which three of the latter ended up in hospital.</p>
<p>In June 1944 his unit embarked for France. At Caen, Bibby often acted as Observation Post Officer, and later recorded in his autobiography, Glimpses: "I used a church steeple for one lookout post. The Germans could spot me and would open fire with mortars. During their shoot, I would go down to the church and play the organ."</p>
<p>Bibby fought through Belgium and Holland, once getting lost in a minefield in thick fog, and on to Germany where "I was sent to the Observation Post at the final push and found myself overlooking the Rhine at Wesel. The Germans brought all their AA guns from the Ruhr to cover their last troops retreating across the Rhine. They then put down what was . . . their heaviest fire of the war."</p>
<p>Bibby was wounded by shrapnel, four fragments lodging in his eyes, requiring a four-hour operation under local anaesthetic. "I had to lie without moving for days", he recalled, "double-bandaged, not knowing whether I had lost my sight." Bibby was awarded an MC after this action. He later spent a year as OC Troops on an Indian troopship, gaining valuable experience of life at sea.</p>
<p>After the war Bibby joined the family business. On his first day his father called him into his office and told the new recruit: "Never borrow any money, so that you can never go broke". But the young Bibby disagreed: in future years he was prepared to borrow money, a calculated risk which some believe secured the long-term future of the business. In the 1960s Bibby recognised that the core business of shipping passengers and cargo between Britain and Ceylon and Burma, and transporting troops, was being superseded by a new generation of aircraft. He therefore moved the shipping fleet into other areas of business, and introduced the distribution and financial arms.</p>
<p>There was, however, a disaster in 1980, when Bibby Line's bulk carrier, Derbyshire, was lost during a typhoon in the South China Sea; 44 people died. In 1986 Bibby succeeded in the baronetcy on the death of his father. Six years later, aged 70, he became honorary president of the group.</p>
<p>Bibby's other main interest was the Birkenhead Boys' Club, which he supported from 1953 until his death.</p>
<p>He married, in 1961, Christine Okell, daughter of the Bishop of Stockport. They had four sons and a daughter. His son, Michael James Bibby, born in 1963, succeeds in the baronetcy; as group managing director he is the sixth generation of the family to run the business <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibby_Line_c529.html" title="Bibby Line">Bibby Line</a> Group.</p>

<p>The term co-inventors usually refers to two or more persons who jointly develop an intellectual property such as a patented device. However, a co-inventor may simply be someone who provides ideas or product development services for another party’s idea or invention. The latter may involve hiring a professional product designer or an industrial designer for a service fee. In the event that the plurality of inventors creates a property that may be patented, the United States patent law requires all parties involved in the creation to be equal owners of any patent based on the invention that may be granted. A designer providing service for an inventor must be party to a formal agreement that is drawn up prior to the commencement of work in order to establish compensation terms with the inventor. If the designer’s fee is lower than normal or there is no fee charged, the designer may be entitled to a large share of income from the sale or licensing of the patent rights or the commercialization of products based on the patent or developed product. If the designer is paid a normal fee, the designer may opt to take a lesser position in profit taking.</p>
