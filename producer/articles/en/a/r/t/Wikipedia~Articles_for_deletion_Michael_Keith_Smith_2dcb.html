<p>vanity article by marginal fringe figure, <b>delete</b> Homey 01:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Keep" - I thought the idea of wikipedia was that anyone or anything of any significance could be looked up. Mike Smith is a leading member of a political party and leader of an association aimed at changing our politicial spectrum from the current one dimentional - same government (no matter who you vote for) - to a multi-dimentional conviction political spectrum we all need if democracy really does exist and isn't just part of some alice in wonderland lie! If this gets deleted, then I'm going to expect that similar artciles on other leading political activists and commentators be deleted (mmm who should we start with?). Lets have a cull of such people on Wikpedia. Or is this censorship politically based? If this goes, I will be nominating a long list of people who should join it!86.20.41.187 23:14, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is saying something when I, as a Leftist, defend the right of CDA figures to have entries on Wikipedia, but I feel I have to. "Homey" has made sneering anti-socialist, the-free-market-is-the-answer-to-everything remarks which make me, as a Leftist, hate him/her far more than traditional conservatives who at least aren't Thatcherite cultural vandals. As is often the case these days, what unites people like me with traditional conservatives, against the new centre ground, is greater than what divides us ... certainly, I feel that Homey's obsessive personal agenda is irrational and wrong-headed. We should <b>not</b> be deleting articles about people just because they aren't ultra-populist Americanisers, which I think is Homey's real motivation (he/she would, judging by the remarks I quoted above, be just as likely to want to delete articles about traditional socialists such as myself). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinCarmody_3768.html" title="User:RobinCarmody">RobinCarmody</a>

<li><b>Transwiki</b>, article is vanity. Story could be the subject of a Wikinews article but it doesn't justify a Wikipedia article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 09:03, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I am the subject of this article</b>, which I did not instigate. I believe that the original article was written by <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a>, a Conservative Party activist who is not a supporter of CDA and subsequently augmented by others.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not the article remains or is edited or deleted must be left to Wikipedia. I would simply comment as follows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, you may feel that notes on the Chairman of CDA are relevant to anybody researching the CDA article on Wikipedia. You may also feel that the references to the landmark internet libel action Keith Smith v Williams will be of use to internet law researchers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I have reviewed the current content of the article and find no falsehood in it. Providing 'citations' even for such mundane matters as (eg) my membership of the RICS, is less easy than it sounds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, recent 'vandalism' of this article appears to have been instigated by Tracy Williams, the loser in the recent landmark action Keith Smith v Williams and her associate Ed Chilvers, who has indeed published on the internet an abstract concerning what he believes to be the 'facts' of the case. <a href="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm</a>. You may gather from this that there is bad blood between Chilvers and myself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the motives of Williams and Chilvers, you must draw your own conclusions from these facts.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 10:27, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: And who do we know from Sussex??? Don't be such a drama queen, Smith's entry is up for deletion because he is a nobody in respectable British politics, he is an attention seeking right winger who spends most of his time posting a variety of rude and obscene messages about the Conservative Party and its leadership on his own message boards. If he was well known in respectable Conservative Circles as you put it, he would be listed in the search engines as being 'A well known respectable Conservative, but he is not. Most entries deal with the Conservative party dumping the right wing Monday Club to shake off its racist image, and Mike Smith setting up the CDA in an attack on the Conservatives's cleaner and respectable image. <small>(<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.163.1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.3.163.1_f08d.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.3.163.1">contribs</a>).</small>)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Wiki is an encyclopedia, not a forum for personal views, and should therefore contain facts, however discomfiting to a minority of readers62.56.69.250 11:00, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: I agree with the previous entry. Wikipedia is not a forum for personal views and should not be subject to the kind of huffing and puffing that is contained in Mr.Smith's entry which is basically not much than a list of dinner appointments and letters to the editor. Important though all this "much ado about nothing" may have been to him it is of no interest to the wider world.Endomorph. *<b>Comment</b>: If one believes Mr Smith's supporters we deletionists seem to span the entire political spectrum. On Smith's CDA Forum we are described as " Far left activists and traitors" and "the combined forces of evil" Yet General Kongo above believes that we are "certain capitalist elements" whilst Barry believes that we are "politically motivated PC types". If this is true then we are disparate indeed but we atleast have one thing in common,the belief that Mr Smith's outrageous example of self-promotion is unworthy of Wikipedia and should be deleted.Endomorph</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>: Mike Smith is a well known figure on the Right in UK politics. Some politically motivated PC types seem to be wageing a vendetta. regards Barry 66.222.88.90 02:43, 8 June 2006 (UTC). <b>Keep</b>: the CDA is a viable and important part of contemporary UK political thought and discussion. MIke Smith is an important part of that organization. Atruelove 19:22, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Editors should be clearly aware of the campaign and its management here and on Stuart Millson and Gregory Lauder-Frost. It demonstrates clear hatred by some administrators and total lack of control by the Wikipedia Foundation. <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 08:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Hopelessly biased attack on a leading figure of the Tory Right. Lightoftheworld 10:16, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr Smith is not a "leading figure of the Tory right". In fact he is not even a member of the Tory Party having left some years ago when they failed to measure up to his pristine standards. Mr Smith is the leader of the miniscule CDA a right wing pressure group which exerts no pressure, is generally unheard of and which, when it is so, becomes the subject of mockery and derision.
