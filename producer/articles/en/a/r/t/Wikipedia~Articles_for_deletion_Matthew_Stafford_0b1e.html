<li><b>Keep</b> Matthew Stafford is known by hundreds of thousands of people. In the past week he has been the subject of newspaper articles in the Dallas Morning News, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and the Athens Banner-Herald. In addition, over the last year he has been profiled by every college football recruiting service and been the subject of hundreds of articles on those websites and publications. If you think Stafford is an unremarkable person because the world of high school football recruiting is limited, I would suggest you browse ESPN's website and read the synopsis and reports they provide on Matt Stafford that bare striking resemblance to the articles they author on professional athletes. 24.131.5.142 01:37, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, I know shit about football except for the little bit from high school. Great times, and excellent times from high school. Often, the notability isn't so grand for these type of athletes. However, this may be a different case, perhaps unprecendent. I have briefly overlooked the matter and it is my understanding that most of the information in the article is truthfull. Some of it specially the last sentences may not be as verifiable, however that still doesn't solve our problem. Is a high school notable enough? According to wiki guideline, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it is proper to have a bio for:</li>

<dd>Can we consider "High school," as part of the highest level in mainly amateur sports? I would imagine the bar is pretty high, (higher than Canadian High School football), however I'm not convinced that it is the highest level of amateur sports football. Perhaps, a quick blurb on the "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school_football.html" title="High school football">High school football</a>" would be appropriate and may help this article for better acceptance. Perhaps, simply, merging the information onto the school's article would be even better. Again, we need to konw if the high school is notable enough to be compared to college or professional football? For now, <b>delete.</b> and add the info to the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_Park_High_School_%28University_Park%2C_Texas%29_e48f.html" title="Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)">school's article</a>. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 01:57, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that the language (<i>Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles.</i> ) concerning the inclusion of athletes in Wikipedia was written with the ultimate goal of keeping "unremarkable" athletes from being listed. The diction chosen provides a necessary leniency for athletes because it is difficult to determine a set of qualifications that would work for every country. The best rough comparisons of Matthew Stafford's remarkableness and stature would be to say that he is the best under the age of 18(henceforth U18) Amercian football player in the world. This honor would be roughly the equivalent of being the best U18 soccer player in Europe. The only difference is that due to the American football system, Stafford does not have the opportunity to play professionally at this point. This does not make him unremarkable, however, when one considers the aforementioned media attention he receives. Furthermore, whether you like the sport or not, the spread of American football through avenues such as NFL Europe and the leagues forming in Japan associated with the yearly NFL preseason game played there indicate more than just a passing appreciation of the remarkable abilities of a player of Stafford's stature. Finally, it seems somewhat settled that once he is officially enrolled at the University of Georgia that his inclusion in Wikipedia will not be at issue. The question then shifts to how his notoriety or remarkableness will change, when he enrolls in the first week of January, to make him worthy of being included in Wikipedia. The answer is that it will not. He will still be the ludicrously talented and widely known Matthew Stafford and will still receive coverage from the same national newspapers and sports media outlets as he does now. 24.131.2.1 04:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

Please note: That we are talking about a high school student. He is not in college yet. Though it is my feeling that high school is trully an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Amateur sports">amateur sport</a>, this discussion continuously fail to demonstrate whether it is the "<i>highest level in mainly amateur sports</i>" (as per the requirements of wikipedia biography guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#People still alive</a>&#160;:sportspeople). Secondly, it is suggested to include a biography if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles. Prove your case. Is this a verifiable and a notable club? For hockey in Canada we have AAA (called triple A), or "AA." or "A". In Ontario, Canada we have the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">OHL</a> or the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">Ontario Hockey League</a>. I believe many people consider this "A" major junior <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> (though they are paid a minimal amount of money) one of the highest amateur leagues. According to the wiki article <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Amateur sports">amateur sports</a>, money seems to be an issue. However, aren't college football student often rewarded by large bursaries, free education, and even a mediocre pay. If you take a look at my Ottawa team "<a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_67%27s.html" title="Ottawa 67's">Ottawa 67's</a>" you will notice a section called <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_67%27s.html#Players_of_Note" title="Ottawa 67's">Players of Note</a>. I'm trying to understand this section, correct me if I am wrong, but on a first impression, I believe it is a list of former 67 players that have become famous. <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_67%27s.html#Players_who_hold_OHL_Team_Records_for_the_Ottawa_67.27s" title="Ottawa 67's">As per this example</a> At a minimum I think Mat's stats and name could be put on the "High Schools Team Article". <s>[[Georgia Bulldogs Football|Oh but wait, <b>no one has started that article</b>?</s> <i>(delayed comment: team is at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Bulldogs_Football_2dcc.html" title="Georgia Bulldogs Football">Georgia Bulldogs Football</a> which I eventually added to the article. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 02:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)) <b>Someone might be able to argue "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events."

<li>Comment: I finally found a source that seems reputable that indicates Mat is going to Georgia College next year but it says spring 2006. Some other place says he's already enrolled. Dear Unsigned or anyone. If you can provide the source of the information... that is that he's enrolling "on January 3rd", that would be greatly appreciated. (even then we all know how hasty some news papers can be at trying to be the first to publish information) This is important to the delete subject because it put in question his present status (even though he hasn't even done the try outs for the QB position) Actually now that I think about it, he could miserably fail at not be accepted on the team even though he's at Georgia, right? So, again we're into prospective semi-pro athlete. I'm still not convinced.

<dd>First off, an article stating he's enrolling in the Spring of 2006 is an article stating he is enrolling in January. The vast majority of American Universities work on a two semester a year system. The first semester runs August-December and is known as Fall Semester. The second semester runs January-May and is called Spring Semester. Therefore, when they say he's enrolling Spring of 2006, they are conveying to the reader that he will begin classes in January of 2006, as we've been stating all along. Also I'm not quite sure why you think someone would invent the idea that Matthew Stafford is beginning classes in a couple weeks just to have his bio posted, but nonetheless you can find that information at plenty of other places as well. For instance, you can visit the University of Georgia's website and utilize their "search for people" function to see that Matthew Stafford is already enrolled as a student. This is the most official source possible. You would not find Stafford in the UGA system unless he has already enrolled in classes. In other words, If he were not going to be taking classes until next August, he wouldn't be in the system yet. You can search for him here. <a href="http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html</a></dd>

<p>Or you can visit the Atlanta Journal Constitutions website and right this second you will se a picture of Matt Stafford front and center with the caption underneath that reads "QB Matthew Stafford enrolls at Georgia in January as its star recruit." <a href="http://www.ajc.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ajc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajc.com</a> There is also a detailed in-depth story on him connected to the picture- <a href="http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html</a> Or you could go to either of the websites devoted to covering UGA sports and ask one of the people who run the sites as their job when Stafford begins classes. You will not want to do this, however, because due to the extreme interest in the sport and UGA, these sites charge a monthly fee to read their articles and talk to their experts. You can find these sites at <a href="http://www.ugasports.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ugasports.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ugasports.com</a> or <a href="http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com" class="external free" title="http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com</a>. At the very least you could go to the following page and look at the list of 50 something various articles, although you won't be able to read the content for free, that have talked about Stafford on that website alone. <a href="http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228" class="external free" title="http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228" rel="nofollow">http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228</a></p>

<dd>Thank you, user:66.191.177.80 for your above comment (which you forgot to sign).

Okay! Enrollement into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Georgia_bdea.html" title="University of Georgia">University of Georgia</a> is the first step.

<dd>First, sorry for forgetting to sign the last comment. Second, he has already been accepted into the Football program. In the United States, you get recruited to play football at a University. In other words, by signing with UGA, he has not only been accepted, but UGA has promised to him that they will pay for the cost of his education, any injuries he incurs during his career, his housing, his food, his school books, and a monthly stipend. This is a necessary facet of the American football system because players are not allowed to enter the NFL until they are three years removed from high school. Combine the inability to play at the highest level because of this restriction with the high percentage of quality football players that come from low income families, and you find a need to provide college football players with these perks in order to insure they can matriculate at the university. Furthermore, his name cannot be added to that official roster and bio link you entered until he starts classes, or in other words January. The NCAA, which oversees college sports in the USA, does not allow Universities to make comments on kids that have not yet taken classes. In other words, even though he has been widely published about in Nat'l media outlets for a couple years and has been officially accepted and enrolled at UGA, no one on the UGA staff can comment on him until he takes his first class. The NCAA would consider posting his roster and bio on that page to be a comment on him. Therefore, you will not see his bio officially added until after classes start back up in a couple of weeks. As for whether or not he needs to be on the All Star page, you should note that there is at least one member of the team, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III</a> , who is not on that list but has a bio that has apparently never been questioned on Wikipedia. 66.191.177.80 23:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;:) AHHa! And the smoking gun is finally here! (or at least a fairly good point to take into consideration)&#160;:) Good job on counter argument! Now we must see if that precedence withstands the tests of WP:BIO. I say that because seemingly, that article doesn't have many categories listings, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Joe_Tereshinski_III" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Joe_Tereshinski_III" rel="nofollow">anything linking to it</a>. This means the article, I believe, might not have had the chance to be properly revued by a substantial amount of peers. It may not be the best precendence. However, I would seemingly tend to support that article, (under the impression that this is a player of that college team) This is only because you have indicated he is on the team roster already. (that article itself sucks and needs much improvement) Anyway I tried finding something similar with my University team the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Gee_Gees_dcd0.html" title="Ottawa Gee Gees">Ottawa Gee Gees</a> but I couldn't find a precedence. And though you example is seemingly good, there still might be a better one out there, no? --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 02:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
