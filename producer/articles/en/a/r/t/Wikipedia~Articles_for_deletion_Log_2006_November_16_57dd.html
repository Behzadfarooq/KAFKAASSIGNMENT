<li>If there is something to this, that isn't evidence of it. The web page that you linked to is a straight word-for-word, but not GFDL compliant, mirror of our <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">electronic commerce</a> article. The text that you are quoting was added to that article by Seelygant (<a href="../../../s/e/e/User_talk%7ESeelygant_4123.html" title="User talk:Seelygant">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seelygant_0c75.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seelygant">contribs</a>), the creator of <i>this</i> article, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_commerce&amp;diff=85985788&amp;oldid=85968329" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_commerce&amp;diff=85985788&amp;oldid=85968329" rel="nofollow">these edits</a>.

<li>Oh, dear, I had no idea I had stumbled on to a mirror site. However, I don't think John Seely-Gant is the originator of this article. It may be his son or a close relative who is very proud of him. I emailed the subject of this article directly to ask him how we might document his accomplishments. He responded with some initial information and promised to follow-up. What makes me think that he did not write the article himself is a change in language that he asked for, as he said in his e-mail: <i>It may be more accurate to characterize me as a "pioneer" than as an "originator" (though I did devise the first U.S. DoD ecommerce system with some others while at Booz, Allen).</i> While I concur with <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s assertion that we still don't have documented sources, I think I can get real sources before this discussion is concluded and that this man has been a significant player in the history of the development of the Internet and e-commerce. I request that someone notify me before any Admin action to delete so that I can userfy this article and get it into good shape for re-posting as a good article.

<li>Since his involvement in the Department of Defense E-commerce work happened in the 1980's, then we may well need to rely on print sources for this, not internet websites.

<dd>Well good luck, but its not as if the United States of the 1980s is poorly covered by internet sources, magazine/news articles or books which are archived online. Factiva database coverage goes back to the 1980s for major news sources in US or even 1970s for a few sources.

That's a completely different article and no citation of references is always a solid reason to remove an asserted fact, even if the fact is real and true. In any case, <i>please keep in mind that we are <b>talking about a living person</b> here. Let's don't accuse him of things like fraud and a hoax when we have no evidence of that. We don't want to get into a slander an libel situation.</i> All we know for sure is that the original author of this article did a poor job of documenting his sources-- actually <i>didn't tackle the job of documenting sources at all before posting an article</i>. I have begun rather extraordinary efforts to locate documentation of reliable sources for this article and I'm actually quite good at that task. Let's don't jump to a conclusion just because the source material doesn't just pop up instantly on our computer screens. Google isn't the only research tool that there is. I've seen many an AfD turn on a dime when the sources are located and change to "keep." As someone who has had no previous contact with this subject I think I will be able to give a neutral assesment of the documentation, and <i><b>I will</b></i> make this into a good Wikipedia article we can all be proud of <i>if the sources turn out to be good</i>. I know good evidence when I see it, and I wont be bashful about explaining that the evidence doesn't pass muster either. If the sources are iffy, I will report the same here on this AfD and advise the subject of the article that neither I nor any of the other editors on Wikipedia can do anything with it. <b>I haven't even voted to "keep" yet-- just requested not to "speedy."</b> A lot can happen in five days. <i>I'm not just arguing a position-- I'm committed to do the work to back it up if this article can be saved.</i> <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 20:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was a stub I wrote a long time ago about a local Baltimore band. It was speedied before I noticed, so I've restored it because it is clearly not speediable under A7. The article claims notability, and cites it (though the link didn't work because the source changed urls, I have found the new url and fixed the link). Whether or not it is enough is another question, so I have nominated it here. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 02:12, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This has been tried as a CSD and a prod, and on both occasions the tag was removed with little or no addition of notability-related material. Essentially, we're dealing with an article which was written by the subject and is about someone who appears to be a run-of-the-mill evangelist. I don't doubt that he's doing good works, just that he's notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:16, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was all ready to jump on the evil spammers, but this is CLEARLY not spam! There is <i>no way</i> that an <b>agency of the UN</b> feels the need to spam Wikipedia! This is clearly bureaucratic, governmental jargon, and probably not <i>yet</i> notable enough for it's own article (although the very similar <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Development_Index_c588.html" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> has its own article), but there's plenty of room for it in the article about the agency that originated it. And if it continues to be a UN standard, there's every chance it <i>will</i> come to deserve its own article before long (if it doesn't already). And guess what? I figured all this out with only a couple of minutes of research, mostly without even leaving Wikipedia! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:35, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Late dissenter: While this is something invented by the ITU, people may come across this out-of-context, and following a link into a much more general article is a confusing experience for the newcomers.

<p>I first noticed this article when I saw users fighting back and forth on the reliability of forum posts as sources- there was a pretty heated debate about the software and neutrality. Anyway, I pointed out on the talk page that this article needs sources to be verified. I've pleaded for sources on the talk page and in edit summaries, saying the page could be deleted if none were presented. None have been, so it's my belief that the article does not meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> and is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> IMNSHO, Vodei is just a scheme to get you to download something that will then nag you for money. The software isn't particularly useful, and seems notable mostly for the number of people who are annoyed with it. As adware goes, it's actually fairly benign compared to some of the stuff out there. I really don't care if we delete this or not, but I want to point out that we have articles on <a href="../../../c/y/d/Cydoor.html" title="Cydoor">Cydoor</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zango.html" title="Zango">Zango</a>, and other such nuisances, so I don't see any reason why we can't have an article on this. -- Mcoder 11:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The WIKI is a community project. I can find lots of pages that do not strictly follow the WIKI guidelines. The bin Laden pages reference unverified anonymous sources (the video tapes), for example, and give them precedence over written verfied interviews from bin Laden. But I don’t seem to be able to persuade anyone to do anything about it, despite the fact it’s a blatant violation of content guidelines. At the end of the day, the case is marginal, I agree, but if WIKI users want the page, and find it useful, why not? Is the server running out of space? BTW, I thought the page was just starting to come together and look reasonable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 13:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I should remind you that "If article A then article B" is not an argument here. This is about Vodei's verifiability and lack thereof.

<li><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl">EdGl</a>&#160;: You're right, this is not the place to discuss the quality of the writing. The article may need improvement, but that is <i><u>not</u></i> a reason to delete. Instead of spelling out the problems that you have with the writing, be bold and edit the article (or tag the article appropriately). <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicago_god_e952.html" title="User:Chicago god">Chicago god</a> 08:36, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying it's a reason to delete! I'm saying that just because (Billpg thinks that) the article is well written doesn't mean that the article should be kept! Sorry for all the exclamation points, but I want to make sure you're reading my posts the way I mean them to say. As an aside, though, I <i>would</i> improve the diction, but since the consensus seems to be "delete", then I'm not going to waste my time. But if it were the other way around, I'd help it out. Or if doing so would improve its notability. <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 21:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> YouTube is notable. And this ranked #1 all-time in important categories. I suspect that YouTube and its succesors are becoming a valid medium for publishing of animation. If this had been made 50 years ago it would have been a short subject at the movies, I guess, and if had won the Oscar for best short subject it'd be notable.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> - there is no such thing as precedent on Wikipedia, but nonetheless, the issue of whether to have an article on every episode of a TV series is mainly a question of whether it falls under '<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate information</a>'.

<dd>Deciding what warrants mention is a critical part of the editing process. You, yourself, are making a call about what warrants mention on Wikipedia by raising this AfD. This is by no means "original research". The alternative, in this case, would be to copy someone else's summary, which I'm sure violates a copyright law or two. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 05:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Where the WP:NOT policy says <i>"Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain [...] not solely a summary of that work's plot"</i>, the work of fiction in question here is actually the whole of Naruto, not this single episode. The episode summaries are merely a small part of the 'article set' of this work of fiction (i.e. this work's article set is not solely plot summaries). So as required, they are an aspect of that larger topic.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry about using the term 'guideline', it's just that I assumed that was the right term from the list at <a href="../../../t/v/e/WP%7ETVE_878f.html" title="WP:TVE">WP:TVE</a> titled <i>"TV shows currently using these guidelines"</i>. Obviously to describe each scene in detail is pointless, but if the level of detail in this article (600 words) is too much, then there is an enormous amount of material listed under WP:TVE that needs cutting. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashwinder_0bc6.html" title="User:Crashwinder">Crashwinder</a> 08:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What are these precedents? The AfD for all Naruto episodes isn't precedent; quite a few of the objections were about the scope of the nomination, not the articles themselves. A TV episode article should be more than just a plot summary, for example, see <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abyssinia%2C_Henry_%28M_A_S_H_episode%29_1e68.html" title="Abyssinia, Henry (M*A*S*H episode)">Abyssinia, Henry (M*A*S*H episode)</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> many people are voting with unfortunate haste as Horay just did above.

It is an aspect of a larger subject, and therefor does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7.

<li><b>Comment</b> An article <i>should</i> be able to stand on its own. There simply is not enough about the episode as it stands to merit an individual article.

<dd>You don't make an argument against sub-articles in general, do you?

<p>The result was: with, as eloquently pointed out by 152 and Garrett, no indication that MPOGD is notable (in fact, an article on the site has been deleted) and no arguments to the contrary, which means MPOGD cannot be said to confer notability through its awards, we have no non-trivial coverage by independent third-party sources or any other indication that this game is notable. <b>Delete</b>, <i>not discounting</i> arguments from anons, since a convincing case for deletion was made that has not been answered. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>And I did not know about the nomination of the one article nor that it had been "settled." I had seen this list this spring. I nominated one golf course (whose name I cannot remember now), which was deleted. Once I saw that went through I planned to nominate the whole list, but didn't get around to it until now. If you want to merge the articles, fo for it. Although including the length of the golf courses in a particular city in the article about that city might seem a little strange. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 17:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all I would just like to make clear that I am not Jennifer Hassum nor do I have a personal relationship with her, so this is not a vanity article. I created this article to connect two other articles in which she is mentioned and to provide extra infomation about her to readers of those articles. Jen is notable in both Canadian and toronto-area politics and I wrote a extensive rationale as to why I feel this way, which can be found on the discussion page of the article in question. As far as the issue of sources, I would be happy to add sources and expand the content if the article is allowed to remain. --Carrottop 79 02:36, 16 November 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have added some sources for you guys (and any gals), any more input in that regard would be helpful. As far as the notablity, as I mentioned in the discussion page, Jen is currently the president of Canada's largest student union with forty-one thousand members, at one of Canada's top universities and she is the youth wing co-chair of one of Canada's major political parties (and will be for about 2 more years) which at last count had support of 22% of Canadians and in the last election received over two and a half million votes. --Carrottop 79 03:14, 16 November 2006</li>

<li>If you want to keep looking for them, please do. This is a good start for preparing AfD's for non-notable bios. Your point -- that the encyclopedia sometimes accumulates articles that really should be deleted -- is well-taken. But I think you're wanting to go the next step and say "and so we shouldn't delete any particular one of these articles." Nah - we should delete them all (assuming they really are all non-notable, which should be decided individually.) What you are showing is that we need to be more active in deleting articles about people who are not notable. What you <i>need</i> to show is that this one particular artice is about someone who <i>is</i> notable, and therefore shouldn't be deleted.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. She was non-notable before 9/11, and her book had not been accepted for publication at that time. The book itself is a non-notable contribution to the self-help genre, and, realistically, was probably accepted for publication simply so the publisher could cash in on her status as a 9/11 victim. I'm sure she was a good and nice person, but she was not notable. If we accept this article we start down the slippery slope to separate articles for every victim of terrorism, and, in due course, every soldier killed in the line of duty. Many good and kind people have died in sad circumstances, and every one of them is a loss to their friends and family. Notability derives from activity, not simple presence at a historic event. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:57, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Terence Ong. <i>The Epoch Times</i> may or may not be operated by Falun Gong, but what it <i>definitely</i> is not is a reliable source. Even the better stories are entirely one-sided, and it's not unusual to see an article that runs along the lines of "All the legitimate scientific authorities say that X does not exist. But I read a webpage by some guy who says it does. Why are all the legitimate scientific authorities lying about the existence of X?" Merely appearing in <i>The Epoch Times</i>, I'm afraid, adds absolutely nothing whatsoever to the credibility of an allegation -- certainly nothing that would justify the highly POV title of "Sunjiatun Concentration Camp". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - what are you talking about? There are numerous sources here (290 someone else counted), certainly many different things besides newspapers including government documents and so forth. More importantly, the topic has been researched by many unbiased scholars.

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> <b>Keep and Clean Way Up</b> Much of this conspiracy advancing travesty of an article consists of nothing more than Conspiracy Theory, Disinfo and Neocon propaganda from disproven Conspiracy Crufters like Stephen Hayes and Laurie Mylroie.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree, but this page also includes all the refutations of the conspiracy theorists.

<li><b>Delete</b> Completely non-notable musician, whose article is entirely about his one-man-band project, <i>which has its own article as well</i> (Mirrorthrone). Totally unencyclopedic tone and appears to be a conflict of interest.

<p>Non notable school asserting no encyclopedic content, I don't think there's such thing as "regioncruft" but this articles assertion of "stalwarts like IICT, NGRI, CCMB" is also hopelessly relevant to only the region in which the article is commenting. The style and grammar would require a complete rewrite (with the capslock key levered off the keyboard) and the POV issues if removed would probably result in a 6 word article. Best to just bin it. <b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 03:27, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

With a little bit of research, it is clear that the school is indeed notable, and the additional information has been added to the article with material from the school's web site and several references from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a></i>, India's main national newspaper. With its management and operation by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Institute_of_Chemical_Technology_9ab6.html" title="Indian Institute of Chemical Technology">Indian Institute of Chemical Technology</a>, the school has a unique science program that allows students to learn from India's top scientists, and to have heard from several recent <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry_883d.html" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> laureates. The school competes in, and has won, at the top levels of sport in the state. I strongly suggest that all those who previously voted to Delete should re-read the article and reconsider their vote. Based on fulfilling the coverage requirements of criterion 1 and the fact that the "school has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools" in compliance with criterion 4, the school meets and exceeds the requirements of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> for retention. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm opposed to the inclusionism surrounding high schools; I strongly feel that only a small few are notable enough to justify having articles. However, I have become resigned to the fact that I am in the minority on this matter as virtually all high schools are kept. Now if we are going to continue following this policy, then we need to accept foreign high schools as well. See what kind of doors this opens? &#160;;) Regardless, this schools article is decently well written and appears that it may be notable anyway. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I left them at the table before I came to the discussion, because I feel they are minority, perhaps even fringe, sentiments, but I now feel compelled to argue with conviction. I do not think that this high school, though it seems like an admirable high school, merits an encyclopædia article.

If a high school were to influence educational standards for a whole national region, or attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement (not, "They delivered N number of cans to FEMA") or fiasco (something on the scale of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine</a>), then I would certainly consider it <i>notable as to justify encyclopædic inclusion</i>. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 17:03, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea what "systemic bias" is supposed to mean, but I do know how to define notability. Your "tentative" status is demonstrating an extreme version of deletionist elitism as to what schools merit inclusion in Wikipedia. At this school, the Nobel laureates lectured as part of an integrated program with the parent <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Institute_of_Chemical_Technology_9ab6.html" title="Indian Institute of Chemical Technology">Indian Institute of Chemical Technology</a>, unlike the feel-good appearances by those on the lecture circuit at your school, which had no connection whatsoever to the curriculum. By your logic, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine High School</a> should not merit an article, as it was merely the site of a massacre. If the incident had happened at a local fast food establishment, would there be an article Columbine McDonald's that talked about the restaurant's menu and staff simply because a whole bunch of people were killed by two members of the wait staff who worked there after school? Or would there be an article for Columbine Post Office about the hours and services offered at that branch, if <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold_7c49.html" title="Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a> had graduated high school and gotten jobs as letter carriers before they went berserk? As to your "influence educational standards for a whole national region" criterion, can you name more than a handful of schools (if that many) that would meet this criteria? We have to stop sitting up all night trying to figure out new hoops for school articles to jump through. And when did Wikipedia become a US only site that we have to question whether foreign schools should be admitted? Schools, as an integral part of our education system, and as demonstrated by the frequent, in-depth coverage they receive from multiple, independent and reliable sources, are often notable and deserve articles in Wikipedia, should they meet these standards. This school is simply one of the better-qualified for Wikipedia inclusion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Your expeditious label of me as an extreme elitist is merely an underhanded tactic designed to discredit my justification to delete this article. Instead of addressing my points directly, you first prefix an accusation of systematic bias in order to label me as a miscreant and a systematically biased Western bigot. I ask you this: if I were an extremist like you explicitly accuse me of being, why would I be compelled to "tentatively" argue for the deletion of this article? If I intended to systematically delete this and every other article which did not fit in with my bigoted "deletionist [elitist]" views, would I argue to "tentatively delete" this article? No. If I were in fact an extremist as you accuse of being, I would argue <i>vehemently</i> for the deletion of any article which I did not include in the limited corpus of human knowledge I deemed appropriate to include in any encyclopædia. Because I in fact argue <i>tentatively</i> rather than <i>vehemently</i> for the deletion of this article, I am not a systematically biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western bigot as you readily accuse me of being. Thus I loathe your accusation that I am prejudiced by an "extreme ... deletionist elitism."</li>
<li>Further, nowhere did I argue that because Columbine High School was involved in one of the the largest, worst, most horrific school massacres in United States history that it should be priveleged to have data on its corresponding encyclopædia article including hours, staff, address, contact information, etc. My apparently systematicaly biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western-bigoted minority/fringe views which you shamelessly accuse me of compel me to disagree with including the aforemtioned data on the grounds of it being unencyclopædic. If the data could be integrated into the article in the form of compelling, even brilliant prose, then including would be fine by me. But I view that including it in a pithy directory format in an easily accessible table right in view at the top of the page is exactly <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
<li>And no, as to my idealistic (but ultimately bigoted and "deletionist [elitist]") school inclusion criterion, that the school "influence educational standards for a whole national region," I cannot name more than a handful of schools that would meet this criterion. But, in the spirit of my alleged systematically biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western-bigoted views, I feel compelled to include only these few schools in any encyclopædia. But I loathe your label; I ardently argue that I am neither systematically biased, nor "deletionist [elitist]," nor a Western bigot when I think that this article should not be included in Wikipædia. A Western bigot would argue that this article be deleted but not articles about high schools in the United States deleted; I argue that not only this article but also articles concerning high schools in the United States be deleted, thus I am not a Western bigot. An "extreme ... deletionist [elitist]" would argue <i>vehemently</i> that this article be deleted; I am not arguing vehemently that this article be deleted, but am arguing <i>tentatively</i> that it be deleted, thus I am not an "extreme ... deletionist [elitist]". (I <i>am</i> arguing <i>vehemently</i> that your accusations and abstractions of my arguments are underhanded, accusatory attempts to discredit my arguments in favor of deletion by labeling me as a systematically biased, "deletionist [elitist]" Western bigot. There is a distinct difference.)</li>
<li>I still stand by my criteria for inclusion of high schools in Wikipedia. (I must note, however, that I do not pretend to hold them as a final decision. Indeed, I quickly summarized thoughts that had been floating around in my head upon which I have neither ruminated nor refined.) I do not use them as a strict policy, but instead I am informed by them, when I choose to argue to <i>tentatively delete</i> this article. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 01:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you claiming that you don't recognize that your argument that only those high schools that "were to influence educational standards for a whole national region" merit inclusion is not elitist? Again, how many schools in the world meet this criteria? It is a justification that is so irrational as to be meaningless. Your "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" is another standard that is so arbitrarily unrealistic as to be useless. How many schools on this planet meet this criteria? By what existing Wikipedia standard have you derived these justifications?

<li><b>Comment</b> Generally, I would agree with the premise that most high schools (e.g., most on the planet) are not notable. I changed to keep on this particular one, as it has some very unique and special characteristics, and has been verifiably recognized in quite a few third-party sources. However, generally, Local High is not notable, any more then a local Wal-Mart or gas station would be. I would say there should be some additional exceptions, such as historic/event notability (Columbine, for example, or the first high school in a country), exceptional standards or styles of teaching (though if this is related to a "chain" such as Waldorf/Montessori, this should already be covered under the main "X Schools" article and wouldn't establish notability for the school itself), exceptional and historic controversy surrounding the school (of more than just local interest), massive and verifiable influence on teaching standards over a <b>large</b> region or nationwide (not just state/citywide), winning a major national (not local) award and receiving significant press coverage for it, or exceptional and region/nationwide (again, not state/citywide) notability for a program at the school. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 03:26, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>Please immediately stop</i> accusing me of being "irrational," "[voting nonsensically]," and providing "ludicrous arguments." I noticed that again, instead of arguing based solely on the apparent merit or lack of merit of my arguments, you prefix an accusation of irreparable and nonsensical bias. Why do I have to cite specific "standards"'s for my argument? I argued based on my conviction that only a few high schools are notable enough <i>to be included in an encyclopædia</i>. So what? My extemporaneous criteria are elitist. I know that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipædia is not paper</a>; but that should never imply that Wikipædia should include everything of little notability and influence.</li>
<li>And why does it matter that my criteria are elitist? Precedent and consensus must start somewhere: an unrecognized and unrespected opinion. Does my argument offend you? Does it frighten you? Why are you so loathe towards my argument such that your reaction is first to alienate my argument, then accuse me of irreparable bias and nonsensical justification? Are you unable to discuss the apparent lack of merits you find in it, so you instead result to name calling? Bingo! That you are accusing me of elitism is again evident of your underhanded attempt to distance me from the mainstream. By attaching a label, you intend to stigmatize and alienate me from the average Wikipædian, based on the virtue that you dislike my opinion. Instead of arguing based on the perceived lack of merit, you attempt to create a divide via an automatic labeling procedure. <i>Please stop.</i></li>
<li>I still stand by my criteria, even if they are "gasp" elitist. I nonetheless consider them a good set of criteria to apply to the inclusion of articles into an <i><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">encyclopædia</a></i>. If you want to discuss the merits or lack of merits of my arguments, instead of merely labeling them with divisive, stigmatizing, and alienating labels, please come back and do; otherwise, any further altercation would be superfluous, appalling, and redundant.</li>
<li>(Note: Consider the following clause from "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">wikietiquette</a>". <i>The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments.</i> You specifically accused me of "[not justifying my] nonsensical <i>vote</i>". I thought this was a <i>debate</i>, not a <i>vote</i>. I argued, either meaningfully or nonsensically, based on my conviction. My "vote" was a mere initial text to summarize my argument. Do you just want me to fall into line and vote <i>strong keep</i>, with little supporting argument, like the rest of the people you solicited to "reconsider their vote"? Perhaps you should cite any "existing Wikipedia standard" for your actions; that is, if you truly do require that to support any individualised action on Wikipædia.) --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 10:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not a vote. But the thing you typed where you wrote "weak delete" and tried to explain your justification is so far out of consensus as to be meaningless. Why is your requirement that a school "influence educational standards for a whole national region" or "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" any more valid than "all schools are notable"? How can you quote an obligation to "make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments", which are solely based on your own personal biases, not on any relevant standard? If you read above, I detail the criteria by which this article passes <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and would pass any other relevant test for such an institution. And you appeal to what, other than your own personal whim?? How many schools in the world meet your elitist criteria?

<dd><b>Comment</b> To reply to the above comment by Alansohn, I don't find Iamunknowns justification meaningless at all and it could be construed as a personal attack... His requirements <i>are</i> more valid than 'all schools are notable' in the sense that they are actual requirements that can act as guidelines for determining notability while simply saying 'all schools are notable' is not, at least not in the same way. Rather, 'all schools are notable' is a discussion closer; it offers no further justification and makes the whole idea of notability rather worthless. Now, I am actually with you on keeping this particular article, but I agree with Iamunknown in claiming that this whole every high school is notable is a flawed approach that is not in line with most of Wikipedia's policies regarding notability standards. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 11:49, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> You got me on that one. Okay, let's try this: a so-called standard that only accepts those schools that "influence educational standards for a whole national region" or "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" is no more valid than a standard that specifies notable schools as those with "more than ten students" or "has been open more than two years." One excludes 99.99999% of all schools, allowing about four or five to slip through, while the other includes almost all schools and excludes a few dozen. They're functional equivalents at exact opposite ends of the spectrum. At least those who claim that "all schools are notable" have the intellectual honesty to proclaim their biases out loud, without hiding behind elitist mumbo-jumbo to hide the fact that what they really advocate is "no schools are notable". The plain fact is that a significant percentage of schools, based on the "multiple non-trivial coverage" standard, are in fact notable by any reasonable definition. It's far less than 100%, but it's certainly far more than the 0.00001% that seems to be advocated by some here. The <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> proposal is a reasonable middle ground that is far closer to a rational middle ground than the wacky deletionist <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> or the even wackier, even further away from consensus standard proposed proposed here. As a matter of fact <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> has not listed any school (other than Columbine) that would meet his criteria. I guess any school that wants an article can always hope for a good, old-fashioned massacre. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:06, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Once again, I would assert that most schools aren't notable (just as the local McDonald's or CompUSA isn't notable, even if in aggregate McDonald's and CompUSA are notable.) The idea of high schools is notable, but very few <i>specific</i> high schools are notable. I think <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, while still a little loose, is a reasonable compromise between the inclusionist "almost all schools are notable" and the deletionist "maybe 0.01% of schools are notable." <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is not, it allows far too many non-notable ones through the cracks. I'd also add that your argument contains a fallacy-just because two arguments are on nearly-opposite ends of a spectrum doesn't mean equal validity. "Almost no one believes the earth is flat" is correct, "almost everyone believes the earth is flat" is wrong, even though they're opposites on that spectrum. Similarly, I would assert that "almost all high schools are notable" is incorrect, while "almost no high schools are notable" is correct. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 14:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Individual local schools are regular recipients of "multiple non-trivial coverage"; Individual McDonald's and CompUSA rarely receive such coverage. Schools receive national and state awards granted on a selective and competitive; ixnay for McDonald's and CompUSA locations. That said, it's nice to have your extreme deletionist bias out in the open. Wikipedia has a a clear consensus that a significant majority of schools are notable, and a succinct proposal at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> that offers succinct guidelines to define which are and which are not. Your "no schools are notable" dictate, and the formal definition of this credo at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, is so far out of the mainstream as to be invalid for consideration. A significant percentage of schools, based on the "multiple non-trivial coverage" standard, are notable by any reasonable definition of the term. It's far less than 100%, but it's certainly far more than the 1-in-ten thousand standard (converting your 0.01%) that you advocate here. If there are 20,000 high schools in the United States, only two would have articles. Which two are they- Columbine and what else? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> One would imagine that a local McDonald's or CompUSA would receive coverage for grand openings, and possibly even for sales or the like-especially in smaller cities or towns. The problem and point here is, however, that the coverage is of only <i>local</i> notability. Also, please do not misrepresent me-I said the compromise point should be <i>in between</i> "include every school" and "include 0.01% of schools" (a figure which I made up on the spot anyway), so I never suggested the 0.01% as a correct figure. The criteria I suggested earlier were somewhat lost in the sea of text, but to reiterate-I believe that schools which are the subject of exceptional controversy (more so than just locally), are historically important (Columbine, or the first high school in a country), have a notable and very unusual teaching method, and are not a "chain" such as Waldorf/Montessori in which this is covered in the main article (many charter schools would meet this), have won major regional/national (not state or local) awards and have received significant press for this, or are a verifiably major influence on regional/national (not state or local) teaching methods or standards, are notable and should be included. Some other schools such as this one (with Nobel-prize winners as regular lecturers) may have some unique claim to notability as well, which should be examined on a case by case basis as it was here. Oh, and before you label me an "extreme deletionist", you may wish to note what I voted here. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have a number of remarks regarding this conversation. They are as follows:
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Alan, please try to be more civil. Making <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on Iamunknown simply because he disagrees with you is inappropriate. Calling someone's views 'wacky' because they are different than yours doesn't help the situation and only heightens tension. Referring to your arguments as the only ones which are 'reasonable' shares the same problem. I don't see why reason dictates that you are more correct than others. I'm assuming good faith on this matter; I believe that we are all reasonable editors with different viewpoints and our viewpoints all have some validity.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> This notion that those of us who would normally want to delete high schools are 'elitist' is perhaps somewhat correct, though it's a thinly veiled attempt to demean our position in favor of a more inclusionist one. As far as the way this term is being used in this context, I am of the opinion that encyclopedias are <i>supposed</i> to be elitist; <b>they are not directories to have information on every school, hospital, restaurant and gas station rather they are supposed to discriminate and include information on those that substantially stand out from the crowd.</b> Does the high school have a novel approach to education? If so, keep it. Has it won a considerable number of awards? Then keep it. Is it a typical high school, with a decent but average program? Then it doesn't need to have an article.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> While this may not be directly on topic, it ties in with my above comments. After looking at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> I have to say I still find it too inclusionist based on its first criteria and the fact that a school must only meet one. Virtually all schools, including elementary ones (and even many preschools) will meet that criteria. Local newspapers often have several articles on each school in that locality every year. This criteria makes the other three meaningless since it's going to end up resulting in articles for all other schools. I personally, and I recognize this isn't the most appropriate place for this discussion, feel that criteria one should be required in conjunction with one of the other three criteria.</dd>
<dd><b>4.</b> Finally, as a matter of self-defense, please keep in mind that I did vote keep in this particular instance. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had changed my notes to reflect some begrudging support for this based on the fact that the article had been cleaned up and removed some of the glaring problems that it originally had, but seeing some fellow exclusionists weigh in a little I'm inclined to comment further towards getting the consensus. I am unreservedly elitist in my view on Wikipedia, as an exlusionist I believe that articles should exist representing the top <i>x</i>% of schools. Those which are notable above and beyond the usual collection of schools that all of us (presumably) went to and each of which had their own unique facets associated with them. Some of the following need to be considered before we can reach consensus here.
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Is this school unique in any way which is unique to uniqueness? This horridly phrased question means, all schools are unique in some way or another. Each has individual personalities, innovative programs and achievements which set them apart from a category or categories in which they may participate. Some have nobel prize laureates give speeches, some have presentations by the Coca Cola yo-yo team (mine did), but by their nature schools do things that other schools don't. Their unique achievements need to be considered in line with this, and should be <i>more</i> unique to assert their notability than perhaps a Safeway or McDonalds should. My highschool in Australia had an annual festival whereby inordinate ammounts of dutch fruit and donut balls were cooked and sold to raise funds, it was very well known in the surrounding towns for it. No other school did this or anything similar but <i>schools do unique things</i>, this doesn't make them notable.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> Systemic bias is a horrid labelling accusation designed to drag a debate into the mud. It is <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum_0887.html" title="Reductio ad Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a> in the worst possible manner, designed to villify arguments by directly associating them with a widely despised phenomena. Essentially the thin veil of accusations of racial vilification are being used to draw attention away from the fact that the school in question here, and often any school whose notability is up for debate, is hopelessly relevant to only a very select area. We should not feel guilty about this, and we should wholesale reject any <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>-esque accusations designed to make people feel guilty for expressing a valid opinion provided it is backed up with fact.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> Further on geography, I don't think we should take into consideration the location of a school when deciding on it's worthiness of inclusion. Let's just drag this down to common sense, let's assume that each Wikipedian reading my comments now is a vaguely intelligent person. Let's say they randomly think up the names of 5 educational institutions. For me it was University of Sydney, UCLA, MIT, Oxford and Lund Universitat. Let's assume they think up 10 more, let's assume they are then asked to think up 1000, 10,000, <b>100,000</b>. Will an average person given ANY period of time, have the Dr. S. Hussain Zaheer Memorial High School pop into their head? Notability doesn't mean fame I know, but would any 500 english speaking people chosen randomly across the globe when asked directly about the Dr. S. Hussain Zaheer Memorial School know what it was from a source other than the Wikipedia? Now apply the same test to <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lund_University_2678.html" title="Lund University">Lund</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Standford</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julliard.html" title="Julliard">Julliard</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroshima_University_25a5.html" title="Hiroshima University">Hiroshima University</a>...</dd>
<dd><b>4.</b> This final one is entirely my good-faith opinion, may be entirely wrong and is almost certainly going to be misinterpreted and leave me the subject of personal attacks. I believe that a part of Indian culture is a unified feeling of immense pride in India's educational institutions, particulary those related with the technology industry. While applaudable this sense of pride needs to be considered with caution when evaluating encyclopedia articles on that subject matter, the cultural pride in India's schools may lend itself to editors of articles on them taking criticism of their notability personally. I'm making no comment on the actual quality of India's schools, only that inside of India the opinion held by people outside of India on the notability of Indian schools may be overestimated. <b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 22:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Let's start looking at this sensibly people. I am sick to death of the systemic bias garbage, being called hamfisted and american-centric (as an-even minded and tactful Australian this is nothing other than a personal attack by any sensible person's reckoning and SandyDancer is to be admonished for it), my reasons for nominating this article are that it is a failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> so spectuacular that it rivals a new-year's eve fireworks display. That the comments for it's inclusion in the AfD debate are backed with ricepaper-like prose while considered discussion for the deletion of it seemed to be ignored in favour of the volume of "keep all schools rox kthx".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This debate was re-opened because I petitioned the administrator who closed it to take another look, thanks should go to him for being open-minded enough to let some more consensus form. The comments on his or her talk page were as follows and should be noted here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(BEGIN)</dd>
<dd>I'd like to request you have another look at this debate, I think the consensus achieved was actually in the negative. If you consider that the aim of an article for deletion debate is to reach a consensus, not vote on an outcome, the consensus was overwhelmingly for the article's deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But first, this school <i>still</i> spectacularly fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> as follows</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the school itself.</i></dd>
<dd>No, or none stated which is the same thing. This school has not been the subject of <i>any</i> non-trivial publications in the world at large, it is only notable within one country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school has been or was in existence for over 50 years, due to the great likelihood of—but greater difficulty of uncovering—non-trivial historical coverage of that school.</i></dd>
<dd>This school has existed for 27 years, a little over half of that requirement. Even if we <i>halve</i> the requirement as per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> it <i>just</i> makes it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school participates in the highest grade of the state, province or regional competitions in at least three extracurricular activities and has won at least two regional championships or one national championship in any of these activities. These can include, for example, sports teams, band competitions, cheerleading competitions, engineering contests, and so forth.</i></dd>
<dd>Again, no. The article states two fields of endeavour in which it has been successfull. This is <i>again</i> a case of if the requirements set out in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> were halved it would still just make it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools.</i></dd>
<dd>My understanding of this (perhaps you disagree) is that the school would have to have something very specific about it that sets it apart. A school which provides for IT industry certifications as part of it's highschool education curriculum, a school which teaches braille or sign lanugage as part of it's curriculum in servicing the blind or deaf, <i>something</i> which sets it apart from highschools. This is another spectacular failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school or its staff.</i></dd>
<dd>None. The school has not been awarded any state awards, or had any commendations from notable people as would be outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school has notable alumni or staff (e.g. would qualify for an article under WP:BIO or WP:MUSIC)</i></dd>
<dd>No, or not stated, again the same thing. You could almost consider that it's namesake is notable, but I'd doubt it and I think the other considered arguments for deletion would agree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school building or campus has notable architectural features that set it apart from others.</i></dd>
<dd>No. I assume that this school is not on board a spacecraft, under the sea, at the 150th floor of a building or in a building which has existed for time immemorial as an example of a particular period of architecture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see this is a failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> that can not possibly get any worse. Further the debate that was meant to achieve a consensus, only tallied votes. These "keep votes" had such nonsensical explanations as "Weak Keep- Seems to be a notable educational institution. Nileena joseph (Talk|Contribs) 16:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)", or "KEEP. NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE INDEPENDANTLY NOTABLE, BUT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THIS SCHOOL IS. RFerreira 05:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)" a cursory counting of heads and people weighing in. There were paragraphs upon paragraphs of weighted, supported, considered reasons for it's deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(END)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Guys my (hopefully) final word on this is that this school is not notable, it is not made notable by having a hockey ground even if it is a very nice one. It is not made notable by important people speaking at it (ALL schools get important people speaking at them), it is not made notable by a sea of people saying "Seems notable" without providing any information as to WHY it seems notable to them and on what version of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> they are making the assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any Wikipedians who comment on this AfD further, would be doing me a personal favour for which I'd be most grateful if they didn't drag the debate into the mud with <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>-esque accusations of racial villification, calling people ham-fisted, a doodie-head, or do anything else to try and detract from the actual subject matter at hand in favour of a petualant race-card play. Any editor offering "<b>keep</b> it seems notable although I've never read any of the guidelines defining what that word means on Wikipedia" or "<b>keep</b> you are racist against India" or "<i>keep</i> This school now has two Google hits, nevermind both of them are Alansohn requesting on user's talk pages that they reconsider their opinion publically", should be discounted and if nobody can offer actual reasons why this article is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia the matter should be closed and resolved for deletion.</dd>

<p>User Hatto created this page because he isn't happy with the current amount of space dedicated to this "phenomena" (as he choses to call it) on the original Masashi Tashiro page. This "phenomenon" is hardly notable enough to warrant its own article and merging it would be pointless (as everything in this article is information that other editors removed from the original article). <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 03:43, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strongly keep</b>, It's my freedom whether I write this article or not. Although Mackan isn't an administrator, he keeps on interfering with me. He should have no need to do it with me! I'm extremely annoying that he says to me guideline, guideline, guideline! and deletes unnecessary sentence to himself at any times. A person like him may be hated because he dogmatically deletes the sentence that he can't accept. Freedom and right to create the articles must be secured for everybody. I don't think what he does is correct. Actually, I think I'd like to expand Tashiro's article without being interfered by him but I have trouble because he keeps watch over me. By the way, Tashiro Festival is frequently used on <a href="../../../2/c/h/2channel.html" title="2channel">2channel</a>. When I wrote about Tashiro Festival on <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masashi_Tashiro_9bbf.html" title="Masashi Tashiro">Masashi Tashiro</a>'s article, I created this as an independent article because Mackan deleted the description about Tashiro Festival and I was unpleasant to be done it by him.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I'm not surely a newcomer but is feeling bitten. I could purely edit Tashiro's article until I was attacked by Mackan. I assume a strong attitude for him daringly, and I think I have no need to talk with a xxxxing terrorist like him because I'm getting so angry to him. Though I just wanted to describe about Tashiro Festival on Masashi Tashiro's article, I was made to shorten a description about it in Tashiro's "Trivia" section by his wish. Originally a description about Tashiro Festival is not written in the section of "Trivia" and the description was written in the section called "Provisional winner of Time Magazine's Person of the Year poll in 2001". (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masashi_Tashiro&amp;diff=73716926&amp;oldid=73716813" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masashi_Tashiro&amp;diff=73716926&amp;oldid=73716813" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masashi_Tashiro&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=73716926" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masashi_Tashiro&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=73716926" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>) I made this section and write about Tashiro Festival because I thought that festival was important but he shortened a description about it and moved it to "Trivia" section because he thought it was not important. I, therefore, can't accept all his sense of values. --<a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatto_ae57.html" title="User:Hatto">Hatto</a> 15:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP &amp; REWRITE</b> Utterly shocking that this is up for deletion. This is ENTIRELY AGAINST <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, because NaSTA is a national organisation (the clue is in the acronym), and has been discussed <i>countless times</i> in the national press (if proof is needed, I can provide it). This article must be kept, it can be dramatically improved if needed, and there is no good reason at all to delete it. I'd like to add that the comments made by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> about UK student TV have been particluarly offensive and ignorant. I know we should all 'assume good faith', but his tone is totally out of order. Honestly this makes me furious, is he suggesting that UK student TV IN IT'S ENTIRETY should be removed from Wikipedia? NaSTA is <i>not</i> an informal organization (that was a mistake in the entry), it is a long standing union of student TV stations, recognised in the UK television indstry. Granted, the article as it stands is pretty poor, but given time it can be expanded into a useful, valid, relevant entry. Being ignorant of this organisations existence is no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMalky_d682.html" title="User:JMalky">JMalky</a> 11:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> There only a very small number of student TV stations in the UK, and ALL of them are watched by industry profesionals looking for fresh talent - especially at the time of the NaSTAs. and the NaSTAs are SO much more than awards - it's a conference, where we can all meet each other, and meet key industry people etc. NaSTA exists (ask Greg Dyke, he'll tell you!) - and there is no reason it shouldn't exist on Wikipedia...! <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamhunt_fa0d.html" title="User:Adamhunt">adamhunt</a> 12:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see how this fails WP:ORG - it's a large formal organisation (hundreds attend the conference, it covers well over a thousand members of student TV stations), and I've seen a few national newspaper articles (often in the media supplements) on student TV that are centred around NaSTA. I've not got links as most papers don't publish every article (especially features) on the web. It's certainly regarded in the TV industry as the thing to watch for new television talent, and considering that many smaller university-specific student bodies are regarded as notable, this large multi-university media organisation surely must be. The article as stands doesn't do NaSTA justice, I'll try rewriting when I get some time.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomisaac_a693.html" title="User:Tomisaac">Tomisaac</a> 00:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Student TV stations have a lot of influence in the UK student population. To say YSTV (and NaSTA and other student stations) do not have sufficient notability is a farse.

<li>As to your refs: The BBC article is trivial because it's of local interest -- note it's in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/" rel="nofollow">"where I live--North Yorkshire"</a> section. Your second link doesn't reference this station at all--I don't know why you include it. Your third ref is a directory/contact info listing. Your fourth ref has two quotes about the station. Given that these are the most promising sources you could find, I can say with more confidence now than before that, like most student TV stations, this one is not the subject of multiple non-trivial outside sources. Finally, your comment that student TV stations have influence in the UK might be relevant to a discussion about whether to have an article on student TV stations in the UK, but it has nothing to do with whether we should keep <i>this</i> article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. YSTV has been running longer than many national TV stations, and has had plenty of media attention over the years. The NaSTA awards are judged by professionals from the industry, so I think it's completely unfair to call them "self-lauditary". DezSP 00:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. YSTV meets the criteria for notability on account of the multiple media references linked on its talk page. If you claim the NaSTAs are self-lauditary, then you imply that the same applies to the BAFTAs, Academy Awards and any other award organised by the community or industry that it is relevant to. Additionally, only the response from pan dan suggests any reason for deletion.Labmonkey 12:02, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The "media references on its talk page" that aren't passing or trivial are from York University itself. To show that something is notable you have to show that the outside world, as represented by sources <i>outside</i> of the subject, have taken note of it. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree that the other references are 'passing'. More have already been listed on this page too. Rowan 17:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Can you point to a single reference that is not passing (e.g. the blurb in the London Independent), trivial (e.g. the Media UK directory entry), or local (the BBC "Where I Live--Yorkshire" article)? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> An article by the BBC featuring only the station's web launch is hardly "trivial". If you would claim that this is not "outside" the subject due to the BBC being a broadcaster, then what references should *any* media organisation on Wikipedia use? Yes, local news, but by a national broadcaster, and on a national site. It's notable.144.32.128.113 11:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The BBC clearly classifies the article as being of local interest only. As I said above, it's in the "Where I Live--Yorkshire" section. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> These arguments about the notability of sources are getting a little pedantic. Wether or not the article complies with the <i>guidelines</i> in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is essentially a matter of opinion. Given that the majority view is that the article should be kept, can we not just give YSTV the benefit of the doubt? <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMalky_d682.html" title="User:JMalky">JMalky</a> 14:55, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> If the discussion seems pedantic to you, think about the general idea that's being illustrated here: <i>Most student TV stations are not notable as reflected in the fact that outside publishers usually do not see fit to issue non-trivial works featuring a particular student TV station.</i> After examining the sources, <i>this</i> student TV station is no exception to that idea. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> As pointed out above, the guidelines are merely guidelines, they are not there to be used to find any possible way of removing an article. It's one thing to request deletion of a page that nobody bothers with, but persisting in attacking an article that has widespread support just seems like a refusal to back down.Labmonkey 17:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> "<i>the guidelines are merely guidelines, they are not there to be used as a to find any possible way of removing an article</i>" -- Please read my above reply more carefully. You imply that the delete voters here are using the guidelines in a lawyerly fashion to try to search for some tiny, inconsequential reason why this article should be deleted. But the opposite is true. This article violates both the letter and spirit of <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. <i>Most</i> local organizations, including student TV stations, are not notable, and this one is no exception. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Actually, I just imply that you and the contributors requesting "keep" have differing viewson the interpretations of the se guidelines. I respect the fact that you were the only one who came up with a reply that was neither empty "Delete- really" or plain spite "Delete OMG WTF the whole bloody lot of them", but as it is, this boils down to your assertation that the media mentions are trivial, against multiple explanations of why they are not.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Multiple explanations"? I don't see one. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seriously, why are you pressing for deletion againt the wishes of so many other users? No stupid questions, no stupid answers. Just come up with a new, valid case for deletion or admit that you either can't bear to lose an argument or that you have some personal dislike of student TV.Labmonkey 21:40, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To participate constructively in this and future AfD debates (this one's almost done), please stop making silly assertions about people you're debating with and start addressing my/their arguments. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>This is just going round in circles. I have already addressed your argument with reference to media mentions, as have other users. You then claim that the media mentions are NN. Explanations are given my JMmalky, Rowan and are backed up by the links on the discussion page of the article. You have never used any other argument than an opinion that the stories linked are not notable enough, based on <i>your</i> interpretation of a <i>proposed</i> guideline, <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. That doesn't even stand up if you discount the BBC site, as Media Directions is a published magazine which falls under the guideline.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I agree that this discussion is almost over. The majority of contributors favour keeping the article and there's a clear list of sources that you are the only user to continue to dispute. I offered the chance to provide a new case for deletion, but you didn't do so. With regards to making "silly assertions", repeatedly disputing sources does seem to be an attempt to drag this out, and just seems to me like you have a personal problem with the article. I may be wrong, so just explain why you want this page removed so badly. Just stop deflecting, and say what you have against the article.Labmonkey 00:12, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's really still just a stub, give it some time. Student TV stations deserve to have entries. As <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloudo_bacc.html" title="User:Cloudo">Cloudo</a> said, GUST is the longest-running student TV station in the UK, plus it's been a training ground for hundreds of media professionals. If needed, I can provide a small pile of articles on GUST and <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a> from national newspapers, and the station has sold content to national broadcasters (as per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>). Some of the comments made about student TV on wikipedia have been really ignorant and offensive. (and why are all the UK student tv stations up for deletion, but not the US ones?) <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMalky_d682.html" title="User:JMalky">JMalky</a> 11:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Can I add that GUST is also the second oldest student TV station in the world, beaten only by Ithaca College Television which was founded six years earlier (confirmed through wikipedia and some internet searching, but further proof could be found if needed). However, ICTV is administrated and partly run by paid professionals, so you could legitimately say that GUST is the oldest student-run TV station in the world! So could everyone please think carefully before typing the letters 'NN'? <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMalky_d682.html" title="User:JMalky">JMalky</a> 14:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think the articles could be pruned - much of what has been included is of little relevance to most people - but to argue they should be deleted entirely is excessive - by the standards used so far, half of the articles on wikipedia could be deleted. Historically, and in the context of the development of television both within the UK and in the world in general, the GUST article and others of its kind are invaluable. Also, just visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Society_of_Change_Ringers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Society_of_Change_Ringers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Society_of_Change_Ringers</a> to see an example of a student society which is of little interest to anyone but those involved in it. I don't think any of these should be deleted - why set a limit on the extent of human knowledge available in these pages? - but if any could be deleted, the GUST and NaSTA pages are the least deserving. And as to the comments of NaSTA being self-lauditary (sic) by ohconfucius, I would respond that the awards are judged by industry figures not directly connected with the stations themselves. One wonders exactly how much actual research is being done on the notability of articles before they are slated for deletion? <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Cheers</b></font><b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewannis_6499.html" title="User:Mathewannis"> <font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2">mathewannis </font></a> | <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathewannis_a49b.html" title="User talk:Mathewannis">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_mathewannis_2b5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/mathewannis">Contribs</a> 04:38, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<li><b>OK</b>, each station should be judged on it's merits. Whilst I believe that all student TV stations should be allowed a page, it is true that some are more 'notable' than others, although I hate that word in this context.

<li>Jen Kettle asks, why should Twikkker have a wiki page? It is arguably the archetypal Rag Mag. It is also probably the first Rag Mag (recorded as being published in 1925 and with copies kept in copyright libraries since 1930). There are other reasons too; see the article!</li>
<li>I'm not sure how MER-C's ghits are relevant; 'nothing really interesting' is a subjective view; and anyway, ghits show many examples of old Twikkers being traded on eBay so it seems that it is still valued by collectors.</li>

<dd>I disagree - and your question ('Would you believe a magazine...?') is an irrelevance. The information taken from the magazines is not self-congratulatory or otherwise doubtful. It is simple statements such as 'The editor in 1947 was...' or 'The introduction in 1988 was written by...'. As I said, (and you have not answered this); in what way are these citations different from the ones in the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_eye.html" title="Private eye">Private eye</a> article?

<dd>Well, your guess is that the rock climb is 'in no way' related to Twikker. My guess is that it is, and I think it's a better guess - can you think of another reason the climb is called 'Twikker'?</dd>
<dd>Sure, the proportion of Private Eye's self-referencing is lower than that of Twikker's; but you conveniently ignore the Deadline example where self-referencing is all the article has to go on. Besides, either self-referencing is to be included, or it isn't. The Private Eye article is just one example where self-referencing in this manner is accepted.

<dd>Incidentally, the refs required was added by me and only for the rock climb section. The article states "A rock climb in the Derwent Valley in north Derbyshire is named 'Twikker', <b>presumably after the magazine</b>..".

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> as unsourced. Any article, to meet Wikipedia's standards, must do two things: 1. Assert the notability of its subject, and 2. document this assertion. The assertion of notability here is that the measure had ramifications outside the community and became precedent for other measures nationwide. After checking the links provided I find that the evidence for this has not been forthcoming. Simply put, if this measure was a landmark event reliable sources should not be hard to come by. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 04:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Despite grandiose claims, you and the article's supporters have still failed to prove your claims, and I am hoping that the closing admin will take that into consideration when deciding how to close this.

<li>You're too focused on term "Measure A" - I agree, you probably will never find anybody outside of alameda refer to the term "Measure A" - but that's not the point. The point is that 'land use' is an issue of great interest to people outside of Alameda, as other people have pointed out. This article is a land use article. People in Alameda know it by the term 'Measure A.' And again, you haven't provided any reason to dis-enfranchise Alameda residents from learning about it through Wikipedia. As for voting twice, that was not my intention - using Wikipedia amounts to using a programming language, and I'm not about invest half of my life learning another one.

I have worked with other people to make it more balanced, and suffered Argyriou (and his friends, I presume) editing the document over the past two months to repeatedly make it one sided in his own favor, forwarding his own Point of View.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowster_c2d2.html" title="User:Mowster">Mowster</a> 00:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You really don't understand this, do you? You're trying to turn this AfD into a referendum on Measure A, rather than a question over whether Alameda's specific policy is notable enough to warrant a Wikipedia article. All that your complaining about other people's biases does is make it appear that you don't have any real argument that Measure A is particularly notable. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 00:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I know I will be attacked no matter how I vote on this, so here goes. I think the tug-of-war over this Measure A article is ridiculous, and not just because I disagree with Mr. David Howard (AKA Mowster, AKA IP address 70.137.142.153) on the underlying issue. Measure A is of great interest to a number of Alameda residents, but I honestly don't think too many people beyond our borders are following it … though I must admit that whenever I tell people that it's <i>illegal</i> to build town homes, condominiums, and apartments in my town, it usually does raise an eyebrow or two. At any rate, I tried to use restraint in the few edits I made to the page, but nothing seems to satisfy Mr. Howard. Just as Measure A is a draconian measure to stop bad multiple-unit development by banning <i>all</i> multiple-unit development, my "delete" vote is a draconian measure to stop bad writing about Measure A by banning <i>all</i> writing about Measure A. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJKrueger_ea9b.html" title="User:MichaelJKrueger">MichaelJKrueger</a> 02:29, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I realized that the real test for deletion of this article should not be its notability outside Alameda, but rather the guidelines under <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html#Campaigning" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Conflict of Interest: Campaigning</a>. In particular, "If you edit articles while involved with organizations that engage in advocacy in that area, you may have a conflict of interest." Mr. Howard, the author of the article and its predecessor (which was also deleted), is one of the founders of a political action committee whose stated goal is the preservation of Measure A. The group, Citizens for Alameda Neighborhoods (FPPC#1288721), funded literature supporting slow-growth candidates in the November 2006 mayoral and city council races in Alameda. I don't have an outside source to verify Mr. Howard's involvement (you'll have to take my word for it), but this <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/your-support-is-needed/" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/your-support-is-needed/" rel="nofollow">appeal for support</a> on his <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Measure-A-themed blog</a> links him to the group through this <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/files/2006/11/kma_donation3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/files/2006/11/kma_donation3.jpg" rel="nofollow">form</a>. I realize that I belong to a community group (<a href="http://www.homesalameda.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.homesalameda.org/" rel="nofollow">Housing Opportunities Make Economic Sense</a>) on the other side of the Measure A issue, but I would be happy to forgo editing any Wikipedia pages about Measure A as long as Mr. Howard agrees to stop misrepresenting HOMES' position. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJKrueger_ea9b.html" title="User:MichaelJKrueger">MichaelJKrueger</a> 03:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These articles were <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Districts_of_the_Unitarian_Universalist_Association_265a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association">nominated</a> (along with the list <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_the_Unitarian_Universalist_Association_156a.html" title="Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association">Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association</a>) on September 2nd and the result was <b>Keep</b>. Normally I don't like renominations, but the first nomination was primarily for the list (which I am not nominating) and I am presenting different arguments for deletion than were raised in the first AfD. Moreover (and more importantly) the arguments supporting <b>keep</b> were particularly unconvincing. They were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>"This is a fairly sizeable and notable religious domination, as are Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc." <i>According to our article <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_religious_groups.html" title="Major religious groups">Major religious groups</a>, the Methodists and Baptists have 70 million members and the Presbyterians (and similar churches grouped with them) have 75 million. Unitarian Universalism has 800,000.</i></li>
<li>"Each of the entries in the subarticles provides useful information, such as the link to the home page of that district." <i>The information provided in the articles is largely limited to the name of the districts and what states they contain, information that is already accessible on the map on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_the_Unitarian_Universalist_Association_156a.html" title="Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association">Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association</a>. The information on the districts' namesakes is better covered in the articles about such persons. That there are "very active" Young Religious Unitarian Universalists has not been established by independent, reliable sources. The primary function of most of these pages is indeed to provide a link to the home page of the district, but this is a reason to delete per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a linkfarm, webhosting service, etc.</i></li>
<li>"[I]t is listed as one of the top 20 major religious groups by population (800,000) on Wikipedia's Major religious groups entry. Getting rid of this would require getting rid of the entries for most of those, as well, yet all are very notable religious groups." <i>Actually, it is number 20, right behind <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenrikyo.html" title="Tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopaganism.html" title="Neopaganism">Neopaganism</a>. Even ignoring the "If Article X, then Article Y" fallacy, this argument is wrong for several reasons. First, even by this logic, deleting articles pertaining to religion number 20 would not imply deleting articles pertaining to religions number 1-19. Second, the nomination did not propose deleting <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalism_f68b.html" title="Unitarian Universalism">Unitarian Universalism</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalist_Association_287c.html" title="Unitarian Universalist Association">Unitarian Universalist Association</a>, it proposed deleting pages relating to <b>districts</b> of the UUA.</i></li>
<li>"...otherwise we must delete all Catholic diocese and parish articles." <i>This is similar to the previous argument and was repeated by several different participants, but is problematic for the same reasons. First, we do not have (nor should we have) articles on each Catholic parish. We do have articles on Catholic dioceses, but these differ from UUA districts in several respects: (i) Catholic dioceses will on average comprise more members than UUA districts: the UUA has 800,000 members in 21 districts, so their average size is only 40,000; the Roman Catholic Church has 64,621,000 members in the United States and 194 dioceses <a href="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sc1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sc1.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, so the average size is ~333,000 (Larger Catholic dioceses for example, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Chicago_7254.html" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago</a> have more than a million members <a href="http://www.archchicago.org/about_us/statistics.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archchicago.org/about_us/statistics.shtm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>; a more typical example is the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_La_Crosse_e1f9.html" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of La Crosse">Roman Catholic Diocese of La Crosse</a> in Wisconsin with 200,000 <a href="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dlacr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dlacr.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>); and (ii) Catholic dioceses are organized primarily at the diocesan level rather than the parish level, with the diocese being responsible for schools, social services, supervision of priests, etc., while UUs primarily organize at the congregational level.</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Most important for our purposes, the individual districts are not covered in independent, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and so, each taken on its own, is not notable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 05:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You are re-nominating these articles because you don't agree with the results of a decision from 5 weeks ago?

<dd>Driving around the country by yourself and playing at random bars does not count as a "national tour". They don't list the names of any of their venues.

<dd>By the way, <i>MySpace is not, has never been, and will never be a reliable source for anything!</i> It doesn't matter if they have four million friends on MySpace, that just means they know where the "add to friends" button is. This is the second time this week I've seen a MySpace defense of a band's notability on AfD; if the best source for a band is MySpace, that's a pretty clear indicator that the article should be deleted.</dd>

<dd>Two things. One, the yourhub article, I believe, was published in some print source, which I'm still trying to track down (I don't live in Denver). Two, If you check the 8 Most Wanted on KTCL's webpage for this week, Single File is #7. <a href="http://www.ktcl.com/main.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ktcl.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> So, if I can exhume the yourhub article, that's three sources asserting national exposure (which meets criterion 3 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>), and two sources asserting rotation on a major national <a href="../../../c/l/e/ClearChannel_436e.html" title="ClearChannel">ClearChannel</a> station (which meets criterion 11 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>). I'm willing to continue to look into this to try and find other sources; since the article is already here, and someone is actively working on verification, isn't it better to just say Wikipedia is not paper, slap an unsourced tag on the page, and close the AfD pending further research? Just to pose the flip side of the coin, we can always come back in a few weeks and delete it if nothing comes up. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 00:34, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>KTCL is one radio station from a major radio network, not a complete network. If it would be in rotation across similar Clear Channel stations across the USA, then it would be "played in rotation nationally by any major radio network". Now it is "played regionally by one radio station of a major radio network".

<li><b>Comment</b> I think at this point, it's clear that the band is notable under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>; the only problem is whether it passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<p>Second largest mall in the Lansing, Michigan area. No claims to notability. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 05:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As the article makes clear (but my nomination unfortunately didn't), Lansing only has two malls. I grew up near there and this mall is incredibly non-notable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 22:39, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It might be useful for WP to develop criteria for mall articles specifically. Some undoubtedly deserve their own article and many clearly do not. Where does the community wish to draw the line? (I know nothing of Lansing, MI and thus cannot comment on the significance of this mall, though the article is pretty well-written so I lean to <b>Weak keep</b>). <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, since Lansing is the capital of Michigan, I believe that this mall asserts some notability as it is quite a big mall. The second largest mall in a big city is considered notable. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Terence_Ong_928d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Terence Ong">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Terence_Ong_2_9033.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Terence Ong 2">R</a>)</sub> 08:36, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just to note, Lansing is not what most would consider a "big city." It is comparable to Ann Arbor, MI and Kalamazoo, MI in size, and far smaller than Grand Rapids. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<p>School built in 1989 whose entire claim to noteworthiness appears to be the fact that a teacher at the school was involved in an automobile accident in which, through carelessness, he caused the death of a 6-year-old near the school. I do not accept that as a valid claim to the noteworthiness <i>of the school</i>. (If it'd happened <i>in</i> the school, maybe.) None of the information in this article that's actually about the school is sourced by anything other than the school's homepage, nor does it amount to more than a directory entry, nor do I find any potential independent reliable sources through various searches -- just directories. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:19, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Please stop quoting that - you are quoting in bad faith a proposal that is supported by only a handful of people and is being used to justify deletions of schools that wouldn't under other proposals.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Those who support keeping every school in the known universe are about equal in number to those who expect schools to demonstrate the same degree of notability as all other article criteria demand. The inclusionists "win" because any no consensus outcome always defaults to "keep". What evidence can you bring forward that "only a handful of people" support WP:SCHOOLS3? Of =course= it will justify deleting some schools - that is the whole point of a policy, proposed or otherwise. The structure and intent of WP:SCHOOLS3 is no different from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - all are intended to separate the wheat from the chaff. I will not stop quoting WP:SCHOOLS3 - I believe that it is use that drives policy. If enough people continue to use this set of criteria, eventually a proposed policy will become de facto policy. And high time in a situation where some claim "every school is notable". <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 16:44, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> as claims to notability (listed by Edison) are not verified by independent sources. Google Books and the reference desk at the local library are good starting points for offline searches for sources, but as it is the article fails Wikipedia policies. As with every deletion for lack of sources, the article can be restored or userfied if sources (which don't necessarily have to be online) are found. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article makes 2 claims to notability: 1)"In 1935 he opened the “Gospel of the Kingdom Campground" in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, where his teachings were adopted and spread by other pastors." 2)"It has been estimated that during his lifetime, at its peak, there were 300 churches and 75,000 believers in the fellowship.[citation needed] Today there are churches worldwide, notably in the U.S., Haiti, Europe and Africa , that have been affected by his ministry." In addition, "william Sowders" gets 1440 Google hits, most to the subject of this article. He is widely written up in pentecostal web sites. He had the misfortune to live and die in an era before there are online publication archives, so what references he had in print are likely not online. There is no reason to exclude as sources his own church, unless you are willing to delete all Roman Catholic, Methodist, etc. sources in articles about figures of those religions. He clearly had influence within his denomination far beyond that of average pastors. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Sowders should be kept, not only for his currently obscure church, but because he had/has influence on a great deal of modern evangalicism, particularly the church of the 4 square gospel and other early evangalicals <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 20:27, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Edison, because I have found the statement about him living before any archives that would be online to be true. I have been researching Sowders for over 10 years, and that is fact. There just is not alot of online information on him. His influence was strongest in the mid-west and south-east areas of the states, and in these areas specifically his teachings have had influences in many of the pentecostal denominations. <a href="../../../w/y/l/User%7EWyldkardde_adff.html" title="User:Wyldkardde">User:Wyldkardde</a> 18:18, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia should have an article on Ming porcelain, and this page could then be a somewhat useful redirect. But it seems that we don't.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A redirect is appropriate, because the "Ming vaahs" is, as the article states, a stand-by prop in sitcoms and Vaudeville routines, so it's quite likely that the term would be entered in a box by anyone wanting to know what's so special about a Ming vase, as well as people looking for Ming dynasty pottery in general.

<li><b>Keep</b>. From the start, the Young Bond series was announced as a five book set that chronicles James Bond's years at Eton. Before the release of SilverFin, author Higson gave plot details for all five books and spoke specifically about the importance of Book 5 as a series closer that will tie all the books together. So why should Wikipedia's Young Bond information only include 4 books? One the first questions many fans ask about the Young Bond series is, "How many books will there be?" As it stands now, Wikipedia answers that question at a glance and goes one better in providing accurate plot details of ALL the books in series. And there is no "crystal ball" at work here. Thus far, all the info on Book 5 has come from author Charlie Higson himself (who starts writing the book next year). If Wikipedia wants to be a source of information about the Young Bond series, eliminating Book 5 and everything we know about it makes no sense. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZencato_8052.html" title="User:Zencato">Zencato</a> 16:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I proposed this for deletion for lack of real notability, and no real content edits in over a year. It was then deprodded, with two additional references (the first content edits in over a year!), so I am taking it to AfD. So far all third-party references are from two online news sites, the first from 1999, the second from 2003. <b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:32, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is weak either way. The club has managed to get itself in the news (and the Salon and WorldNetDaily articles are not insignificant) so I vote for <b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability seems pretty obvious to me. Due to the nature of their purpose I wouldn't expect a whole lot of third party verification, but they have obviously garnered some media attention. They seem pretty active still so it's not a case of being has-beens. Perhaps they're just better at keeping out of the scornful view of main-stream America. The article could definitely use some attention, but I don't think that an article should be frequently edited in order to avoid an AfD. <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 10:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Black Rose is one of the biggest and most influential and important BDSM groups in the country.

The subject organisation is clearly notable enough and there's enough to say to make an article. At what point does it stop being relevant? When it only applies to 10,000 people? 1,000? 100? There are no clear distinctions as to where we draw the line and I would like to see information on how many people are members of this branch. Its activities seem to merit mention (if we are to proceed on the basis that it is too small to be of importance then we could apply the same reasoning to many small towns), so an idea of how many people it is relevant to might be a way to go (membership size for example). But I don't believe this is a suitable candidate for deletion - Wikipedia should be an encyclopedia for all things and removing articles like this is unnecessary. Mogh 10:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As an organisation LUCF is autonomous. It is a member of the National Conservative Future in name only and receives the scantiest of benefits from that nominative link. As a constituent society of Leeds University Union it receives even less benefits, and therefore merging it with the University page would not only be incorrect but also insulting. The society's recent record as described on the article speaks for itself and can be described as notable - probably not understandable to people not concerned with Leeds or the British University Political scene. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlsbottom_853c.html" title="User:Harlsbottom">Harlsbottom</a> 15:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

Also, it is common practice to as the sitting MP of the constituency for endorsement with an Hon Presidency, and to ask prominent political figures to come to speak, so that these associations are also insufficient to establist notability. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:45, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This does not fail <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> because <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is a *proposed* policy and as such is not binding. Since this organisation exists there is very little point in deleting a factual page about it. Wikipedia has the capacity to outgrow the limits of paper and bound volumes; why *shouldn't* it catalog the world? Nobody is forced to read the article or forced to acknowledge its presence but its there for anyone who wants to read it, and that really is the service we should be offering. I've yet to see a good argument as to why deleting it has any advantages over having it there for those who will read it. Mogh 19:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it's a faulty and broad assumption that any article you don't like is simply there because the organisation in question cannot afford webspace. Clearly this organisation can, because their home site is mentioned in the links at the bottom; so let's dispense with that indefensible position. Wikipedia's status as a reputable encyclopedia is hardly challenged by covering factual articles in depth, and with a broader mandate than that which could fill a traditional encyclopedia. Just because you personally don't think the page is of interest doesn't mean that other users don't (and perhaps we need some facility for tracking how many users visit pages as a metric for whether they are valuable). This is a factual article written in a neutral tone about a real organisation. I have yet to hear a good argument as to why a factual, up-to-date and real-world relevant article requires deletion simply because one or two people don't think it's "worthy". I reiterate: nobody is forced to read it but it's self-evidently useful for those that do, and we should not be purging useful information or else what is the site for? And whilst I think on, can you site which part of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> it fails?Mogh 00:28, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I ran a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> database search for this society. Only hit - a single sentence mention in a letter to the editor in a regional newspaper (Yorkshire Evening Post) in Sept 2003.On google, brief vox pop opinion from society member along with other random local conservative society representatives in this bbc piece<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2001/conferences_2001/conservatives/1584321.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2001/conferences_2001/conservatives/1584321.stm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Other than that - very few (6 spread over 3 websites) unique hits on google outside of wikipedia and wikipedia mirrors<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=2FX&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22+Leeds+University+Conservative+Future+%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=2FX&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22+Leeds+University+Conservative+Future+%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Aside from the encyclopedic reputation issue, another major reason for notability criteria is to safeguard wikipedia from being a free publicity space for anyone and anything out there. Wikipedia is a major target for spam and self-promotion efforts due to its prominence on search engines. Such efforts also benefit from Wikipedia's credibility as a source (while at the same time eroding this). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:18, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Look at the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guideline. Generally the band has to have been talked <i>about</i> by multiple non-trivial secondary sources that aren't related to the band (ie. not blogs, not fans, and not band members or their friends), must have charted on a notable chart (anywhere in the world), must have had multiple releases on a major label, or the like.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Currently, though I am opposed to it, there is a long-standing precedent that we keep all high school articles. Given this, there is also a precedent, this one I do agree with, that virtually all colleges, particularly accredited ones, get articles. As such, this article should remain; we can't have a general policy of keeping all American colleges and then go ahead and start deleting Indian ones. In my opinion, consistency is very important in these matters. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

Have we gotten to the point where the mania to delete school articles means that Universities are now fair game, particularly when they are located in poor third world or muslim countries? Is cultural bias the new buzzword at wikipedia? Not as far as I am concerned. This is the third ranked art &amp; architecture university in Pakistan <a href="http://www.hec.gov.pk/new/QualityAssurance/Ranking_lists.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hec.gov.pk/new/QualityAssurance/Ranking_lists.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.hec.gov.pk/new/QualityAssurance/Univ_ranking/Ranking_IVS_arts_Arch.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hec.gov.pk/new/QualityAssurance/Univ_ranking/Ranking_IVS_arts_Arch.htm" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> - the sixth biggest country in the world by population. It fully qualifies for inclusion based on the Wp:Schools, not that it matters since that's just a proposed guideline (and not too long ago, those non-existent guidelines were being frequently cited as grounds for disqualifying "keep" arguments). For those who want to learn more about the school, google is a good start. For example, <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamiluddin_Aali_f110.html" title="Jamiluddin Aali">Jamiluddin Aali</a> spoke at the 2005 graduation, when 87 degrees were awarded <a href="http://www.ilmkidunya.com/EduNews/show_news.asp?newsid=714" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilmkidunya.com/EduNews/show_news.asp?newsid=714" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. The school has been discussed in the Hindu magazine <a href="http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/08/14/stories/2005081400100200.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/08/14/stories/2005081400100200.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> or architecture &amp; culture magazine <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:0c0vv9Ygq7oJ:archnet.org/file-storage/download/09%2B-%2BThe%2BYoung%2BEmbraces%2Bthe%2BOld%2B%26%2BHow.DOC%3Finode%3D174096+IVS+Karachi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=15&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:0c0vv9Ygq7oJ:archnet.org/file-storage/download/09%2B-%2BThe%2BYoung%2BEmbraces%2Bthe%2BOld%2B%26%2BHow.DOC%3Finode%3D174096+IVS+Karachi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=15&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and I'm sure there are a lot more sources if I spent more than 5 minutes searching. Let's not send a message that art, architecture and education in Pakistan does not matter to the English wikipedia. Finally, I hope no one takes up JoshuaZ's suggestion to start "AFDing" American colleges (which would just further strain wikipedia's limited resources in more futile debate). Instead, I would encourage people to improve/expand articles on institutions of higher education worldwide as we strive for comprehensive coverge that goes beyond the elitist US/UK Unis and meets the needs/interest of our global reader base. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to address the claims of "mania to delete" "cultural bias", "elitism" or implications about some sort of anti-muslim sentiment since they are irrelevant to the matter at hand. The references you gave are not obviously non-trivial. The article in the Hindu has less than a paragraph about the school and the other article has little useful information for a school article. If you think that a useful article can be salvaged from those references add them to the article and then tell us. In any event, I still don't see this school as even meeting the primary criterion of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> let alone meeting the stricter one of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> or any other more restrictive set. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:58, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Address what you want to address, but if you don't believe that being the third ranked architecture university in Pakistan is significant, than, as per your suggestion, you should start AfDing whole boatloads of American universities. I think the article is highly "useful" in its present state and can only improve from here. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:05, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It may be the third ranked. Its also the bottom ranked on that list. It appears that there are only three in all of Pakistan. Being the bottom ranked might be notable for its own reasons, but let's not pretend that being third ranked her is somehow saying anything good about the school. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is exactly what I'm <i>pretending</i>. I'll further go out on a limb and <i>pretend</i> that, for a start, we should have articles on all the top ranked universities in every country in the world - even if the country in question only has one university. You are of course entitled to <i>pretend</i> the opposite. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:21, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not convinced that a single university in a country would be necessarily notable by itself given that even countries themselves are not inherently notable. Nevertheless, this enough to make me switch to very weak keep for now. I need to think about this case in more detail. Again, if there are any language issues here, I welcome users who are more familiar with Pakistan helping find sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I welcome your change of position on IVS Pakistan. However, I am intrigued by your remark "<i>that even countries themselves are not inherently notable</i>". Assuming we are talking about countries on the planet Earth, I would have thought that a presence on the world atlas would be sufficient, or a UN seat, or participation at the Olympic Games. I'm also sure the inhabitants of those countries would be surprised to learn that, according to wikipedia, they live in a "non-notable" state, presumably with a non-notable history, culture, language, etc. Would you be so kind as to point me to the "non-notable" countries currently included at wikipedia (so that I might contribute to helping to establish their "notability"), or point me to country articles that have been deleted for 'non notability" (so that I might help fill the gaping hole in our coverage). Please enlighten me on your thinking here.--<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unverifiable, possible vanity. His name is not known in Israel and searching for עובדיה שוחר yields almost nothing. The only thing that can be notable about this is the fight against Amazon.com, and even that is dubious.

<li><b>Weak delete unless sources are found</b>: there are no reliable sources in this article whatsoever (4 are his website, the other two are pay-to-post press-release sites).

<li><b>Comment</b>: It doesn't paint him in a very positive light, because i tried to neutralize it a bit and removed the most preposterous claims in hope that this article might be useful as a study case on Internet censorship (see article's talk page).

The only notable member, Miles Kington, specifically claimed by the article is principally known as a humourist/journalist, not a musician. Even he was primarily a musician, this does not automatically confer encyclopedic notability onto this society. Claims made about Lol Coxhll and the Oxcentrics are that the club presented at least one pub gig where they played. I'm sure these musicians have played in many pubs and nightclubs. This doesn't mean every one of these venues gets an article based on this association. No claim about encyclopedic notability in article, even if all claims were properly verified. No indication that this club is significant as a representative of any "Oxford jazz scene", if such a scene is in fact important.And this reminds me, I've been meaning to clear out some of the Cambridge clubs <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:29, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tagged for speedy (that way lies ArbCom!), this is a very short article for a generic primary school, written in the first person.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please permit me to suggest that you not vilify the inclusionists. I realise that you "...have nothing wrong with AfD ... school inclusionists," except when they "...can't provide any rationale whatsoever besides 'this seventeen-student-strong elementary school is Mozambique is notable because all schools of all kinds are notable....'" But your opinion that "... when [inclusionists] just state 'all schools are notable,' [they're] doing nothing more than voting" appears to be a fallacious <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">Guilt by association</a></i> argument: a tactic to discredit all inclusionists, whether they vote without reading the article and providing rationale or not, by associating them all with voters.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I do not remember any specific details about proposals becoming guidelines, but I would suggest two things. First, Amarkov, please do not discredit someone's argument solely based on the fact that it is "convtroversial". Only by introducing new, potentially controversial ideas into discussion can we change. By polarizing arguments, one merely stagnates the discussion. Second, Amists, I would suggest that you not provide citations to proposals as your only argument for your decision. Consider providing a thoughtful analysis and <i>argue</i> why the article should be deleted. Granted, your thoughts may parallel a specific policy proposal, and you may wish to append a statement such as, "Thus my thoughts are parallel to <i>X policy</i>," (but use something extemporaneously, because that statement is awkward and silly), but nonetheless, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">this is a discussion, not a vote</a>. And please do not consider me condescending at all. I do not intend to be. I merely got frustrated at another school afd and intend to go out and read the other afds and offer any suggestions I can. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 23:55, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Deletion nomination</b> Encyclopedically non-notable university sports club. Gaelic sports are not a major sport at Cambridge. Makes dubious claim of connection with 19th century patron of GAA but club only started in 1995. College/varsity sports in UK nowhere near as important as college sports in US (and this club is for a very minor sport in the UK too) but still I'm taking this to afd rather than speedy delete due to club's participation in university gaelic sports league and the BUSA championships, whatever that may be - seeing if any gaelic sports fans want to argue for encyclopedic notability here <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: University sport in the UK is (in general) non-notable, and there's no indication here that this club rises above that (BUSA is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Universities_Sports_Association_340f.html" title="British Universities Sports Association">British Universities Sports Association</a> into which essentially any University can compete); for what it's worth, I was a student at Cambridge for 8 years and never heard of this lot. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 16:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> He does seem to be a minor figure in creationism. He is a minor author on the subject. He is also a minor figure in chess. From what I can tell his standings appear to be somewhere in the thousands world wide and has never been much higher. Scientifically he has a few articles but so do many. The article is definately way too long for such a minor figure. My take is he is a minor figure in several areas. Seems to be a smart guy with a moderate level of success in an odd array of fields. All of these minor achievements are well spun together into a compelling biography that makes him look important.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He is notable. The article is supposed to be about Sarfati, which includes his beliefs. His beliefs are presented as his beliefs, not as truth, and the sources used must surely be considered reliable sources of what his beliefs are. Yet this is somehow claimed to be POV, despite there being a section titled "Writings and criticism", responding to his beliefs. I struggle to find an evolutionist on Wikipedia with a section titled "criticisms" or similar, but on Wikipedia it's considered POV to simply describe a creationist's beliefs. And some of the criticisms are presented as truth, such as "those scientists do not demonstrate any manifestation of religious faith". The only POV in this article is an anti-creationist one. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J.

<li><b>Keep</b> This may not be a proper means of asserting notability, so feel free to discount this 'vote,' but I tend to feel that if a person is still known to histroy by name 2,500 after they died then they are notable enough to have an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is a very valid argument. Unfortunately there is nothing about him to be found. Really it should be in the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaean_League_8c4c.html" title="Achaean League">Achaean League</a> article where people can look him up anyway when searching for him.

<ul>
<li>The bar for ArXiv as a whole is fairly low. You need to either be an established academian or endorsed by an established academian to put an article in there. In general these are articles for which publication is being sought. However, many (if not most) arXiv papers are not published. More to the point, a "journal-ref" field will be filled in by the author once publication has been achieved, or a notation made in the "Comments" field if the article has been accepted for publication.

It makes sense that LSU may be an "open" domain for arXiv.

<li><b>Do not delete</b>. The idea of different worlds in motion with similar laws (obvioiusly not equivalent to modern relativity but a relativity principle nevertheless) also occurs in Yoga Vasishtha (an important later text, which allows us to determine how the cryptic verses of Aryabhta are to be interpreted). Here're two early references that speak of Aryabhata's relativity:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is almost a joke. The article has been edited to explicitly claim that the principle of relativity was being used, but no additional evidence is presented. Mr. Aurel is also holding up two new references here at the last minute, but fails to quote anything out of them. (I also find it odd that these references are being presented now instead of having been cited in the article initially.) Even this posting raises questions: Mr. Aurel talks about Aryabnhata thinking of "different worlds in motion with similar laws", but the relativity principle calls for all reference frames to have <i>the same laws</i>, not similar laws. In the article Mr. Aurel now also correctly notes that Aryabhata must have been aware of the concept of a frame of reference. That is all fine and dandy, but the idea that a dropped ball will fall the same way with respect to you no matter how you are moving along the surface of the Earth is a major breakthrough for which the concept of a frame of reference is only the foundation. Overall, if the term "Aryahbata's relativity principle" is not a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, then it certainly is a misleading phrase which implicitily gives Aryabhata credit with something that he did not achieve. As I see it, <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryabhata.html" title="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> really did achieve a lot.

<li><b>Reword</b> -- Some facts about modern relativity theory: Modern relativity theory came about based on a long series of observations and experiments (Fizeau, Michelson-Morley,Newton's onservations etc.) that Aryabhatta or his contemporaries could not possibly have done. The statement "Just as someone in a boat moving sees the stationary objects (on either side of the river) as moving backward, similarly are the stationary stars seen by people at Lanka (reference co-ordinate on the equator), as moving exactly towards the west." has more to do with a kind of vague Galilean Relativity than Einstein's Relativity. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Relativity_1cb0.html" title="Special Relativity">Special Relativity</a> is based on the invariance of the Minkowski metric and the fact that it generates a transformation law that is counterintuitive as compared to the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilean_Transformation_cde5.html" title="Galilean Transformation">Galilean Transformation</a>.Plus, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Relativity_700f.html" title="General Relativity">General Relativity</a> would be completely beyond people in the 5th century BC. While it is ignorant to call this a "hoax" (as people above did), and Aryabhatta's observations and notes here are interesting in the context that it does seem to talk about "Frames of reference" in some roundabout way.Thus, it is technically correct to call it a "Principle of Relativity".However, since the phrase "relativity" is invariably associated with Einsteinian relativity it becomes misleading to call Aryabhatta's a "Principle of Relativity" as it creates the misconception that he came up with the fundamental postulates before Einstein. The best thing to do is to explain that he was talking about a very basic philosophy of "frames of reference".Now, I glanced through the Parakh paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0610095" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0610095" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The ref "Roger Billard, L’astronomie Indienne. Paris: Publications de l’ecole francaise d’extreme-orient, 1971" seems to show that Aryabhatta's observations were grounded in experiments and that he showed that the Earth rotates. I'm not sure on how to reword it but I think that the basic precept is sound.Perhaps "Aryabhatta's Principle of Relative Transformations" or something.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 08:24, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>using "relativity" is no problem, we have <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilean_relativity.html" title="Galilean relativity">Galilean_relativity</a>, and nobody but our most illiterate readers will think that means Galileo discovered Einsteinian relativity. It is justified to compare Aryabhata's two verses to Galileo. It is also well known that European science only in the 17th century caught up with things that had been known since at least 400 BC, and it is very plausible to state that Aryabhata was aware of things that were <i>at the time</i> unknown to western science (but that doesn't put him 'first' automatically). I argue for <b>merge</b> below since these are essentially speculations based on two verses of Aryabhata's treatise that may well be treated in the main <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryabhata.html" title="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> article, there isn't really all that much to say about it. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>At least this poster agrees that a description involving the use of frames of reference does not constitute a statement of the principle of relativity.

Very often, important information comes up during the course of an AfD which significantly affects the votes already cast (if, for example, the article was thought to be a hoax and unambiguous proof that it is real has surfaced).

<p><b>Notability definition: A notable, or remarkable, person or thing; a person of note.</b> Soccergirl has 165 shows, updated twice or three times a week since March of 2005.

I chat under the user "thenintendofreak" soccergirl is a well known podcaster among the podcasting community, with her awsome beats and stories that are just so creative in nature. Soccergirl is right up there with the greats of podcasting along with dawn and drew, geekbrief with cali lewis, not too many people can say they get paid to podcast. Yeah she shows her boobs sometimes but theres much more too soccergirl incorporated then just listeners and podcasters its friendship too, she is the worlds first bathcaster. for one she has inspired me to do my own podcast. Soccergirl doesnt judge and deserves her spot in history, listen for you self, she always keeps it interesting. I wish i could be ryan p(soccergirls boyfriend) you wont find a kinder podcaster not even dawn and drew can top that.Richw53149 00:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep &amp; Wikify</b> Normally I would say delete on something like this, but after checking the sources I have to say it meets notability and verifiability criteria, though barely. To Sandydance: Normally I'd agree with you, but the press coverage in this case comes from major sources, the NYT and Reuters are not small and tend to cover only more mainstream, notable things. Furthermore, the sources carry the common theme of being a sort of introduction to the concept of podcasting to the general public which is precisely the type of article in which there'd be name drops of the most notable, paradigm-type examples of the subject matter. The fact she's appeared in numerous articles of this type is further in her favor. I must admit, however, that the sockpuppets weren't a help. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 10:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I cannot agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a>'s rationale. Mainstream press coverage can be used to gauge notability, if the coverage is specifically about the topic at issue. This, by the way, is not necessarily grounds for notability, despite the apparently irresistible view here that if it finds its way into the NYT, it gets an article on WP (see <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_the_Central_Park_Coyote_3180.html" title="Hal the Central Park Coyote">Hal the Central Park Coyote</a>, a peculiar memento mori that exists ONLY thanks to this conflation between press coverage and notability). We need to be more intellectually energetic, critical and engaged in determining whether a topic is notable enough for inclusion, rather than arrogate that responsibility to the chance decision made by a deadline-stressed reporter looking to use one or another example to illustrate a point. I know that press coverage is crawling over our guidelines for inclusion, but we need to apply common sense in using that as a criterion. As in this case, press mention does not on its own confer notability. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 11:34, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Normally I'd agree with all of you, however I feel that the fact that multiple sources have all chosen to use this particular blog as an example implies notability. If it was just the NYT then I'd say delete. Yet, it seems like an awfully big coincidence that many sources choose this particular blog, when theres thousands upon thousands of blogs out there. Indeed, I doubt its coincidence and I feel its more likely that this is seen as a paradigm example in the media's coverage of blogs. However, if the consensus is to delete then that is fine; I do recognize that the notability here isn't fully clear. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> but in a kindly way. It may be nonsense and flapdoodle, but it is entitled to an article if the editors demonstrate multiple independent reliable sources.

The article lists several psychic journals and ESP research establishments, but I do not see citations to particular journal articles about the subject of the article, nor do I see articles about it in newspapers or magazines of general circulation, or even TV documentaries, I expect such references are out there, but the article looks like O.R. supported only by websites devoted to the phenomenon which cannot be regarded as independent. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>NOT Delete</b> Many independent sources have been cited, as to the originality of the term itself. On top of that, it has been CLEARLY distinguished from astral projection in both the external literature, and from within the Astral Projection article itself.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And what makes a source "verifiable", to begin with? There MANY sources which validate the concept of etheric projection and the etheric body-- <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dion_Fortune_c15c.html" title="Dion Fortune">Dion Fortune</a> being one, who's book (Psychic Self Defence) has been in print since the early half of the 20th Century. Others include the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian_Fellowship_6dfc.html" title="Rosicrucian Fellowship">Rosicrucian Fellowship</a> and the in some cases, the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophical_Society_0cb8.html" title="Theosophical Society">Theosophical Society</a>, all whom distinguish the astral from the etheric states of consciousness.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the discussion page for the main article. There, it states the case for why this page should remain where it is. There is no reason to assume astral and etheric projection are even closely related, when there are literally hundereds of reports of at least two seperate extremes-- one being <b>fantastical</b>, while the other being scientifically <i>objective</i>.</dd>
<dd>I should also add that astral projection is in no way objective. People claiming to visit spirit guides and crazy mixed up adventures are not objective, yet these kinds of experiences are in fact lumped in with the whole OBE paradigm. How can this stand, yet something that IS objective is being up for deletion? <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a>
<ul>
<li>I fail to see which is the 'fantastical' and which the 'objective' one from the articles. Can you explain? How is 'etheric' projection an objective, scientific phenomenon but astral projection not? Not that this has anything to do with the existence of a Wikipedia article on either of them, but anyway?</li>
<li>How are we to believe that this idea is not original research on your part, or some sort of POV fork?</li>
<li>Does etheric projection allow one to time travel? I ask because the author of 'Psychic self defence' was apparently born in 1891 (according to our article). This would mean that their book would have had to have been published a few decades before they were born, if it was published in the first half of the 19th century. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 12:39, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I meant to say early 20th Century, sorry. All the e-books are in physical print, and can be found in local libraries, or through some on-line retailer. Other than having physical books in print that have been around for decades, I am unsure as to what else someone could mean as "verifiable", because lots of other Wikipedia sources are furnashed in the same manner or less.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For one thing, an OBE has been described by people in two ways: one where the person can "float" around in the mundane world (or some reflection of it), while the other (which is associated with shamanism), depicts fantastical adventures in words that can not and do not exist-- such as visiting spirit guides, and dieties. One of these extremes is objective and has been replicated in a lab (see Tart, for example). Given that all the literature on "ether" relates to either a physical state of being (Etheric Region, to the Rosicrucians), or a close proximity, it is only a matter of opinion that the fantastical paradigm be lumped with something that can be physically validated.</dd>
<dd>In shamanism and other magickal systems, the adept uses "astral projection" to travel to the "inner planes" (or Underword), to learn about power from entities and their worlds-- none of which physically exist. Even according to Robert Monroe himself: he had to "shed" a "second body" in order to be "completely free". Monroe explained that his second body seemed to have some sort of "electro-magentic" properties, which we all know EM fields are physical, not conceptual. He refered to this second body seperatly from that which he used to travel to all those other worlds.</dd>
<dd>My other arguement is that since this term DOES exist and has been used to relate to a state seperate from the astral, according to several independent sources. The Rosicrucians have been around since at least 1916; Theosophical Society has been around since the 1800s; Dion Fortune's book has been around since the 1940s-- on top of that, "ether" is an expression used by alchemists and occultists (such as Eliphas Levi) to indicate a semi-physical state (see Transcendental Magic, and Key to the Mysteries). "Etheric Vision" to those occultists was the mean by which one can perceive the ether, and this was coined independently from "astral sight" and "astral light". So, "etheric" projection exists in relation to a <b>mundane</b> experience, not a conceptual one.</dd>
<dd>In conclusion, I think if nothing else, that the astral and etheric projection articles could be merged into one "OBE" article. From there, their distinctions and similarities can be made. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a></dd>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>This information is important to those who do paranormal, and metaphysical research. Threre is nothing wrong with quoting from e-books. The Bible is available as an E-book, does that make it less of a quotable source? Most of the classic books of the occult are available in PDF form and if the article was written, citing these sources then it serves its purpose. Some information in the occult is only available from journals or kept as lodge secrets, never entering the public eye. Classic occult literature is a valuable resource to those who study the occult or the occult sciences. This subject touches on metaphysical science, and much of metaphysical science is not openly verifiable in scientific terms. Metpahyiscal science is best understood when many pieces come together to form a larger picture, and this is often done by research, no matter if it came from the 15th century or if it is a modern version. The age of knowledge has nothing to do with its value, and if people have been writing about it since the 15th century and even before that then maybe there really is something to take note of there. We would like solid concrete physical proof but the occult, psychic research and also religion does not work in this way. Such is the nature of the metaphysics. This article not only should be kept but it should be treasured as a good source of information on what the "etheric" really is, for those who study metaphysical sciences, and for those who are looking for additional sources on this great topic. If anyone here who actually studies the occult and its sciences will appreciate an article like this.

<dd>Actually, the literal definition of 'metaphysical' is "beyond the physical". This means that a metaphysical science is that which studies and observes non-physical phenomena. There are two sciences that do that in one manner or another: Quantum Physics, and Parapsychology. "Psi phenomenan", for example, has no known physical mechanism, and can not be attributed to any known physical energy; there for, this specific event is "beyond" what we know to be physical, until other evidence surfaces.</dd>
<dd>And yes I agree, this whole discussion is spurious. Hardly anyone has taken a good look at the evidence that has been presented, yet assume everything is invalid. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a></dd>

<dd>What utter nonsense. Quantum physics is <i>not</i> metaphysics (only New Age-flapdoodle scribblers like <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Zukav_528e.html" title="Gary Zukav">Gary Zukav</a> allege otherwise, in their second-rate, ignorant screeds). Quantum physics is <i>empirical</i>, and science is, by definition, an empirical endeavour. <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">Empiricism</a> deals with things which are physical, i.e. which can be measured, which are accessible through the senses (all <b>five</b> of them), etc. Therefore, if something is scientific then it is <i>de facto</i> not metaphysical.</dd>
<dd>Parapsychology is <b>pseudo</b>science. However, even if we were to assume that some 'parapsychological' phenomena were somehow accessible to scientific enquiry, then they would be <i>empirical</i> and hence not metaphysical.</dd>
<dd>In short, you don't know what you're talking about. I suggest you make sure of the definitions of the words you use, before digging that hole any deeper.

<dd>Wow. Nice way to accuse, rather than investigate. How many scientific journals have you read on Psi Phenomena? How many scientists can you name that study it? I have personally read at least a dozen, and can name as many, including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Tart_7ffa.html" title="Charles Tart">Charles Tart</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Utts_a6f4.html" title="Jessica Utts">Jessica Utts</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Radin_6479.html" title="Dean Radin">Dean Radin</a>, but you must know of them already. Unless you can answer those questions with honesty, then your arguement is subjective and there fore invalid. You basically summed up what you do not know on the subject, because you are somehow under the impression that anything metaphysical and/or paranormal can not be observed via the scientific method. This is a logical fallacy, and has no place in this discussion.</dd>
<dd>"All" FIVE senses? Are you sure? Perhaps if you looked up the meaning of that, you might want to rethink accusing strangers of being ignorant. Here you go: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_senses.html" title="The senses">The senses</a>.</dd>
<dd>This is a direct quote from Dr. Radin's website, entitled "What Parapsychology is Not":
<dl>
<dd><i>Many scientists have viewed parapsychology with suspicion because the term has come to be associated with a huge variety of mysterious phenomena, fringe topics, and <b>pseudoscience</b>. Parapsychology is also often linked, again inappropriately, with a broad range of "psychic" entertainers, magicians, and so-called "paranormal investigators." In addition, some self-proclaimed "psychic practitioners" call themselves parapsychologists, but <b>that is not what we do</b>.</i> (Source: <a href="http://www.deanradin.com/para1.html#four/" class="external text" title="http://www.deanradin.com/para1.html#four/" rel="nofollow">Dean Radin's Parapstchology FAQ</a></dd>
<dd>Tell us, how many degrees do you have in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a> or <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>? Because you seem to know a lot about these things, even though the evidence is contrary to what you <b>believe</b>. Is belief now part of <b>empirical</b> science, now a days?</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable school. To the point above: schools are either notable on their own, or else they are not. Having notable alumni is a needless canard and folks asserting they should be kept should not have to resort to such silly arguments since it is perfectly defensible (if in my view wrong) position to argue simply that schools should be kept inasmuch as that is what they are. I doubt many of us who feel otherwise will change our tune because a few notable students call a random collection of bricks their alma mater. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 01:08, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What part are you questioning? She was on seven episodes of a very popular reality show seen by millions, <i>America's Next Top Model</i>. She's certainly well known. Because of that, she meets WP:BIO, which allows for the inclusion of "television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually - and I know you know this - you're selectively choosing portions to deceptively suit your argument. What <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> specifically says is: <b>"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions"</b> and then goes on to spell out what constitutes "notable". She fails. Big time. Next time you quote policy, try not to leave out the part of the sentence that doesn't agree with you! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's quite the accusation, and I request you retract it. Why don't we spell it out, since you think I'm being sly: "Multiple features in pop-culture magazines?" No problem, what entertainment magaizne hasn't covered the people in this show. "Large fan base, cult following." Do a Google search on NTM sometime. "Independent biography." Might not meet this, although I'm sure the NTM site has one. "Name recognition." without a doubt. People know who are on reality shows. "Commercial endorsements." Borderline. It ain't L'Aureal, but she's done plenty of magazine work which could fit in here. There's no need to attack me just because you disagree, I deserve better. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:26, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You left out the crucial part of the sentence that contradicted your own point. Why would you do that? I have no idea. Feel free to explain. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:28, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b><a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says that a business is notable if "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." I've listed 3 articles, which constitutes multiple, these are published works not written by Falcon or its subsidiaries, and many people use these articles for information, so I would hesitate to call them trivial. If these don't fulfill that criteria, I'm wondering what kind of published works you are looking for? -<b><a href="../../../s/n/e/User%7ESneakyTodd_6f8a.html" title="User:SneakyTodd"><font color="orange" size="+1">Todd</font></a></b><font color="#007FFF" size="-2">(<a href="../../../s/n/e/User_talk%7ESneakyTodd_a39a.html" title="User talk:SneakyTodd">Talk</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SneakyTodd_dbfd.html" title="Special:Contributions/SneakyTodd">Contribs</a>)</font> 08:56, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

These certainly demonstrate that Falcon Studios is of significant notability that others would write significant articles about them.

<dd>Most likely there will never be much "mainstream" coverage of the porn industry and <i>Forbes</i> will probably never cover a gay porn company.

<dd>Point taken. There was a marginal assertion of importance, but the content was obviously designed—as you said—as a placeholder. I agree that "placeholder articles" are different from true stubs, which need to be a bit more robust before they're published. I've argued the point several times in the past and probably will again. For example, there are more than 600 "stubs" in <a href="../../../c/h/u/Category%7EChurch_stubs_1f43.html" title="Category:Church stubs">Category:Church stubs</a>; many of which resemble the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Christian_Center_3ce3.html" title="Family Christian Center">Family Christian Center</a> article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just can not see an article about what amounts to a Chevy ad. The merge retains the info, puts it with similar or related info, but does not give it an article.

<li>I dunno. An ephemeral film from the 1940's? Man there are scores of thousands of ephemeral films. Hella lot of them are amusing now in a campy way. What makes this one special? Is it really funnier than "Happy Hooligan, Double-Cross Nurse" or a thousand others? Is it really a cult favorite? The article says so but I dunno if that's true.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only assertion of notability is that the film "has developed somewhat of a cult status." Not much of a claim, and even that is not verified by reliable, third-party sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b> They're not just "being mentioned", they're the subject of the article. I think we're interpreting "trivial" differently. I tend to interpret "trivial" as "the article's on another person or event and the subject of the article only gets two lines worth of mentions". Notwithstanding the first Boston Globe article (which is something like 1000 words or so), one review is around 100 words maybe and the other around 300 words or so. So my feeling is that there's enough verifiable content there to write an article. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 19:48, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. WP:CORP requires that 'The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.' A Google search for the founder, Larry Rachitsky gets 991 hits. However in the first 3 pages of results there are no reliable sources included. Googling for 'Searchguy' gets more hits but I did not see any reliable sources. Searchguy has an Alexa rank of about 258,000 over the last 3 months, not too impressive.

<p>From what I've seen there is no other pages for wrestlers championships and accomplishments. Ric Flair shouldn't be the exception. The most important titles should just be on the Ric Flair page, a seperate article doesn't need to list all of them. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 20:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, acceptable article fork, and advise <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">Ric Flair</a> to reduce its Awards section considerably.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think this is an necessary fork. Although the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">Ric Flair</a> page is in desperate need of a trimming, (37 kilobytes,) I'd rather see that the prose be trimmed to something more terse, than to create a spin-out that would not be appropriate for other wrestlers. --<span style="border:3px solid #00f;font-weight:bold;background-color:#c00;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk"><span style="color:#fff;">RoninBK</span></a><sub><span style="background-color:#fff;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_Esperanza_3389.html" title="User:Roninbk/Esperanza"><span style="background-color:#0f0;">E</span></a><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></span></sub></span> 11:23, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two of the scores were Oscar nominees, making them notable. The movies themselves are acceptable sources for describing when a given theme appears. Topic itself seems encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. This article is rather crufty, it is true, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously the music in Harry Potter is an encyclopedic topic, as Harry Potter itself is. At the most, you'd move the information to the individual pages on the movie, or even an article on the album itself. So I don't see any benefit to deletion. If you have any specific problems with the content, tag the article, bring it up on the talk page, or fix it yourself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rewrite.</b> If it was nominated and/or awarded an <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Awards_d780.html" title="Oscar Awards">Oscar</a>, it's something that can be considered encyclopedic. However, I do think that this article needs a lot of rewrite to avoid making it read like fancruft (at least, to me). It would also help if there are additional references/citations about any published studies/articles on the music score (say, from the film or music industry). Better still would be more details about the composition, orchestration, recording and editing of the score, replete with sources. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 21:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Of the 7 keeps, the 1st (and hence the 3rd), the 4th and 5th 'keep's are based on it winning an award that fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The 2nd 'keep' vote (from Vsion) makes no sense and I've discounted it.

<dd>Agree with Wikipediatrix. But we don't even have to argue the point in the abstract of whether being a Blue Ribbon school confers notability. We can just check to see whether multiple non-trivial sources independent of this school have taken note of its being a Blue Ribbon school. The answer is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-32,GGLJ:en&amp;q=%22fairmont+preparatory+academy%22+%22blue+ribbon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-32,GGLJ:en&amp;q=%22fairmont+preparatory+academy%22+%22blue+ribbon%22" rel="nofollow">no</a> (also checked Lexis-Nexis).

For all those deletionist extremists who would like to claim that this award is no more valuable than a "stick of gum" or that the fact that "schools nominate themselves" diminishes its value in any way, here's <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" rel="nofollow">the official description</a> of the process: <b>How Are Schools Chosen? The Department convenes the National Review Panel to evaluate the nominations. The panel consists of approximately 100 outstanding public and private school educators from the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Based on the quality of the application, the most promising schools are recommended for site visits. The purpose of a visit is to verify the accuracy of the information the school has provided in its nomination form and to gather any additional information the panel has requested. Experienced educators, including principals of previously recognized schools, visit and observe the schools for two days and submit written site visit reports. The National Review Panel considers the reports in its final review of applicants and makes to the U.S. Secretary of Education, who then announces the names of the schools selected for recognition.</b> Deletionism depends on ignorance and denial, and we see it here in action. Given the rigorous selection criteria for the program, I think it's clear that any school that has been awarded a Blue Ribbon has the strongest possible claim of notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:08, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Its hard to see something as a claim of notability when the school hasn't recieved in the least press coverage over it. Also, the claim that it is the "strongest possible claim of notability" seems to be hyperbole at best. <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_School_a1a7.html" title="Hopkins School">Hopkins School</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant.html" title="Stuyvesant">Stuyvesant</a> and others have far stronger claims of notabilty. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Reword for the benefit of those in denial of the explicit claim of notability: <b>Recognition by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> grants the recipient a claim that is among the strongest possible claims of notability for a school.</b> Do you deny that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> thoroughly researches and verifies all applications and that the winners have demonstrated a clear level of achievement? In the continuum, is a school that has been so recognized no more notable than a stick of gum? Your claim re press coverage is entirely worthless. Do you believe that every 15-year-old newspaper article is available online, and that your fruitless efforts to find such an article prove anything? Is a source from the United States Department of Education not reliable and verifiable? This is deletionism at its worst. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not claiming that the statement is false but simply that we cannot find any sources. And if a source did exist it would likely turn up on Lexis-Nexis even if it were 15 years old. The bottom line is that we have no evidence whatsoever that this school's Blue Ribbon is all that notable, and if not a single news source saw fit to even mention it, it is difficult to see it as a claim of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:31, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't trust the government for a lot of things, but do you think that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> is not a valid and reliable source for this information in full compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I think the selection criteria listed above and the fact that it is the nation's highest award for a school makes it one of the strongest possible claims of notability that an American school can possibly make? Besides, as the late, great <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> has been quoted, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:54, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> re: <i>do you think that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> is not a valid and reliable source for this information in full compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></i>: You misunderstand the issue here. The problem with the Blue Ribbon thing is notability, not just whether it's true. There has to be non-trivial coverage, independent of both the giver of the award and the recipient of the award, before you can begin to argue that the receiving of the award is notable. Of course, the giver and the recipient will both issue press releases, but that's not independent coverage, obviously. Also, the recipient may be included on lists of recipients of the award, or in wire service blurbs, but those aren't non-trivial. Now, re: "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Please. We need evidence of appropriate sources to establish notability. We don't assume notability by default. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability is not established. If the award were truly distinguishing, the school's receiving of the award would garner non-trivial attention from independent sources.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I expressed myself incorrectly: I meant that receiving that award (Blue Ribbon) and being a member of the organization (IBO) not mean that you are notable (both events have not received much media coverage, it appears), but I erroneously said that the award and the organization in itself are not notable, which is of course something completely different and not true. 07:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Inline Figure Skating is an off-ice training option for ice skaters and an extra competition discipline for quad artistic roller skaters.</p>
<p>There seems to be some strange resentment towards the growing popularity of Inline Figure Skating, which is understandable but some are behaving genuinely hateful about it. Discriminating against it is nothing to be proud of, it is downright tragic!</p>

<dd>Well, you say and prove it yourself. An official national federation is fine on Wikipedia. A hobby team (using geocities and yahoo as website) is not notable however.

<li>It can be confirmed by checking the venue sites (linked from their website).

<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> <i>does</i> want tour information "reported in notable and verifiable sources". Which makes sense to me, as otherwise it's just too easy to lie about. I could claim to be in the middle of an international tour on my own MySpace page (if I had one). For that matter, I've driven around the country. If I'd taken my guitar and played in parking lots, would I deserve a Wikipedia article? <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 14:33, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He is not really the inventor of MP3 but he led all the works related to MPEG; he created the MPEG (moving picture experts group) and chaired it from the beginnig i.e. for over 20 years. If not the inventor, at least he is at the origin of MPEG standards for video (used on DVDs) for Audio (mp3 being one instance of MPEG audio standards) and obtained a Grammy award for this work. However, this bio has tio be completely rewriten to stick to his exact titles of fame, who are numerous enough. Liagushka 21:28, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I took a look at the categories. Just the Indian bloggers. I dont have anything against the category itself per se. But just because a 'nobody' blogs day in and day out for 'x' number of years doesnt bless him with enought notability to merit an article on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>If a 'notable' person(like say, M J Akbar) blogs, then it makes sense to make a 'note' of it. Rajeev Srinivasan also just about makes the grade because he is a regular journalist/columnist at one of the biggest portals/websites in India and perhaps the world. That certainly is 'notable'.</li>
<li>Kiruba who(??) is on the other hand, a 'nobody'. Blogging alone seems to be his claim to dubious claim of notability. It is not like he is the only blogger from his country or that he is the only one in the world who blogs about a certain topic or something like that. It is not like he's running something on the lines of slashdot or something notable like that(dont jump at me, I know slashdot isnt a blog). Basically, forget the person, even his blog is nothing special. For example, there was some blog during the recent Iraq war which was the only blog in the world that was reporting from ground zero and major news agencies were feeding off that blog. Kiruba and his blog have no such achievements to their credit. It is just another one of the zillion blogs on the net.</li>
<li>And just because The Hindu mentions his blog in an article about the 'non-notable' blogging scene in India(not even India, just Madras) is no claim to fame. The Hindu and other Indian newspapers(even English ones) routinely cover such 'non-notable' events like some fancy dress competition for kids in some school for Krishna Janmashtami, some high school's annual day celebrations etc.,.</li>
<li>Using these to establish notability is ridiculous and going on to write articles about such people and events is an abuse of technology and wikipedia. Gigabytes and terabytes may come cheap these days, but that is no reason to dump all nonsensical stuff reeking of vanity on wikipedia. Basically, as a thumb rule, I'd ask myself the question, "Will this article make it to the Encyclopedia Britannica?(even assuming the book ran into millions of pages and thousands of volumes)". The answer is an emphatic NO! Kiruba and his blog(considering their 'achievements' to date) will not make it into E.Britannica today or in the next 50 years or ever!!</li>
<li>Also, I havent taken a look at the entries under the Bloggers category for other countries. But even if there are entries like Kiruba's from other countries, I hold that even they should be deleted. This is just plain and utter nonsense!! Come to think of it, I myself have represented a state of India in baseball. How many people in India have done that? So let me just trash the fact that 'Baseball in India' itself is 'non-notable' and nonsense, and let me go ahead and create a wikipedia article for myself!! Kiruba's name at best belongs in some article about say, 'Blogging scene in Madras' or some such article. Writing a whole article about this 'nobody' is simply an abuse of technology and resources.

<dd>You certainly weren't involved in the same efforts all of us were - I hadn't heard about you either, and you hadn't heard about me. But that doesn't invalidate your efforts, and it doesn't invalidate Kiruba's either. As for his "ordinary blog" - strange that every indiblogger rating system I know rates him in the top 5 - and for very good reasons.</dd>
<dd>As I have said before - a subject doesn't turn "non-notable" just because *you* haven't heard about it/him/her. It turns non-notable if *no one* has heard of it before. And that is very obviously not the case here or in the case of the other AfD nominations by the same editor, who seems to be showing the same "haven't heard of, can't be notable" problem. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 18:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>I haven't heard of you, you haven't heard of me; it doesn't invalidate our efforts</i> - Alright. Nor does it make us 'notable' enough to merit articles on wikipedia. And in any case, why are we discussing his tsunami works?? I was under the impression that the article existed because he was a 'notable' <i>blogger</i>. The article describes that 'blogging' is his greatest(and only) claim to 'notability' on WP. His tsunami work and rowing for sify team wouldn't fetch him an article even on wikipedia even from whoever wrote this dubious article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And <i>indiblogger rating system</i>. What indiblogger rating system? Systems that require bloggers to register their blogs on their 'system' to even get rated! These so called 'systems' themselves are of dubious nature and the less said the better about the 'systems' they use to establish their useless top 10 or top 100 lists. Its not like some fortune 500 or forbes 50 list. These so called 'indiblogger systems' - what are they? are they slashdot? Also let me quote the Category:Bloggers description -

<dd>As I said, the article can do with editing. Notability is not something either of us can be a judge of. And Kiruba wields huge influence in the blogger world in India and has used that influence to make things happen for many people, including (but not limited to) Tsunami victims. We are here to edit articles, not to judge.

<dd><i>...Kiruba wields huge influence in the blogger world in India...</i> - Thats your POV and basically nonsense. I for one, wielded considerable influence in the <i>gilli-danda</i> and <i>buguri</i>(top) circuit in my area. Kiruba is just another one of the billion bloggers who has had his 15 mins of fame, thanks to the likes of people who've voted "Keep" here. I'd like to see someone establish the <b>widespread influence</b> this 'nobody' has had on anybody or anything. Note that the emphasis is also on 'influence'. Also while blogs as a technological innovation and a medium of communication may be 'notable', bloggers arent automatically 'notable' nor will cooked up 'ahhh-so-coooool' neologisms like "Blogging 'scene' in India", "Indibloggers", "blogger meet" etc., give them the 'notability' they dont deserve. And also please stop talking about tsunami, row row row a boat etc.,. Even the article doesnt describe those things as his claim to fame. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody contests the fact that Hindu is a reliable source. But you should be pragmatic enough to know where and how much weight to give to it. Like I said, Hindu and other Indian newspapers routinely cover insignificant items like high school annual day celebrations, inter school elocution contests, a talk by some 'motivational' expert in some corner of the city etc.,. Even the article you've linked is just one such insignificant 'city-specific' article. Also '....India's leading blogger...' is blatantly POV for WP purposes. I can fish out zillion articles from zillion 'reliable' sources that sing praises of Tendulkar and describe him on the lines of 'the greatest there is, the greatest there was, the greatest there'll ever be'. How I wish I could use those sources to edit <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tendulkar.html" title="Tendulkar">Tendulkar</a> and claim that he is the greatest of all time! I can produce any number of 'reliable sources' that sing praises of <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a> and elevate him to 'Godhood'. How I wish Wikipedia would let me use those articles(with the POV) to edit <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a>. Kiruba Shankar is not India's leading blogger, not even close. Who is Hindu to decide such things. It is not like they're quoting some authoritative source. It is simply some unabashed POV of some journalist.

<li><b>Disagree -- do not delete</b>The company is the first of its kind.

<li><b>Comment</b> True -- but I am not sure what is wrong with this (Again I am a newbie on Wikipedia). My blog is well read in the field and the person who has marked it for deletion has demonstrated no expertise or experience in the field. Quote from Wikipedia: "Users are cautioned to assume good faith, and to recall that all new users must start off somewhere. Further, many people with expertise in a specific area quite reasonably make contributions within that area alone." I have no other way to defend the article than to appeal to experts in the field. If you read the blog you'll see that it is not a sales platform but a conversation within an emerging community of design and communication experts. You'll also note that the conversation does not tend to be adversarial. In my understanding the merits of an encyclopedia article are generally based on "peer review." The blog entry was an appeal to my peers for them to add their voices to this discussion. <a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgray_xplane_79fa.html" title="User:Dgray xplane">Dgray xplane</a> 18:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC) dgray_xplane

<li><b>Comment</b>: Outside of Wikipedia, XPLANE is a thriving business that's helped tons of people better understand complex digital information. Pick up any of the last two dozen Business 2.0 magazines and you'll see what they've contributed to the lexicon. Dave and his team have been behind some amazing works to better communication over all, by using visual thinking to put their points across. I'm not sure the "rules" of Wikipedia, but it seems silly to delete something just because the contributor hasn't been toiling away on the rest of the entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> - From reviewing in detail the relevant materials related to qualification for inclusion I would suggest XPlane more than qualifies for inclusion in Wikipedia. Within it's industry it's widely regarded as not just a leader but a unique entity that has essentially defined the space. Their work appears in numerous respected publications such as Business 2.0. While not broadly "notable" as an organization within the information design community they are as notable as it gets and have made an immense contribution to it's industry. - RyanColemanYYZ 14:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— RyanColemanYYZ (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RyanColemanYYZ_810f.html" title="Special:Contributions/RyanColemanYYZ">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not only is XPLANE obviously a big player in its field, but the company's contribution also extends beyond the commercial sphere. Their work is an inspiration to anyone and everyone. I stand in awe of their achievement, yet my experience with the CEO Dave Gray is that of a very approachable person, who will allways find time for others despite his busy schedule. XPLANE is a company about communication, who practice what they preach, and not just for a dollar. Their work has inspired me personally in many ways, on a practical and communication level. XPLANE not only contributs in a commercial sense, but to communication as a whole. When a company can reach far beyond their clients, to the far corners of the globe, and in a benificial way, that IS noteworthy. Communication is about just that, and not about protocoll for protocoll's sake. The real question about the wiki entry is about noteworthyness. There is no doubt in my mind, that XPLANE is.Judyofthewoods 15:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— Judyofthewoods (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Judyofthewoods_02c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Judyofthewoods">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>In response to the request for citations: XPLANE's work has been published in Discover Magazine, Time magazine, Business 2.0, and Harper's. XPLANE has also illustrated several books, including "Informal Learning" by Jay Cross (inventor of the term "e-learning" and Network Security Illustrated, published by McGraw Hill. XPLANE diagrams have been also featured in textbooks on e-Commerce.</li>

<li>Contribution to Wikipedia is important, and many of us are grateful, but that should not be the only determiner of notability. Experts in the subject should be consulted whenever possible. In response to the definition of "notable:" If any of the posters have practical experience or have been recognized in the field of information design it would be helpful to add it, as it lends credence to their arguments. Speaking for myself, I have six years experience doing information design for major metropolitan newspapers, including the LA Daily News, LA Herald-Examiner, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and St. Louis Post-Dispatch. I have been recognized for excellence in the field by the Society of News Design and the Associated Press. I have spoken at numerous conferences on information design, including

<dd>I would like to reiterate that I did not write the article; I only tried to modify it based on the assertion that there was no evidence that the company was notable. Never having been asked to do this before I took my best shot. Now the article has been accused of being too much like advertising, which was not my intent. It was an attempt to redress an assertion by Veinor that the company is not notable. In the field the company is highly regarded and recognized as an innovator. However as the Founder of the company it is difficult for me to write or be credible as an objective writer. However this is not a good reason to delete the entry. I have yet to see tangible suggestions for improving the article, other than the ones I have made myself. <a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgray_xplane_79fa.html" title="User:Dgray xplane">Dgray xplane</a> 01:10, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author Informal Learning, Rediscovering the Natural Paths that Inspire Innovation and Performance. ISBN: 0-7879-8169-9. XPLANE's use of graphics to improve learning at a major petroleum company warrant an entire chapter. When I was CEO of eLearning Forum, I hosted a conference on visual learning. The three keynote speakers were David Sibbett (founder of corporate group graphics), Bob Horn (author of Visual Language), and Dave Gray (because XPLANE is an importance force in visual learning.) As for other published work, see any copy of Business 2.0 magazine. Or the article in Training &amp; Development magazine on visual learning, February 2002. At Learning 2006 this November in Orlando, I curated the Graphic Learning Excellence gallery, an exhibit of top learning graphics. XPLANE was the only firm to have three projects represented.

<dd>According to Wikipedia guidelines (Bolding mine):</dd>
</dl>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets <b>any</b> of the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself. This criterion includes <b>published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations except</b> for the following: Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.</p>
<p>First: Reading through the list of press mentions above, I believe it will evident that the press mentions are not media reprints of press releases, nor are they advertising, nor are they publications where the company taks about itself.</p>
<p>Second: The articles are not trivial coverage based on the definition given here. Since the press mentions meet the first criteria, and are not covered by any of the exceptions, then I submit that XPLANE has met the standards provided by Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgray_xplane_79fa.html" title="User:Dgray xplane">Dgray xplane</a> 22:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>KEEP: As a professional in the field of Visual Facilitation for the past 20 years, I agree that XPLANE is an appropriate topic for Wikipedia. Their work is foundational to a field that contributes to enriched understanding of complex information for businesses and communities. As a result of my research for two books on this topic I have concluded that the capacity to use visuals, symbols, icons and other pictoral references is an important skill for the "information age". The work XPLANE provides also increases their client's capacity to think systemically -- a skill that is critical during this era of globalization.-Nancy Margulies, 21 November 2006</p>

<p>In the UK, district council members are not inherently notable (all strategic issues are decided at county council level).

<p>Non notable school asserting no encyclopedic content, I don't think there's such thing as "regioncruft" but this articles assertion of "stalwarts like IICT, NGRI, CCMB" is also hopelessly relevant to only the region in which the article is commenting. The style and grammar would require a complete rewrite (with the capslock key levered off the keyboard) and the POV issues if removed would probably result in a 6 word article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea what "systemic bias" is supposed to mean, but I do know how to define notability. Your "tentative" status is demonstrating an extreme version of deletionist elitism as to what schools merit inclusion in Wikipedia. At this school, the Nobel laureates lectured as part of an integrated program with the parent <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Institute_of_Chemical_Technology_9ab6.html" title="Indian Institute of Chemical Technology">Indian Institute of Chemical Technology</a>, unlike the feel-good appearances by those on the lecture circuit at your school, which had no connection whatsoever to the curriculum. By your logic, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine High School</a> should not merit an article, as it was merely the site of a massacre. If the incident had happened at a local fast food establishment, would there be an article Columbine McDonald's that talked about the restaurant's menu and staff simply because a whole bunch of people were killed by two members of the wait staff who worked there after school? Or would there be an article for Columbine Post Office about the hours and services offered at that branch, if <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold_7c49.html" title="Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a> had graduated high school and gotten jobs as letter carriers before they went berserk? As to your "influence educational standards for a whole national region" criterion, can you name more than a handful of schools (if that many) that would meet this criteria? We have to stop sitting up all night trying to figure out new hoops for school articles to jump through. And when did Wikipedia become a US only site that we have to question whether foreign schools should be admitted? Schools, as an integral part of our education system, and as demonstrated by the frequent, in-depth coverage they receive from multiple, independent and reliable sources, are often notable and deserve articles in Wikipedia, should they meet these standards. This school is simply one of the better-qualified for Wikipedia inclusion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your expeditious label of me as an extreme elitist is merely an underhanded tactic designed to discredit my justification to delete this article. Instead of addressing my points directly, you first prefix an accusation of systematic bias in order to label me as a miscreant and a systematically biased Western bigot. I ask you this: if I were an extremist like you explicitly accuse me of being, why would I be compelled to "tentatively" argue for the deletion of this article? If I intended to systematically delete this and every other article which did not fit in with my bigoted "deletionist [elitist]" views, would I argue to "tentatively delete" this article? No. If I were in fact an extremist as you accuse of being, I would argue <i>vehemently</i> for the deletion of any article which I did not include in the limited corpus of human knowledge I deemed appropriate to include in any encyclopædia. Because I in fact argue <i>tentatively</i> rather than <i>vehemently</i> for the deletion of this article, I am not a systematically biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western bigot as you readily accuse me of being. Thus I loathe your accusation that I am prejudiced by an "extreme ... deletionist elitism."</li>
<li>Further, nowhere did I argue that because Columbine High School was involved in one of the the largest, worst, most horrific school massacres in United States history that it should be priveleged to have data on its corresponding encyclopædia article including hours, staff, address, contact information, etc. My apparently systematicaly biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western-bigoted minority/fringe views which you shamelessly accuse me of compel me to disagree with including the aforemtioned data on the grounds of it being unencyclopædic. If the data could be integrated into the article in the form of compelling, even brilliant prose, then including would be fine by me. But I view that including it in a pithy directory format in an easily accessible table right in view at the top of the page is exactly <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
<li>And no, as to my idealistic (but ultimately bigoted and "deletionist [elitist]") school inclusion criterion, that the school "influence educational standards for a whole national region," I cannot name more than a handful of schools that would meet this criterion. But, in the spirit of my alleged systematically biased "deletionist [elitist]" Western-bigoted views, I feel compelled to include only these few schools in any encyclopædia. But I loathe your label; I ardently argue that I am neither systematically biased, nor "deletionist [elitist]," nor a Western bigot when I think that this article should not be included in Wikipædia. A Western bigot would argue that this article be deleted but not articles about high schools in the United States deleted; I argue that not only this article but also articles concerning high schools in the United States be deleted, thus I am not a Western bigot. An "extreme ... deletionist [elitist]" would argue <i>vehemently</i> that this article be deleted; I am not arguing vehemently that this article be deleted, but am arguing <i>tentatively</i> that it be deleted, thus I am not an "extreme ... deletionist [elitist]". (I <i>am</i> arguing <i>vehemently</i> that your accusations and abstractions of my arguments are underhanded, accusatory attempts to discredit my arguments in favor of deletion by labeling me as a systematically biased, "deletionist [elitist]" Western bigot. There is a distinct difference.)</li>
<li>I still stand by my criteria for inclusion of high schools in Wikipedia. (I must note, however, that I do not pretend to hold them as a final decision. Indeed, I quickly summarized thoughts that had been floating around in my head upon which I have neither ruminated nor refined.) I do not use them as a strict policy, but instead I am informed by them, when I choose to argue to <i>tentatively delete</i> this article. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 01:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you claiming that you don't recognize that your argument that only those high schools that "were to influence educational standards for a whole national region" merit inclusion is not elitist? Again, how many schools in the world meet this criteria? It is a justification that is so irrational as to be meaningless. Your "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" is another standard that is so arbitrarily unrealistic as to be useless. How many schools on this planet meet this criteria? By what existing Wikipedia standard have you derived these justifications? Please refer to anything, anywhere that justifies your nonsensical vote. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:36, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Generally, I would agree with the premise that most high schools (e.g., most on the planet) are not notable. I changed to keep on this particular one, as it has some very unique and special characteristics, and has been verifiably recognized in quite a few third-party sources. However, generally, Local High is not notable, any more then a local Wal-Mart or gas station would be. I would say there should be some additional exceptions, such as historic/event notability (Columbine, for example, or the first high school in a country), exceptional standards or styles of teaching (though if this is related to a "chain" such as Waldorf/Montessori, this should already be covered under the main "X Schools" article and wouldn't establish notability for the school itself), exceptional and historic controversy surrounding the school (of more than just local interest), massive and verifiable influence on teaching standards over a <b>large</b> region or nationwide (not just state/citywide), winning a major national (not local) award and receiving significant press coverage for it, or exceptional and region/nationwide (again, not state/citywide) notability for a program at the school. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 03:26, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>Please immediately stop</i> accusing me of being "irrational," "[voting nonsensically]," and providing "ludicrous arguments." I noticed that again, instead of arguing based solely on the apparent merit or lack of merit of my arguments, you prefix an accusation of irreparable and nonsensical bias. Why do I have to cite specific "standards"'s for my argument? I argued based on my conviction that only a few high schools are notable enough <i>to be included in an encyclopædia</i>. So what? My extemporaneous criteria are elitist. I know that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipædia is not paper</a>; but that should never imply that Wikipædia should include everything of little notability and influence.</li>
<li>And why does it matter that my criteria are elitist? Precedent and consensus must start somewhere: an unrecognized and unrespected opinion. Does my argument offend you? Does it frighten you? Why are you so loathe towards my argument such that your reaction is first to alienate my argument, then accuse me of irreparable bias and nonsensical justification? Are you unable to discuss the apparent lack of merits you find in it, so you instead result to name calling? Bingo! That you are accusing me of elitism is again evident of your underhanded attempt to distance me from the mainstream. By attaching a label, you intend to stigmatize and alienate me from the average Wikipædian, based on the virtue that you dislike my opinion. Instead of arguing based on the perceived lack of merit, you attempt to create a divide via an automatic labeling procedure. <i>Please stop.</i></li>
<li>I still stand by my criteria, even if they are "gasp" elitist. I nonetheless consider them a good set of criteria to apply to the inclusion of articles into an <i><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">encyclopædia</a></i>. If you want to discuss the merits or lack of merits of my arguments, instead of merely labeling them with divisive, stigmatizing, and alienating labels, please come back and do; otherwise, any further altercation would be superfluous, appalling, and redundant.</li>
<li>(Note: Consider the following clause from "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">wikietiquette</a>". <i>The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments.</i> You specifically accused me of "[not justifying my] nonsensical <i>vote</i>". I thought this was a <i>debate</i>, not a <i>vote</i>. I argued, either meaningfully or nonsensically, based on my conviction. My "vote" was a mere initial text to summarize my argument. Do you just want me to fall into line and vote <i>strong keep</i>, with little supporting argument, like the rest of the people you solicited to "reconsider their vote"? Perhaps you should cite any "existing Wikipedia standard" for your actions; that is, if you truly do require that to support any individualised action on Wikipædia.) --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 10:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not a vote. But the thing you typed where you wrote "weak delete" and tried to explain your justification is so far out of consensus as to be meaningless. Why is your requirement that a school "influence educational standards for a whole national region" or "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" any more valid than "all schools are notable"? How can you quote an obligation to "make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments", which are solely based on your own personal biases, not on any relevant standard? If you read above, I detail the criteria by which this article passes <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and would pass any other relevant test for such an institution. And you appeal to what, other than your own personal whim?? How many schools in the world meet your elitist criteria? Please give us an idea so that we can judge if there is any merit to the standards you've concocted. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:35, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To reply to the above comment by Alansohn, I don't find Iamunknowns justification meaningless at all and it could be construed as a personal attack... His requirements <i>are</i> more valid than 'all schools are notable' in the sense that they are actual requirements that can act as guidelines for determining notability while simply saying 'all schools are notable' is not, at least not in the same way. Rather, 'all schools are notable' is a discussion closer; it offers no further justification and makes the whole idea of notability rather worthless. Now, I am actually with you on keeping this particular article, but I agree with Iamunknown in claiming that this whole every high school is notable is a flawed approach that is not in line with most of Wikipedia's policies regarding notability standards. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 11:49, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> You got me on that one. Okay, let's try this: a so-called standard that only accepts those schools that "influence educational standards for a whole national region" or "attract attention because of a nationally-publicized achievement" is no more valid than a standard that specifies notable schools as those with "more than ten students" or "has been open more than two years." One excludes 99.99999% of all schools, allowing about four or five to slip through, while the other includes almost all schools and excludes a few dozen. They're functional equivalents at exact opposite ends of the spectrum. At least those who claim that "all schools are notable" have the intellectual honesty to proclaim their biases out loud, without hiding behind elitist mumbo-jumbo to hide the fact that what they really advocate is "no schools are notable". The plain fact is that a significant percentage of schools, based on the "multiple non-trivial coverage" standard, are in fact notable by any reasonable definition. It's far less than 100%, but it's certainly far more than the 0.00001% that seems to be advocated by some here. The <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> proposal is a reasonable middle ground that is far closer to a rational middle ground than the wacky deletionist <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> or the even wackier, even further away from consensus standard proposed proposed here. As a matter of fact <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> has not listed any school (other than Columbine) that would meet his criteria. I guess any school that wants an article can always hope for a good, old-fashioned massacre. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:06, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Once again, I would assert that most schools aren't notable (just as the local McDonald's or CompUSA isn't notable, even if in aggregate McDonald's and CompUSA are notable.) The idea of high schools is notable, but very few <i>specific</i> high schools are notable. I think <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, while still a little loose, is a reasonable compromise between the inclusionist "almost all schools are notable" and the deletionist "maybe 0.01% of schools are notable." <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is not, it allows far too many non-notable ones through the cracks. I'd also add that your argument contains a fallacy-just because two arguments are on nearly-opposite ends of a spectrum doesn't mean equal validity. "Almost no one believes the earth is flat" is correct, "almost everyone believes the earth is flat" is wrong, even though they're opposites on that spectrum. Similarly, I would assert that "almost all high schools are notable" is incorrect, while "almost no high schools are notable" is correct. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 14:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Individual local schools are regular recipients of "multiple non-trivial coverage"; Individual McDonald's and CompUSA rarely receive such coverage. Schools receive national and state awards granted on a selective and competitive; ixnay for McDonald's and CompUSA locations. That said, it's nice to have your extreme deletionist bias out in the open. Wikipedia has a a clear consensus that a significant majority of schools are notable, and a succinct proposal at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> that offers succinct guidelines to define which are and which are not. Your "no schools are notable" dictate, and the formal definition of this credo at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, is so far out of the mainstream as to be invalid for consideration. A significant percentage of schools, based on the "multiple non-trivial coverage" standard, are notable by any reasonable definition of the term. It's far less than 100%, but it's certainly far more than the 1-in-ten thousand standard (converting your 0.01%) that you advocate here. If there are 20,000 high schools in the United States, only two would have articles. Which two are they- Columbine and what else? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> One would imagine that a local McDonald's or CompUSA would receive coverage for grand openings, and possibly even for sales or the like-especially in smaller cities or towns. The problem and point here is, however, that the coverage is of only <i>local</i> notability. Also, please do not misrepresent me-I said the compromise point should be <i>in between</i> "include every school" and "include 0.01% of schools" (a figure which I made up on the spot anyway), so I never suggested the 0.01% as a correct figure. The criteria I suggested earlier were somewhat lost in the sea of text, but to reiterate-I believe that schools which are the subject of exceptional controversy (more so than just locally), are historically important (Columbine, or the first high school in a country), have a notable and very unusual teaching method, and are not a "chain" such as Waldorf/Montessori in which this is covered in the main article (many charter schools would meet this), have won major regional/national (not state or local) awards and have received significant press for this, or are a verifiably major influence on regional/national (not state or local) teaching methods or standards, are notable and should be included. Some other schools such as this one (with Nobel-prize winners as regular lecturers) may have some unique claim to notability as well, which should be examined on a case by case basis as it was here. Oh, and before you label me an "extreme deletionist", you may wish to note what I voted here. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have a number of remarks regarding this conversation. They are as follows:
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Alan, please try to be more civil. Making <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on Iamunknown simply because he disagrees with you is inappropriate. Calling someone's views 'wacky' because they are different than yours doesn't help the situation and only heightens tension. Referring to your arguments as the only ones which are 'reasonable' shares the same problem. I don't see why reason dictates that you are more correct than others. I'm assuming good faith on this matter; I believe that we are all reasonable editors with different viewpoints and our viewpoints all have some validity.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> This notion that those of us who would normally want to delete high schools are 'elitist' is perhaps somewhat correct, though it's a thinly veiled attempt to demean our position in favor of a more inclusionist one. As far as the way this term is being used in this context, I am of the opinion that encyclopedias are <i>supposed</i> to be elitist; <b>they are not directories to have information on every school, hospital, restaurant and gas station rather they are supposed to discriminate and include information on those that substantially stand out from the crowd.</b> Does the high school have a novel approach to education? If so, keep it. Has it won a considerable number of awards? Then keep it. Is it a typical high school, with a decent but average program? Then it doesn't need to have an article.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> While this may not be directly on topic, it ties in with my above comments. After looking at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> I have to say I still find it too inclusionist based on its first criteria and the fact that a school must only meet one. Virtually all schools, including elementary ones (and even many preschools) will meet that criteria. Local newspapers often have several articles on each school in that locality every year. This criteria makes the other three meaningless since it's going to end up resulting in articles for all other schools. I personally, and I recognize this isn't the most appropriate place for this discussion, feel that criteria one should be required in conjunction with one of the other three criteria.</dd>
<dd><b>4.</b> Finally, as a matter of self-defense, please keep in mind that I did vote keep in this particular instance. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had changed my notes to reflect some begrudging support for this based on the fact that the article had been cleaned up and removed some of the glaring problems that it originally had, but seeing some fellow exclusionists weigh in a little I'm inclined to comment further towards getting the consensus. I am unreservedly elitist in my view on Wikipedia, as an exlusionist I believe that articles should exist representing the top <i>x</i>% of schools. Those which are notable above and beyond the usual collection of schools that all of us (presumably) went to and each of which had their own unique facets associated with them. Some of the following need to be considered before we can reach consensus here.
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Is this school unique in any way which is unique to uniqueness? This horridly phrased question means, all schools are unique in some way or another. Each has individual personalities, innovative programs and achievements which set them apart from a category or categories in which they may participate. Some have nobel prize laureates give speeches, some have presentations by the Coca Cola yo-yo team (mine did), but by their nature schools do things that other schools don't. Their unique achievements need to be considered in line with this, and should be <i>more</i> unique to assert their notability than perhaps a Safeway or McDonalds should. My highschool in Australia had an annual festival whereby inordinate ammounts of dutch fruit and donut balls were cooked and sold to raise funds, it was very well known in the surrounding towns for it. No other school did this or anything similar but <i>schools do unique things</i>, this doesn't make them notable.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> Systemic bias is a horrid labelling accusation designed to drag a debate into the mud. It is <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum_0887.html" title="Reductio ad Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a> in the worst possible manner, designed to villify arguments by directly associating them with a widely despised phenomena. Essentially the thin veil of accusations of racial vilification are being used to draw attention away from the fact that the school in question here, and often any school whose notability is up for debate, is hopelessly relevant to only a very select area. We should not feel guilty about this, and we should wholesale reject any <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>-esque accusations designed to make people feel guilty for expressing a valid opinion provided it is backed up with fact.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> Further on geography, I don't think we should take into consideration the location of a school when deciding on it's worthiness of inclusion. Let's just drag this down to common sense, let's assume that each Wikipedian reading my comments now is a vaguely intelligent person. Let's say they randomly think up the names of 5 educational institutions. For me it was University of Sydney, UCLA, MIT, Oxford and Lund Universitat. Let's assume they think up 10 more, let's assume they are then asked to think up 1000, 10,000, <b>100,000</b>. Will an average person given ANY period of time, have the Dr. S. Hussain Zaheer Memorial High School pop into their head? Notability doesn't mean fame I know, but would any 500 english speaking people chosen randomly across the globe when asked directly about the Dr. S. Hussain Zaheer Memorial School know what it was from a source other than the Wikipedia? Now apply the same test to <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lund_University_2678.html" title="Lund University">Lund</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Standford</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julliard.html" title="Julliard">Julliard</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroshima_University_25a5.html" title="Hiroshima University">Hiroshima University</a>...</dd>
<dd><b>4.</b> This final one is entirely my good-faith opinion, may be entirely wrong and is almost certainly going to be misinterpreted and leave me the subject of personal attacks. I believe that a part of Indian culture is a unified feeling of immense pride in India's educational institutions, particulary those related with the technology industry. While applaudable this sense of pride needs to be considered with caution when evaluating encyclopedia articles on that subject matter, the cultural pride in India's schools may lend itself to editors of articles on them taking criticism of their notability personally. I'm making no comment on the actual quality of India's schools, only that inside of India the opinion held by people outside of India on the notability of Indian schools may be overestimated. <b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 22:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The school has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools.</i></dd>
<dd>My understanding of this (perhaps you disagree) is that the school would have to have something very specific about it that sets it apart. A school which provides for IT industry certifications as part of it's highschool education curriculum, a school which teaches braille or sign lanugage as part of it's curriculum in servicing the blind or deaf, <i>something</i> which sets it apart from highschools. This is another spectacular failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school or its staff.</i></dd>
<dd>None. The school has not been awarded any state awards, or had any commendations from notable people as would be outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school has notable alumni or staff (e.g. would qualify for an article under WP:BIO or WP:MUSIC)</i></dd>
<dd>No, or not stated, again the same thing. You could almost consider that it's namesake is notable, but I'd doubt it and I think the other considered arguments for deletion would agree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The school building or campus has notable architectural features that set it apart from others.</i></dd>
<dd>No. I assume that this school is not on board a spacecraft, under the sea, at the 150th floor of a building or in a building which has existed for time immemorial as an example of a particular period of architecture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see this is a failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> that can not possibly get any worse. Further the debate that was meant to achieve a consensus, only tallied votes. These "keep votes" had such nonsensical explanations as "Weak Keep- Seems to be a notable educational institution. Nileena joseph (Talk|Contribs) 16:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)", or "KEEP. NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE INDEPENDANTLY NOTABLE, BUT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THIS SCHOOL IS. RFerreira 05:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)" a cursory counting of heads and people weighing in. There were paragraphs upon paragraphs of weighted, supported, considered reasons for it's deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(END)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Guys my (hopefully) final word on this is that this school is not notable, it is not made notable by having a hockey ground even if it is a very nice one. It is not made notable by important people speaking at it (ALL schools get important people speaking at them), it is not made notable by a sea of people saying "Seems notable" without providing any information as to WHY it seems notable to them and on what version of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> they are making the assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any Wikipedians who comment on this AfD further, would be doing me a personal favour for which I'd be most grateful if they didn't drag the debate into the mud with <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>-esque accusations of racial villification, calling people ham-fisted, a doodie-head, or do anything else to try and detract from the actual subject matter at hand in favour of a petualant race-card play. Any editor offering "<b>keep</b> it seems notable although I've never read any of the guidelines defining what that word means on Wikipedia" or "<b>keep</b> you are racist against India" or "<i>keep</i> This school now has two Google hits, nevermind both of them are Alansohn requesting on user's talk pages that they reconsider their opinion publically", should be discounted and if nobody can offer actual reasons why this article is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia the matter should be closed and resolved for deletion.</dd>

<p>The result was: with, as eloquently pointed out by 152 and Garrett, no indication that MPOGD is notable (in fact, an article on the site has been deleted) and no arguments to the contrary, which means MPOGD cannot be said to confer notability through its awards, we have no non-trivial coverage by independent third-party sources or any other indication that this game is notable. <b>Delete</b>, <i>not discounting</i> arguments from anons, since a convincing case for deletion was made that has not been answered. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. No sources outside its fanbase.

<dd>I'd be quite suprised if we ended up keeping an otherwise un-notable game thanks to an unknown award from a non-notable site. <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Tony+Sidaway%22+%22Drama+Queen%22+Award+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Tony+Sidaway%22+%22Drama+Queen%22+Award+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Internet awards</a> need to have some provenance if they are to carry any weight. Looking at "mpogd.com" itself to attempt to determine its notability, I'd point out that:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=mpogd&amp;go=Go" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=mpogd&amp;go=Go" rel="nofollow">It doesn't have a Wikipedia entry</a></li>
<li>It's only Google news entries are from <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;q=mpogd&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;q=mpogd&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">itself.</a></li>
<li>While the website gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=mpogd&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=630&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=mpogd&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=630&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">quite a few</a> Google hits, none I could find were from an <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">independant third party</a>.</li>

</ol>

<dd>If this game can demonstrate that it's won an award from a notable website, or that it has had non-trivial coverage somewhere else, then this article should be kept.
