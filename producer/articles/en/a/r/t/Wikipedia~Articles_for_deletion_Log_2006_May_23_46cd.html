<li><b>Keep or Move</b> Having fairly limited experience on Wikipedia I am willing to respect the decision here, but I would like details on what each of you thought was lacking besides the generic 'reason-for-deletion' terms. First, I would like to question the primary assertion of non-notability by referring you to criteria 1 on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a> and pointing out that this camp hosts thousands of different persons annually and acts as a cultural unifier for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches_of_Christ_04ac.html" title="Churches of Christ">Churches of Christ</a> in the Northwest US, which I would classify as "at least well-known in a community." Having met said criteria, "there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being: of insufficient importance, fame or relevance or... obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki_is_not_paper.html" title="Wiki is not paper">Wikipedia isn't paper</a>.)" Granted, this is an article on an obscure location, globally speaking... Perhaps this article would do better on <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiTravel_62d2.html" title="WikiTravel">WikiTravel</a> as per point 3 on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. I would also request examples of NPOV violations in this article so I can do better in the future; I thought this article was very neutral, as it passed rigorous editing for NPOV over at H2G2. <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslemaster_32d3.html" title="User:Islemaster">Isle</a> 18:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>DELETE</b> - Simply, there is no claim to noteability. The article asserts no more noteability than the fact that it exists, and websites aren't entitled to articles simply because they exist.

<li><b>RESPONSE</b> - No, it does not. The criteria listed at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are: <i>"1)The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. 2)The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation. 3)The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>."

<li><b>Keep</b> The organisation is clearly notable, is frequently mentioned in news articles (today hits on google news as well as yahoo news), was also described in the foreign press (e.g. Junge Welt, Germany, French articles).

From the website: "I have just spent several frustrating hours trying to revise and improve the entry on "Scholars for 9/11 Truth", only to discover that my rewrites were being over-ridden by someone at Wikipedia." <i>Bottom line</i>: This guy is a POV pusher, trying to use wikipedia as a web server in an attempt to give credibility to his project that is looking more dubious the more i look into it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 18:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So are you suggesting that Fetzer created the article, or that he is inappropriately editing it? It seems to me that the latter claim shouldn't be grounds for deletion, but rather grounds for caution about POV-pushers lurking about. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 18:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The latter, and i agree that that in itself is no grounds for deletion. But it is a warning about POV-pushers, hence the comment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 18:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think its even more harmless then that if you read the link listed, he was simply trying to add information to the article, albeit POV centric. However alot fo the information he tried to add that was removed is actually legitimate. Also this group obviously meets the popularity standard. The google hits alone show that. Also I used that link as a source cause Metzer himself is admitting to being in the group something one of the vandals who removed all the information repeatedly stated need citing as their member list needs to verified by a secondary source, which is pretty ludicrous assertion. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 19:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, unfortunately. The group is notable, although seriously misguided (IMHO) (The article should assert the group's notablility, though, which it doesn't, at present.)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Much of the support to delete articles on this subject, see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/9/11_Truth_Movement" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/9/11_Truth_Movement" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, is obviously intended as censorship. The language used to describe the advocates of the article; ‘crackpots’, ‘loonies’, ‘conspirators’, ‘worthless’, ‘tin pot wackos’, etc., shows strong subjective bias. ‘Not Notable’ entries ignore the tens of thousands of hits on Google, proving this article outranks many other articles found here. Most impressively notable is the recent Zogby poll <a href="http://www.911truth.org/images/911TruthZogbyPollFinalReport.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.911truth.org/images/911TruthZogbyPollFinalReport.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> which demonstrates extremely strong public interest. Isn’t it the purpose of Wikipedia to provide information for those who wish to learn more about a subject at hand? Does it not degrade Wikipedia to allow censorship by those who simply do not subscribe to certain views on a subject? If people aren’t interested, or don’t want to learn about this subject, they can simply bypass it. But those who are interested should find it here. After all, who needs reference material that disallows controversial subject matter?--<a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolateral_339b.html" title="User:Kolateral">Kolateral</a> 05:35, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Excellent point. And to add to it, a lot of the initiative to close down this page and other controversial pages like it, seems to be coming from those who look to the mainstream media for what is true and authoritative. It is useful to remember that much of that media is owned by huge corporate interests. For example, GE, one of the world's largest munitions manufacturers, owns NBC. And the Carlyle Group, also a munitions investor, and with whom the Bush family has strong ties, has a huge <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3995.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3995.htm" rel="nofollow">contract</a> to rebuild infrastructure in Iraq after those munitions companies have made a fortune blasting it to hell, on the pretext of WMD. So as far as trusting mainstream to give a full and balanced picture, remember the vested interests behind the media, and also the fact that the only unifying voice that objective and concerned citizens really have is the Internet. So let's not knock the groups they form there too much. They are not crackpots until proven so, which is why a proper 9/11 inquiry is needed. Let's have some respect here, and recognize their existence on the <i>people's democratic Wikipedia</i>.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 20:23, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article does nothing productive, and has virtually no potential to be an informative article in the future. The term "legal technicality" is either:
<ul>
<li>(1) meaningless in that if it were written from a NPOV it would encompass the whole of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurisprudence.html" title="Jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> in every country on the planet; or</li>
<li>(2) it becomes, at it presently is, inherently POV in the sense that well-reasoned and time-tested legal principles are seen as unnecessary complexities that normal folks shouldn't need to be bothered with when they may need to be in court for some reason, or alternately</li>
<li>(3) the article as titled is inherently a POV that the exercise of a person's legally permitted rights in a court of law are mere excuses for guilty people to get off scot-free. ....<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 01:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with the article, which seems perfectly informative to me in describing precisely what a legal technicality <i>is</i>. IMHO, the nomination strays more into POV than does the article. Regardless of the nom's opinion, there <i>are</i> many legal principles, however time tested or well reasoned, which are viewed as "technicalities" by people all the way up to the White House. There's a strong revisionist streak on Wikipedia, I recognize, but there's a difference between how we <i>want</i> the public to perceive things and how they actually do, and a valid encyclopedia should reflect the latter more than the former. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 02:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re: " there are many legal principles, however time tested or well reasoned, which are viewed as "technicalities" by people all the way up to the White House." Note carefully the use of the words "viewed as 'technicalities'" in this statement just made here. Are you actually asserting that the article should be kept, but if it is kept it should be brought in line with the fact that anyone who disagrees with another party's use of the procedural law to stop them from doing what they want in court, they almost universally call it "based on a technicality"??...<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 03:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am asserting that the article should be kept. I agree that aside from anything else, people <i>do</i> blame many legal results they don't like on "technicalities," and that mentioning the syndrome would suit the article just fine. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 04:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(1)Say an old business associate takes you (or a friend or relative of yours) to court claiming that in 1956 a contract was broken and you owe them money for it. You assert the procedural defenses of <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laches.html" title="Laches">laches</a> and expiration of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a>, and the judge dismisses the case. The old business associate now goes to the press and says “it was dismissed on a legal technicality.” Are you convinced that the assertion of procedural defenses in this case are “legal technicalities”?</dd>
<dd>(2)Say you are arrested, hauled off to jail, not permitted a phone call, and not informed of what the charges are against you. Finally you get to court two years later and tell your story through your court appointed attorney who just met you, and are fortunate enough to have a ‘’competent’’ attorney who, with evidence and argument, persuades the judge that your version of events is factually correct. Note that all your arguments here are “procedural defenses”. The judge releases you.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Metropolitan90, thanks for the link! I should interrupt the comment/analysis of content to report that the U.S. Supreme Court's use of the informal phrase "legal technicalities" over the last century (13 times minus two duplicates and one quote from a newspaper = 10 times) are as follows. All of them are used in a non-definitional way to refer to the idea of merely "complexities or technical aspects of the law"... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 05:14, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) “The function of counsel as a guide through complex <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> long has been recognized by this Court.” (U.S. v. Ash, 1973)</li>
<li>(2) ”Furthermore, during the federal habeas corpus hearing Davis showed his awareness of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.”(footnote in Davis v. North Carolina, 1966)</li>
<li>(3) ”If recovery were denied in this case, the railroads, by the simple expedient of doing each other's work, could tie their employees up in <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> over the proper railroad to sue for injuries and perhaps remove from coverage of the Act a significant area of railroad activity.”(Shenker v. Baltimore and Ohio R.Co., 1963)</li>
<li>(4) “Admiralty practice, which has served as the origin of much of our modern federal procedure, should not be tied to the mast of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> it has been the forerunner in eliminating from other federal practices." British Transport Comm'n v. United States, 354 U.S. 129, 139 .” (CONTINENTAL GRAIN CO. v. BARGE FBL-585, 1960)</li>

(British Transport Comm'n v. United States, 1957).</li>
<li>(6) “When the Congress deliberates over this problem, as it often has, it does not worry about the passing of title or other <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (KERN-LIMERICK, INC. ET AL. v. SCURLOCK, 1954)</li>
<li>(7) “by substituting practical, business conceptions for the previous hairsplitting <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> encrusted upon the 'found'-'present'-'carrying-on-business' sequence, the Court yielded to and made effective Congress' remedial purpose.” (UNITED STATES V. NATIONAL CITY LINES, 1948)</li>

(U.S. V. SCOPHONY CORP. OF AMERICA, 1948)</li>
<li>(9) “<a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">Legal technicalities</a> doubtless afford justification for our pretense of ignoring plain facts before us, facts upon which a man's very life or liberty conceivably could depend.” (CARTER v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF ILLINOIS, 1946)</li>
<li>(10) “We shall assume that the statement, 'judicial instance and interpretative procedure ... even go out to find, every possible technicalit of the law to protect the defendant ... and nullify prosecution,' refers to the quashing of the rape indictments as well as other condemned steps. The comment of the last two paragraphs evidently includes these dismissals as so-called <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (PENNEKAMP v. STATE OF FLA., 1946)</li>
<li>(11) “Yet if <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> rather than practical considerations are to decide that question it should be noted that the defendants were payee-indorsers of the checks.” (KANN v. U.S., 1944)</li>
<li>(12) “After the making of the consent decree and the deposit of the money in court, the situation of this case was substantially that of an interpleader suit after the making of a decree for interpleader and the dismissal of the stakeholder from the cause, with the issue as between the conflicting claimants limited by stipulation to the determination of the amount 'justly due' from the one to the other. That question, of course, was and is to be decided according to the equities of the claimants as between themselves, without regard to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (MCGOWAN v. PARISH, 1915)</li>
<li>(13) “In the News, published the evening of March 19, there was an editorial reviewing the local proceedings, which concluded: 'All of this delay is aggravating to the community. The people of Chattanooga believe that Johnson is guilty, and that he ought to suffer the penalty of the law as speedily as possible. If by <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicality.html" title="Legal technicality">legal technicality</a> the case is prolonged and the culprit finally escapes, there will be no use to plead with a mob here if another such crime is committed. Such delays are largely responsible for mob violence all over the country.'”(U.S. v. SHIPP, 1909)</li>

<dd>The last use is the kicker here, as it is a quote from a newspaper.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As far as I can tell, it has met the notability requirements.

<li>"the article must prove notability itself" (paraphrase) it doesn't. linked articles are meer mentions, and the print articles are not proved. pictures would be proof, i would assume the WSJ could be accessed online somehow?. theres no reason to suspect either of the print articles are anything other than mentions without proof. there has been no claim they are more than mentions anyway. there have been many oportunities to give proof. 137.205.25.203 10:12, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Update</b> - The page has been entirely rewritten. Keep in mind that the 'Truth Movement' is something very new. Those who might be able to define it are presently those who are participating. One might reasonably say that this would not result in an objective definition. This page was written by people with direct experience of the movement, in the sincere attempt to reasonably define a term that has recently entered the popular parlance. Logical critique will receive a logical response. 71.247.64.215 04:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Question: So how is this different from a (hypothetical) article Kindness Movement on "an emerging social movement comprised of many independent groups and individuals" working to promote kindness? What evidence do we have that this Truth Movement exists outside the minds of users Sneet and 71.247.64.215? Who determines which groups and individuals are part of this?

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this article ought to be ammended in two ways. First, it should have some sort of weird roll-over graphic, like those ads for insurance that are an ear of corn and the kernels peel off when you roll-over your state. Second, I was unsatisfied with the exclusion of any information pertaining to the well known similarities between Yuen's life and The Da Vinci Code. 67.86.9.248 05:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As the author of this article, I should like to point out that even people one would have expected to know about this Shabbat in Hebron had never heard about it. The article was therefore written not as a scholarly article but as a factual reconstruction of a significant historical event, which otherwise would have been forgotten.</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b>, of course, and I've gone ahead and done just that. Redirects are cheap, and there are plenty of examples of using them for this precise reason. Obviously the author didn't know of the other page, so what ought to happen in these cases is for some friendly person come and change the new article to a redirect, leaving the history intact so any new information can be merged. I've made the redirect and so deleted the afd notice, but if someone <b>really</b> cares that this was out of process, then go right ahead and finish this vote... — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 20:50, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per Leifern and IZAK, particularly due to the WP:Libel issue. There is no indication that the case has even gone to trial yet, let alone reached a verdict. A mere "allegation" or "civil lawsuit" against a person is completely NN (unless the person is <i>already</i> notable, and even then it's questionable.) The only possible notability at this point is that he is an "Orthodox Jewish rabbi", making this a Man-Bites-Dog story. The article itself alludes to its NN, by acknowledging that the "impact [of the allegations] remains unclear." Bottom line: Delete now and revisit the issue once the criminal/civil cases are concluded and the societal impact becomes clear. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 11:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I just got round to read back issues of <i>New York</i> magazine today. This already seems to be a big deal in the Orthodox community, judging by the letters page of the last issue, and its only likely to get bigger. About Izak's objections, I can say in response to both points, that (a) distortions and (b) potentially libellous statements are easily eliminated by Our Friend The Neutral-making Phrase, namely (say it with me) "It is alleged". If really terrified, add "unsubstantiated" and "in certain quarters". About Nmagedman's objections, yes, the point is that he is an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, with charge of a yeshiva. That's why it is a news story, and thats why it seems people are discussing it and would wish to read about it. Your objection is the same as all the people who vote to delete the articles about that kid who disappeared in Aruba because the only possible notability comes from her being a pretty blonde. Yes! Tragically, it does. Irritates me too, but nothing to be done. Live with it. The world is imperfect.

<p>On Talk:Variational number theory, the author mentions two references, both standard text books (Courant &amp; Hilbert is, among other things, about <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus_of_variations.html" title="Calculus of variations">calculus of variations</a>). However, neither of them mentions variational number theory. I do believe that at least the first example is correct, and that it can be deduced using these two references, but it does seem that there is no field of "variational number theory", and the inclusion of a non-existing book in the references is, to put it kindly, a strange mistake to make. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:21, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This list is inherently unencyclopedic. It assumes that there is a common standard for "unusual", and includes a number of deaths (just for starters, Commodus, Attila the Hun, Clement XVII, Giles Corey) that are not unsual or are at any rate are not unusual in context. Kept to the low standards that the list currently manages, being basically all-inclusive, this is an infinite list and is therefore an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:10, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I was originally looking for an article to delete, but article looks significant and interesting. It covers only notable people with unusual deaths, which is not clear from the title, and unusual is not well defined as Vizjim pointed out. I would like to tidy these up. While I'm criticizing, I would like a cite for each claim, perhaps a web link to a respected source. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 14:27, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Check towards the end of the article (e.g. the last entry). A lot of the people listed here are not famous. What standard of fame would you apply? There's an NBC reporter who died of an embolism there - that's embolism, as in "thing that kills thousands of people every year".
<ul>
<li>I begin to see your point better. However, the vast majority of the pre 1900 entries would fit the most curmudgeonly of criteria. Do you object to more than (say) 10% of the pre 1900 entries? If not, then I suggest the issue is with frequent editing the article to delete the chaff, rather than deleting the whole thing.

<li>Having referred back to the article from your list above ("Commodus, Attila the Hun, Clement XVII [should be VII?], Giles Corey") I think you're just too picky. Dying of a nose bleed on a wedding night is fairly unusual. Personally, I wouldn't be too bothered about 3 of those 4 being included. <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 16:05, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think a balance of fame and unusualness. If it was a really whacky death, I think anyone would do. I would prefer a higher fame threshold for less unusual deaths - perhaps only those with WP articles? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 16:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've added the last three wikilinks to the names. Only two came out red, surprisingly. So any editing will have to be on unusualness of death vs famousness of person. Obviously someone thought each was important, so I might make a list of possible deletions on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 20:25, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with the above opinions. An idea that may please most parties... the "Darwin Awards"-type entries are irritating, I'd humbly suggest that if the page was altered to be a list of <b>famous</b> people who died unusually, it would pass your "indiscriminate..." test? <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 14:31, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Though I see serious POV problems with what constitutes an unusual death, and some are mystifyingly normal deaths. (Clark Gable died of heart disease. Jessica Savitch drove into a canal. Zurab Zhvania died from CO poisoning from a faulty space heater. These are unusual, how?) Can someone define some criteria? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:32, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Possibly trim out some of the less-unusual ones, but this is an interesting and encycloepdic article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with Andrew Lenahan completely. I think people will agree that dying because a tortoise was dropped on your head is unusual and deserves to be noted. The same goes for most of the list, but there are some which are not notable – for example, Matthias Corvinus, who died of poisoned figs?

<li><b>Keep</b> - It clearly needs a fair bit of work, but the nucleus of a good article is there and discussion over the notability of certain aspects of it should surely be on the talk page.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't see what's so NPOV of unusual. Unusual implies that it is not a normal occurance, that it is something notable. Dying of a nosebleed does not happen normally, or else people would be dropping like flies. --THollan 17:34, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - "unusual" can be determined based upon the likelyhood of it occuring. So then, the question is: " of all those that have died throughout history, how many died in this way." If it is not comparitively speaking something that could be considered a "usual" event, then it is inherrantly unusual.

Dear Tony, I don't know how to send you a credible source, any user to write something you will surely think is a fake one. I have helped Mario Finelli Jr. at Sculch.com make a good website, creating many of the flash programs that have and are on his website. Ruff Ruff Studios has also created lots of entertaining flash, but like i stated in the artical, there is no way for us to expand our audience due to a lack of website. I hope you will reconsider your request to delete this artical, as it is important to many people who admire our work in the community.</p>

<p>Dear Everyone,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seriously, what you judge as important may not be whateveryone else thinks. I know he is unknown to most of America he is still important to many people. Addressing the lack of a website problem, All animation by Ruff Ruff Studios are soon to be hosted on sculch.com. I never said he was a major flash animator. Also just to get this strait, he doesn't animate, Walker Downey does. Schott works out the preloaders, actionscript, and interactivity in all of thier projects.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia has notability requirements for this kind of thing, like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">these requirements for biographies</a> that I think would apply here.

<dd>After looking through the google hits a bit more, all the newspaper mentions are incidental to Browne, mainly occuring in articles which describe her as a psychic and then list "other accomplishments."

No content has since been added to the article, so I'm now listing here for discussion. The main content in this article is now a disclaimer <i>This is a useful article and is not speculation! Please do not nominate this article for deletion in less you have a better reason for doing so.</i> The fact of the matter is, the only non-speculative remark is <i>Treehouse is a Drake and Josh episode from Season 4</i> and since that is unsourced, I'm not sure that's even verifiable. Other statements "filiming has most likely..." and "it is expected to..." are clearly speculative. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Treehouse_%28Drake_and_Josh_episode%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50672775" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Treehouse_%28Drake_and_Josh_episode%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50672775" rel="nofollow">This</a> edit rather sums things up, whilst removing the {{prod}} tag with the explanation <i>The article is not speculation and there is content here about the filming and the Plot</i> the article contains the content <i>Filming has most likely begun</i> and <i>The plot outline is unknown</i>.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep and STRONG clean up</b> The camp has been around for a century, it was founded by a notable person, and "Camp Timanous" gets 1,810 Google hits (although only 147 are unique, which is a concern). Googling just "Timanous" gets 7,550 hits and all of the top hits refer to the camp, although only 191 are unique. So, while I'm barely voting keep, this is among the <i>least</i> encyclopedic encyclopedia article I've ever seen. WP doesn't need to list every (or pretty much any) activity that goes on at the camp. WP doesn't need an awards summary. WP also doesn't need the POV that's exhibited in the article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:18, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>-This article concerns a 100-year-old summer camp, with a rich heritage as one of the first and leading summer camps in the US. Its stability, track record, thousands of alumni, consistent success, and role in shaping modern New England camping are all assured. The founders, Luther Gulick and his wife, are children's physical education innovators and used Timanous as a template for their work (please see Luther Halsey Gulick's entry for more on his contributions to basketball, the Campfire Girls program and physical education). Camp Timanous's unchanging values, consistent ownership and staffing, rich generational tradition, and small size all make it an interesting abberation in a growing age of homogenous, do-it-all camps. This is a unique enterprise and deserves inclusion in wikipedia.</li>

<dl>
<dd>As concerns the complaints of Kicking222, the depth of the article should not be a negative. By covering as much ground as possible, in a cohesive and organized manner, a reader can acquire as little or as much information as he or she seeks. By including the most vital facts (e.g. location, date, owners, etc.) at the beginning and continuing on to include more trivial, yet still possibley interesting, information throughout the article, I believe that the writers (myeself included) have developed an interesting article relevant for anyone searching for information about the camp. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrogle94_f9e4.html" title="User:Crogle94">Crogle94</a></dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Organized criminals can technically be terrorist groups, depending on their activities. But I would prefer we avoid throwing around the term unnecessarily, especially since it has gained an immense political connotation since 9/11. The articles are about a group of fictional organizations, not suicide bombing series fanboys, which is what the that article's title seems to imply. <i>Organizations in the Pokemon Series</i> would be a precise category title which avoided any confusion, and could include the gyms, the various antagonist groups, research labs, etc. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 20:51, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Irishguy, the poster asking for deletion, references on the linked source of the alleged "copyright" source the following....Fleshlight History - Interview from S.E.X. zine; "This little article I saved should help you" (current website text image here: <a href="http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00" class="external free" title="http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidebehind.com/B5380D00</a>, and to prevent the obvious legal threats which I'm sure will ensue, such use of this image is covered under the Fair Use ruling as I'm using it to make a point in this editorial comment. The actual website image is owned by the domain registrant for www.fleshlightvideo.net, although I question said registrants copyright ownership of all materials contained therein). The article is bordered by no less than 5 referral ads to the Fleshlight products. You are using the original article for commercial purposes. You are a shill. There is no use of the article here for commercial purposes, it is for informational purposes only. You obviously do not own the copyright of the source material, merely saving it from another now defunct source does not make you the owner of the material. Again, either produce evidence that it is copyrighted material or shut up. (LubeNLuv 22:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>If you placed the AfD tag onto this article and referenced the source, then you clearly didn't note the source did NOT claim to be the copyright holder. It claims just the opposite. So your claims are baseless and your placement of the AfD tag is what is in question. Your continued commentary about which users opinions should be considered "questionabile" simply due to their lack of historical posting are supercilious and put your motives into question. The AfD must either provide evidence that the text is copyrighted or the tag is without merit. (LubeNLuv 23:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>I followed standard procedure. This article has been prodded twice and removed twice by an IP without comment. It ALWAYS goes to AfD when a prod is removed without comment. I noted that this article is unimportant and the subject already has its own article and that it is nothing more than an interview which is not what Wikipedia does. I remarked that it may very well be a copyright violation and it probably is. But frankly, the article should be deleted regardless because it isn't encyclopedic. Also, it is standard procedure to note when a brand new user makes a comment on an AfD page. It is usually a sign of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 23:31, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please point me to the standard procedure FAQ for Wikipedia that encourages labelling first-time posters as "sockpuppets." Just like your claims of copyright violation, I believe that statement is entirely a fabrication of your own making. I can point you to the guidelines, I assure you it does not mention labelling first time posters as "sockpuppets" or even noting that they ARE first-time posters. Please read them for yourself at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines</a>.

<dd>First off, those are talk page guidelines. This isn't an article talk page, it is an AfD page. Second, you yourself should have read that page before attempting to throw it at me. Note the rules on <i>No personal attacks</i> and <i>Assume good faith</i>, both of which you have broken it almost every one of your posts. If you have looked through any other AfD, you will note that first time editors are pointed out because they could be sockpuppets, they could be random people sent here to fill AfDs with <i>don't delete</i> votes, etc. Third, you really should stop going on about me claiming copyright violations as I have refuted this in pretty much every post above. No matter how loudly you say it, it won't make it come true. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 01:07, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>Assume good faith</b></i> would mean that first-time posters are real, sincere and expressing self-motivated thoughts and not "sockpuppetry" I would assume? Or does that only apply in special circumstances? And why assume first-time posters are here to spam "do not delete" posts versus "Please delete" posts? (LubeNLuv 05:09, 25 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>I don't need to assume good faith when brand new users show up, vote for this AfD and either disappear forever as SSHUBIN did, or only deal with this AfD as you do. A user must have a discernable edit history to illustrate that the aims of Wikipedia are important to him/her for their views in the discussion to carry any weight. If a new user arrived to post <i>delete</i> I would have pointed it out. Thus far, it hasn't happened.

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> I am the original subject of the interview listed both here on WikiPedia and on the Fleshlightvideo website. This is not a copyrighted work and if it was, I'd share the copyright with the authors. It's also not an entirely accurate representation of the history of ILF, the makers of the Fleshlight. However, the individual who claims to "hold" the copyright to this work is dead wrong for claiming so and is well known to also claim "ownership" of other peoples videos and public-domain materials as their own for the sole purposes of driving personal click revenues via their website. I believe Wikipedia is a proper repository for this material and would like to see it remain here uncontested. SSHUBIN 20:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

And my continuing message here is that original flag cited alleged evidence that is unfounded as the link points to text that is clearly marked as having originated from another source. And a "nuisance?" Please heed your own advice and kindly refrain from making derogatory commentary about my edits. (LubeNLuv 01:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Please explain to me the definition of the "<b>EDIT</b> this page" function if not to make edits? Or perhaps your screen shows a differently worded command? Also, thank you for calling out the earlier "edits," but you still fail to address that the current discussion pertains to the "POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT VIOLATION" notice all users are greeted with upon attempting to read the "Fleshlight History" entry, where the cited reference for said "POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT VIOLATION" points to a non-copyrighted work. I repeat my claims because they continue to go unanswered. Why is this entry flagged as possibly violating copyright laws when the cited evidence does not claim copyright and, in fact, claims to be derived from other sources?

<dd>First, it is only <i>Fleshlight History</i> because it has been renamed twice since the AfD tag went up. Second, I didn't tag it as a copyvio so stop claiming that I did. Third, all pages have the same basic templates, but discussions on AfDs don't count as <i>edits</i> in any sense of the term. Any more strawmen you would like to set up? Also, I note that you completely avoided the multiple prods and the fact that I didn't put up the copyvio prod that you insist on accusing me of doing. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 09:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> By that standard any site that has humor, comics, etc is a rip off of something awful. By my Alexa bar, it was ranked 167,000 last month, and has experienced a traffic drop this month. Historically, it shows the traffic going up and down like this about every other month, so your current Alexa ranking isn't an accurate reflection of the site's popularity. And when you google the site title, yes it has one main entry. But if you google specific subjects that the site has covered, the articles are usually high up on the list. Several of its pieces are linked as external site links for many wikipedia entries, according to google. For example, if you google Dr. Phil, or "Dr. Phil Endorses the PSP" you find a fake Dr. Phil page the staff did a year ago that's not only linked all over the web, but apparently pulls in so much email from people actually believing it to be Dr. Phil's website that the staff get a mailbox full of Ask Dr. Phil emails every week asking for advice.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> It isn't about the inspiration of the site's content nor it's similarity to other websites; as far as I can see this website gets notable traffic and this wiki reads as an unbiased account of this website's history and purpose. It was interesting to find out more about how it came into being. This deserves inclusion just like any other high-traffic entertainment website (when written in a non-self serving way.)

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I am not sure what the issue is here. I have read the deletion policy and I believe that the page is compliant with all of the guidelines. It is an accurate wiki article. I believe that putting it up for deletion is rather childish, because I am of the opinion that the people who are wanting it gone are the same who have instigated disagreements with the website already and have personal and irrelevant reasons for wanting the wiki deleted.

<dd>The above user, Caitlin Des Rosier, is yet another first time editor. I put this up for AfD following standard procedures. Whilst I am not in a position to speak for any other users, I have only visited the site once when analyzing it for AfD. I used Alexa and Google to find potential relevancy and found none. This AfD, like most, isn't personal. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and therefore article subjects must have encyclopedic value which can be verified. This website is, thus far, not notable. That may change in the future, but for now it doesn't meet any of the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd>I may be a first time editor, but I've been familiar with Wikipedia for long enough to know that this entire argument is rather ridiculous. I will, for now, ignore the unnecessary name-calling which lends no credibility to your argument, but I would ask that it please stop. If it is possible, this discussion should be mature. As for defending the wiki that has my name attached to it - I find this to be a natural reaction and not one that should come as a surprise to anyone. To address the statement that we are all "self serving" - everything listed on Wikipedia is self serving in that it serves itself by providing history and facts and links that are available to the entire internet and therefore is promoted to a large audience. If this entry is to be deleted, than there must also be deletions for absolutely every other article in Wikipedia about an entertainment website or web comic, for one is every bit as relevant or irrelevant as another. I also ask - who are you to judge what does and does not have encyclopedic value? I believe that it has been adequately expressed that the website is linked all over the world and this shows that while the website is not interesting to you personally, there are people out there who ARE interested and might like to read about the history of the website as well as any other information included in the wiki. Caitlin Des Rosier 02:58, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have not called anyone names. The arguments aren't ridiculous as there are set standards (as I have pointed out numerous times) in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that this site just doesn't meet. If you want to argue that the standards should be changed, go for it...but this isn't the place for that. I never said the site isn't interesting or that it is bad. I have made no judgement about the content of the site or the creators, merely that the subject isn't encyclopedic under Wiki standards. No, I don't decide what is or isn't encyclopedic, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does. If all these people who create accounts just to vote <i>don't delete</i> were to take the time to prove some level of notability and verifiability, then this AfD would be over and the article would remain. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 03:13, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been to read the page you are citing as your reasons for wanting the wiki deleted and I still view the argument as ridiculous. If you had flagged the page to say it had missing information then this would be different, but you did not. So far I believe we've met all of the requirements and I do not appreciate the "sock puppet" reference. I know it must be a term used in Wikipedia a lot, but it is used on this page in a derogatory fashion that I am offended by. That is what I mean by name calling and I firmly expect it to stop immediately. Caitlin Des Rosier 03:23, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your problem with reading comprehension is becoming annoying, sir. I said the argument that you've posed is what I find ridiculous, and not the guidelines themselves. If you are going to suggest deletions and then also have a discussion to defend your reasons, please try to read, <b>understand</b>, and <i>then</i> respond. Doing otherwise shows disregard for your argument and tends to hurt rather than help. he fact that you believe the 7th level is not compliant with the guidelines after little to no research or effort to find the truth alerts me that you either don't know what you are doing or that you are what I have heard referred to as an "internet troll". I do not, sir, thrive on argument, and since you seem to be incapable of normal discussion, I am going to stop participating on this page. I believe that my point has been made - there is absolutely no valid reason for the deletion as we have filled every requirement. 67.161.252.42 09:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If nothing else, we meet the criteria number 3&#160;: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators..." because every reference to a movie in our website has been linked at imdb.com and one of the web-comics featured has received nominations for two awards on thebestsatireawards.com and if the current voting trend continues, he should win those awards without any competition.

<dd>I think the point she was trying to make was that IMDB.com links to every movie review their site puts up, especially reviews for movies which IMDB.com itself hasn't posted a review for. techinically, that is distribution of material from an independent website. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.125.55.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.125.55.219_d952.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.125.55.219">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
<dd>Number 3 states: <i>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>. IMDB is not a newspaper, magazine, broadcaster, nor publisher. It is a movie site that accepts information and links from any user. Therefore a link from IMDB placed by a 7th level user isn't the same as content distributed on a notable and independent source. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 20:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The game may be fan based, but it is a game none the less. Just because something is not famous does not make it un-noteworthy. If it has the need to have information gathered to those who seek it then let it be included. The reason an encyclopedia is there, is for people to look at it for reference and knowledge.

<li>First, calm down. Then - the question isn't why we think the game is not notable. A better question is, what makes the game notable? We don't have specific notability criteria for games (though <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> might apply in certain cases), but I personally believe a country- or worldwide release though a distributor could qualify, as would coverage by a notable game publication. And, of course, the fact that the game has to be either released or in the state that release readiness is merely a matter of polish. Does this game meet those guidelines? If so, I'll be glad to change my opinion. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:25, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Save</b> I know there have been a few here are angry at you guys for wanting this deleted. Well, I don't want you to think we are all immature 12 year olds. Rather than trying to defend why it should stay on here, I am going to take a different approach. Is there anything that we can do to save it? Is there any way we can improve upon it so that it won't be deleted? I am new to Wikipedia, as are mos of the people defending this article, so we don't know how to make a proper article, so any help would be appreciated.</li>

<dd>There is a bit of a POV-push going on here by proponents of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a> including adding {{<a href="../../../r/e/m/Template%7ERemote_Viewing_3c60.html" title="Template:Remote Viewing">Remote Viewing</a>}} to a couple of senior CIA figures despite remote viewing being of only peripheral importance to their careers (if any - theree is no reliable source which says it was), some remote viewers have been deleted, Remote Viewing Timeline is up for deletion, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a> itself has been grossly POV in the past. There are by my reckoning a bout 3,300 relevant ghits (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=fu1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22pat+price%22+%22remote+viewing%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hs=fu1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22pat+price%22+%22remote+viewing%22" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>) and I don't see any evidence of Pat Price having <i>written</i> any books - there is another Pat Price, active in the field of cancer research who is the likely author of <i>treatment of cancer</i> and of course all the Google Scholar hits on Pat Price as author. This Pat Price is mentioned in 20+ of the 1500-odd published papers on remote viewing in the Google Scholar database, but is not cited by any papers published in peer-reviewed journals as far as I could tell (chronological bias: he died in 1975). Overall, there is a notbale Pat Price, an oncologist, but this Pat Price does not appear to me to be considered significant other than by a few other devotees of remote viewing. <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingo_Swann_5078.html" title="Ingo Swann">Ingo Swann</a> is a notable RV crank, I don't think this guy is. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:52, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: So, this is not an article, it's a placeholder. And there are other similar, um, placeholders that make an organizational structure. IMHO this means that the whole idea of series on <i>every</i> railway station on this line is wrong, since there is nothing notable that can be said about most of them (only <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Central_railway_station_1f7f.html" title="Belfast Central railway station">Belfast Central railway station</a> has a decent stub). IMHO, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast-Londonderry_railway_line_c76b.html" title="Belfast-Londonderry railway line">their list</a> says it all; ie. it <i>lists the stations</i>. --<a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanm_5283.html" title="User:Romanm">romanm</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomanm_b12d.html" title="User talk:Romanm">talk</a>) 06:06, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As has been mentioned above this is simply one of a much larger collection of articles for all UK (GB and NI) railway stations which is nearing completion. Yes it doesn't have much on at the moment but if this were to be deleted purely for not having much content presently then there's literally hundreds of others in a similar state. Again repeating the above, this is at the moment more of a place holder upon which people can expand. I think that the problem is more than no one has yet taken the time to expand and include detailed information about the railways of Northern Ireland as is slowly happening with the system on Great Britain. Just check out some of the more than 1000 UK railway stations and plenty have been expanded to include useful facts about current services, locations, management, history etc. Just because this one hasn't been expanded yet doesn't mean that it won't be in future once someone with the right knowledge comes along. For the time-being all UK station articles are waiting for just that expansion, after all the 1 millionth Wiki article, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanhill_railway_station.html" title="Jordanhill railway station">Jordanhill railway station</a>, was about a UK railway station and that was expanded upon hugely once people were aware of it and researched information. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 17:44, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong speedy delete</b> First of all, this article can easily be speedily deleted because it <i>does not attempt to assert notability</i>, which is what CSD A7 if all about. It doesn't say that the band has been signed to a major label, or toured with anyone of import, or had a hit song, or anything of the sort. It just says, "This band exists and has two records. The end." Second, the article is almost certainly vanity, as it was created by User:Jp07, and JP just happen to be the initials of Jamison Parker. Third, Jp07 mentions on the article's talk page that one of Jamison Parker's songs is in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_suicide.html" title="List of songs about suicide">List of songs about suicide</a>. Aside from that meaning nothing to the importance/notability of the band, <i>Jp07 put the song on the list himself- after he made that comment on Jamison Parker's talk page.</i> But even aside from those final two points, what matters is that the article does not assert importance, and thus, there is no reason for it not to be speedily deleted. Sure, they're on AllMusic and they get a lot of Google hits, but those criteria are not the be all and end all- the content of the article is. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:57, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. No, I'm sorry. It is just poorly written--I'm trying! I wrote my first <b>original</b> article last night at about midnight--I was tired and didn't have a lot of time to devote to it, but I plan to expand it shortly. In order to defend the "vanity case," this is not even the first article I have edited/composed, if you check my history I also edited the Mario series enemies page. My initials just so happen to be JP as well, but I did not take this into consideration until it was mentioned, I suppose. They just happen to be one of my favorite bands, and I live in Kansas--check my IP address if you want--and they are based in California. So obviously they have a significant influence. And about the suicide songs page--I edited the link ONLY so that it actually pointed to an article now. The mentioning of "Slow Suicide" was already on that page. --Jp07 20:06, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. I would clean it up myself except I have to go to work. They have a detailed Allmusic.com article which indicates that at least one of the two records was an album released on Interscope in 2005. Their Allmusic.com bio then mentions that they supported that album with a tour. Having a national tour, an album and EP released on a major label and a biography on Allmusic.com a verifiable source according to our guidelines qualifies them under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for mine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:09, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was a 10-day festival in London in 1999 promoted by the <b>Association of Autonomous Astronauts</b>; amazingly, their web site is still active <a href="http://www.deepdisc.com/space1999/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deepdisc.com/space1999/" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. The article focuses heavily on protests against the militarization of space and mentions a lot of irrelevant companies but the festival web site barely mentions these activities. I found one article via Lexis/Nexis describing the event, "Take me to your loonies" from <i>The Evening Standard.</i> At the risk of committing recentism, <b>delete</b> as non-notable event. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thatcher131_e41f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thatcher131">contribs</a>).</small> Dang, sorry. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, it occurred no doubt, and garnered one newspaper article that I can find, making it verifiable. The article does note that the Association of Autonomous Astronauts was an "international network founded four years ago in a Brixton squat and dedicated to the intriguing concept of 'independent, community-based space exploration'," and that while NASA is "all about getting up there, doing 17-hour shifts, lots of experiments and then coming home. We have always said we want to play football, have sex and hold raves." The attendance was described as in the "hundreds."

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have trouble keeping articles that omit information that is discussed in an AfD nomination. For now, <b>rewrite</b> and then revisit.

<li>This article is on a very popular Dallas radio figure. One source is the blog of the person in question. The other is his official radio show website. And one about the radio station which yes, apparently indeed, does employ the man. Let's hope that somebody whose spelling of words like "rumor" would strongly indicate that he lives nowhere near Dallas, TX, wouldn't be so arrogant as to think that simply because he's never heard of this man in his infinitely small section of the universe, that obviously in his mind Bob Sturm is not Wikipedia worthy. Could the article use a little retouching? Perhaps. But let's look at new articles with an open mind, not a "delete first, ask questions later" policy. - Monosylab1k (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonosylab1k_5b4b.html" title="User talk:Monosylab1k">talk)</a> 21:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was that it is broken beyond repair. While it's clear that the refactoring was done in good faith, it is directly contra-indicated by <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> for things to be sorted into categories. Further, I've never even <i>seen</i> an instance where someone so misunderstood the purpose of these discussions as to <b>number</b> the arguments. These are deletion discussions, we are not voting here. In many cases, the numbers are meaningless, and may in fact <i>distort</i> the process. For example, here several accounts whose status is fairly dubious have made recomendations. A late comer, following the advice on the main AfD page to <i>not</i> take part when consensus appears to have formed could be misled by the raw "count" and choose to remain silent. For this reason this debate is closed, without prejudice to being re-opened at any time. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman</a><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></span> 03:56, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, while it would have been better for another user to have been the initial author, that is not a requirement. Notability and NPOV are requirements. WP:WEB includes as criteria #3 "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Google news is certainly well known and independent of the creator. I didn't find in my review proof that they were picked up by Google News, but this news.google.com/news?as_q=Israel&amp;svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nsrc=Israel+News+Agency&amp;as_nloc=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=23&amp;as_minm=4&amp;as_maxd=23&amp;as_maxm=5 search for articles from them shows that they are picked up. 02:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/b/User_talk%7EGRBerry_d7ba.html" title="User talk:GRBerry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GRBerry_c9d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GRBerry">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If we are to judge notability by deeds, being the first Israeli government accredited source of online news in 1995 speaks volumes. To judge by association the hundreds of international media organizations and blogs using the Israel News Agencys materials is substantial. To judge by impact using Alexa.com and Google web / Google news reaching millions world wide the INA appears more than notable on all three accounts.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 06:18, 25 May 2006 (UTC)<small><b>Comment:</b>This is user's 6th edit to Wikipedia</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> 1. Not sure how objective Woggly can be in this discussion given her and Israelbeach's RfC on one another. 2. A scanned press card or copy thereof is proof of accreditation, as I am also a working journalist in Israel who carries a GPO press card. 3. Not reasonable to request that anyone publishes their passport and or ID numbers on the Internet. Card looks good to me. If in doubt, speak with Danny Seaman, director of the Government Press Office in Jerusalem. 4. Do not ask of others what you would not do yourself. Leyden aka Israelbeach has been honest and transparent in his identity. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotterseesall_25f6.html" title="User:Potterseesall">Potterseesall</a> 20:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't expect anyone to put their passport or ID numbers online, and I wasn't asking for that. I was just pointing out that scanning the card is pointless, and proves nothing. Good proof of accreditation would be a link to a government list of accredited news sources (or indeed, any source that is not simply repeating information from the INA). As for my objectivity, please stop hinting that I may possibly be unreliable. If I have written anything that is not true, come out and say so directly so that I can address your objections point by point. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 21:28, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but clean up and include coverage of criticisms. The article has generated a great deal of attention but most of the negative comments reinforce my inclination to keep it. It appears to meet minimum standards for inclusion. The article could use some good coverage about disputes regarding the agency's origins, affiliations, reliability, etc.. I would hope that the WP community is able to include such criticism without it turning into mere rants or name-calling.

<li><b>Keep</b> but it needs editing. Cut down on the puffery that's sourced only to the site itself; add the fact of the Alexa ranking to help readers judge the agency's importance.

<li>Being listed on Google News is not very difficult and probably not enough to make something "notable" by our standards. The Alexa ranking is low and there are few unique Google hits. No reliable sources are presented for the information in the article. Currently it seems to me that the article doesn't qualify for inclusion, but I'm willing to be convinced if evidence to the contrary is presented. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 21:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How is notability being measured in this case? Are we applying <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or another standard? Þorgeirsson states that getting listed on Google News is a rather trivial task; how does one accomplish this? For the moment, I am leaning toward <b>keep</b> due to its frequent citation by the press, but am open to discussion. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 00:38, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Just for the record, with regard to issues discussed in the previous AfD, the Israel News Agency is not a government-controlled press agency in Israel, just a private entity, and it is not even the leading press agency in Israel -- that would be Itim which Wikipedia doesn't yet have an article about. The Israel News Agency appears to be a relatively small operation although the Google News connection should be considered a point in its favor. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:22, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The fact that Israel News Agency comes up ranked highly in Google searches might be more significant if its publisher were not a professional search engine optimizer. www.israelnewsagency.com/joelleyden.html Also, I don't know whether Alexa.com is evidence of INA having significant impact, given that INA's Alexa rank is 251,401. --Metropolitan90 13:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I draw people's attention to all pages which refer to Joel Leyden where <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> at every twist and turn attempts to discredit Leyden, following in the footsteps of user Woggly. We can also conclude that <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> is a sockpuppet of Woggly and or Danny Wool. Bonnieisrael is transparent. She has revealed her personal details both here in Wikipedia and on Goggle News. Furthermore, she has made direct contact with Danny Wool after being blocked and unblocked by Danny after personal contact. We can suspect anyone of anything. What we must do is deal in fact. Is the Israel News Agency "notable"? One vote was already taken a few months ago with the community saying Keep.

<li><b>Comment</b>:For any readers of this debate, please be aware that the opinions of anonymous users and users with very little edits during deletion debates are almost always disregarded unless a very valid point is made. This policy exists for two very valid reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, participants of a deletion debate think it is a vote and so try to gather all of their friends and aquaintences in order to try to influence the debate's result. The outcome of a deletion debate is determined by the opinions of whoever shows up, and so whoever engaged in this practice would be negatively affecting the practice. Secondly, users with very few edits may be accounts of users that have already had their say, trying to make their opinion sound more prevalent than it really is.</p>
<p>For this reason, the opinion of 71.102.46.200 will most certainly be disregarded. It is likely that user is "trolling," trying to evoke reactions and emotions among those that are sensitive to certain issues, and revelling in the chaos that results. Please do not see the actions of one anonymous user as being equivocal of the sentiment of the entire Wikipedian community.</p>
<p>The ban on legal threats on Wikipedia exists for a very good reason as well. During a deletion debate on a famed potter, and an author of scholarly research on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>, the grandson of the subject of the article up for deletion came and reported that he would sue another user for libel, for saying that his grandfather "wasn't notable enough to be in Wikipedia." Lawsuits used as threats in these situations may make other users feel uneasy and inhibit honest, open debate.</p>
<p>As a result of the ban of Israelbeach, assumedly for legal threats, it seems that the user tried to evade the ban and post as another user, in order to still have a voice. While I can see reason behind this, it is still a violation of official Wikipedia policy. Please try to understand actions of administrators blocked you, Israelbeach, if for that reason. I have limited knowledge of discussion that led to the ban, because it appears to me that the user page and the user talk page of their content.</p>
<p>The people that want this article to be deleted aren't anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. They are using Alexa as the standard for a website's notability, but this may be inaccurate because the rating of a site on Alexa is entirely dependant on how many people viewing that website have downloaded an Alexa toolbar, which may have less prevalence in Israel. Maybe the website has a higher viewership in its Hebrew edition. If I wanted to speak my mind with a user account---I really don't feel like getting involved in "wikipolitics"---I'd vote to keep this article, and the article on Joel Leyden.</p>
<p>As for WP:OFFICE, and an example of United States censorship that may be affecting Wikipedia, if one article had information about two author publishing untrue allegations against a subject, this may be considered republishing libel in California and Europe, and so Wikipedia would have to take that article and its entire edit history down to prevent legal action, even if the information that those allegations were made was in itself true.</p>
<p>No matter where Wikipedia's servers are, there may be statutes prohibiting its free expression. If they were based in Canada, Wikimedia could not legally publish election results before elections are over. Canadians were advised when reading the article on their parliamentary elections that reading this article may not be legal in their country. You may have heard that Wikimedia was sued in Germany for containing the first and last name of a child inventor and hacker that had developed a voice-encrypted public phone. Luckily it had won that lawsuit.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that the Japanese Wikipedia complies with both statutes in the United States of America, where the servers are hosted, and in Japan, where most of their userbase is. They cannot publish personal information about certain figures in the national media that would be considered public figures in the United States. A Japanese teenager decided to go to Iraq---to see "what was happening over there"---and he was beheaded in a video released by his kidnappers. The English Wikipedia on him has his first and last name. The Japanese Wikipedia article's title, as I remember it, translated as something like "17 year old Japanese death in Iraq." That could be censorship right there, and in all of these cases, it is not Wikipedia's fault. I hope Joel Leyden can come to an understand the position of the management of Wikipedia and their viewpoint. 65.244.171.35 02:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In response to: <i>Maybe the website has a higher viewership in its Hebrew edition.</i> I'd like to point out that the website <b>does not have</b> a Hebrew edition. I have worked as a journalist in Israel and never heard of this website before encountering it here, nor has my husband who is a news-junkie and regularly checks some offbeat alternative news-sources as well as monitoring the mainstream press. It does not have an entry on the Hebrew wikipedia. And the few "articles" I have read have either been copied from other sources, or rather poorly written (poor style, poor spelling, repetition, faulty logic). Joel Leyden, the so called editor in chief, is also the main writer, and often also the subject of his own articles. He often quotes his own articles to support himself. He reports to no one but himself. I consider this terrible journalism. You don't have to take my word on any of this: browse and see for yourself. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 14:23, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Please also take note of Wikipedia's policy on original research and autobiographies. When someone creates an article on himself or something he is personally affiliated with, bias may unconsciously seep into the article's content. If not, unconfirmed knowledge may slip into the article's content, such as the subject's birth year. Because the subject's birth year was only known to the author of the subject before it was put into the Wikipedia article, it can't be cross-checked against any other independent media publication. Because of tendencies such as these, Wikipedia takes a special approach to pages where editors may be personally involved. Also, sometimes subjects may overestimate their notability---not at all that I think that's the case here. Regardless, it may lead to dispute, controversy, accusations of creating a "vanity page," and all-out nuclear edit war. Please understand that sometimes it is better to let things on Wikipedia arise as they naturally do, and let them be created on their own. 65.244.171.35 02:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This quote came from an Israel News Agency article by Joel Leyden: "So now I was intrigued to see how Wikipedia would respond to a page on the Israel News Agency and on myself. I expected trouble. And I was dead right. Why would an open public miss a chance to throw a stone at an Israeli let alone a news site coming from Israel." Your attitude was unnecessarily pessimistic, and the problems that came after you first created this article, Israelbeach, might have been prevented if you had come across <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> earlier. Thanks for trying, anyway, hope this long droning message has softened up any hard feelings, and so long. 65.244.171.35 03:19, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> For any of you who may still be wondering about the INA's status as a primary news source, here is a brief overview of the ten most recent releases on the INA's site:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipediacensorshipisraelnews480527.html Wikipedia Attempts To Censor Israel News - Again an editorial authored by Joel Leyden, about the current AfD. Entire passages lifted verbatim from Wikitruth, The Village Voice, and other critics of Wikipedia.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/jerusalemdayisraelolmert48480525.html Olmert Addresses Jerusalem Day supposedly "By Israel News Agency Staff... communicated to the Israel News Agency by the Israel Government Press Office". In fact communicated to the whole world on Prime Minister's official website:www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechjeru250506.htm Prime Minister Speech at the Jerusalem Day Ceremony at Ammunition Hill</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/shimonperesisrael480525.html Israel Peres Meets French Minister for Regional Development Estrosi the news part is quoted verbatim from a government press release:www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2006/Vice+PM+Peres+meets+with+French+Minister+for+Regional+Development+Estrosi+24-May-2006.htm Vice PM Peres meets with French Minister for Regional Development Estrosi. The only unique contribution of the INA are biographical details about <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimon_Peres_8663.html" title="Shimon Peres">Shimon Peres</a>, which can be found anywhere.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/israelolmertcongress48480524.html Israel's PM Olmert Addresses US Congress this is labelled: "Special to the Israel News Agency". Again, lifted verbatim from the Prime Minister's site: www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechcong240506.htm Address by PM Olmert to Joint meeting of US Congress</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/palestinechildterrorismisrael88480521.html Israel Tears For Palestine Child byline is "by Joel Leyden". It is, at best, an editorial and not a news story. I believe the general tone and style to be representative of Leyden. Also note that the INA website makes no disticntion between news stories and editorials in general.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/israelknessetchristianallies4890521.html Israel Knesset Christian Allies to Present KCAC Women’s Council not a verbatim lift as far as I can see, but compare to a press-release issued two days earlier by the Israeli Parliament for this rather minor event: www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=29349 Knesset Christian Allies Caucus to Present Newly Created Women's Council</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipediacensorshipchinalahav.html Wikipedia - The Weakest Link an editorial "by Debbie Lahav", who identifies herself as <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonnieisrael_553e.html" title="User:Bonnieisrael">user:Bonnieisrael</a>.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/chinaisraelolmert660516.html Israel Olmert Meets China Provincial Official this is another PM press release: www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/EventsDiary/eventchina160506.htm PM Olmert Meets Chinese Provincial Official tacked on to another Government press release: www.export.gov.il/Eng/_Articles/Article.asp?ArticleID=3129&amp;CategoryID=457 Telecommunications delegation to China</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/jasonalsteradhdvideo440516.html ADHD - Alster Produces New Therapy Program Video "by Keren Goldberg". This may be original, but it is hardly news: it is advertisement, plain and simple.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/israeldefenseforcesnavyterrorism480516.html Israel Defense Forces Navy Patrol Seizes Terrorist Explosives lifted from a Foreign Office press release: www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terrorism+and+Islamic+Fundamentalism-/IDF+Naval+craft+seized+several+hundred+kg+of+explosives+14-May-2006.htm IDF Naval craft seized several hundred kg of explosives. The INA did not bother changing the wording from "today" to "two days ago".</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Thank you for taking the time and effort to post the above links. You have just illustrated beyond any doubt that the Israel News Agency is a news agency with major impact. As all news agencies i.e. - AP, Reuters, AFP, the INA collects and then disseminates information - both original and copied. That's the purpose of news agencies. AP and Reuters carry advanced copies of speeches and events provided to them by the public affairs' offices of corporate and political world leaders every day. As the Israel Government Press Office does not have its own Web site (PM site is not the same - ask Danny Seaman, director of the GPO in Jerusalem) the INA also serves as a clearinghouse for news from Israel's various ministries. And does so without profit! From I have seen, the INA has published several hundred news stories over the last 11 years. Including several exclusives such as [Al-Qaeda&#160;: The 39 Principles of Holy War www.israelnewsagency.com/Al-Qaeda.html]. The Israel News Agency has proved "notable" to millions of readers worldwide, to me, the Israeli government and to ... Google News. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 14:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In case anybody missed it, I've transwiki'd the page to Wikiquote. This essentially "keeps" the material, but in the more appropriate place, namely, at the project specifically set aside for collections of quotations. It would seem repetitious to keep the page in Wikipedia. Do we really need it in both places? For pages that reference this quotation collection, instead of a link to a WP article like this: <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies_%28excerpts%29_f947.html" title="On the Jews and Their Lies (excerpts)">On the Jews and Their Lies (excerpts)</a>, one would put in the WQ template like this:</li>

<p>Beno, can I suggest a little more compassion and help to new authors. I understand the need to help keep Wikipedia a good source of information. I could have come to the same conclusion about the state of my articles without the negative feedback. I don't see how your negativity helps build a community (see Talk:Mike_Teppenpaw). Give a listen to the next show when we talk about Xmen. We will be sure to include a little commentary about this experience near the end of the show.</p>

<p>ya to tell everyone what its all about and why is was created. Im not telling anyone to watch the shows am i. It says no where in the article to watch the show, it just that its coming out. im not advertising anything im just simply telling people what uVw is and about their past.</p>
<p>If you go here and look at some proof then maybe you will realize that this is not "a crystal ball"... <a href="http://cawunderground.com/index.php?showtopic=8951" class="external free" title="http://cawunderground.com/index.php?showtopic=8951" rel="nofollow">http://cawunderground.com/index.php?showtopic=8951</a> ...if you dont beleive that then, seriously what else do you want me to do, send you the stuff? as i said before its a work in progress so obviously you are going to have to wait till im done the show. Im not gonna stop everything and post what i got just becuase you want me to (not trying to be rude or anything. And i started the article because uVw has had enough history for this. Not to mention i will soon be posting it on CAW Underground so they will all come here and see what uVw is all about.</p>
<p>and about that propaganda garbage...seriously...thats a joke if you think im trying to advertise something...nothing is being advertised, its just telling whats going to happen or what happened at the show.</p>
<p>i would also like to add that even if it is "non notable" that does not mean that it should be deleted. So what if not many people know of uVw yet. This article was created to further the word of uVw, not to show how big and cool my fake wrestling league is.
