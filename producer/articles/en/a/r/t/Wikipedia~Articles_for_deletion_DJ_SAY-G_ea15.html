<p>This article claims that the subject is an internationally known DJ who plays in Europe and North America. One would think that such a high-profile DJ would have some sort of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> talking about him. Well, a search came up with a total of 260 Google hits, only 18 of which showed outside of the "similar articles" selection. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22DJ+Say-G%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22DJ+Say-G%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> These articles are MySpace pages, the artist's websites, and listings of DJs, as well as a couple of articles in (apparently) German that don't seem to be of substance. Thus, I feel that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> is lacking for this article. Looking at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, about the only guideline that might be met would be the appearances in North America and Europe - but again, there are no reliable sources that I've managed to turn up referring to them. So, again, I don't believe the artist meets the guidelines at all, despite the claims of notability in the article itself. Finally, the editor who has done most of the work on this article is Most Wanted Club - which happens to be the name of the subject's business. Thus I smell an advertisement attempt, and at very least a failure of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a> guidelines. <b>Delete</b> unless someone can magic up some sources proving anything in it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 04:01, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

"This article claims that the subject is an internationally known DJ who plays in Europe and North America."</p>
<p>THE ARTICLE DOES NOT CLAIM THIS&#160;!!! The only point the article refers to is that DJ SAY-G is booked in several countries. This does not mean that he (or whoever worte this text) claims to be internationally FAMOUS or KNOWN all over.</p>
<p>" 260 Google"</p>
<p>My research resulted in more results. However, this again does not deny any fact of the text given. As long as I understand the text, there is no phrase saying DJ SAY-G rules the Google Hits, nore doe sit represent his networking among international club promoters.</p>
<p>"appearances in North America and Europe - but again, there are no reliable sources that I've managed to turn up referring to them"</p>
<p>I don't know the company, but I think you can request a list of club references from Most Wanted Club Ent. with RELIABLE sources, such as telephone numbers to call and ask...</p>
<p>"User Name"</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; this really lacks proof...anybody can choose any name to edit&#160;!!! Imagine you were a representative of the company and somebody judges you because of somebody chose your name.</p>
<p>" Thus I smell an advertisement attempt"</p>
<p>I don't see any advertisement attempt. It is an infomative text.</p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, IT'S A OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO&#160;!!!</p>
<p>NO NEED TO DELETE&#160;!!!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The bottom line here is that there's no proof anywhere that we're being informed about a notable individual as against someone who'd <i>like</i> to be notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - oh, and for the record a randomly-selected sample of the German sources don't add anything much to what we're dealing with here, so we don't seem to be dealing with someone astronomically famous in the non-Aglophone world but totally unknown within it (just in case anyone's worried). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 05:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<b>I coincidentially read this page:</b> Are you people, who are critisizing really into Hip Hop? Do you really know the industry? Be conscious...go ask yourself if you are a person, who really knows the DJ industry or a person who is good in Google-research? If so, go delete every DJ here, who has less than 500 Google entries (or you as an expert should tell the number)...</p>
<p>"not to be dealing with someone astronomically famous" &gt;&gt;&gt; If so, go delete the 10 % of Wikipedia people&#160;!!!</p>
<p>I agree: there is nothing wrong with the text. <b>NO DELETION&#160;!</b></p>

<li>In response to the IP (over and above Tony Fox's suggestion), a couple of minor points. It sounds from your comments that you believe that Wikipedia exists to document each and every DJ in the world. We don't. We exist to document each and every DJ (or singer, ski jumper, politician, doctor etc etc) who is actually notable. There is no indication on this DJ's article or on Google that he is in fact notable. If there are other DJs listed on Wikipedia who are not notable, then they stand a high chance of being deleted as well - the fact that they're here at the moment doesn't mean that they should be, it just means that nobody's put them up for deletion yet. What I said about "dealing with someone astronomically famous" was because of the fact that some of the pages which Google threw up as results were in German. Therefore, one might wonder if DJ SAY-G was perhaps very famous in Germany but not in the rest of the world (yes, this does happen every now and then, someone very famous in one country is nominated for deletion because he/she doesn't appear famous to someone in another country). However, because I speak German, I was able to read the pages in German and determine that not only is he not notable in English, neither is he notable in German. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

A DJ, of all people, who doesn't show up on Google a mere 500 times—a weekend DJ I went out with once three years ago has 860 hits, and she's NN—should be deleted. Wikipedia is not a place for people to achieve notability. Comments along the lines of "ask him, ask his agent" miss the point.
