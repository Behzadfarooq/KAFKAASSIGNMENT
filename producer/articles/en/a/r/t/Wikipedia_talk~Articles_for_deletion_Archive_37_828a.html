<p>and that article ends up being kept, the nominator should incur some consequence. something like no more nominations for a week or no more nominating a certain type of article or seomthing.

I guess prosecuters can still prosecute after they lose cases. but the defendant gets something- a settlement, his name cleared, lawyers fees at least. some afD nom's are annoying. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR"><font color="green">k</font></a><a href="../../../k/z/z/User%7EKzzl_8d54.html" title="User:Kzzl">zz</a>* 17:05, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Welcome to one of the irritations of Wikipedia. Most of us know the frustration of starting an article that we think is interesting or important only to have some (what we feel to be) officious f__l decide that it isn’t encyclopedic and is worthy of an AfD nomination. We can all agree that the Wiki standards for what should be kept are seriously variegated; my current pet peeve is that almost any <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-world.html" title="First-world">first-world</a> company warrants retention, but I’ve seen a number of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_world.html" title="Second world">second-world</a> companies dismissed out of hand. I really question some of our AfD standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there are certainly some articles that deserve to be culled. And I’m unwilling to be one of those folks who sorts through all the new articles to find the occasional crap. So I’m not enthusiastic about discouraging those folks who will do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I had an article nominated as an AfD, I made myself a few guidelines:
<ul>
<li>When I add a new article, I think carefully about how to present it to give in the maximum encyclopedic weight. Just a word or two can make a difference.</li>
<li>I craft the new article in my <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">sandbox</a> to make sure it looks pretty good and reads smoothly before I move it onto its new page.</li>
<li>I try to make it several paragraphs long (the more substance the better).</li>
<li>I find a category for it (lack of categories tends to trigger AfD sweeps).</li>
<li>And if I know someone with a similar interest, I recruit them to help add material as soon as it is posted. Articles that have multiple interested folk are less likely to be targeted as AfD.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Watch the AfD page. Look for articles on the AfD page that you think need support and are getting an unbalanced hearing. Support their retention if you think they should be retained.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if someone repeat nominates a page after it has survived one AfD nomination, remember that repeated attempts to have an article deleted for non-policy reasons may sometimes be considered abuse of process and/or <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">disruptive</a>, and the article may be <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">speedy kept</a></i>. Contact an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">administrator</a> for an opinion whether this warrants a speedy keep decision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Probably not what you wanted to hear, and I’m sure there are others who will support your view (a year ago I would have) but at Wikipedia we are nothing if not tied up in an incredible pile of consensus based Wiki-policy based on years of fighting through exactly the same arguments again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again... Not as immediately satisfying as we'd like. Sort of like democracy, not a very good form of government, but better than anything else out there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I’ll post to your talk page as well. Hit me at [User talk:Williamborg|home]] if you want to talk more. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 17:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I see two problems with this.</li>
</ul>
<p>One is that AFD's are supposed to be controversial; non-controversial should be speedy or prod. The idea is that if you put something up, and it doesn't get deleted, you're supposed to accept it and move on. Punishing people would break this.</p>
<p>The other is that articles may be nominated mostly because the content is terrible, and doesn't assert notability, but someone responds to the AFD by completely rewriting the article. Personally, I wouldn't consider that a failure; if I nominate something because the content it that bad, and the bad content is removed, it doesn't much matter whether the article is deleted.</p>
<p>I could see some kind of AFD block for obvious abuse, but not a good faith block for good faith edits. I also think that if we put too many roadblocks in the deletion process, Wikipedia will naturally evolve into another myspace; a few spurious nominations seem like a small price to pay to prevent that. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Sanbeg</a> 14:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think that there should necessarily be a penalty for a delete nomination that winds up in a keep. However, if the nominator is acting apparently in bad faith, the nominator can and should be penalized. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The rules state that unless an article fits the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a>, it should be listed here for 5 days after which an editor looks if concensus has been reached and takes appropriate action (<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>).

<p><br />
As I have also stated yesterday in response to this last closure, Speedy Deletion is a powerful tool here on Wikipedia, but should be used with caution. The criteria for speedy deletion are strict, for a reason. In case an article has been AfD tagged and is not an obvious speedy candidate, I think it is important that the AfD rules are followed correctly. Otherwise a dangerous precedent might be set for the deletion of articles that are <i>unwanted</i> in the view of a specific administrator. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 07:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have noticed that some AfDs are closed on the same day they are posted (or the day after) when they have received a fair amount of participation, especially when everyone (or almost everyone) recommends that the article be deleted. Since the nominations received participation, the admins involved may not see them as speedy deletions, just speedy closures. This seems to be what happened in the first two nominations, although the first one might be cutting it close with only 6 participants and lasting only 8.55 hours. I do not think this should be done, except in extreme cases (like when over 25 or 30 people have participated and it's becoming disruptive). I think that they should be left for five days so that there is a greater chance that people knowledgeable about the subject will see it and that any missing information relevant to the nomination will be found. As for the last nomination, I agree that the two versions are very different. However, if a much better version was deleted recently through AfD, it would make sense, to me, to delete the current version as well. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For the record, I do understand the reasons for deletion and agree with the deletion in these cases, it is just that interpreting the deletion rules liberally is something that should not be done easily in my opinion. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 09:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>About the Counter-Strike one, the old AfD'ed article was about the very same subject and included more information. If that copy was deleted, then this one would be even more likely to be deleted, and every single person at the current AfD agrees. It is a waste of everyone's time to restore it and post another AfD. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 09:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with that, but no time would have been wasted if the AfD rules had been followed from the start. I've seen this happen more often now and this particular AfD just happened to be one that I choose to pick to discuss this matter. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 09:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If an action is done by mistake or due to a different interpretation, when undoing it is moot (it's going to be deleted no matter what), then I don't see why you don't let it be. If there are so many of these early closures, then you should instead contest some that you actually think should be kept. If there aren't any, that indicates that the written policies don't reflect reasonable, actual practice, and need revision. That is, you could instead spend time getting things undeleted that actually should be undeleted or to correct the policies. About recreated AfD material, the question to ask is, "Would this new version have been deleted had it been the version at the original AfD?", "Is the speedy criterion really intended to allow unlimited recreation of articles on the same subject so long as they delete or add or rewrite a paragraph here or there?". —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 09:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>

With regard do the other two I cannot tell if I wanted them to stay, since I have not been given the opportunity to look at them because they were closed so quickly (the reason I still endorse their deletion is because I trust the other editors and do not want to make an issue of more than one deletion at this time). With regard to the time spent on these issues, I see no harm in spending time on situations were I feel that the rules have not been followed even though I agree with the results.

<li>My apologies for the early closure on that AfD, it was done accidentally. What I was actually doing is that I was closing the first 50 AfDs that I have relisted the night before. Only now having a look at it again, I realised that the nominator has placed this particular AfD at the <i>top</i> of the list (rather than the bottom), which I have unwittingly closed it thinking that it was among the 50 of the relisted. It is not my intention to close AfDs way earlier than the 120 hours' grace. If you like to have that AfD re-opened, feel free to let me know on my talkpage and I'll do so. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 09:33, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What's the feeling on what constitutes an "unambiguous keep decision" when a non-admin is closing an AfD?

Without commiting the vote-counting sin, is a single "delete" comment enough to call the debate "unambiguous" in the face of numerous good keep arguments?

Maybe they could all be merged into one article, and the actual text brought to wikisource or something like that. Then I thought that the last two hymns could possibly be merged with their parent hymn articles. As you can see, I have no idea what to do, if anything should be done.

<dd>Hmmm... Ok, I'll be less <i>nice</i> about it and come right to the point. There are several parts to an XfD, in order of importance: Beginning with facts finding, then policy interpretation, then editor's opinion. If a discussion comes down to a decision based on "opinon" like this, and those opining keep are mostly known to be highly active XfD contributors who diverge widely from the norm with regards to thier stance on inclusion, what to do? We're in some way doing sampling to determine "community consensus" and this is a biased sample. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 08:48, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The point is that some editors apparently disregard all stated WP policy in their afd considerations and nominations. I presume we're supposed to be working from WP guidelines and policies for a reason, in this context to give rationality and sense to the afd process with a presumed level-playing field of known and stated policies to follow. I am therefore aghast when people nominate for delete or keep with rationalizations like, "Not interesting" or "Possibly useful". My two cents is that afd discussions and considerations should therefore take attention of nominations and issues relating to the relevant policies and guidelines.

<dd>For times like these I thought admins just userfied the article for the new users? That and kindly reminding them, or making them away of sandbox. I just had an article I created proded, and is now on AfD. When I started the article out, I had the cat's, sections, main articles, references, expand tag, and a few items with citations. In my opinion, the prod to AfD process gives the creator/editor/contributor enough time to source the article, expand, and make it worth saving. This is somewhere around 10 days if you dont remove the prod tag, and about 5 days as long as the article shows some signs of notability. For these reasons I wouldnt care for a criteria, since in most cases, the contributor is lazy and wont work on the article anymore, or the article really isnt worth saving. I agree in most cases people jump the gun and go striaght for AfD. This is the real issue I think. Not saving worthless articles because they dont qualify for speedy. I mean, everday, about 100 to 150 articles on AfD are not speedy-able.

<dd>This suggestion would make the job of new pages patrollers massively more difficult, essentially making AfD unavailable to them entirely. It is also a solution searching for a problem; the five days it takes to go through AfD already serves as all the "incubation period" that an article needs. Arguing that we should wait x <i>hours</i> when they're already going to get five days is silly. Also, I'm puzzled by your statement that "I haven't started several articles on my to-do list just because I don't have the consecutive hours to do a proper stub that will prevent deletion." That is what stub notices are <i>for</i>. When dealing with topics that are clearly encyclopedic, a few sentences and a stub tag should suffice; for less clear ones, your stub might need a short paragraph or so and an external link or two to help people evaluate the topic... such stubs generally only show up on AfD when the nominator asserts that the <i>topic</i> is unencyclopedic, which is not normally something that can be fixed through expansion. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 20:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I feel strongly that the original statement concerning notability being a "good argument" is inaccurate and creates an unfair bias in promulgating one side of the conflict as a "guideline" when the matter is not settled at all.</p>
<p>My edits were reverted; I'm restoring them with modifications to try to present a more neutral and balanced view. (Upon review, I found my original edits weren't very neutral, either.) The original text, my edit, and my addition are below. I'd like to see this language or other balanced language remain, rather than returning to language that, though many may wish otherwise, is not factual.</p>
<p>The original:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good arguments for deletion are: "unverifiable" (violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), "original research" (violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), "unencyclopedic" (violates <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>), and "non-notable" (for example, for a person, does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). The argument "non-neutral point of view" (violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) is often used, but often such articles can be salvaged, so this is not a very strong reason for deletion.</li>

</ul>
<p>Addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is disagreement among editors as to whether describing an article as "non-notable" is a good argument for deletion. While there are guidelines on notability for many different topics (they're listed in the "Centralized discussion" box above), notability itself is not a policy and is a contentious topic for some editors. Sometimes using notability as an argument for deletion may turn the discussion about the article into a discussion about what constitues notability, a discussion to be found in abundance elsewhere (see <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-notability_3841.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-notability">Wikipedia:Non-notability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ENon-notability_fdb7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Non-notability">Wikipedia talk:Non-notability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia talk:Notability</a>).</li>

<p>My edit does not "encourage editors to ignore notability", I don't know if you read my comment above or not. Like it or not, notability <i>isn't</i> a policy; my edit is more accurate than saying that notability is a good argument for deletion—that is not a unanimous viewpoint. I specifically asked that the original, language not be restored as it is not factual. I'm not married to my edit, I would like to see balanced langague; however, I doubt that there will be any discussion now that you've reverted the change, however.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 03:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't a policy; it is a guideline, and one followed by the majority of editors.

It is extremely rare to ever see anyone argue that notability is not an issue; there is contention on the level of notability which should be required. You would like to see notability de-emphasized in the instructions. I haven't seen you gather support from others for the change.

<p>You're right—it isn't a policy, it's a guideline. However, it's cited in the same sentence with policies with no mention of it not being a policy; the effect (whether the intent or not) is that it is presented as another policy.

<dd>The problem is that your proposal implies that non-notability should be avoided as an argument for deletion. The status quo is undesirable, but your proposal omits the fact that notability is an acceptable reason to keep or delete an article.

<dd><i>(Chidom will have read some of the following already, as it's an edited version of what I said at my talk page)</i> The argument that 'non-notability' isn't a good reason to argue for deletion is on the fringes. It encompasses a natural conclusion of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (which we can't maintain if people are allowed to create articles only they are interested in) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, numerous widely-accepted guidelines plus, IIRC, Jimbo's own views on the subject (unfortunately I forget where the relevant mailing list posts are quoted). Editors reading this page aren't looking for the ins and outs of the various debates surrounding deletion - they want to know how to participate. Telling them that 'non-notability' may be used to justify deletion does that - telling them that some dispute it just creates unnecessary confusion. Anyone who wants to know about the arguments surrounding notability will find them at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia talk:Notability</a> and other forums. We should avoid the temptation to try and tell people everything that they could conceivably find useful at some point, as they'll think 'tl;dr' and not read <i>any</i> of it.

If notability is a guideline "followed by the majority of editors", that doesn't necessarily make it acceptable. If it is a "common viewpoint", with only a "tiny minority" opposing it, the minority still exists. The argument against notability may be "on the fringes", but that doesn't mean it's an invalid argument.</p>
<p>There was a time when the vast majority of people thought the earth was flat and that the sun revolved around the earth. Despite the majority opinion, it just wasn't so. One of the nice things about Wikipedia is that we can talk about differences without (hopefully) fear of being burned at the stake for heresy.</p>
<p>Nothing in my language says "that non-notability should be avoided as an argument for deletion." The language is a factual account; it is meant to inform the reader that non-notability isn't universally accepted as an argument. If the reader wishes to avoid it, that's a decision they can make with better information than is available to them presently. The statement that "notability is an acceptable reason to keep or delete an article" is not a fact, as is stated; it is an opinion. There is well-documented evidence that many people disagree with the opinion. The current language does imply that it's a fact, and further implies that notability is a policy; it is neither.</p>

<p>For the sake of concerns about 'tl;dr' (which I assume means "too long, don't read"), please propose more concise language, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. No, we don't need to educate every editor about everything they need to know in this one place; neither do we need to mislead them with misinformation—which is what the current language does.</p>
<p>The truth, however uncomfortable for some to admit, is that the current language is biased. It ignores the controversy and promulgates the view of one side of that controversy. I've tried to propose unbiased language. If what I've proposed is too long, propose something else that's unbiased or remove the current language.

<dd>You say you've proposed "unbiased language". Maybe, from your viewpoint, it seems unbiased. To me, it seems like that last paragraph boils down to: <i>Avoid bringing up notibility - it might lead to contention</i>. That doesn't seem unbiased.

There are those that feel that notability shouldn't be the primary/only criterion.

<dd>It may be a strawman; I've witnessed AfD <i>policy</i> be ignored, let alone guidelines. Your proposed solution still doesn't address the problem with the language. To say that the notability argument is "controversial but acceptable" when the controversy is regarding whether or not it <i>is</i> acceptable is a misstatement and lends weight to one side of the controversy over the other. The fact that you deleted articles on the basis of notability doesn't mean that you did so erroneously; if notability was found to be an acceptable argument <i>in those cases</i>, fine. I don't understand why it's such a problem to delete the inaccurate language instead of making any sort of statement about notability at all.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 20:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Suggestion</b> - <i>While notablity requirements are not policy, they are a guideline and may be taken into account by editors who choose to do so.</i>, wording of course can be changed, but perhaps something like this could put this to bed? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 20:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say "While notability requirements are not binding policy, they are generally accepted guidelines". That explains the difference between "policy" and "guideline" on Wikipedia for those that may not know it yet, and my definition of "guideline" as "generally accepted" ought to be uncontroversial as that's the definition used by <a href="../../../g/u/i/Template%7EGuideline_29bd.html" title="Template:Guideline">Template:Guideline</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>Alternative suggestion</b>: Change the first sentence of the disputed paragraph, "Good arguments for deletion are:" to say "Commonly used arguments for deletion are". Most readers will rightly interpret "commonly used" as "good", and I do think it's more accurate. The arguments <i>aren't</i> always good arguments because the subject may actually be verifiable, notable etc, but they're indisputably commonly seen... and they're commonly seen because they are good reasons if you do your fact-checking and use them correctly. I think that might solve the problem while only adding a single extra word. I would be happy with both changes being made, but it would be my second choice. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll be glad to go with Sam's version. I think it works. All the other suggestions seem to be suggesting (to one degree or other) that notability should be discouraged as an argument. This one actually is neutral. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made the change with one slight modification, moving "arguments" to the start of the sentence and adding "recommend": "Arguments commonly used to recommend deletion..."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template Afd footer</span></h2>
<p>There is a problem with the template when second nominations are listed. It came to my notice when a user was having problems with a second listing. I have given a detailed explanation <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template_talk%7EAfD_footer_75d7.html#Request_for_change_in_template" title="Template talk:AfD footer">here</a>. After doing that I came across <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html#Instructions_incorrect_for_2nd_nomination" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">this discussion</a> on this page. So it seems that other users too have had the same problem. Please comment on this on the template talk page for sake of keeping all comments in one place. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 10:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
