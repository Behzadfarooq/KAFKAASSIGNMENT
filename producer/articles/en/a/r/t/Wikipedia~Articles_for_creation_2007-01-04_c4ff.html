<p>Brett Rosenberg began his music career in 1999, relocating from rural <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_572b.html" title="New York State">New York State</a> to Boston at age 20. He began as a subway busker and caught the attention of singer-songwriter and fellow busker <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Lou_Lord_30b1.html" title="Mary Lou Lord">Mary Lou Lord</a>, who introduced him to the Boston music scene. Rosenberg's profile rose and in 2000, he formed his first band, the Brett Rosenberg Problem.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-04_c4ff.html" title="Edit section: Joint Regional Information Exchange System (JRIES)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joint Regional Information Exchange System (JRIES)</span></h2>
<p>The Joint Regional Information Exchange System (JRIES) began in December 2002 as an all-source intelligence / information sharing system, designed initially as a grassroots pilot system to connect the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center, the New York Police Department, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). These groups designed JRIES, which was first deployed in February 2003, to facilitate the exchange of suspicious activity reports, register events potentially related to terrorist activity, and foster real-time intelligence and law enforcement collaboration in a secure environment across federal, state, and local jurisdictions. JRIES used a commercial, off-the-shelf software collaboration tool application to enable multiple groups to share the information securely. A JRIES executive board, comprised of representatives from the participating groups, provided guidance and structure to help manage the system. JRIES proved useful during the northeast blackout in 2003 when information posted on the system allowed users across the country to quickly learn that the event was not related to terrorism. The system provided a very simple and efficient way for the law enforcement community to obtain situational awareness concurrently, without the need for hundreds of phone calls.</p>
<p>Although DIA originally operated and maintained JRIES, DIA transferred program management of the system to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in September 2003, due to funding constraints. DIA was concerned that managing JRIES to support domestic intelligence activities conflicted with its military intelligence role. As of February 2004, approximately 100 organizations–with more than 1,000 law enforcement and intelligence analysts from federal, state, and local government agencies–were using JRIES.</p>
<p>After acquiring JRIES, DHS recognized that the system’s utility could be expanded beyond its existing counter-terrorism intelligence and threat awareness mission because JRIES met DHS’ requirements for senior executive communications, crisis planning and management, and coordination and communications with first responder, emergency management, and military organizations. As such, in February 2004, DHS announced the expansion of JRIES as its primary communication, collaboration, situational awareness, and information-sharing system. The DHS Secretary renamed JRIES as the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) in order to reflect the system’s broader scope. By December 2004, DHS had deployed HSIN to all 50 states, 53 major urban areas, five U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and several international partners. DHS extended HSIN access beyond the law enforcement community to include state homeland security advisors, governors’ offices, emergency managers, first responders, the National Guard, and an international component. DHS equipped each location with two laptops installed with the commercial, off-the-shelf software collaboration tool application.</p>
<p>In March 2005, because of the lack of scalability to accommodate a large increase in users, DHS decided to move HSIN away from the current software collaboration tool and to develop a series of web-based portals as replacements. Nonetheless, DHS continues to operate both the commercial software collaboration tool application and a portal to support the law enforcement community.</p>
<p>DHS has expanded the role of HSIN through a state and local initiative. The goals of this initiative are to identify and address requirements of state and local communities of interest, as well as to provide robust training to promote effective use of the network. As of January 2006, eight states had deployed HSIN throughout their respective departments and agencies. Declaring HSIN the primary system for operational information sharing and collaboration, the DHS Secretary asked that the department’s senior managers as well as headquarters and field personnel support the ongoing growth and utilization of HSIN.</p>
<p>Prior to DHS’ implementation and expansion of HSIN, reports by various nonprofit, industry, audit, and congressional organizations documented problems with homeland security information sharing and the need for a single, effective collaboration system.</p>

The widely-distributed <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears.html" title="Sears">Sears</a> catalogue was also a popular choice until it began to be printed on glossy paper (at which point, some people wrote to the company to complain). In <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herv%C3%A9_Bazin_f6c2.html" title="Hervé Bazin">Hervé Bazin</a>'s book, "<a href="../../../v/i/p/Viper_in_the_Fist_1944.html" title="Viper in the Fist">Viper in the Fist</a>", a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> family uses pages of the Catholic newspaper, <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Croix_f54f.html" title="La Croix">La Croix</a></i> (after tearing off the cross of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvary.html" title="Calvary">Calvary</a>).

During the reign of his son, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>, the title was awarded to favoured <i>minions</i> of the King, though the bum-wiping job itself continued to be carried out by Court functionaries.</p>
<p>Using water to clean oneself, in lieu of toilet paper, is common in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and Muslim countries, where people use their left hand to clean themselves and their right hand for eating or greeting (in parts of Africa, though, the converse is true, and a right-handed <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handshake.html" title="Handshake">handshake</a> could be considered rude). The use of water in Muslim countries is due in part to Muslim <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">sharia</a> which encourages washing after defecation. It is not uncommon to find Indians and Middle Eastern people express their disgust for the use of dry toilet paper as they doubt the effectiveness of just wiping with toilet tissue and feel it is impossible to completely clean one's bottom and washing is absolutely necessary. Toilet tissue is not as rare today in these households, but in many countries, a hose with a water sprayer (called a "health faucet"<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) or a pail of water is found instead of a water sprayer.</p>
<p>Some people will just compromise and use toilet tissue dipped in water to clean themselves. There have been attempts to market wet swipes as toilet paper, but the market was not big enough. In the modern world toilet tissues are being challenged by other techniques, especially <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidet.html" title="Bidet">bidet</a> type devices. For tender bottoms (e.g. <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemorrhoids.html" title="Hemorrhoids">hemorrhoids</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarrhea.html" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>), toilet tissue must be used with additional chemicals to ease the pain and irritation. For the environmentally conscious, the bidet approach may be superior to toilet tissue. Modern bidets may also be better at removing fecal, parasitic and infectious material in the lower regions.</p>

<p>The advantages of toilet tissue are that it is easy and intuitive to use, fairly absorbent, can be conveniently made available near toilets and it can be flushed in most countries where toilet tissue is common. Most modern sewage systems, including septic tanks, can accept toilet tissue along with human excreta. In many instances, used toilet tissue is placed in a tin or <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustbin.html" title="Dustbin">dustbin</a> next to the toilet if the plumbing or septic system cannot cope with toilet tissue. Misplacing the soiled paper can lead to a serious <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faux_pas.html" title="Faux pas">faux pas</a>, regardless of culture.</p>
<p>Toilet tissue also has disadvantages: environmental, infection, cleanliness, replacement costs (materials &amp; time), and a high level of cognitive/ physical functioning to be used properly. The modern alternative: heated <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidet.html" title="Bidet">bidet</a> - is rapidly decreasing in prices and increasing in variety.</p>
<p>In purchasing toilet tissue, there are many deceptive marketing techniques being used. One of the most common is to increase the size of the empty hole. or narrow the width and size of the tissue. Fancy packaging is another common method, allied with carefully placed advertisements and publicity techniques.</p>
<p>Toilet tissue is available in several types of paper, a variety of colors, decorations, and textures, to appeal to individual preference. Toilet tissue is typically made from <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recycle.html" title="Recycle">recycled</a> paper. <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">Environmentally</a> friendly toilet tissue may also be <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28chemical%29.html" title="Bleach (chemical)">unbleached</a>, which reduces pollution of waterways and is safer, as fewer chemicals are used. Toilet tissue vary immensely in the technical factors that distinguish them: sizes, weights, roughness, tearability, softness, chemical residues, "finger-breakthrough" resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require/ demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet tissue may have a light coating of aloe or lotion worked into the paper to reduce roughness. Quality is usually determined by the number of plys (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet tissue is typically of the lowest grade of paper, have only one or two plys, are very coarse and sometimes have small amounts of unbleached/unpulped paper embedded in it. Mid grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness, and is somewhat durable. Premium toilet tissue may have lotion, and has 2 to 4 plys made of very finely pulped paper.</p>
<p>Two-ply toilet tissue is the standard in many countries, although one-ply is often available and marketed as a budget option, it may also be more appropriate for use in toilets on boats and in camper-vans. Toilet tissue, especially if it is marketed as "luxury", may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti bacterial chemicals), treated with <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloe.html" title="Aloe">aloe</a>, etc. Many novelty designs are also available on toilet tissue, from cute cartoon animals via pictures of disfavored political celebrities to pictures of <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollar</a> bills. Women who are prone to <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vaginal</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidiasis.html" title="Candidiasis">Candidiasis</a> yeast infections are advised by some medical experts to use white, unperfumed toilet tissue.</p>
<p>Moist toilet tissue was first introduced by the <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberly-Clark_Corporation_50c8.html" title="Kimberly-Clark Corporation">Kimberly-Clark Corporation</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> by Andrex in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, and in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, two countries in which <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidet.html" title="Bidet">bidets</a> are rare.

<p>The manufacture of toilet tissue is a large industry. According to U.S. company <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmin.html" title="Charmin">Charmin</a>, an American uses an average of 57 sheets of toilet paper a day (20,805 a year).

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-04_c4ff.html" title="Edit section: Installation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Installation</span></h3>
<p>Most of the discussion below is about household uses of toilet tissue. In large buildings, there are many users, so many very competitive industrial methods exist for the use of toilet tissue.</p>
<p>There are two common methods of installing toilet tissue rolls on a <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_roll_holder.html" title="Toilet roll holder">toilet roll holder</a>. Often a matter of stern debate, and a contentious problem in households with opposing viewpoints (second only to the "toilet seat up/down" debate), the variances are mainly that of personal preference.</p>
<p>The first method of installation has the edge of the roll facing away from the wall and commonly facing the toilet (that is, overhand). This method allows the defecator easy access to grab the toilet tissue and pull off the desired amount of tissue, as the roll spins toward the user. This, in fact, is the protocol advocated by the toilet tissue industry itself, including at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Paper_1009.html" title="Scott Paper">Scott Paper</a>'s factory (the inventors of toilet tissue in 1907). Since the industry designs toilet tissue to be used overhand, designs that are patterned, quilted or printed upon toilet tissue are found on the outside of the roll; i.e. so that it is displayed. In institutions where there is a defined protocol (e.g. Marriott, Holiday Inn/InterContinental Hotels, United Airlines, the U.S. Army), the "overhand" method is specified.</p>
<p>The second method of installation has the edge of the roll facing the wall and commonly facing away from the toilet (underhand). This method makes it a bit more difficult for the defecator to grab the toilet tissue: as the roll spins, it spins away from the user. However, there is an advantage to this method in a household with toddlers, as is makes it less likely that toilet tissue will spin off the roll. This is because a toddler is most likely to spin the roll toward himself (or herself). In the case of this installation, as the roll spins toward the toddler, the tissue remains wound on the roll. Yet another advantage of this method is that when the toilet tissue is folded directly from the roll, it allows the embossed or printed side of the tissue to face out. Many modern toilet tissues are advertised as being "quilted" or "embossed", so this method would let the user take full advantage of the un-printed or un-quilted side of the product (if that is what one prefers).</p>
<p>A third (but far less common) toilet tissue installation method is to dispense without any roller mechanism at all, or use a vertical toilet roll holder.</p>
<p>A fourth method involves a portable roll dispenser that encloses the roll entirely. The roll is oriented vertically, and there is an opening on the top of the container. Before installing the roll into the portable roll dispenser, the cardboard core is removed. The tissue is then extracted from the center rather than the edge.</p>
<p>Another method of dispensing the tissue does not use a roll at all. Cut sheets are stacked in a dispenser, folded in such a way that removing a sheet causes the next sheet to protrude from the dispenser. This method has the advantage that it can be refilled at any time without waiting for the supply to run out completely (as would be the case with a roll) and is therefore popular in public buildings. Cut sheet dispensers force users to help themselves to one sheet at a time, thus preventing wastefulness. They are also commonly used on <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport.html" title="Rail transport">rail transports</a> where the motion of the train would cause a roll to rotate and cause a mess. This method may also be used alongside toilets that may be used by "Shomer Shabbat" Jews, some of whom do not tear on the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
<p>In terms of the debate, Kenn Fischburg, the President of www.ToiletPaperWorld.com states, "Many hotels install the toilet tissue to pay out from over the top in order to make a nice pointed triangle on the end sheet. This points out to the user that someone cleaned the bathroom and paid attention to the 'finer' details. However, others feel that in a public facility it is best to install to pay out from underneath. In this way, the dispensing and tearing is more controlled and therefore less people will touch the roll of tissue, therefore less cross contamination. Also, keeping the tissue closer to the wall by dispensing from underneath provides a 'cleaner less intrusive' environment, especially in close quarters. Some dispensers have a top cover that helps the user pull and tear the tissue. In this case the roll should be dispensed from the top allowing the user to 'pull up' on the tissue and tear it easily. So, it depends on the dispenser, the location and the facility. However, the simple concern about the installation of the roll may have a deeper meaning and may be indicative of a different issue in the personality of the user."</p>

<p>Many private and public <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">toilets</a> are provided with toilet tissue holders, each of which can hold up to two complete rolls of toilet tissue at one time. This arrangement is most effective if paper is always used from the roll with less paper on it. Then, there is an allowance of one complete roll before a completely used roll is replaced. (In effect, the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventory.html" title="Inventory">inventory</a> of toilet tissue at the toilet has a minimum of one roll and a maximum of two rolls.) However, if both rolls are finished at the same time, there is a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a> of being without toilet tissue before the next replacement.</p>

<p>Those with limited mobility, or those with unusually short arms, such as commonly seen on people with <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achondroplasia.html" title="Achondroplasia">achondroplasia</a>, often find it helpful to wrap the toilet tissue around a bottom wiper, which is a plastic instrument with a tong-like clasp at one end to accommodate the toilet tissue and a long handle at the other to allow the person to reach his bottom. The person wraps the toilet tissue several times around the clasp, and after wiping, can easily eject the toilet tissue into the toilet without having to touch the paper. Folding bottom wipers are available, and can be easily stored or carried in a purse.</p>

<p>Another matter of personal preference is how to prepare the toilet tissue for usage. The predominating methods are either to "fold" a number of sheets together, or to "scrunch" sheets into a loose ball, with "wrapping" the tissue round the hand being somewhat less popular.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The intensely private nature of the subject, coupled with the fact that the methodology is instilled at a very young age, means that a majority of the people are unaware that the difference exists (or have even thought about it), and may react with shock upon learning that their partner uses an alternative method.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence <sup id="_ref-newscientist_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newscientist" title="">[2]</a></sup> suggests that scrunching is more common in America, and folding more common in the UK, and that this difference informs the construction of toilet tissue sold in the two markets.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">toilet</a> sanitation was supplemented by the invention of the <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bidet.html" title="Bidet">bidet</a> in the <a href="../../../1/7/1/1710s.html" title="1710s">1710s</a>. With the improvements to plumbing in the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> the bidet moved from the bedroom (where it was kept with the chamber pot) to the bathroom. Modern bidets use a stream of warm water to cleanse the genitals and anus (before modern plumbing, bidets sometimes had a hand-crank to achieve the same effect). The bidet is commonplace in many European countries, especially in France and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, and also in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> where approximately half of all households have a form of bidet. It is also very popular in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The first "tissueless" toilet was invented in Japan in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. It is a combination toilet, bidet and drier, controlled by an electronic panel next to the toilet seat. This has famously led to tourists accidentally activating the bidet and causing a jet of water to shoot high into the air and spray all over the bathroom floor, usually a result of investigating the unfamiliar fixture's buttons, all labeled in Japanese (the fact that some toilets use a button on the same panel to flush exacerbated the problem). Many modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid the problem, and some newer models even have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless it detects someone actually sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p>Another popular alternative resembles a miniature shower and is termed as a "health faucet". It is placed on a holder near the toilet, thus enabling the person using it to have it within an arm's length for easy accessibility.</p>

<p>In many <a href="../../../s/o/u/South-east_Asia_8bdd.html" title="South-east Asia">South-east Asian</a> nations it is common to see toilet tissue used as a general purpose tissue in peoples homes and in restaurants. Higher end restaurants and family homes of the wealthy are more likely to use a western-world idea of tissue for blowing the nose or cleaning the hands at a meal, but otherwise the use of toilet tissue for these purposes is common. Plastic holders for toilet tissue are commonly used for this general purpose use: these usually take the form of an upside-down cup covering the toilet roll and slightly taller than the actual roll, with a hole in the top. There is a base to the holder too, to form a unit enclosing the tissue. The loose end of the tissue is poked through the hole and people then take their required amount of tissue from the holder, tearing it off by hand at the perforations.</p>
