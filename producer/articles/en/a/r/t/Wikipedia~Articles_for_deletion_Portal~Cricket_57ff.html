</dl>
<p>This page represents a new idea - a portal for Readers. (We do have WikiPortals, but these are for editors and live in Wikipediaspace - this one is for readers.) A lot of hard work and consideration has gone into it. The aim is to allow readers interested in a particular subject, in this instance cricket, to easily navigate between the various pages - or at least the good, well-developed pages. This is why it has been place under the title <a href="../../../c/r/i/Portal%7ECricket_1b4e.html" title="Portal:Cricket">Portal:Cricket</a>. It makes it clear that this is a different type of page, neither Wikipediaspace (which is purely administrative) nor a normal article page.</p>
<p>However, some people wish to kill this idea to promote Wikipedia at birth. After the farce at the VfD page for the original Cricket (portal) page, I am therefore rationalising the discussion by opening it with a clean slate here, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:56, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Still not an article. A move out of the main namespace would be acceptable, but by no means necessary. Requiring a second parallel vfd is a frankly astonishing show of bad faith, the sort we normally see from anons trying to preserve their vanity forum advertisement. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 18:59, May 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying that, but I would prefer if lists were not counted as articles.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's a great idea. And until the self-references issue is settled, moving it to the Wikipedia namespace will make it off-limits to readers, ruining the whole point of it. If there is no reason to move the existing lists, then I don't see a reason to move the existing portals. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 08:28, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Once more with feeling. Am I correct in summarizing the status quo as follows?
<ul>
<li>The main namespace is reserved for articles, with the exception of
<ul>
<li>The unique <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>;</li>
<li>Redirects, which are a technical aid and ideally invisible to readers;</li>
<li>Lists, which serve as ways of ordering either
<ul>
<li>Pieces of information that merit no separate articles or are factored out from articles (the appropriateness of which is disputed by some); or</li>
<li>(Possibly nonexistent) articles by other means than category and title.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disambiguation pages, which are hybrids of article content and pure navigation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(Note that some of this contradicts <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENamespace_6ef8.html" title="Wikipedia:Namespace">Wikipedia:Namespace</a>, but that only describes what <i>should</i> be the case.)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The Wikipedia namespace is reserved for internal Wikipedia affairs, including all editorial processes like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia:WikiProjects</a>.</li>
<li>The intent of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> is
<ul>
<li>To make information as accessible to reusers as possible by not mentioning Wikipedia in a non-factual way;</li>
<li>To prevent displaying what some see as an unprofessional image by mentioning Wikipedia in a non-notable way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reason this discussion (well, not <i>this</i> one, but this is only the perimeter) has generated so much heat so far is because portals are triggering more than one of these concerns. If you believe the main namespace is good enough for anything useful to readers, then you'll get different results than if you believe it's for articles only, and you'll get different results still if you believe that portals resemble the Main Page, which need not be unique. Likewise, it matters to what extent and for what reason you believe self-references should be avoided, and whether a link to a WikiProject in a portal constitutes a promotion to an "internal Wikipedia affair". A separate namespace might be the best solution simply because we can write new rules for a new namespace. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:09, 2005 May 2 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think your summary looks good to me. I'd clarify that one of the reasons this is so contentious is the turf war pushes this portal both ways. This portal is intended not for editors but for readers—say a reader is interested in cricket, this is a way to explore different areas of cricket. I personally think it's a great idea. As a page in the article space, some argue that it should be out of the main namespace and in the Wikipedia space. Fine; {{<a href="../../../p/o/r/Template%7EPortal_d2ae.html" title="Template:Portal">portal</a>}} on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> would be a nice way to let readers of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> know about the other articles. However, another group say that this violates no self-references and remove the portal tag. (Note that the basis is for this instance, as I understand it, is making accessible for reusers, not the unprofessional image). Those (like me) who think it's a good idea argue that the portal, now in Wikipedia space, is unreachable from the article space, so readers (the intended audience) have no way to get to it, rendering a good idea useless. I feel that in the two wars going on, a good page is getting pushed out from both sides. A third possibility is that a page like this is not appropriate for readers and readers should not be directed to it, which would of course resolve the problem, but I haven't seen anyone suggest this so far. The fourth possibility is the creation of the portal namespace, which would solve the problem, assuming links from the main namespace to the portal namespace are allowed. If not, there'd be little point. Also, incidentally, I am arguing from the point of the portal just featuring cricket-related articles and such; I believe links to WikiProjects would be unprofessional and inappropriate (the second reason for the "no self-reference") — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 09:47, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It seems like the only real issue with putting this portal in the main namespace is that it violates "no self references". This really isn't much of a reason:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1) We can trivially style the link to the WikiProject as an external-style link (as is done at <a href="../../../c/e/t/Category%7ECetaceans_612b.html" title="Category:Cetaceans">Category:Cetaceans</a>). Thus there is no problem for re-users.</li>
<li>2) The original self-reference policy was formulated to avoid things like "Mount Everest is as high as 55 Wikipedias" in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Everest_bc8a.html" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a>. It was never originally applied to things like stub notices.</li>
<li>3) Carrying on from 2). We have thousands of references to Wikipedia in the main namespace. E.g. stubs notices etc... the reason that it is not a problem is that a re-user can easily rewrite the (relatively few) templates to suit their own needs. Often they just use a no-op.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thus <b>KEEP in the main namespace</b>, it is a new, innovative and useful way of presenting information to readers and the problems it raises can be trivially worked around. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:10, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thank you, Pete. A voice of sanity.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The problem with having this article in the main namespace is that it's unencyclopedic and, IMHO, has no potential to become encyclopedic. If there were a Portal: namespace, then this would be okay, but there isn't. <b>Move</b> to Wikipedia: namespace and <b>delete</b> the redirect. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 22:38, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What does "encyclopedic" mean in this context? We are just trying to open new avenues to our content. The main page is similarly "unencyclopedic" but that doesn't mean its not useful. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 07:11, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Technical issues and naming arguments be damned, the *idea* is brilliant, and that is what should be voted on. I could easily forsee a portal for US History or Classical Music or Videogames... or even niche sections like Survivor or Pokemon or Zelda or Star Wars or whatnot if each could be made and upkept in an applicable and useful manner. I don't understand what all the arguing is about, but the *idea*, people, the *idea*... the idea is good. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 09:30, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
