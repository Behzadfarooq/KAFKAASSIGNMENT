<ul>
<li><b>Keep!</b> Here are my reasons.
<ul>
<li>It is a pre-release stub for a new game, where the other games in the series have articles. E.g. <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_fantasy.html" title="Final fantasy">final fantasy</a><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VII_f2ee.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a> etc. etc. &amp; etc. We should allow this article to develop.</li>
<li>The VfD was added a less than 20 hours after the article was started. The article was started on 05:22, 1 October 2005.</li>
<li>It is easy for the non-gamers to dismiss all these games. I mean, people just spend <b>hours</b> on them instead of doing something constructive like browsing E-bay or www.woot.com.
<ul>
<li>We need to welcome these young people and not view their musings as less important than <a href="../../../i/r/e/Iressa.html" title="Iressa">Iressa</a> or <a href="../../../g/i/s/GIST_4b28.html" title="GIST">GIST</a>. These young slackers are our future. They are the future of Wikipedia. One day, when our arthritic fingers fail to connect with the correct key on the keyboard, when our eyesights collectively fail and our brains turn to mush, gamers with access to pre-released games, young ones like <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlareNUKE_315e.html" title="User:FlareNUKE">User:FlareNUKE</a> will continue to post. Word after word. Article after article. Wikipedia will be saved by the teenie bopper gamers.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While the current version and location looks unacceptable, I think there could be a good article about interior design trends in 1950s America (and other countries). Maybe I just say this because I'm renovating a house with some wacky 1950s-era design choices under the carpet/wallpaper! But interior design, very different every 10 years or so, is a notable part of culture. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:32, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sure, I'd support a History of interior design or some such. But individual decades probably don't merit an article. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 02:12, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think you will find that individual decades of the 20th century probably do merit an article. For that matter, though there are fewer people capable of contributing, it is possible to go decade by decade back into the 19th century. 18th century, the span between major changes it a bit larger. Heck, changes in fasion for interior decoration goes back to the ancient Egyptians and earlier. I encourage <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> to start a better article on 50's interior design. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 16:08, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason this is being listed for deletion is because it's 1) in a non-English order and 2) is a personal project of an inactive Wikipedian. It isn't so much a matter of whether the category deserves a list or not, but a matter how poorly that list is written. If/When this is deleted, I'm sure it will be fine to completely redo the lists in a format that makes sense, if anyone it up to it. -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 18:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can we move this whole complex to the Wikipedia namespace somewhere to keep the structure, links etc.? Although some have few or no entries, some have lots. It would be useful to have a list of names of stations (red links) for expansion. But it does little good as an article as it is (with nobody working on it). <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 08:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are two lists of the 21 which may be nearly complete: SA and A. I think those two lists of station names <i>is</i> a nice resource, so moving them to another place for safekeeping is a good idea. But even then, I wouldn't want to consider them to be canonical (I haven't checked -- it seems pretty thorough, but that just means that the gaps will be harder to spot). I've started an unofficial project to build a set of templates for each railway line, similar to the prefecture or state templates (the templates list each station on a specific line, similar to listing each city of a state, etc). <a href="../../../t/e/m/Category%7ETemplates_for_Railway_Lines_of_Japan_40b2.html" title="Category:Templates for Railway Lines of Japan">Category:Templates_for_Railway_Lines_of_Japan</a> As that moves forward, then that may be another place to collect red links, and in a localized manner at that. It is still in its infancy, but help in filling in other lines is definitely welcome.<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I took the Japanese lists from <a href="../../../../ja/%E6%97%A5/%E6%9C%AC/%E3%81%AE/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E9%A7%85%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7.html" class="extiw" title="ja:日本の鉄道駅一覧">ja:日本の鉄道駅一覧</a> and played a bunch of perl games with them. The net result is that I have a list of romaji names for the ~9000 stations, along with (PREFECTURE) on most of the ones which need them. Until this current mess is cleaned up, I've stuck them in my <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_Sandbox_TrainList_8911.html" title="User:Neier/Sandbox/TrainList">User:Neier/Sandbox/TrainList</a>. There is still some work to be done with the names on the list, such as bad romaji, and also several disambiguations that we need that the Japanese site didn't (like <a href="../../../i/z/u/Izumi-Chuo_Station_8e65.html" title="Izumi-Chuo Station">Izumi-Chuo Station</a>) because the kanji is different, but the romaji is the same. Once there is a clean slate, I'll move the sandbox into a List of xyz structure (after wikifying the romaji names, red-links and all). Feel free to fix things in the sandbox until then. - <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 12:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Nameneko's quite right--the reduncancy with the category is <i>not</i> the issue. The issue is that ScottKuberski only finished the list for A, and nobody's going to finish the rest because the people who care would prefer to organize such a list geographically rather than by Japanese spelling, as it is organized here. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 02:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, but without prejudice for another list with a different structure. Lists of stations are valid if they present the information differently from what a category would. The problem as I see it is that <i>this</i> list tries to list the stations in <i>alphabetical</i> order, and without any descriptions on the page, it is very redundant with the category. A list which ordered the stations according to railway line or by geographical location (district/region/whatever) however, would be valid. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Homey 01:09, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - He's a co-founder of Canada's first republican movement (an achievement in its own right), their main anglo spokesperson, and as Homey just mentioned, he regularly speaks on behalf of organized Canadian republicans in the media. And again, if the head of their monarchist counterpart deserves a page, so should the head of the republicans. As far as the significance of the organization is concerned, they recently formed a strategic alliance with the republican movements of Austrailia, NZ and UK. So not only are they recognized in Canada as the voice of Canadian republicans, but also internationally. I think it's obvious what's happening here. The attempts to delete this page are coming from monarchists who will do anything to sabotage the republican movement. I hope admin will see through these attepmts for what they are - vandalism.

<li>That is a reductio ad absurdum that is flawed because it is based upon a false analogy.

<li>Whie it would seem better to do it the other way around (article on artists with song title as redirect), that isn't a bad suggestion, so long as someone expands the article to establish notability. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 17:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because this can't be elegantly merged into <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_camp.html" title="Summer camp">summer camp</a> without writing more elaborate descriptions for the other types of specialty "camps."

<li><b>Comment</b> If we do get lots of articles such as soccer camp and baseball camp, a page about compulsory camps could be created and the information could be merged -- but we'd still need redirects, because "band camp" and "soccer camp," etc, would be used much more often for searching than "compulsory camps". --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 16:54, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep.--I found the list of theme songs that mention the show in the lyrics interesting and useful. Trivia? Yes, but you can reduce all information to the level of trivia if it doesn't interest you. The other lists (instrumental themes and themes that DON'T mention the show in the lyrics) don't seem so essential to me, since, as other folks mention, it all becomes reductive after a while.--June</p>

As usual, none of the bands listed are described using this term on their own article pages. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 04:55, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Certainly verifiable; I own at least one book which catalogs each camp's history and culture. Many of these have historical significance (hideouts for outlaws; ancient artifacts found nearby; major mining disasters) which predate the BSA's involvement.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I concur with Dan. Most of these articles are notable and are worth keeping. My question is, how should these articles be presented?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I went to Philmont so I may be biased but these should be kept. Here's why: more than 700,000 Scouts and leaders have backpacked through Philmont since 1938. These camps are familar to many people. With some additional work, the articles could be useful. Merging them into a single article or list is not a good idea because if information is added the article would be enormous. The information could be valuable but the only way to share it is to keep all the individual articles. Check out the <a href="../../../p/h/i/WP%7EPhilmont_b772.html" title="WP:Philmont">WikiProject</a>, the Philmont Scout Ranch category, and the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Philmont_camps_f626.html" title="List of Philmont camps">List of Philmont camps</a> as well as the changes to the main Philmont article and a few of the camps (added <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Philmont_camps_151b.html" title="Template:Infobox Philmont camps">an infobox</a>).--<a href="../../../l/1/a/User%7EL1AM_b77a.html" title="User:L1AM">L1AM</a> 13:15, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page has two problems: the page title is a misspelling, and the contents describe <a href="../../../a/i/f/AIFF_457c.html" title="AIFF">AIFF</a> (Audio Interchange File Format), which is something completely different. The page was linked as misspelled from the disambig page <a href="../../../a/i/f/AIF_46d1.html" title="AIF">AIF</a>. The correct spelling, Analysis Interchange Format, seems to be a real thing, but I couldn't find enough on it to make a decent stub. Apparently it has something to do with modelling embedded systems. I merged in the two sentences from Analyis Interchange Format containing information not in <a href="../../../a/i/f/AIFF_457c.html" title="AIFF">AIFF</a>, rewritten to avoid GFDL problems.

<p>Okay, it starts as a "tv setup that lets you order movies,sporting events and concerts for free", is sold to Time Warner and for some reason now has film contracts. UBO.com is the apparently unrelated Urban Box Office, which deals in music and isn't owned by Time Warner. There were three results for a search of UBO and the creator, David Webster, but they were all irrelevant. I didn't have any luck searching to see if Time Warner bought a company named UBO. Time Warner owns HBO, but I didn't find anything about UBO being its predecessor, either. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:14, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as almost certain hoax. None of the named properties appear on the IMDB, and the $550,000 ("in cash") is an awfully small sum for something with that much content... that works out to about $13,500 per property, which is next to nothing for an original movie, TV series, or miniseries.

His rights come from abdication of the last daughter of the king Charles of Portugal, Maria Pia, and he has also many jurisdictional international recognitions. These are the more important facts. Others are only talk. I don't understand because miss Muriel want hide this truth.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unfortunately Manuel de Sousa has chosen to use Wikipedia as a means of publicizing a fringe character's absurd pretensions, in a way that does not recognize the absurdity of the claims, and is thus misleading. An article with a neutral point of view would be under the man's real name "Rosario Poidimani", and would point out that [1] his "claim" is through a purported (and unlikely) bastard daughter (impossible) [2] who "abdicated in his favor" (impossible) to whom he is [3] unrelated. The claim is ludicrous, and unimportant, and most importantly, with Manuel continuing to propagandize in this and other articles (see the vote at <a href="../../../h/i/l/Talk%7EHilda_Toledano_a094.html" title="Talk:Hilda Toledano">Talk:Hilda Toledano</a>), it is apparent we cannot maintain a neutral article. This is just a fork of the Hilda Toledano article (it's the same "claim", dressed up for an unrelated man), created when it was made apparent that <i>that</i> article would not be residing at "Maria Pia of Saxony Coburgo Gotha and Bragança". If we could maintain an article like <a href="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/portugal-false.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which makes the absurdity of the claims clear, it would be worth doing. But with Manuel, who is associated with the websites of this fantasy royalty faction, showing no commitment to NPOV, and a relentless pursuit of falsely depicting these claims as reasonable and true, this seems impossible. The article as it stands could come from Poidimani's own website! - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:56, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Their authenticity can't be confirmed because the originals don't <i>exist</i>, as far as can be determined. Setting aside the issue of "Maria Pia's" natural birth, her supposed legitimation/elevation as an Infanta of Portugal is based upon a single typewritten document, dated 1959, purporting (on the authority of the lady herself) to be a transcription of the Royal document. The original has never been produced, nor evidence brought forth (e.g., from the Royal Archives) to corroborate it; indeed, while I'm not familiar with the various Portugese constitutions of the time, I find it difficult to believe that the King had the power to unilaterally confer succession privileges. There are reasons why this claim is not taken seriously, and the supposed ill-will of Miguelists has nothing to do with it. (Side note: I don't know precisely what litigation is in hand, but Mr. Sainty has won the initial round; here is <a href="http://www.icocregister.org/Poidimani_Sainty.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.icocregister.org/Poidimani_Sainty.htm" rel="nofollow">a transcript in Italian</a>.)<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 00:52, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a Greek article about a village near Ancient Olympia (some 10 miles away). It is part of the Municipality of Skyllous (Krestena, about 3 miles away) on the road leading from Pyrgos (capital of the Perfecture of Ilias) to Andritsena, a village town some 30 miles away, where the Temple of Epicurean Apollo is situated. It was written for a Greek magazine a couple of years ago by this writer who also retains the article's copyright.

<dd>Swedish indeed. There's a first chapter, "MUSIK - Musikhistoria och musikaliska grundbegrepp", as well. The title means "Music - History of music and basic musical terms". The capitalized subheadings mean "Basic acoustic terms" and "The acoustics of musical instruments", which probably tells you what you need to know about the content. Both texts end with the statement "The text is written in 1974-1977 and edited in 2005 by Anne Jaenzon." Considering the fact that both these articles were posted by <a href="../../../j/a/e/User%7EJaenzon_3238.html" title="User:Jaenzon">User:Jaenzon</a>, who have placed similar dumps on both the user page and the user talk page, I'd say this might be a case of a well-meaning newcomer wanting to contribute what is probably pre-existing personal work, but not knowing how to go about it. As for the value of the texts, I don't know. At a quick glance, they don't look particularly well-written, although they might well be factually correct. I am not familliar enough with acoustics to say. Without checking, my guess is that they mostly duplicate existing content. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 22:05, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Swedish indeed. There's a first chapter, "MUSIK - Musikhistoria och musikaliska grundbegrepp", as well. The title means "Music - History of music and basic musical terms". The capitalized subheadings mean "Basic acoustic terms" and "The acoustics of musical instruments", which probably tells you what you need to know about the content. Both texts end with the statement "The text is written in 1974-1977 and edited in 2005 by Anne Jaenzon." Considering the fact that both these articles were posted by <a href="../../../j/a/e/User%7EJaenzon_3238.html" title="User:Jaenzon">User:Jaenzon</a>, who have placed similar dumps on both the user page and the user talk page, I'd say this might be a case of a well-meaning newcomer wanting to contribute what is probably pre-existing personal work, but not knowing how to go about it. As for the value of the texts, I don't know. At a quick glance, they don't look particularly well-written, although they might well be factually correct. I am not familliar enough with acoustics to say. Without checking, my guess is that they mostly duplicate existing content. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 22:05, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth -- I did google a couple references to the Free Methodist Church in the Dominican Republic; apparently they have about 6000 members according to adherents.com. The article, though: on speed-reading through it, it is clearly not NPOV and does have the feel as though it was lifted from some other document (but apparently NOT online--I tried googling half a dozen variations and phrases and never got a hit).

<li>That's the whole problem here, Kappa. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be of the opinion that <i>everything</i> is inherently important and significant. You have not, at least as far as I can tell by your votes, found a single thing you deem as unimportant or insignificant. It appears as if, in essence, you <i>have no criteria</i> for determining if the subject of an article is appropriate and acceptable or not, beyond whether or not it is verifiable. (I believe I saw a delete vote from you once on that basis.) Without such criteria in guiding us as to what is suitable for inclusion and what is not, Wikipedia just ends up becoming the world's largest junk drawer. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Did you click the link? There's no article about that particular screwdriver (and I'm sure Craftman has made dozens, if not hundreds, of different #0 screwdrivers, even) because it's an interchangable member of a homogenous group. In the case of such a homogenous group, you describe the group as a whole and let that description suffice for the whole<br />
"Doesn't merit an article" is one of the two main reasons something would and should be listed on AFD (the other reason is "Unverifiable"); empty articles, copyvio, gibberish/non-English, and such are dealt with elsewhere. "Doesn't merit an article" is why we don't have an article about my toenails, every streetlamp in the world, every single person that has ever been in a news story (be it feature news or obituary), etc. Now, different people may have very different standards of what merits an article, but to say that "This is not an encyclopedic subject" isn't a deletion criterion is just silly. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:48, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

When someone votes "nn" or "non-notable" or "not encyclopedic" or "doesn't merit an article," they're saying it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia for the same reason (probably to a lesser degree) that we don't have an article on my toenails or the dear departed Uncle Mortimer. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It's not a strawman argument. I'm simply pointing out that everyone has a point at which they would vote "This subject is notr encyclopedic." For some, this standard is only in the case of patently ridiculous articles (e.g. my toenails, Uncle Morty), whereas for others this standard includes other things (e.g. people with unusual names, unremarkable sex toys, elementary schools). As this is a subjective stadard that varies from person to person, someone can vote "Doesn't merit an article" someone else can disagree, without either person being objectively wrong or voting or bad faith. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:01, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>To the contrary, many, many individual items and articles do <i>not</i> merit encyclopedic articles. As such, when you have an article written about an unencyclopedic subject (let's say Uncle Morty) and Uncle Morty's article comes up on AFD, people are perfectly right in saying "Uncle Morty doesn't merit an article" as their reason for deletion. "Doesn't merit an article" is a perfectly valid deletion criterion. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:19, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The name of the article jumps up and down screaming vanity, and the content isn't impressive - red links by the hoard, and puffing up the importance of a hair removal technique and a (rather obscure I would imagine) trade magazine.

<li><b>Delete</b> Interesting case. Being a practitioner of hair removal definitely isn't notable by our standards, and if the article was just that it would be speediable. The true claims to notability are related to acting. The article lists several stage roles, both high-school and college, and two feature films, one of which (Failure) has no IMDB entry, and the other (My Dark Lady) does but it seems very obscure and doesn't list the article's subject among the cast. He did, however, go to school with some notable people, though I'm sorry to say that isn't enough, or even borderline. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:48, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Regular delete</b> it's not really an attack page, just an article about a fanzine which was vandalised. Still, I'm voting to delete as not notable, and also because of the shaky precedent of keeping an article on a fanzine. There's already a link on the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough F.C.</a> page. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What kind of circulation does a magazine need to be included? Just wondering. I often wonder when trying to decide on books and magazines how "big" we should require them to be. <a href="../../../q/a/z/User%7EQaz_e5fc.html" title="User:Qaz"><font color="#F88017">Qaz</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/a/z/User_talk%7EQaz_6c21.html" title="User talk:Qaz"><font color="#347235">talk</font></a>)</sup> 19:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a very good question. I don't think there's a simple numerical answer (i.e. 50,000 copies average sold for 3+ years) as such stats are easy to fudge and not necessarily indicitive of much of anything... for example, many free local "shopper" publications have circulation into the hundreds of thousands, that doesn't really make them notable. In my opinion, the fact that this one self-identifies as a "fanzine" is probably enough that it isn't an encylcopedic topic. Certainly no scope beyond <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough_F.C._284c.html" title="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough F.C.</a>, so in that article it belongs. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:36, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (and don't merge, although the submitter's record makes me wonder if it's a copyvio). It does seem to be genuine. It seems GM released several cars under this name, based on a variety of different platforms.

<p>appears to be someone whose only claims to notability are that he owns a law firm and stands an exceedingly small chance (acccording to the article; no sources are offered for the "public polls" mentioned) of becoming the next President (presumably of Poland).

<li>Yeah, introduction to my print copy (1937 Everyman's) says "The title must be puzzling to many readers, for 'bummel' will not be found in English dictionaries." It's not in American Heritage. Merriam-Webster Unabridged has it only as a Scotch-derived word meaning "bumble." Jerome's book obviously did <i>not</i> popularize the word.

<li>User:Wolfpackfan72: We have an artical up about 2008, what's the diffrence? Okay, so a couple of years, but this is not fictional, it really will happen. Scientists and theolagists speculate all the time about things that can't be proven.
<ul>
<li>2048? Of course there's a slight chance that there might not be a 2008 election (nuclear winter, asteroid impact, etc), the chance that there won't be a 2048 election is exponentially higher. Of course, all that aside even, the difference is, as WP:NOT says, preparation is already underway for the 2008 Presidential election, and there has been much talk and discussion over it.

<li>I would disagree, the election is only 43 years (and one month) off. The youngest person to ever be president was Teddy Roosevelt, at 42. (Kennedy, at 43, was the youngest ever elected.)

<p>How? You were asking how could your article have been discovered so quickly?</p>
<p>Matthew, it's impossible to make a change to an article on Wikipedia without having it instantly show up on the "Recent Changes" list. And it's impossible to make a new article without having it instantly show up on the "New Articles" list. And it's impossible to make a change to an article without instantly having your name (or IP) show up in the article history, even if you didn't sign your name; that's how we know you're the one who tried to vote anonymously to keep the "2048 Presidential Election" article.</p>
<p>We keep track of these things, Matthew.</p>
<p>You're welcome to contribute more articles, but don't be silly, okay? DS 18:35, 3 October 2005 (UTC)<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfpackfan72_8e70.html" title="User:Wolfpackfan72">Wolfpackfan72</a> 19:44, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Matthew Overby hey, this is wolfpackfan72, I didn't try to not sign my name, I'm a fairly new user and I simply didn't know how to. also, I was not being silly, I think the artical was compleatly ligit, people seem to think that things that are a long time away can't be speculated on. It hurt my feelings to hear that you think I would ingage in vandelism. Please write back, however, you seem like a nice guy.</p>

Sorry if I hurt your feelings, Matthew - I was trying to be friendly, but firm - and just so you know, it's a good idea to always sign your name when you leave a comment. You do that by typing <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfpackfan72_8e70.html" title="User:Wolfpackfan72">Wolfpackfan72</a> 19:52, 3 October 2005 (UTC) - that's the "tilde" symbol, four times in a row. If you're a registered user, that creates your signature. If you have IRC, you can join channel #wikipedia on irc.freenode.net and ask for someone to help you out directly; I'd go there to see if I can help you out in person, but I'm a bit busy right now writing some stuff on a deadline.

<p>It's been several months since the first succesful deletion of this page. The Slate article notwithstanding, it is <i>still</i> not notable: I'd say it is a prime example of a hoax that fails the "will anyone care about this a year from now?" test. Therefore, I'm nominating the newer version of this page for deletion also.

<li>Just to be clear: I think this article should be <b>deleted</b> as both a neologism (for the term), and because the hoax itself was nonnotable.

<li>Not too sure why it isn't considered informative that there are business-specific student newsletters out there. I am an SFU student, and have had discussions with many students at other Canadian universities, who were all quite surprised and interested to hear that The Buzz exists. Also, how is it like an advertisement? All other Canadian student newspapers' entries seem to follow a similar structure. <b>Keep</b> 24.207.70.210 22:06, 3 October 2005 (UTC)pkthree</li>

<li>Anonymous users don't get to vote. That being said, read it, it's very advertisement orientated and is no way in keeping with Wikipedia's neutrality policy.

That's hardly worth the space here. --<a href="../../../o/t/t/Image%7EOttawa_flag.png_f8c0.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/4/40/Ottawa_flag.png/20px-Ottawa_flag.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../o/t/t/Image%7EOttawa_flag.png_f8c0.html" /></a> <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a> 23:43, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I am anonymous no more. I am the one who created the entry. I based the style on The Peak's entry, which I see has also been marked as "advertisement" material. The Buzz prints monthly with a break during the exam periods, which would add up to 9 times a year, although I'm not sure why the fact that it is monthly should make it any less worthy. Honestly, The Buzz is a not-for-profit and isn't looking for fame or fortune by being listed on Wikipedia. We're just trying to show other students (and perhaps other Canadians in general) that business student newsletters/newspapers do exist. I'd definitely appreciate specific input on how to keep the entry as neutral; I've looked at the other entries under the Canadian Student Newspapers and really can't see why you have a specific beef with this one.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Am a little confused now. To my opinion, indeed, a fantastic amount of schools article are just there because schools do exists (like the door of my house for instance, just come and verify it), not much point. Thanks for underlying this <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> page is not policy nor guideline. I was a little too enthusiastic imagining that WP had a definitive (though bad) solution to this recurrent tiring school acnea. My mistake.</dd>
<dd>With a school article I always imagine naively that it got written because of something worth of interest. Anythinkg like "such and such labour union got started by who and who, which is now world famous", or "this foreground scientist invented in that year the dehydrated water" or just something... Not happening often though.

<li>But schools aren't people. They are constituted by many people, and remain in a fixed place for a substantial period of time, developing an importance to the community and history that far exceeds the capacity of one person's lifetime. No one uses the argument that "if this village were a person..."; to make that argument of schools is comparably absurd. I <i>still</i> don't know if I really think they are notable, but that analogy is seriously flawed. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not the slightest bit flawed. It is not the building which is so influential on the people who pass through it, it is the teachers who work within it. The school itself is just so much brick and drywall. Yet Mrs. Jones, who has been teaching thirty years, and has probably influenced over a thousand young lives, will never get an article here unless she sleeps with one of her students. I find it quite amusing how much importance you place on the role of the school in the community. As a former teacher, I can assure you that a school for most people is just a good place to leave their kids while they're at work. Most parents do not involve themselves at all in the goings-on of a school, and it is a real chore to find parents willing to come out and lend a hand. While there may be some ongoing attachment by high-school students to their alma mater, no such warm fuzzy feelings are felt by elementary school students after graduation. It was rare that I had students return to visit after they had moved on to grade seven. And even if all this was not the case, an article that says in its entirety that "XY School is in Armpit, Manitoba. It has 320 students and its colors are taupe and chartreuse" does nothing whatsoever to encapsulate the "importance to the community and history that far exceeds the capacity of one person's lifetime". In fact, it cheapens the school from a shaper of student lives to a historical post-it note. And if this is all that can be said about a school, maybe its influence really wasn't so great after all. As for the comparison of <i>villages</i> to people, I don't recall making that analogy, and in fact, a village is not a school. People live in villages much longer than they attend a school, and in many places in the world, they may spend their whole lives there. People also tend to participate more in village or town goings-on than they do school goings-on, even if it's nothing more than shopping and doing the laundry. Finally, I have never voted on principle against school articles. However, I expect a school article to do what every other article in Wikipedia is expected to do: say something. The vast majority of these school substubs stand open-mouthed and drooling, and should be put to a quick death before they bring on the ridicule they deserve. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:55, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I'm afraid we can't. As long as the balance of votes runs roughly fifty-fifty in favor of/opposed to deleting schools, there is no consensus, and it behooves those who believe these articles have no place in Wikipedia to keep trying. Just because they are not deleted does not mean we are obliged to stop trying; they are not deleted because a no-consensus vote defaults to a keep. Therefore, it is much, much easier to get an article kept than it is to get one deleted. Please do not feel so morally superior because your keep votes appear to be what is saving these articles. It's not - it's how the system works that is saving them. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:01, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is though, the balance of votes doesn't normally end up at 50-50, it normally ends up with a fairly strong keep consensus. --<a href="../../../a/p/y/User%7EApyule_9559.html" title="User:Apyule">Apyule</a> 01:40, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>But do you consider that those that have argued for delete in the past have long ago lost interest in fighting against the 'keep at all costs' crowd? Those that condider them worthy of deletion, in general, have better things to do than fight for good school articles. What i really find amazing is that the communities that are represented in wikipedia rarely have a section on education. Those that create these stubs rarely link them to the relevant community or visa versa. If the keep crowd regard schools as the focal points of communitites why are they rarely mentioned in those articles?<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 03:28, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I have considered it. Deletion on Wikipedia is decided by those who choose to participate. If people don't say anything, we can't take their views into account. I can speculate that the reason that some school articles aren't well integrated into Wikipedia is that they are written by students who are new here. --<a href="../../../a/p/y/User%7EApyule_9559.html" title="User:Apyule">Apyule</a> 05:23, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With regard to students who are new. This relates to one of the strongest argument I have seen for keeping schools (i don't remember where i first saw it now). The argument goes that a new contributor may feel comfortable writing about their school etc. It effectively gives them an immediate niche to experiment on creating articles, investigating the world of categories and templates. Even if these early contributions are less than ideal, if these contributors become more confident and contribute to more interesting articles then wikipedia definitely wins. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 05:41, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
