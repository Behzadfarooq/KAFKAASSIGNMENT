The country rapidly started changing the British system. This was one of few steps.

By the way there are <b>atleast</b> <b>Twenty Five 25</b> <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazims</a> in each district of Pakistan, there are nearby 200 districts in Pakistan. There are thousand of people who wins the lottery everyday at every place of the world. If we started entering the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazims</a> of Pakistan and lottery people, then I think Wikipedians will have nothing to do except of hiring people to upload data for whole of them.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_M._Khan_c4c8.html" title="User:A M.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Lets talk about the merits of this article. Isn't <a href="../../../i/h/s/Ihsan_Khan_399f.html" title="Ihsan Khan">Ihsan Khan</a> a District <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> which means that he is the boss of all the other town Nazims. Yes he is. Furthermore, how many people have won US Lottery worth 32 Million Dollars, none and especially a poor cab driver from Pakistan. Certainly passes the Google test. It’s a Cinderella story and strongly deserves a place in Wikipedia. You are once again pushing a POV on personal enmity. And by the way please insert your vote only once and avoid adding more votes down the page.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 14:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's verifiable with sources and the subject has successfully entered elected politics. Being mayor of a town isn't normally notable just by itself, but this guy has already had international media coverage (and I guess a lot more in non-English media) so he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> even if he stops now. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 18:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I know a person who is not a notable to anyone in his street, but his name comes in google, whenever you search, as he use to work on net and also in a private organization. I also know a bureaucrat who is too famous in bureaucracy of Pakistan and atleast 2-3 pages of goole comes for him, so it means should we make an article for such people too? <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> has nothing to do with any bureaucrat, he is even under the DCO {District Chief Officer), the name itself shows that all powers are with DCO not with <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazims</a>. I don't want to go further, except making a comment that you for your un-healthy claim brought up many sock-puppets here. Aiditior, Zakksez a.k.a Zak are your sock puppets. I hope the administration will be taking action against you soon and blocking of you will be made alongwith this article soon. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_M._Khan_c4c8.html" title="User:A M.

<li><b>Keep</b>- Seems to be notable. But is there any Pakistani wikipedians to comment on this Afd...? If so we have to consider there words with more weightage. Asian Language Newspaper reports are not available in Google search. So we cannot blindly believe and rely on google hits when the AfD biography of an Asian is taken into consideration. News reports from Urdu or Hindi newspapers of 5 lakh copies are not available in google. But report from English Newspapers with mere 1000 copies are also available in google.Ha...Ha...Ha...<b><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph"><span style="background:#0c0;color:#FFFF66">&#160;Nileena joseph&#160;</span></a></b><sup>(<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENileena_joseph_c9bd.html" title="User talk:Nileena joseph">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nileena_joseph_3551.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nileena joseph">Contribs</a>)</sup> 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>High Comments</b>. I am also a <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> Wikipedian, I never knew the person before reading this article. He is infamous person. I asked many people in his area, who were my college mates and some work with me in <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobilink.html" title="Mobilink">Mobilink</a> <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar.html" title="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>. All of them replied that yes they just know him for Nizamat (Holding status of Nazim) not for his lottery. One of them confirmed yes he is won alottery in US, others replied that they don't knbow about a lottery but came to know that he is having a property in US also some fule-stations and minor things. He was a sheep-man (who is servant of elders of Villages to make sheeps roaming daily inmountains) before he went to US. Now he won due to using money, his case is still pending in election commission tribunal. Even he is freed of charges, <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> is nothing, nothing special as mentioned by my fellows earlier. An appropriate action for deletion of this artilce musttake place now. The article is nothing more then a debatless for some voters who are just voting withut any specefic reason other then being involved in personalising. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBegu_Khel_ef57.html" title="User:Begu Khel">Begu Khel</a> 21:43, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> If we start adding <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, we will for sure be adding thousands of pages daily. According Local Government Ordinance of Pakistan a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazim.html" title="Nazim">Nazim</a> is having powers of Grade (BPS-20) officer. Nazim have no right to interfare in divisional or provincial political affairs even. There is a restriction of Matriculation for Nazim, while for <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Civil_Services_8a0a.html" title="Pakistan Civil Services">Pakistan Civil Services</a> one need to be passing the competetive Central Superior Services! examination. For Members of Pronvial Assemblies, Naional Assemblies and Senate, in Pakistan, one need to contest an election and candidates for such elections need to be holder of Bchelors Degree. This shows the real difference that how less is Nazim delaing with. They (Nazims) are just restricted to use some powers, previously those were with prestigious Assistant or Deputy Commissioners. Recently, in one of the debate here on Wikipedia, concluded that Grade-20 officer is not at all a prominent.Eventhoug, there are such officers in 20-Scale, that they are looking there department as Incharge of it for whole Pakistan. Inshort, I will surely, ask for Speedy Deletion of this article. It also seems to be copy from a <b>baseless-link</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBegu_Khel_ef57.html" title="User:Begu Khel">Begu Khel</a> 19:28, 11 November 2006 (UTC) <small>What if it is my 9th edit?

<li><s><b>Speedy and Strong Dlete</b></s> The article should be delete now. There are majority of fake votes casted for the favour of """Keep""". I think it's too much to know about a conspiracy which is to make this article keep. Eventhough, I think theer is no strong debate made nor defended in favour of this article. The debate that is in favour of deletion is a very tough. Requesting here to delete the article on true norms. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBegu_Khel_ef57.html" title="User:Begu Khel">Begu Khel</a> 20:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
