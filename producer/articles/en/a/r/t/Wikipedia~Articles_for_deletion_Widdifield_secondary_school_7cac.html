<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a nano-stub, a short, contextless, low quality pair of sentences about a subject that may or may not be encyclopedic, depending on your POV. Furthermore, when the article creator can't be bothered to correctly capitalize the title (i.e. Widdifield Secondary School), why should others be forced to move it and then expand on it?

<li><b>Comment</b>. What we seem to have here is a school with a considerable commitment to excellence particularly in sport. Its alumni have gone on to join the National Gymnastics team, Track and Field Olympic teams--one guy was once rated 5th in the world--Olympic Beach Volleyball, Olympic Paddling Team, National ski and freestyle ski teams, and even a NHL referee and a St Louis Blues (NHL) player. This isn't quite like having <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Beckenbauer_9676.html" title="Franz Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Charlton_1adb.html" title="Jackie Charlton">Jackie Charlton</a> as an alumnus, but it's close. I could be wrong, but my seat-of-pants feeling is that this article is already beyond being a merge candidate, and we can already see that it certainly isn't about to be delete. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:54, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, you've created exactly the sort of Alumni list I already said I wasn't impressed with. So to me, this doesn't count as creating a good expanded article, this is just filling space for the sake of filling space. I want some form of proof that the school created these great athletes, not that they just happened to live in the area (I went to school with an Olympic swimming finalist, and I can guarantee the school had nothing whatsoever to do with her competing at the Olympics). So while, say, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permian_High_School_0544.html" title="Permian High School">Permian High School</a> gets an article because of sports achievement, it is the sports achievement of the school (National champions, featured in a book and a film) rather than that of people who happened to go to the school.<a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:08, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't recall making any claim about national championships. The population of Northern Ontario is some 800,000; it isn't a little village outside Nova Scotia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:58, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I gave an example of a National Champions, of a country with a population of just under 300 million, a team that almost uniquely has more than just the parents of the players turning up to watch it (they have their own stadium that can seat thousands), and you expect me to be impressed by badminton champions in the 18 year old age category from a population of 800,000 is impressive? Exactly how many 18 year old badminton players do you think there are in North Ontario? It's just local padding, it might make a brief mention in the local news, it won't make the national news, there won't be any books written on them by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, and nobody will make a film about them. 128.243.220.41 10:06, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
