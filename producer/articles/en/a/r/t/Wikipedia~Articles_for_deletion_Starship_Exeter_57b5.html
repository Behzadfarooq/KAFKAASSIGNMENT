<dd>The Minneapolis Star Tribune article was a major one, unfortunately it is no longer available online.

The St Paul Pioneer Press published an extensive article, but that is no longer available online either. All of these articles were written by persons "independant of the subject itself."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As a TV writer/producer with credits on Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Insurrection, The Dead Zone, Wildfire and other productions, I personally consider Starship Exeter to be the most notable and most professionally produced tribute series on the Internet. I know several professional Hollywood writers and producers who follow the series regularly (and eagerly await Act 3 of The Tressaurian Intersection). The production values are second to none. I personally prefer it over New Voyages. The project's notability certainly goes well beyond the fan community. - Eric A. Stillwell EStillwell 19:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Keep" - It is a thing done by people and is therefore worthy of note. I take exception to the people who think that using major publications as "justification". As an amateur screenwriter, I'll let you know that by saying you require some corporate newspaper or magazine to justify this for you, you're insulting tens of thousands of writers, directors, actors, cinematographers, et cetera, the world over who have never had their productions appear in some publication.

<li><b>Query about the entire process</b> Is there a Wikipedia policy against all non-professional films? If this entry is to be deleted for being a fan film, then ergo so much all other entries on such items. Or is it noteworthiness and existing media attention that are the criteria? Or is it that the article as written is not as informative as should be for an encyclopediac entry? I do not see as valid comparisons of the merit of the films in question to other fan films. Popularity and perceived quality are poor criteria for whether or not something is worthy for inclusion. -- M. Molyneaux 67.170.221.224 06:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't see that it meets any of our notability guidelines. I'm also curious why all of these fan communities and articles don't do more work at <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Memory-Alpha</a> and related projects. You'd earn less scorn and AfD's over there. If this has been discussed somewhere, I'd be eager to read it.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why should they be scorned - that's rather strong wording don't you think? Because they are fan films? Because they are Star Trek? Because they are given away for free so you can't affix a price to them? Because they publicly admit to being a minor infringement of Copyright and Trademark? Because the very real benefits they give the IP owners in return are ignored? Because they represent an embarrassing reminder of civil libertarian questions posed by electronic media?</li>
<li>ALL of those points make these fan films <i><b>worthy</b></i> of note NOT scorn. Oh, and Memory Alpha? They have <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Fan_films" class="external text" title="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Fan_films" rel="nofollow">started a page</a> but it is in danger of AfD because they aren't Canon! You people are trying to bar us because we're too Trekkie and they're wanting to bar us because we aren't Trekie enough! it'd be funny if it didn't fly in the face of objectivity and fair dealing--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 14:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hey, I didn't say the articles were worthy of scorn, I was just commenting on the votes in the many AfD's that were brought up a week ago.

<li>So do you mean that THIS fan film is non-notable or ALL fan films are non-notable. What makes you say that it is non-notable after reading the above? Which fan film is more notable than Starship Exeter in your opinion? You <i><b>have</b></i> seen it haven't you? Or are you condemning it sight unseen? I'd really like you to share your critique with us - As Gene Hendricks of "Tales of the Seventh Fleet" pointed out one time, fan film producers are used to getting negative feedback but it is welcome if it is specific so that improvements can be made.--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 14:37, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>How so? Please be specific. The people who are voting to keep this and all the other articles that have been bulk AfD'd are giving detailed and verifiable responses whereas the majority of the deletes are value judgements ("fancruft" indeed! &lt;snort&gt;) by people who are not backing them up with examples.

<dd>I hope whoever tallies the votes will look into the posting histories of some voters.

<dd>That's interesting. Could someone please explain what this has to do with the validity of a persons vote? Am I to infer that the vote of someone who has voted on many AfD's will be given more weight than the vote of someone who knows something about the subject? So that it is more important to be a scholar of Wikipedia than an expert on fan films? So that the opinion of, for example, Eric A. Stillwell "a TV writer/producer with credits on Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Insurrection, The Dead Zone, Wildfire and other productions" will be given less weight than the honeourable <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeleuze_eace.html" title="User:Deleuze">Deleuze</a>, who I am assuming from his post is a frequenter of AfD's? I can respect that there is a need for woodcutters in a forest but I most certainly hope that they will NOT be given any greater standing than those who plant and tend the forest. Is this Wikipedia policy? I know it is not a democracy, but gimme a break!--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 09:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AfDs are not straight votes. A lot of new or anonymous votes would indicate ballot stuffing.

<dd>Good faith has nothing to do with it, I am talking logic here. I assumed that AfDs were not straight votes, however if this were so then it would mean that all this hoohaa about "ballot stuffing" would be background noise wouldn't it? This also means that <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike's</b></a> countup of votes on 00:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC) is useless. I can also assume that a vote that does not reference specific instances and examples to support it will be given less weight than one which does? Good! Then I feel that ayes have it! Since all we have had from the nays seem to be unreferenced and unsupported opinions like "this clearly fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in my mind." and the classic "Star Trek fancruft.".

<li><b>Keep</b>, the original Exeter production predates some of the more well known fanfilms out, but that should not diminish its significance. Unfortunately, since I am a newly registered user of Wikipedia after editing for years anonymously, some appear prepared to automatically discount my vote because I haven't been a member long enough. <a href="../../../m/d/o/User%7EMDonfield_fe81.html" title="User:MDonfield">user:MDonfield</a></li>
