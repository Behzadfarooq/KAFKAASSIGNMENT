<dd><b>Further comment</b> I actually think the "exposes harmful information about students" is on to something, although I wouldn't put it nearly that strongly. There are extensive lists in the article of names of student government officers. I think that's (a) unlikely to be referenced; (b) I'm uncomfortable giving the world their names, even though it's high school, not elementary or middle school; (c) probably going to attract vandals; and (d) there's a slight possibility of libel. All in all it's a bad idea to have it, so I'm going to delete the list. I'll repost this on the talk page. If anyone has a good reason to keep the list, I'd of course welcome a comment there. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article seems to meet notability guidelines and precedent set by keeping of numerous other high schools, many smaller or less notable than this one. It desperately needs to be cleaned up and properly expanded but that is no reason to delete it completely. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 04:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's inherently notable, as all high schools are. My concern about the long lists of student names isn't a reason to delete it.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no consensus at Wikipedia that high schools are or are not notable, as evidenced by the high school AfDs closed as "no consensus". However, I believe this school is notable as being the first school with cameras in every classroom, school security being a major issue in this day and age.

<li><b>Keep</b> Biloxi High School is one of only three schools in the southeast nominated for Blue Ribbon Status. I believe that this in itself makes this article noteworthy. I have fought constant vandilization from students at this, being my own, school. Please give me the chance to keep this site.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree this is much more N than most high school articles., but, as for the student officers, do I understand correctly that Noroton &amp; (on the talk page, Grace Note and ElKevbo) all three agree that lists of student officers are not appropriate for school articles, due to privacy concern, updating, and nonNotability? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely. Wikipedia is not a directory and it's really not particularly significant which particular children hold which particular office.
