<dd><b>Comment</b> Accusing the authors of this article of <i>created as flammable article by authors</i> is not assuming good faith. I did not create this article as flammable article. It was a process of creating individual State terrorism articles by country to better organize <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a>. No one claimed when I created <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism_in_Syria_709d.html" title="State terrorism in Syria">State terrorism in Syria</a> of creating a flammable article but when it is about the US, hell breaks loose and I become a biased author. Once this is settled, I will keep creating articles on Sudan and Iran, then let's see whether the same accusations are thrown at me <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I wonder how many of these wikipedians who are screaming delete because of POV actually attempted to work on this article before putting it up for deletion: answer: none of them. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a> suggested guidelines state, in the very first two sentences: "Before listing an article for deletion here, consider whether a more efficient alternative is appropriate: For problems that do not require deletion, including duplicate articles, articles needing improvement, or <b>POV problems</b>, be bold and fix the problem or tag the article appropriately."

<dd>For your information Travb, I <b>did</b> consider improving it and as I stated, it would have emptied out the article, hence the nomination. This one is so bad it is off the scale and looking at it now it is only getting worse. Also, accusing me of acting in bad faith is not assuming good faith by yourself, pot calling the kettle black and all that.... I would appreciate you striking that part of your comment out with an apology as well. The only one that appears to be screaming is yourself, most of us are just discussing things rationally based on the facts.

<dd>I struck out the section. My apologies. The fact remains that the first edit to this page you ever made was a deletion tag.

<dd>Thank you for that and apologies accepted. I acknowledge that I have acted in good faith and took the course of action I thought was required.

<dd>I counted one reputable source. Look, there are plenty of things the US government sponsored at various points, it shouldn't be hard to find reliable sources for quotes. I see two problems: 1) some of the incidents mentioned would not sourced to my satisfaction if I were to convince myself that they happened at all, and 2) other incidents that surely happened are supported only weakly. The best change for this article is a complete rewrite. Failing that, half the sections should be deleted, twice as many added, and sources should be used for everything. If you'd like to salvage the article, why don't you do it now -- it it's done well I'll change my vote, and others may also do so. Until then, I don't see why we're even writing back and forth; the artile's not worth it. <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/g/User_talk%7ECRGreathouse_a2c7.html" title="User talk:CRGreathouse">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CRGreathouse_ecde.html" title="Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse">contribs</a>)</small> 21:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're talking about merging - I think this article's title is preferable to the ambiguous and vague "American Terrorism". This article's title conforms with a standard wording used for other article's on other nation's. Anyway, the article content deals with terrorist acts carried out by the US government, rather than 'America' as a whole, which to me sounds like a racial slur. I equally would not like to see an article on "Irish Terrorism" or "Jewish Terrorism", however, well sourced NPOV content under the heading "State terrorism by the Republic of Ireland" or "State terrorism by Israel" would be acceptable.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 15:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This AFD is not on my intent, it is on the subject matter. I did not hide why I created this article like others, if you are going quote me them quote me fully. This is what I said in the reason for creating this article <i>Per discussion on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> I have been peeling off by country each so called incident to make it easy for us to edit the main page. So far I have created State terrorism in Syria and Sri Lanka, looks like the consensus on both will be to keep them, hence this explosive article which is nothing but a copy of what was already there in List of State terrorism by country. My eventual aim I to have an article by every country in the world and categories under state terrorism to categorize all different incidents, ......

Simply the arguments hide the real biases. Also the original article that I cretaed and the current one are night and day, it has improved hell of lot due to many editors.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nothing POV about this title, or State terrorism by Canada, State terrorism by Sweden, State terrorism by Ukraine, State terrorism by Japan, State terrorism by Israel, or State terrorism by India. The "domestic" viewpoint--that is, the 'home' view of the government or local media of that nation--has no role in determining what is considered state terrorism, really. Would domestic Canadian media or government in 99% of cases even refer to it's actions as state terrorism? Or any other nation? Of course not. To call the US article POV and unsalvageable is simply patriotic bluster. I love America, I live here, but if a sanctioned United Nations court said something we did for example is terrorism, guess what? It's terrorism. Editorial/domestic POV has no place in the content or name of an article. Facts are facts--whether they are locally disliked facts are irrelevant, I'm unhappy to admit. The article needs to stay, as do the others from the original forking based on this. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 22:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> From Bookmasters.com <b>Edward Herman</b>, Professor Emeritus Whalen School of the University of Pennsylvania:<i>In his State Terrorism and the United States, Frederick Gareau shows that, contrary to the war on terror imagery of a United States hostile to terrorism and dedicated to its elimination and to democracy-building, this country has regularly supported state terrorists (and dictators) who serve U.S. economic and political interests. Using as his evidentiary base the truth commission reports that have followed the ouster of terror regimes in El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, along with a varied array of sources for Indonesia, Israel, Iraq (until August 1990), and Nicaragua, he makes his case for vital U.S. support for these regimes compellingly and soberly. Gareau stresses throughout how little the U.S. public is permitted to hear about what its government has done, which provides a cover for actions the public might well disapprove, and he ends with an appeal for a much needed truth commission for the United States itself. This book is a valuable addition to the literature on terrorism.</i>Frederick Gareau himself is full tenured professor at Florida State University and holds a PhD from Amrican University. 216.95.23.6 13:52, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The really smart and talented wikipedians, regardless of their own POV, "POV diplomats", can actually research and support their POV using reliable sources. Thus far I have seen a lot of POV warriors, but I have yet to see one conservative POV diplomat.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Just a note to all, please review article as it exists today--the sources listed I believe are somewhat different than when this AfD was filed. At best I can personally see just copyediting and structure/form issues of the article now, but it does meet all WP policies (upon which the AfD should be based). Please review the article again and if needed review your keep or delete comments based on Wikipedia policy, rather than personal belief.

<dd>User:Karwynn, Amen to that. I agree. I have lost several article to POV warriors. I made a list in my archive. I also agree this article should be renamed, to a less POV term, and a less AfD prone title. This is something I will address after this AfD is behind us. User:Seabhcan, this article does have POV, and it needs to be edited by competent conservatives to give it balance. The <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladio.html" title="Gladio">Gladio</a> section is suspect, and may not even belong in the article, so is my Naom Chomsky quote. (I thought it was an excellent point, and I did not want to be accused of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> so I was forced to add the lightning of controvery, <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naom_Chomsky_28ef.html" title="Naom Chomsky">Naom Chomsky</a>, who I attempt to not quote directly or at all, if at all possible.) We need competent conservative editors, who know how to research and counter the claims on this page, not POV warriors.Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 22:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying its perfect, but it drives me crazy when voters cite 'POV' without explaining what they are refering to. As for the Gladio section, I believe it is the clearest and best documented example in the article. Counter examples are certainly needed, and infact, the Gladio example is probably the best place because although it certainly did exist, there is a case to be made that it was necessary at the time to defend against the greater evil of a soviet invasion.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 22:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I apologize for the delay. I would say an "accusations of" or "allegations of" in the title would do a lot of good, as in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_U.S._officials_176b.html" title="Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials">Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials</a>. Additionally, there is little or no refutations of several of these claims. It doesn't represent all sides. <b>But these are problems that should be worked out, not used as an excuse to delete.</b> I say merge because the two articles seem almost identical.

<dd>You make good points. Yes, such a name change would be fine by me, if we also rename the other articles on syria, etc. I also agree that the opposing view. I'll try and find sources for them. I think the merge is fine, but I think this article title, or a variation, is better than the vague and slightly insulting "American terrorism". <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 22:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed, about the refutations part. Re: <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_U.S._officials_176b.html" title="Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials">Allegations of war crimes against U.S. officials</a> <b>First</b> I do not like the word "allegations" because it is a <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:Weasel Word</a>, and I have actively attempted to delete this personally despised word from wikipedia, along with "claims" etc. "Claims" and "alleged" is a common word of POV warriors, in an attempt to lessen the statments of those who disagree with their own POV. <b>Second</b> we are not discussing war crimes per say, but terrorism, as the dictionary and the US government define it. I simply don't know what word we can replace with "terrorism". I think an alternative to a name change may be a long introduction like <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_empire.html" title="American empire">American empire</a>. But the word "terrorism" is so politically charged, like the word "imperialism" the word "(terrorism) is more often the name of the emotion that reacts to a series of events than a definition of the events themselves. Where colonization finds analysts and analogies, imperialism must contend with crusaders for and against." <b>Is there a less emotional term we can use for terrorism?</b> Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 22:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
