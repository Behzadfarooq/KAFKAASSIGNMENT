<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on my own page (which I did NOT create or help write), But I think being a well known Flash artist with several popular movies on the worlds most largest Flash portal (which also has a article) is an acceptable reason to have a Wikipedia page. It's not claiming I'm the best or anyhitng like that. It's citing what I've done, and fans might learn a thing or two.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The thing is, there are literally thousands of people on Newgrounds, being such a big portal. And the vast vast majority of it is pure pure dredge. <a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/255487" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/255487" rel="nofollow">A Sample of Joseph's work (That I helped with - Joseph)</a>. I don't see anything that lifts this from all the other stuff on Newgrounds, I don't think it's any funnier, original, professional or intelligent then anything else on the portal. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:36, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> - I'm not against Flash or anything, there can be some genuinely good stuff out there. Compare say Joseph Blanchette's work with some other random internet things - <a href="http://epic.makingithappen.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://epic.makingithappen.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">EPIC 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.zeppotron.com/lawcops/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zeppotron.com/lawcops/index.html" rel="nofollow">Lawcops, by entertainment company Zeppotron</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hahnchen , You should post a movie that I animated, drew, and wrote, not one I just helped with. This is one I did all by myself: (<a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053" class="external free" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053" rel="nofollow">http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/105053</a>) Just because I'm not the best flash animator ever dosn't mean I can't have a page about me. There are countless movie and TV actors as well, but that dons't stop people form making pages for lesser known ones. Making internet cartoons is very much like being a actor in many respects. The simple fact is I AM popular in the flash comunity, it's just the flash comunity isn't as well known as the acting one. If you want my opinion, I think there should be more entries for popualr flash artists from sites such as Newgrounds. Right now there are only a handful. It's not like its useless, pointless information. Imagine searching for your favorate Flash author on Wiki and getting a page about them. Pretty neat huh? Isn't that the point of Wikipedia? - LegendaryFrog 9:48, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Apologies</b> - I just went to a random site on the external links section and clicked on the top movie. I still don't think that your movies have had enough recognition outside newgrounds, unlike say <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xiao_21c5.html" title="Xiao Xiao">Xiao Xiao</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:55, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps more people need to do stuff like this for other Flash artists, like CaptHayfever did. It's a excellent resourse. LegendaryFrog 6:15 pm 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, that's very much what I was thinking when I did this. It just happened that the only Flash artists I know enough on to write are the Chapmans and LF, and the former was already well-documented here. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a> 05:11, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. If we delete this page, then it sounds like we shouldn't be writing articles about <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> Flash authors at all. And then there's little point in even having a Newgrounds category. I figure he's a noteworthy Flash artist. Maybe not as noteworthy as people in other fields, but noteworthy none the less. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptichan_6a3d.html" title="User:Optichan">Optichan</a> 16:40, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. While I do recognize and appreciate the fellow's submissions, he doesn't have the level of notability and uniqueness that a person such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Firth_155c.html" title="David Firth">David Firth</a> would have to merit for an article. Keeping this article would mean a green light for a whole lot of other non-notable Newgrounds artists' articles to be made. ╫ <b><a href="../../../2/5/_/User%7E25.html" title="User:25">25</a> <sup><a href="../../../2/5/_/User_talk%7E25.html" title="User talk:25"><font color="green">ring-a-ding</font></a></sup></b> 18:21, 12 August 2005 (UTC) ╫</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, I agree with the argument about the credit we give lesser-known actors and I'd like to add that Joseph's early work not only topped the charts on both <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_Player_5eac.html" title="Flash Player">Flash Player</a> back when it was first submitted, but it has inspired a generation of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia_Flash_1a63.html" title="Macromedia Flash">Macromedia Flash</a> artists in their work. It seems that every 1 in 3 comedy Flashes, whether in or outside of Newgrounds, revolve around the style established by Blanchette: the sitcom vibe, the character animation and the same type of humour has been echoed in countless submissions, of particular note being those of the The_Super_Flash_Bros/<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Helix_71e3.html" title="Double Helix">Double Helix</a> team, who have already got several Flashes in the Newgrounds top 50 with their style. I don't feel that it's unreasonable to ask for a bit of recognition to a growing industry. There is obviously an interest in this subject because even if one could accuse the page of being vanity there are still people with an interest in the subject reading and adding to these articles. Besides, there's also an educational aspect with encyclopedias: you don't use them to find things you know all to well, but things you're not sure about, even things you've never even heard of. There's already a big interest, and it can only stand to increase over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Not Only Keep, Expand.</b> I haven't visited Legendary Frog's website but I've viewed many of his Flash pieces - his Alexa rating is irrelevant if he releases on Newgrounds. In fact I'm a little surprised that The Super Flash Bros do not have an article. Their work, including Decline of Videogaming, is arguably more notable than Legendary Frog's. Certainly if the Pedia has articles on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a>, icons of dubious longevity or cultural relevance, then if enough people search for Blanchette or Dim/JT and generate this kind of talk page, they deserve to keep or gain articles. You can put me down for "Wish I'd found some content when I searched for The Super Flash Bros, and glad at least Legendary Frog got his due." Keep up the good work, Wikiers. Aug. 14 05, Frequent_pedia_user</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Everyone I know has seen at least one of his cartoons. He is one of the most famous (and one of the best by the way) flash animators on the net. I mean if animutations and YTMND can have an article, shouldn't Legendary_Frog have one? I mean he's way more popular than them. Keep it. KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
