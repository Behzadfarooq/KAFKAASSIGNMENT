<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-04_67b0.html" title="Edit section: Zombie Wars (Role-playing Game)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zombie Wars (Role-playing Game)</span></h2>
<p><b>Zombie Wars</b> is a new and independant roleplaying game or RPG developed by Lazy Bum Entertainment in April 2006. It consists mainly of the moderator and founder BaronessStormrage (an ambiguously gendered person who generally sees to the everyday play of Zombie Wars and keeps the world balanced, throwing in occasional weather, NPCs, or nerfs) and ShotgunNinja, one of the founding members.</p>
<p>Zombie Wars is a fledgling game, and is currently working through its open-alpha testing, in an attempt to find bugs. Current traffic is relatively low, compared to other text-based RPGs, but its community is steadily growing. <i>Zombie Wars</i>is free to play, supported by pop-up adds and banner hosting, and is guaranteed to contain no spyware or adware. Currently, there are no plans for any monentary fee.</p>
<p>Gameplay is divided into short sessions, called "drafts" which last until one faction stands victorious. At the end of each draft, all players are asked to either play the exact same character, or are freely allowed to create a new one from scratch and the war begins again.</p>
<p>Currently, there is only one reality, or realm included in gameplay, but with the addition of more GMs and moderators, there may be more added.</p>

<p>As this is a very young game, there isn't much of a history to speak of. The game actually began as a joke among friends about who among them would survive a zombie attack. This led the group to start forming their original "zombie chats" where they would use an IRC client or an instant messaging chatroom to host minirole-play sessions, with players divided up into zombies. These gradually evolved into the game that we have today. The gameplay was originally very abstract, but evolved into the d20 system used under the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Game_License_c519.html" title="Open Game License">Open Game License</a>. Even the classes have been greatly revamped, and although they began with less than 10, at the time of writing, they sport upwards of 50 classes, and add more whenever the heads, John Phillips and David Dong, decide to add more.</p>

<p>Unlike most text-based RPGs, Zombie Wars uses sort of a distorted time-scale. At points where the GM considers play to be too monotonous, e.g., travel, the GMs will increase the pace of gameplay. However, during massive battles where some members aren't on, a few minutes of in-game time can stretch out for hours. The pace depends strongly on the players and the GM. For this reason, the staff encourages members to log in frequently.</p>
<p>Upon creating an account, players are given a choice of Faction (Human, Hellspawn, Zombie) and a class (far too numerous to be listed). Each Class and Faction has its own strengths and weaknesses; some have access to unique spells, some have bonuses to offense or resource production, and so on. Different races also have a different number of bonus lives or "respawns".</p>

<p>Essentially, gameplay revolves around defeating all other factions and establishing your own faction as the dominant one on earth. However, the players have been known to attempt backstabbing, and many a zombie has had his brains eaten by his own ally. The path to world domination can be taken in many senses, such as subjugating the others, seducing them into joining your side, gathering magic artifacts, or even just butchering every one that you see (especially useful when the other side only has a few hundred on earth).</p>

<p>The entire Zombie Wars campaign takes place on a post-apocalyptic earth where a supernatural disease has been killing humans and turning them into zombies. The hellspawns have come from, well, Hell, but plans have not been made to begin play in this area.</p>

<p>Allen East High School is a four-year college preparatory high school in Allen County, Ohio. It was formed in the autumn of 1965 with the consolidation of the two eastern Allen County School Districts: Lafayette-Jackson and Auglaize-Local. It is the newest school in the county and is made up of a largely rural population.</p>
<p>The high school (grades 9-12) has, on average, between 270-300 students. The district is beginning to see a sharp rise in population due to the construction of its new buildings. The kindergarten class of 2006-2007 is the largest in the history of the school, with over 150 children.</p>
<p>As with many schools in Northwestern Ohio, Allen East is constructing new school facilities to accomodate its growing population. Its outdated facilities, such as the current high school (constructed in 1931 as Lafayette High School), will be torn down. The new school will open for the 2007-2008 school year.</p>

<p>Skating: A superb skater with excellent acceleration and top speed...very good first step…maintains a fast tempo throughout the game...very hard to knock down with the puck.. skates well through traffic.</p>
<p>Shot: Possesses a strong, precise wrist shot with a very quick and deceiving release: he appears to shoot the puck high, but manages to wrist it to just underneath the cross bar...possesses a great, precise backhand...though not used as often, his slap shot is very strong, with a quick release...primarily uses the slap shot on the junior squad, when he comes out as a fourth forward on a power play.</p>
<p>Technical Ability: A terrific puck handler...possesses great hand to eye coordination...very soft hands Pass: Makes very precise passes, right on the stick...sees the ice very well and makes excellent passes...in junior competition, tends to crash the net, taking two or three players with him, and then passing the puck off to the side to a wide open teammate.</p>
<p>Hockey Sense: An already very mature player...terrific vision of the ice...great awareness of his teammates.</p>
<p>Defensive Play: Mostly responsible defensively, but defensive lapses do occur as a result of his primarily offense-minded approach... skates well backwards and uses his acceleration to get back into the defensive zone, but is usually also the first player out of the zone on the offensive rush...has been more responsible defensively while playing for Super League’s Dynamo Moscow and the senior national team, than while with the U18 or U20 national teams.</p>
<p>Physical Play: At 6’3, Ovechkin is a physical power forward who has had to deal with being double teamed on the junior level for the past three seasons...solidly built and can take many hits without losing the puck...fights very well at the boards...though not known for hitting, can deliver strong hits at the boards and by the opponent’s crease.</p>
<p>These are his stats as of 2006</p>

<p>It all began with the 2000 election. In 2000, at age 12, Derek first associated himself with the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Now a freshman student at Hanover in Indiana, a Presbyterian liberal arts college, Derek's advisor is Philip L. Barlow, and Derek believes in a conservative approach to governing although he's not terribly clear on how it differs from radicalism.</p>
<p>In the 2004 election, Derek was a vocal Republican for local, state, and federal candidates. Derek made sure that his neighbors knew who he supported with giant flaming symbols supporting leaders like President Bush, Gov. Daniels, Congressman Pence, Jack Abramhof and many more. In fact, even though Derek was not old enough to vote at the time, he was able to convince his parents to help elect Gov. Daniels and re-elect President Bush (an amazing task, since Derek’s parents don't usually listen to him).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
In 2005, Derek embarked upon a new challenge in his life: attending a college. At Hanover, Derek is involved with Student Senate, Pre-Law Club, Relay for Life, Community Board of Standards (Judicial Board), and of course, College Republicans.</p>
<p>During his freshman year, Derek was (and will) continue to be a strong advocate for Republicans and conservatives. Every student has a right to voice his or her personal opinion; however, far too often, conservatives are oppressed by their sense of paranoia and loss of control issues.</p>
<p>In late 2005, an intelligent organization on campus protested the Iraq War and President Bush. In order to defend America’s military and President Bush from accountability, Derek openly voiced opposition and ordered that the protest stop. And with other conservative voices, the protest stopped (on its own, but who's counting). Numerous conservatives voiced opposition to the courageous and patriotic protests, protests against the wasted use of military men and women for an unjust war. The organization eventually apologized to the entire campus for creating “such a ruckus” despite their positive influence and role. Derek believes that the integrity of the American solider was restored to Hanover’s campus due to the values of these protestors.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
Then in April 2006, Derek officially became vice-chairman for the Southeast brotherhood of republicans for more republican brotherhoods. In his role as vice-chairman, Derek will work with College Republican chapters in southeast Indiana. Derek’s main goal will be to help elect and re-elect Republicans to the brotherhood. There are three things to know about southeast Indiana, in particular the 9th Congressional District: there are more trees than people, more registered Democrats than Republicans, and many of those Democrats are really Republicans (they just don’t know this yet).</p>
<p>Derek sees a Republican victory in November as securing America’s future. However, this election will not be won by just pushing the party. Derek hopes to push values and conservative issues. By doing so, Americans will unite for a better American, and thus, they will vote for Republican candidates.</p>
<p>Once more, Derek sees himself as a true conservative Republican. He is, by all accounts, a devoted member of the party, perhaps even too devoted. He thinks Jessica Beeson is HOT.</p>

<p>Accomplished musician <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bromberg_1440.html" title="David Bromberg">David Bromberg</a> said, "Jody Stecher was basically my teacher. He opened my ears to more beautiful music than anyone else ever did... more than I ever knew existed. He is also one of my favorite musicians on Earth to play with. I have never known anyone so intensely and completely enveloped in music. It's my suspicion that if you drained all the music out of Jody, you could carry what was left around in an eye dropper."</p>
<p>Stecherís guitar stylings have been noted as blues tinged, banjo influenced and highly inventive. They are fluid, evolving and subject to flights of fancy and improvisation in actual performance.</p>

<p>The Bergmann MG15 was the ww1 production version of the earlier MG10, brainchild of Theodor Bergman and Louis Scheisser. Like many weapons in the history of German gun production, It was somewhat ahead of its time, using modern aluminum - link belt - feed system and a short - recoil operation. Initially water cooled, it was superseded during the the war by the air cooled MG15Na (the previous water jacket was replacedby a slotted metal barrel surround) wich featered pistol grip and trigger, a recoil pad fitted to the rear of the reciever, a tripod mounting and a drum magazine to contain the belt. The MG15Na was a fine gun wich served to the 1930s, but the dominence of the maxim '08 during the war ment it never acquired mich enthusiasm from military officials.</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was <i>cacoastrum</i>, the stuff of chaos. As the flux shaped itself, it occasionally created <i>illiaster</i>, the fabric of order. A being of illiaster was sponateously created, imbued with self-preservation, and this being fought against the cacoastrum. In the struggle, six more beings were created, and together, the seven created a vast hollow orb that temporarily sealed out the chaos. These were the Firstborn: Yaweh, Satan, Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, Leviathan and Belial.</p>
<p>During the Second Wave, the walls of Heaven collapsed, and the Firstborn fought again, rebuilding their stronghold, and in the process, hundreds of archangels were created. This happened yet again, and the ordinary angels were created.</p>
<p>In the peace after the Third Wave, Heaven has been divided into four regencies. Belial, half-mad and trapped in the form of a dragon, rules the mountains of the Northern Regency, and few dare disturb his slumber. Leviathan, a kindly woman in the shape of a sea serpet, oversees the Western Regency. Satan rules the deserts of the South with his loyal servant Beelzebub, trapped in the body of a Golden retriever. Lucifer rules the plains of East, with his consort Lilith, who has recently left Satan's side. Yaweh oversees all of Heaven from the center, aided his healer Raphael and warrior Michael.</p>
<p>Other important angels include the blind musician Harut, the poetry-quoting Ariel, the craftsman Asmodai, the smirking Mephistopheles, the dour Uriel, the sneering Abdiel and the coolly competent Zaphkiel.</p>
<p>Trouble arises when Yaweh, worried about the imminent Fourth Wave, devises the Plan: the blueprint for a new, larger Heaven, with walls that the cacoastrum cannot destroy. Unfortunately, at least a thousand angels will die during the construction of his new Paradise. Yaweh charges Satan with securing the cooperation of every angel in Heaven, and Satan finds himself wondering if they have the ethical right to coerce anyone into participating.</p>
<p>Exacerbating matters is an angel named Abdiel who craves Satan's rank. Abdiel begins playing Satan against Yaweh, telling each of them that the other will no longer discuss matters. Step by step, the factions escalate. Abdiel attempts to wound Beelzebub and accidentally kills the innocent Ariel. When Satan and Beelzebub attempt to avenge this murder, Raphael and Michael misinterpret this as proof their opponents have abandoned all decency.</p>
<p>Yaweh, attempting to rally his side, convinces his supporters that he is not only the eldest of the Firstborn, he is God. This announcement stuns not only his opponents, but even Michael, his closest supporter. Using the energy of his newfound worshippers, he creates a new angel, Yeshuah, who he proclaims his son and heir.</p>
<p>As the war continues, Zaphkiel intercepts Satan and brings him directly to Yaweh, where the two discover that Abdiel has played them both for fools. Unfortunately, Satan will not acknowledge Yaweh's dishonest claim to Godhood, so the war goes on.</p>
<p>Abdiel, now on the run from both sides, begins digging a hole in the wall of Heaven, but Mephistopheles strangles him before he can finish the work. As the battle swings in Satan's favor, Yaweh, a sore loser, smashes open the hole Abdiel began, flooding Heaven with cacoastrum. Yeshuah, seeing an opportunity to enact the Plan, sacrifices his life, and apparently creates the second stronghold: the universe. Meanwhile, as the rebels fight for Heaven, Satan is captured and cast out; his followers join him in the abyss and create a third stronghold: Hell.</p>

<p>Mary Ellis has resided on what she probably thought would always be a stately piece of property overlooking the scenic Raritan River for the past 170 years. In actuality though, Mary has been had anything but a peaceful rest. Mary came to rest beneath the asphalt of the Loews Theater parking lot on Route 1 in New Brunswick in a romantic, and ultimately tragic story.</p>
<p>Mary Ellis came to New Brunswick in the 1790's to stay with her younger sister Margaret, as the legend goes. It was around this time that she met and fell in love with a man who was a sea captain, and former Revolutionary War officer. The Captain sailed down the Raritan and out to sea one day, vowing that when he returned he and Mary would be wed. He even left her his beloved horse to look after in his absence. Every day after her captain's departure, Mary would ride his horse from her sister's house, on what is now Livingston Avenue, down to the banks of the river to eagerly await a glimpse of her lover's returning ship.</p>
<p>In 1813, she purchased a parcel of farmland overlooking the river from which she would maintain her daily vigil. Mary died there fourteen years later in 1827, still faithfully anticipating her captain's return. She was buried on the property, along with her sister, some other family members, and according to local lore, the captain's horse.</p>
<p>The plot, which was originally surrounded by an ornate wrought iron fence, lay in a rural, wooded setting until the twentieth century. Over the years Mary's farm was paved over, and for many years was the site of the Route 1 Flea Market. Stranded high and dry in the market parking lot, Mary’s four-foot-high grave remained adrift in a sea of tarmac and bargain hunter-mobiles. Until recently, the small, grassy island was enclosed by a chain-link fence and sporadically maintained by Mary's descendants. Often though, the weeds on the plot were so tall that one could park right next to the grave without even noticing the two and a half foot tall marble head stone.</p>
<p>Those who did take note of the parking lot grave have always been curious about, and sometimes even inspired by it. It’s been alleged that the early 1970’s pop hit "Brandy," was really an ode to Mary. The Looking Glass, the band that wrote and recorded the song, were in fact from New Brunswick, and did record other songs based on local sites. The band's bassist, Pieter Sweval was a brother of Phi Sigma Kappa at Rutgers. "Brandy," the fine girl, according to the song, was in love with a ship captain who could not leave his true love, the sea, to marry her. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>After the demolition of the Route 1 Flea Market a few years ago the property was redeveloped and became the Loews Cineplex. The parking lot was re-graded, making Mary’s grave stand even taller than before. Still parked in a prime spot, Mary’s grave has been given a new retaining wall, and a few small trees have even been planted close by. The final resting-place of Mary Ellis seems to have been given a new lease for now.</p>

<p>The Northern Bettong is a small potoroid which is restricted to some areas of mixed open Eucalyptus woodland and Allocasuarina forest bordering rainforest in far northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p><br />
The Bettong is a solitray animal and is Nocturnal. They spend the day in a well concealed nest constructed beneath either a grass tree within a clump of grass or from other litter collected at ground level. Nesting material is carried using their prehensile tail. Ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarps are the staple diet of the northern bettong. These are dug from beneath the soil at the bases of trees, and work to date suggests that substantial nightly movements are often required to detect this patchily distributed food source. Other foods in the diet include grass roots and tubers, lilies, herbs and sedges. Northern bettongs appear to breed all year round, and like other kangaroos the young is carried in a pouch until it is old enough to follow the mother as a 'young-at-foot'.</p>
<p><br />
The Northern Bettong is an endangered animal, and only populates three regions ofQueensland, Austalia. All withtin 80 miles of eachother.</p>

<p>The company of Vineyard Vines started with ties in 1998 when two brothers, Shep and Ian Murray (who at the time were 23 and 26) decided to stop their busy work lives in New York City and moved to _________ to make, well....TIES! The ties were fun and whismical and equally as colorful. They all reflected what the two brothers love most in life : Fishing, boats and the northeatern Preppy lifestyle. "We are goning to try and make ties for other people to where so we don't have to where them anymore," said Ian. The two supplies ties for many politicians including John Kerry. Other politicians that wear the ties from Vineyard Vines include George Bush. Eight years later, Vineyard Vines is headquarted in Conneticut. The brand now has a variety of Men's and Womens clothing, it's most famous still being the ties, but the polos are now gaining great popularity amongst New England Preppies.

<p>Just what is the "infamous crime against nature" which is a crime and criminal act in many American states?</p>
<p>The "infamous crime against nature" is a very big word sodomy. And of course sodomy is oral sex, anal sex, and last but not least humans having sex with animals.</p>

<p>Multiple Description Coding is a coding technique which codes a single media stream into minimally two independent descriptions. Any, or an arbitrary combination, of these descriptions on the decoder side are used to reconstruct the media stream. Quality improves with the number of descriptions correctly received. Its main advantage, over real-time single description (SD) video coding, is its robustness to errors in an unreliable network.</p>

<p>87.254.69.75 20:15, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Doug Harpool is a Springfield resident with an extraordinary record of accomplishments. For a decade he served as state representative from the 134th District of south Springfield, a traditional Republican stronghold. Harpool is a Democrat. He was 26 when first elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in November 1982. But he was hardly a political neophyte; by then he had already worked in the campaigns of Mel Carnahan for treasurer and Jerry Litton for U.S. Senator, and he was president of the 7th District Young Democrats.</p>
<p>Once elected to the statehouse, Harpool “cut a wide swath for a freshman legislator,” according to the Springfield Leader &amp; Press (June 22, 1984). That fall, the city’s two daily newspapers both endorsed Harpool for reelection.</p>
<p>The Daily News’ editorial board noted that Harpool “may have sponsored, got passed and had an influence on more legislation than any first-year legislator in recent years.” The Leader &amp; Press (then the city’s afternoon newspaper) affirmed the nod, writing: “He did an outstanding job in his first term in office. It is rare that a freshman legislator achieves anything, but Harpool succeeded in introducing and getting passed two bills that were signed into law by Gov. Christopher Bond,” a Republican. While serving as a state representative, Harpool personally wrote many of Missouri’s toughest laws to combat crime. He helped create a bill of rights for victims of violent crime, to protect them during the judicial process. His Safe Schools Act established harsher penalties and longer prison terms for drug dealers who sell drugs near schools. He was an outspoken leader in the fight against drunken drivers, and a tireless supporter of strict laws to protect children from abuse and neglect. Harpool is most remembered as “Mr. Ethics,” the lawmaker who was “willing to fight the chummy, closed ways of Jefferson City for the sake of openness in state government,” according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</p>
<p>He personally fought for ethics legislation, using the debating skills which earned him scholarships to college to persuade fellow legislators that reform was necessary.</p>
<p>Harpool’s reforms banned politicians from using campaign funds for personal use, and required greater disclosure of financial interests held by public servants. Reaction was overwhelming, and positive. The St. Joseph News-Press: “The law is on target by making officials more honest and more responsive to the public instead of lobbyists.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “Mr. Harpool’s bill … is a real threat to the business-as-usual gang in Jefferson City.”</p>
<p>The Springfield News-Leader: “Harpool has been the exception to the stereotype of the play-safe politician … it is time to offer a vote of thanks to Doug Harpool for his skill, commitment and determination in representing Springfield to the rest of Missouri.” Harpool narrowly lost a bid to become Springfield’s state senator in 1994. He has since worked in the private sector as an attorney with one of Springfield’s largest law firms. His return to politics comes as Missouri, and the country, are embroiled in ethics scandals involving politicians. His first act as senator from the 30th District will be to introduce the “Return to Public Service Initiative.”</p>
<p>Other facts about Harpool: •He was president of the Student Government Association at Southwest Missouri State University (Missouri State Currently), from which Doug and all four of his brothers are graduates. •Speaking of that school, Harpool first called for a name change to Missouri State University while serving in the statehouse in the 1980s. •He was named to Who’s Who in America’s Colleges and Universities. •While in law school (University of Missouri-Columbia), he won the Thomas Deacy Prize and the Roscoe Anderson Award for outstanding accomplishments in advocacy. •He was chosen as one of the Outstanding Young Men in America (1982-84). •He was named Outstanding Young Springfieldian (1986). •He (and his four brothers, and all three of his children) attended elementary, junior high and high school in the Springfield Public Schools. •He will turn 50 in June 2006</p>

<p>... is a small and pleasant cotswold vilage, it is no different from any other small and pleasant cotswold village, apart from the fact that i live there, which may not matter to you but is very important, suprisingly, to me. It consists of about twenty houses, a petrol station and a very fine pub called the Five Mile House. Its neibouring villages of Duntisbourne Rouse (historically more important because of the church), Duntisbourne Leer (very similar to Duntisbourne Abbots) and Middle Duntisbourne (populated by approximately 1 family, 3 chickens and 5 dogs) Everywhere needs a profile even a village of such little importance, this does not meamn to say that it's very existance is meaningless; many people have lived here all their lives and this village is what keeps them going. Thank you for reading this article, the stated facts are true and the emotional veiws are merely a subject of popular opinion and do not represent the veiws of the village as a whole. Thank you again for having the courtesy to read my article.</p>

<p>Cistercians first came to Norway in 1146 to Lyse Kloster. They were in Norway until the period of the Reformation in the 16th century. The first permanent monastery of Cistercians to return to Norway came in 1999, to the island of Tautra in Trøndelag (central Norway). This is a monastery of nuns: Tautra Mariakloster. The monastery is established not very far from the ruins of the old, medieval Cistercian monastery. The seven Cistercians nuns who established the monastery hope to be a point of contact and exchange between the Norwegian tradition and Cistercian spirituality.</p>

<p>Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow. The book starts slowly and builds tension only towards the end. It is about several men and women united by mystic experiences. People of the circle identify one another by interest to the book of Ezekiel from the Bible. The circle exists in Australia and includes an old maid, an aborigine and Holocaust survivor. The book climaxed in a scene, where Anti-Semites stage a mock crucifixion of a Holocaust survivor, former professor, working in a small factory. The owner of the factory is baptized Jew, who is afraid to interfere. The Abo member of circle thrice denies any connection to the crucified, which dies several days later. It is interesting that in spite of the author being homosexual, the Abo hero is shown as a victim of sexual harassment from a homosexual priest. The book shows possibility of rich spiritual life of an ordinary people.</p>

<p>The Northside Gangsters, also known as the "Potato Salad Northside Gangsters", are a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> group formed in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houghton%2C_MI_78dc.html" title="Houghton, MI">Houghton, MI</a>. The group takes pride in their lack of talent in all areas of rap, often resulting in what they consider to be humorous lyrics. Though both members claim to have problems with crack cocaine, it is disputable whether or not this holds true for reality. Though the band has yet to release an album, their website on <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> has generated significant interest among those who know hip-hop.</p>

<p>Last December, Kevin Federline was reported spent some time in Las Vegas with porn star, Kendra Jade, while Britney was away in Louisiana with her mom and baby Sean Preston. American tabloid the Star is dropping the bombshell accusation that Brit's husband K-Fed has cheated on her with ex-adult film star Kendra Jade during a weekend getaway in Las Vegas. It's also reported that Kevin was allegedly kicked out of their house and run away with his Ferrari.</p>

<p>Father Renzo Mancin is the The Chief Scout of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Ethiopia Scout Association is the national Scouting association of Ethiopia. The Association was re-established in 2002 after being inactive since 1999. Due largely to the efforts of Father Mancin.</p>

<p>The Scout movement was first introduced in Ethiopia circa 1933, however the association was forced to terminate its activities due to the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936. Scouting was revived in Ethiopia in 1948, when Scout activities gained a foothold in the schools of Ethiopia. Ethiopia was recognized as a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1969.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is also a former member of WAGGGS, last mentioned in 1984, now part of the Ethiopia Scout Association.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Scouts assisted during the nation's droughts and famines in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as literacy campaigns and other community services. In the 1970s, Ethiopian Scouts established a new training and camping center at Lake Langano. The Ethiopia Scout Association enxperienced its second demise in the early 1970s, when the marxist military regime Derg dissolved the association and confiscated its properties and funds, under the accusation that the values of faith enshrined in the Scout promises were incompatible with the philosophy pursued by the new regime.</p>
<p>After twenty years of effort, with the emergence of the democratic system, and in accordance with the proclamation number 512/59, the Ethiopia Scout Association was re-established in 1995. The 35th World Scout Conference, convened in Durban, South Africa July 26-30, 1999, voted to remove Ethiopia from WOSM membership because the national Scout organization had ceased to exist (although earlier that year an Ethiopian contingent had attended the World Scout Jamboree in Chile). The Ethiopia Scout Association was readmitted to the WOSM at the World Scout Conference in Greece in July, 2002, the result of ten years effort by Father Renzo Mancin, the Chief Scout of Ethiopia, commissioners and other members of the Ethiopia Scout Association, who worked to get the association recognized again at the world level. Soon after this most recent recognition by WOSM, with the support of the Africa Regional Office, the Ethiopia Scout Association organized a number of training courses, and conducted recruitment drives and public relation activities.</p>
<p>Presently there are 3,650 Scouts (as of 2004), compared to 9,829 in 1972.</p>

<p>A subaudible tone is a tone that is used to fire an automated event at a radio station. A subaudible tone is not inaudible; however, it is usually at a volume level that is not noticable to the average listener at normal volume levels. These tones are included in the audible main portion of audio in the case of satellite; on tape, these often are filtered. Normally, subaudible tones are at one of the following frequencies: 25, 35, 50, 75 Hertz(HZ) or combinations of those frequencies. Until computerized radio automation became inexpensive and common, 25 and 35 HZ were used either in the audio stream or on a special channel (in the case of "carts") on the tape to indicate to a radio station's automation system that it was time to fire another event; with the advent of computers and digital satellite, these tones are relegated to triggering commerical announcements and legal ID's on a dwindling number of radio networks, as tones in the audio have been supplanted by relay closures sent independent of audio on digital satellites (Starguide being a prominent system).</p>

<p>Stem cells have been discovered in hair follicles and some researchers predict research on these follicle stem cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication, also called hair cloning within three or four years (as of November 2004). This treatment is expected to initially work through taking stem cells from existing follicles, multiplying them in cultures, and implanting the new follicles into the scalp. Later treatments may be able to simply signal follicle stem cells to transmit chemical signals to nearby follicle cells which have shrunk during the aging process, which respond to these signals by regenerating and once again making healthy hair. Unfortunately, this new approach to treating baldness appears to be taking longer than expected. The first products are now expected to hit the market in 2009/2010. However, it remains unclear how effective they are going to be. It has been suggested that only future generations of HM will allow patients to grow as much hair as they want. HM is being developed by two independent companies: ARI (Aderans Research Institute, a Japanese owned company in the USA) and Intercytex, a company in Manchester (UK).</p>

<p>"Requiem for a Hit" is a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronica.html" title="Electronica">electronica</a> single by <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Kittin_6ce6.html" title="Miss Kittin">Miss Kittin</a>, from her album <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Com_2764.html" title="I Com">I Com</a>.</p>
<p><br />
"Requiem for a Hit" is probably Miss Kittin's second most-remembered commercial single ("Frank Sinatra" was the first). Like "Frank Sinatra", "Requiem" contains explicit lyrics, although the content in "Requiem" is much more watered-down. A notable example is probably the most famous line in the song: "I beat, I beat, I beat, I beat, I beat that bitch with a hit". Another example is one of Miss Kittin's lines: "Um, excuse me, would you mind to...pump?" It did quite well for itself, becoming an instant dancefloor hit, and also appearing on Mixing Me and LFO For Kittin, an exclusive 2-track single. It was also a major transition from the silly, light-dance-ish sounds of her venture with The Hacker.</p>

<p>"ICMP tunnel" is a way to establish connection between two remote computers (named client and proxy) using only ICMP echo request and reply packets. Typical example of this technique would be tunneling complete TCP traffic over ping requests and replies.</p>
<p><a name="Technical_Details" id="Technical_Details"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-04_67b0.html" title="Edit section: Technical Details">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technical Details</span></h3>
<p>Tunneling is based on arbitrary data that could be injected into the echo packet and sent to the remote computer. Remote computer could reply in the same manner, injecting his answer into another ICMP packet and sending it back. The client performs all communication using ICMP echo request packets, while the proxy use echo reply packets. In theory, it is possible to have the proxy also use echo request packets (and make implementation much easier), but these packets are not necessarily forwarded to the client as client could be behind translated address (NAT). This bidirectional data flow can be abstracted with ordinary serial line.</p>
<p>Tunneling is often used ilegally, to bypass firewalls which do not block icmp packets, or establish hard to trace, encrypted communication channel between two computers without direct network interaction.</p>
