<li>I'm not particularly attached to the notion of there being a "Two Finger Test" article <i>per se</i>. The only real expansion potential that I see for this article is the inclusion of yet further tests that people have that involve the use of two fingers in some way. I haven't found one that is individually <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">notable</a>. Collectively, they aren't particularly notable, either, given their diversity and the tautology of what is common to all. It's a test, that involves the use of two fingers. Gosh. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:11, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)</li>

<li>Someone has googled for "two finger test" and linked all the results. Please redirect to Google. I mean: <b>DELETE</b>. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 20:46, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At Dpb's request: a two finger test must be unreliable due to the size difference in fingers. A doctor with <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acromegaly.html" title="Acromegaly">acromegaly</a> would find the woman a virin, while his colleage with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marfan_syndrome.html" title="Marfan syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a> would find the opposite. Visual inspection of the introitus is probably much more informative, and requires no fingers. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:46, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm guessing that someone has tidied the entry after most users here posted.

<li>Seriously, are all (any?) of these "two finger tests" encyclopedic in their own right? They're just a grab-bag of Google results for the phrase. Even the "adolescent folklore" bit has no source for it... Supercool Dude is not an adolescent according to his user page, and "S.A. Suriano" may not even exist (see discussion below). Is there a need to keep even the modified article? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 17:16, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. It should not be kept. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> who turned up all the other "two-finger tests" was making an interesting and valid point, but none of them is worthy of a whole article and collecting them into a list is no more encyclopedic than a list of <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_thumb.html" title="Rules of thumb">rules of thumb</a> would be. (I'm typing this in, don't know yet whether <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_thumb.html" title="Rules of thumb">rules of thumb</a> will turn out to be a redlink or not!) And you're right that the phrase "adolescent fantasy," which is my language, is just my surmise, I was trying to reword that paragraph to be less tendentious than <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s original language, "What the Two Finger Test is not, is a test to see whether a woman is a virgin." Nobody has yet given any source other than <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupercool_Dude_cf24.html" title="User:Supercool Dude">Supercool Dude</a> himself for the existence of any real <i>or</i> mythical "two finger test for virginity."

<li>Back in the early 1990's I saw a woman (Kimberly Bergalis) who testified in a Florida Court of Law that she was still a Virgin and they proved to the Judge that she was not. I asked my Surgeon who was a Board Certified Urologist how they could tell!<br />
He told me of this TFT and said that a woman who has repeated Sexual Intercourse will become "loose" and stay that way.<br />
I asked my Sister an Brother In Law who are physicians and they said yes it is true! Are there any MD's here in Wikipedia?<br />
I stand for speaking the Truth! You guys are politically correct children!<br />

<li>No problem, then. Under "references," or on Talk:Two Finger Test, give the names and professional contact information of the doctors who told you this, so the information can be verified. "Dr. so-and-so, (year), thus-and-such clinic, city, state, personal communication." I'll call when I get a chance this week and if I can verify the information I'll change my vote to "keep." One of them can probably give me a relevant citation to whatever code specifies that this is the legal definition (in whatever state this applies to).</li>
<li>The information may be true, but we have to have a verifiable source for it. See <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Wikipedia:Cite your sources</a>. Verifiable means that someone else can check it.

<li>The story about Kimberly Bergalis is false, in any case. She was, as per my memory, but more importantly, as per the <i>Washington Times</i> (09/17/91), p. F2, a "nonhemophiliac virgin" who contracted AIDS from her Florida dentist Stewart Acer. It was the first case of such transmission, and her virginity was certainly not "disproved", no matter what one's brother-in-law says. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:30, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
