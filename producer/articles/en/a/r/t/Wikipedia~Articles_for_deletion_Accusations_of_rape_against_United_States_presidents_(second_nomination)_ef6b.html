<p>The section on Jefferson includes the relationship between him and Sally Hemings, which is covered extensively on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Hemings_cccb.html" title="Sally Hemings">Hemings'</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_jefferson.html#The_Sally_Hemings_controversy" title="Thomas jefferson">Thomas Jefferson's</a> pages. The accusation of rape is merely speculative. The accusation against Ronald Reagan contains only the account by the accuser. There is simply not enough evidence for this to be considered a notable accusation, an argument which is supported by the brevity of the section. Perhaps the only notable accusation on this page is the one against Bill Clinton, but that accusation is already covered on <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juanita_Broaddrick_fb76.html" title="Juanita Broaddrick">Juanita Broaddrick's</a> page. The accusation against Bush is a joke. The demented ramblings of a crazy person are non-notable. Because the only worthwhile accusation (made against Clinton) is already covered elsewhere, I'm nominating this page for deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablothegreat85_bfd1.html" title="User:Pablothegreat85">Pablothegreat85</a> 19:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>False and slanderous. I created the article for exactly the opposite purpose. Anon's kept jamming the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton articles full of this stuff. I got sick of it and decided to spin it off to a sub-article. <b>That</b> avoids the undue weight problem that was in fact present in the main articles. It certainly does not disparage, but makes quite clear that there's not much evidence in any of these notable accusations. It's plainly equal-opportunity politically, so I can't imagine what soapbox you think I was standing on. "Accusation" is not OR, what a bizarre statement, there clearly was an accusation. The article <b>reports</b> the accusation and the evidenced adduced for it elsewhere. It does not make the accusation itself. If you care to make an argument without shrill hysteria about the nefarious motives of other authors, it would be welcome. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It sounds to me like you were upset that anonymous users were vandalizing those pages with this stuff (as well you should be), so you created this page and filled it with the content with which these anonymous users were vandalizing the page. If this is the case (and it may not be), why would vandalism on the presidents' individual pages be acceptable for a separate page? <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablothegreat85_bfd1.html" title="User:Pablothegreat85">Pablothegreat85</a> 01:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I said nothing of the kind. It wasn't vandalism or I would simply have deleted it. This is a perfectly legitimate subject for Wikipedia; it meets all criteria. The problems was that the material violated the undue weight section of NPOV policy given the emphasis in the main article. I created this at approximately the same time that Arbcom itself recommended the <i>exact same remedy</i> for the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article. The point is to keep the main article on a subject to the main points; that doesn't imply that other lesser points can't be included elsewhere in Wikipedia. If it does, we'll delete half the damn thing. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>delete</b> POV fork to address vandals, undue weight, etc but POV fork nonetheless. It needs to be in the articles with apropriate weight which is less than a sentence. Or better yet, if the accuser is notable, it should be in the accusers bio and leave the details out of the presidents' bio completely. Even having an article that addresses presidential rape accusations is undue weight. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 01:30, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, because it doesn't promote or take a POV. There's nothing at all POV about the article. Arbcom itself endorsed this approach to the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> mess, which is about when I created this article, with that experience and remedy in mind. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The accusations against Clinton have never been shown to be unreasonable and there's always been a lot to them. <s>To blather on about slander shows a partisan spirit and POV.</s> If accusations against the other presidents have something to them or don't, we might as well present them fairly. It's a public service not to leave it only to conspiracy theorists and cranks. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one has said that the Clinton allegation is unreasonable. In my nomination, I wrote, "Perhaps the only notable accusation on this page is the one against Bill Clinton." Furthermore, no one has suggested that the allegations should be presented unfairly. The whole issue here is how to fairly present the accusations, if at all (which only the Clinton one should be). <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablothegreat85_bfd1.html" title="User:Pablothegreat85">Pablothegreat85</a> 01:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But that's simply not accurate. The Reagan accusation received quite wide coverage at the time, though it was not widely believed. Jefferson is hugely well known and publicized, though it is admittedly of a different character than the others (and was added by someone else). Clinton goes without saying. The Bush accusation is the most tenuous; it surely would have gone without note in the pre-internet age. However, it is in fact widely known, and the coverage here does a public service I think because neutral coverage pretty clearly implies that the poor woman was desperately ill. Many of the highly partisan sources on the web make it sound like there was a cover-up. I personally think that none of these accusations is accurate, but then the article is not titled "rapes by presidents". <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think we can put the Clinton discussion to rest. It seems to be consensus that that accusation is notable. Jefferson's <i>relationship</i> with Sally Hemings is widely known, and it is clearly notable. What I don't like is that there is no evidence of rape in the article. Instead, the article quotes speculative sources, and in turn, appears speculative itself. I'm not sure that the Bush rape is that well-known. Should we include content every time a crazy person accuses the president of a misdeed (and I'm sure they've been accused of far worse deeds than rape)? <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablothegreat85_bfd1.html" title="User:Pablothegreat85">Pablothegreat85</a> 02:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Some argue that consent is not possible between slave and owner, thus rape by modern standards. The point is arguable, but the accusation has clearly been made. If you feel the article is not clear enough about the issues, then constructive response is to edit the article to improve it, rather than delete it. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 03:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I understand why the article was created, but much of this is spurious and without credibility...even though it supposedly cross examines each issue. I don't think that the information in here is notable enough to warrant inclusion. Allusion to crimal acts in biographies should be avoided at all costs or all we are is a repository of indiscrimnate misinformation.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your AGF Mongo. I understand your concern. However, when a story has been covered by the likes of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times as each of the Reagan, Clinton, and Jefferson cases was, it's not indiscriminate information. It's already notable, we're not adding to that. Its notability that means we have a role to play as a neutral repository of information whether or not the accusations are true. Certainly a great many of the crazy claims against the Clintons are completely unsubstantiated and meritless, and yet we have articles on those which received national coverage and rightly so. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 04:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

It's like having an article called 'Actors that played Tarzan' totaly pointless. <span style="font-weight: bold;padding: 2px;background-color: white;border: 1px solid green"><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01"><font size="2;" color="green"><b>Mobile 01</b></font></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User_talk%7EMobile_01_2f77.html" title="User talk:Mobile 01"><font color="red"><i><sup>Talk</sup></i></font></a></span> 23:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as POV magnet and playground. The "information" is based on frivolous accusations, and the thing is the title of the article just targets United States presidents. Should it be more neutral by being titled <i>Accusations of rape against world leaders</i>? Even if were to be renamed as such, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues/concerns would make it hard to maintain. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunglecat_ec45.html" title="User:Junglecat"><font color="green">JungleCat</font></a> <small><a href="../../../j/u/n/User_talk%7EJunglecat_4799.html" title="User talk:Junglecat"><font color="blue">Shiny!</font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Junglecat_98e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Junglecat"><font color="blue">Oohhh!</font></a></small> 23:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because there are only these small number of accusations, the 1 or 2 notable ones are worth separate articles , and the others go into the general bios article. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> IMHO, this is not encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not for the sum total of all human knowledge. Content about presidents from the USA that have <i>actually</i> raped might be more <i>noteworthy</i>, but that would belong in the biographies of those presidents. — Rico 16:42, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Accusations of criminal misconduct against a US president is of historical value. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 02:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The notable cases are/should be discussed in each individual bio; the rest is unencyclopedic chatter which doesn't belong on Wiki. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and merge the relevant bits into the relevant bios as was mentioned above, otherwise it is forking, really.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 00:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>I do not think that this page will promote the harm that is alledged, as long as they stay only accusations. Clay hatcher 02:24, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
