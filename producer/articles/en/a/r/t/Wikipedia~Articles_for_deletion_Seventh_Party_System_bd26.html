<p>Article was prodded, but author deprodded for consistency with First to Sixth Party System. It looks to me as if the whole range is fairly unnotable, but that the use of the terms declines dramatically to the end of the range, making the article Seventh Party System a case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Seventh Party System gets 10 distinct Google hits, which is terribly low for something that only started in 1994. Of these links, at least this one<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/2897/index54.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/2897/index54.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> lets the seventh start in 2000 at the earliest. This article<a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/polparties/sexracrel.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jofreeman.com/polparties/sexracrel.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> only agrees on the first five (which are not up for deletion), and sees the outlines of a seventh system only in 1996. So we have very few references for a seventh party system, and the few we have disagree seriously. This makes the concept non notable and the article <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> or at least not according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and hard to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. By the way, we even have only 59 distinct Google hits for the Sixth Party System, so the whole concept seems to be a bit out of fashion... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:47, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I say we Keep this article. I surely agree that there may be disagreement as to when the Seventh began, but that point is worthy of noting in the article itself. It certainly isn't a valid reason or point to delete the article. If you feel the whole range is unnotable, perhaps the proposal to delete should be the whole range, not just one part of it. In fact by selectively deleting only this one portion, it would leave the reader confused as to the missing time frame (that you propose to delete.) I don't believe there would be much support at all to delete the entire range, as it is a scholarly term and subject much studied. As far as google hits, many somewhat abstract scholarly discussions will not find a wide discourse in general society. That surely is no reason to delete from wikipedia, or any encyclopedia for that matter. (You will find many topics with articles in wikipedia that are far less scholarly or otherwise used than this, and they too are worthy of maintaining inclusion.) Wikipedia has no requirements as far as numerical google hits.</li>

<p>I hope my comments help with some context as to the need for this article, as part of the series.</p>

<dd>On a further note, being that we were discussing google results, John H. Aldrich of Duke University is one of the scholars as far back as in 1997 (in Political Science Quarterly, see <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195(199724%2F199824)112%3A4%3C541%3ATTTRRI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195(199724%2F199824)112%3A4%3C541%3ATTTRRI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> ) made the polical science observation that we are currently in the Seventh Party System.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-historical, nonreferenced. Just because some poly sci wonks have speculated about a seventh party realignment, it does not mean it should be presented as a scholarly consensus, as this article appears to do. From a practical standpoint, the article makes no argument for any great sea change in the parties in 1994, only that the Republicans took control of the Congress in that year. I don't see why the "Seventh Party System" would not have begun in 1980 ("<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_Revolution_b6cf.html" title="Reagan Revolution">Reagan Revolution</a>"; "<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_coalition.html" title="Reagan coalition">Reagan coalition</a>" controls Congress) or 1972 (<a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Presidential_Election%2C_1972_fe0b.html" title="U.S. Presidential Election, 1972">Nixon Landslide</a>, effective death of '60s-style big government liberalism). <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<dl>
<dd>Allon, I think you would be better suited to suggest the article be updated to clarify your points, rather than delete the article in its entirety. Certainly it has historical value, and we have some references in this discussion (see above) that ought to be included in the article itself. As far as scholarly consensus is concerned, we could discuss in the article any scholarly disagreements as to the timeframe of the Seventh, when it began, when the Sixth ended, etc. In 1994 the Congress became Republican for the first time in 40 (fourty) years.) That it seems is quite a sea change. It certainly is a strong argument for the scholars who classify the Seventh beginning in 1994. In any event, these points ought to be mentioned in the article. (Hence the reason why the article is currently classified as a 'stub'.) <a href="../../../1/6/9/User%7E169.132.18.248.html" title="User:169.132.18.248">169.132.18.248</a> 14:54, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the term is only used by very few authors, and even those disagree on when and how. What makes "seventh party system" notable? Being the logical next after "sixth" is no argument,a we could then just create "eigth", "ninth" and "tenth" as well. e should have articlse on scientific terms that are widely used in their speciality, but it looks like "seventh party system" is not widely used at all and is rather obscure. When it gets more mainstream (at least to the level of "fifth party system", although even fourth and fifth party system are still pretty obscure), then an article would be warranted. Now, it seems that only very few authors / scholars use the term, while mainstream politicologists / historians don't use this classification, certainly not for recent times. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fram, As mentioned previously, your argument then should be do delete the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Party_System_2927.html" title="Sixth Party System">Sixth Party System</a> as well, not just the Seventh. Now your saying even the 4th &amp; 5th are "pretty obscure" (in your words), it seems you are arguing to delete the whole series. Are you planning to propose to delete this series piecemeal, one by one? I don't think there is the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_consensus.html" title="Rough consensus">rough consensus</a> needed for that.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This discussion has gotten off track. The argument isn't that this is an obscure poly sci term, but that <i>to the extent</i> political scientists have spoken of this term it has been speculative. This article passes it off as common wisdom that there was a party realignment in 1994-- which it isn't-- and does so completely absent of sourcing. Now, if someone were to add sources to the article, that would be a VERY different situation. The point is, as it is written the article is very misleading; there is no consensus or even substantial academic support that I know of for the idea that a new party system began in 1994. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 23:35, 22 September 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Allow time for additional stuff--references,etc. The Sixth article is no more informative than the seventh. Both are listed as stubs. Since poli scientists to a certain extent use both, allow discussion of who agrees with it and who not <i>in the article itself</i>. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomehouse_ccf1.html" title="User:Homehouse">Homehouse</a> 00:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see there is 3 Keeps and 2 Deletes (not counting an anonymous vote.) Can we remove the tag from the article?
