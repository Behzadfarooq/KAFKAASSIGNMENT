<li><b>Delete</b> -- I now feel confident both articles should be handled the same way -- if this phenomena of cliche pictures is encyclopedic, then write about that in an appropriately titled article, but this seems to just be a non-notable intricacy of the barely notable forum site Fark.com which is something that should not expand into a whole article on its own, because people just would not look for something like this in an ecyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. We're discussing this because a related VfD is in play (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Ha_ha_guy_4089.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ha ha guy">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ha ha guy</a>). IMO the related VfD should result in a redirect, and this should be kept, because this article is already encyclopedic and interesting, and because of the likelihood this will be an even more encyclopedic article. After all, we've VfDd and kept an article about a woman who's only encyclopedic accomplishment in life was to climb mt everest in a skirt and wrote a book about it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Frances is a douchebag. Then again, so are Drew Curtis and Jeff, the two head honchos behind fark.com, so it's not like fark users aren't used to that sort of thing. Anyway, as I've said before -- when we use fark, we try to forget about its many, many flaws (such as the unfair deletions, paying to be linked on the main page, the superiority complexes of TotalFarkers, etc.). Some of what helps us forget are the funny cliches and articles that appear. The "Ha Ha" guy is one of those cliches. It's almost like someone has to die of cancer and the article linked to the main page for the admins and moderators -- as well as Fark posters both lite and TF -- to not be douchebags. When you attack the items used from the site, you attack its users as well. Most think its funny, and most think it is relevant. If you are going to delete it, and I don't think you should, then at least link the stupid thing to fark.com which you SHOULD have done in the first place. Which makes me think, if you are going to link it to fark.com, and have it listed as being relevant to the site, wouldn't it need its own entry to explain WHY it's there in the first place? Granted, Admiral Ackbar is listed due to Star Wars. But he has additional significance as it relates to Fark.com. It's really a fine line here, but why make such a big deal out of it? When it comes down to it, it's just an image, and you guys at Wikipedia aren't exactly the most superior life forms on the Internet, either. Nobody is really going to notice this after it calms down, and now that it's one day later after one of the Fark admins went off his ritalin and all but demanded that Fark posters who liked the image stopped using it, things ARE beginning to calm down a bit. At least, that's the way it seems to me. --68.158.111.157 01:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article indeed seems to be much more informative than the original "Ha Ha Guy" article. I have done a lot of reading on what does and does not constitute a valid Wikipedia article. Everything I have read so far suggests that the article is completely legit. These internet memes are fascinating and I see no reason whatever to remove them. There are no space constraints - as previously mentioned, this is not a paper encyclopedia! Furthermore, the arrogance of those that seek to remove the page is disgusting to me. If the article is not "noteworthy" to you, simply don't read about it. I find lots of stuff in the Chinese language Wikipedia to be "not noteworthy", yet I am not parading around trying to remove the content. I think Wikipedia was built for articles like this in mind. --<a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigizen_3647.html" title="User:Digizen">Digizen</a> 02:47, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Contrary to the dismissive sniffing above, this is a useful article. I myself searched here for HA! HA! Guy several times during the course of his meteoric rise to fame/infamy -- to no avail. Only today did I finally find something with useful information -- history and origin, in my case. I know there are <i>many</i> people curious about just where this came from, and finding answers is what an encyclopedia is for -- right? --Atario 05:35, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Besides, if every "non-encyclopedic" concept were wiped from Wikipedia, it would be as marketable as yesterday's newspaper. Ceremony1968 01:35, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
