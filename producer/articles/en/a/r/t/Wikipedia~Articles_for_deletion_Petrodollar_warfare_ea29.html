<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. This seems like a vanity page to showcase someone's research (though it is so poorly written as to suggest it probably wasn't the work of the author showcased). As pointed out on its talk page, most of the google hits for this page point to advertisements for this guy's book or to blogs. On Lexis/Nexis I searched full text for all available dates for "petrodollar warfare" in major papers, then in all news transcripts, then in all wire reports, for all available dates, and did not come up with a single citation for an article mentioning that phrase. <b>Not one</b>. A search of EBSCOHost for academic journals found not a single use of the phrase. A <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Petrodollar+Warfare&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Petrodollar+Warfare&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google search of books</a> mentioning the phrase returns nothing. The <b>only</b> result on Google scholar is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22petrodollar+warfare%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22petrodollar+warfare%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">a link to an essay by Clark</a> posted to a site called "ratville times."

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. And a <b>comment</b> regarding notability: the publisher's blurb on the author (William R. Clark) asserts notability as "manager of performance improvement at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine" (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865715149/ref=pd_sbs_b_1/103-6355449-2117458?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865715149/ref=pd_sbs_b_1/103-6355449-2117458?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>), though the actual <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3877" class="external text" title="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3877" rel="nofollow">publisher's website</a> makes no such claim and a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22manager+of+performance+improvement%22+%2B%22Johns+Hopkins%22+-Clark&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22manager+of+performance+improvement%22+%2B%22Johns+Hopkins%22+-Clark&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> finds scant evidence of such a position that's not referenced to Clark.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a conspiracy theory, but that is irrelevant. <b>Trying to verify</b> if the theory is incorrect however <b>is original research</b>. Journalists, a concressman, a professor and university lecturs have, as can be seen in external links section, written on the matter. Petrodollar warfare gives <b>57,300 Google hits</b> therefore is is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think a move to a new title is needed, but the theory itself is actually notable. I ran into this whole thing on a website about hybrid cars and gas prices. I then came to Wikipedia to read about <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar.html" title="Petrodollar">petrodollars</a> and Iraq's move to Euros in 2000. Then I ran into this article. The theory can be found in many journal articles as can be seen in the "External Links" section. So a new title is needed because this is not just W.R.Clark's invention, but a delete is not warranted. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihai_da56.html" title="User:Mihai">Mihai</a> 04:24, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The theory cannot be found in any journal articles, at least not in any that have undergone peer review (or, for that matter, any that are in the EBSCOHost database, which includes many magazines and non-peer-reviewed journals as well).

<dd>SCloat You seem to be unaware of wikipedia guidelines. Peer-review has NOTHING to do with whether the article should be kept. The wikipedia guideline for notability even mentions conpiracy theories and having only 1-2 proponents of the idea as valid. As long as journalist and bloggers, etc. picks up the idea it is noteworthy. Go read the guidelines and change your vote. Stop mentioning peerreviewing as it is irrelevant, to reseach if the idea has any real merit is to do original research. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngwar_628f.html" title="User:Engwar">A human</a> 15:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No; original research occurs when you use wikipedia to showcase theories that are otherwise not notable. Quoting Ron Paul and claiming that the quote has something to do with "petrodollar warfare" is original research. That is what is happening here. I don't mind this idea being mentioned in an article about ludicrous conspiracy theories believed by only one person or something, but there is no way this "theory" deserves its own page. Peer review, as well as mention in newspapers or other print media, is a much better way to measure notability than google hits. Again, if this theory has another name that is more easily found in such sources, let's hear about it. The fact that those defending the theory can't suggest such a name indicates that it probably doesn't have one. I agree with the MLA comment below that <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">Oil imperialism theories</a> would be a good place to mention this if it must be mentioned.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>R.Paul talks about <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar_hegemony.html" title="Dollar hegemony">Dollar hegemony</a> and how that leads and already has lead or been part of a rationale for warfare. Now he may not have called it <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar_warfare.html" title="Petrodollar warfare">Petrodollar warfare</a> but that is the same as this Clack is saying. They both argue that oil producers switching to selling in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroeuro.html" title="Petroeuro">Petroeuro</a> will hurt USD and therefore US might force them to return to USD. Clark just 'invented' a word to go with it. That how I see it. Listening to Rons speech it become obvious they are saying the same thing. It is not a scientific theory, in fact it implies that the US government is lying about rationales for wars, by definition it is a conspiracy theory. So why all that fuss about peer-reviews? It is a fringe theory, but wikipedia says that <b>"The following are not original research: 6. The ideas have become newsworthy: they have been repeatedly and independently reported in newspapers or news stories"</b> and google hits and the various external links confirms that. Wikipedias <a href="../../../f/r/i/Wikipedia%7EFringe_theories_37ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Fringe theories">guideline for fringe theories</a> states: <b>"Any non-mainstream theories should be referenced in at least one major mainstream publication or by another mainstream group or individual."</b>, and if a rep. congressman from texas is not a mainstream individual, what is? Is this a discussion about the term or the content, I do not care about the term, but the theory does deserve its own article. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngwar_628f.html" title="User:Engwar">A human</a> 01:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't see "petrodollar warfare" on a single one of those pages you linked. You are referring to a number of different ideas and theories here and none of them refer back to the William R. Clark theory this page is about (save the link to Clark himself that you included). The conflation of these various ideas constitutes a bizarre form of original research -- come on; Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michael Klare support the same theory? That's ludicrous. We already have pages on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrodollar.html" title="Petrodollar">petrodollar</a> and <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">oil imperialism theories</a> where Clark's nonsense can go, but to conflate the conspiracy theories with the legitimate theories of everyone who has ever mentioned the role of resources in warfare is not an encyclopedia's job.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:05, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more thing. This is a term that is spreading very quickly at the moment because of all the press its getting. Especially if Iran is attacked as predicted, Petrodollar warfare will be as common as "neoconservative." So at most, the deletionists will succeed for a few months and then the term will become common enough that all the arguments against it will be no longer debatable. You can't make it fall out of favor like the term <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_IV_b2af.html" title="World War IV">World War IV</a> just by avoiding a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarltonh_e6a2.html" title="User:Carltonh">Carltonh</a> 23:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Expand</b> and rewrite. I understand that for some reason csloat has a problem with the model. Probably a conflict with some deeply hold convictions. My apologies but this does not make it less relevant. Conversly it means it is important enough if somebody is fighting it with such fervor. What comes to the notion that the afformentioned people only some mention the theory with the same name does not mean that they are not talking of the same model. If somebody offers it a better name then lets rename it. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Oldfield_d229.html" title="User:Alan Oldfield">Alan Oldfield</a> 11:14, 10 March 2006 (GMT+2)</li>

<li>LOL... Thanks, but if I need psychoanalysis I'll consult a professional. If you think Brzezinski and Klare and Chomsky and Ron Paul and William Clark (whoever the latter is) are all articulating the same theory, please point to some specific claims. Everyone who talks about "resource wars" (Klare's term) is not saying the same thing. But that's neither here nor there; my point is, we already have <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_imperialism_theories.html" title="Oil imperialism theories">oil imperialism theories</a> (poorly titled, but better than "petrodollar warfare") for this kind of stuff, and we don't need a name that makes it sound like a science fiction movie. It would be interesting to email any of these people (besides Clark) and ask them how they felt about being named as a proponent of a theory of "petrodollar warfare." As I said when I suggested deleting this page to begin with, I think this is a vanity site showcasing an otherwise unknown scholar's work.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 11:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>*<i>Colin Nuan</i>: "The first country to actually make the switch was a very important oil exporter indeed: Iraq, in November 2000. Before the war in Iraq began, some observers, myself included, argued that this might well be a major reason for the US desire to invade and the strong Franco-German opposition to the invasion. Corroborating evidence included the apparent influence which loyalty (or lack thereof) to the dollar seemed to have on the US attitude towards other OPEC members. Iran had been talking of selling its own oil for euros and was subsequently included in George Bush's 'axis of evil'."</dd>

<dd>(1) Perhaps it is does really only reference one book, but many books have their own page on Wikipedia - since it is a collaborative article and not written BY the author, it cannot be considered a "vanity page". An argument could be made, however, for the article to specifically be renamed to refer to the book in question.</dd>
<dd>(2) Yes, "petrodollar warfare" seems to be a Wiki-neologism, and therefore essentially unsearchable - but this is an argument for renaming rather than deletion.</dd>
<dd>(3) If you consider it a conspiracy theory, then it should be linked to "conspiracy theories" at the bottom of the page. But since other conspiracy theories have entries in Wikipedia, this is not in itself a reason for deletion.

<dd>I put such a link in place, but <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Oldfield_d229.html" title="User:Alan Oldfield">Alan Oldfield</a> removed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petrodollar_warfare&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38652583" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petrodollar_warfare&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=38652583" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Though, I don't want to meddle into this discussion too much, I wish to add that there is some academic research about the connection of Iraq's petroeuro choice in 2000 and the war in Iraq since 2003. See: R. LOONEY, “Petroeuros: A Threat to U.S. Interests in the Gulf?” in <i>Middle East Policy</i>, 11, (2004), 1, pp. 26-37. (Note that the conclusion of this article is that it is very unlikely that there is any significant connection). <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 21:07, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. An important entry. It could do with a rewrite and expansion, but well researched. It may be a fringe analysis (ie. one not commonly understood), but don't see any reason why it should be considered a 'conspiracy theory'. There is no conspiracy alleged. It takes the perspective of the US as an empire, but in the last couple of years that has become the accepted terminology by both US leaders and their critics. The referenced articles are good -- they include articles pro- and con- the core theory. However, I think the <b>M3 data reporting discontinued</b> section should be removed, as it is not sufficiently central to the argument. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamfenderson_b167.html" title="User:Adamfenderson">Adamfenderson</a> 02:55, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dfleck: yes I probably stretched a point there - but several US conservative opinion leaders have begun embracing the term in this time, which seems like a pretty significant intellectual turn, given that it has been such a negatively loaded concept and one vehemently denied by many: eg. <a href="http://www.hooverdigest.org/034/johnson.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hooverdigest.org/034/johnson.html" rel="nofollow">"America's New Empire for Liberty"</a>, article from conservative writer and historian <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Johnson_%28journalist%29_db19.html" title="Paul Johnson (journalist)">Paul Johnson</a>, in which he argues that the U.S. has always been an empire—and a good one at that. See also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Empire#The_benevolent_empire" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Empire#The_benevolent_empire" rel="nofollow">"Benevolent Empire secion of the American Empire wikepedia entry"</a>, the most significant name there being Zbigniew Brzezinski.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either way it's a matter of semantics. The US is big and powerful, dominates the world economy, has military bases all around the world and uses financial and military pressures to apply political influence. I don't think anyone credible would deny this, they'd just characterise it differently, and whether you're for or against it, you can choose to call it an empire or not. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamfenderson_b167.html" title="User:Adamfenderson">Adamfenderson</a> 02:02, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
