There has been considerable effort made to speedy this page, even though it is not really a candidate, and it has been redirected twice to articles which really don't speak to this issue.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the topic is an interesting one, and considering the fact that before WWII one sixth of all Jews in the world were Polish, I'd say this deserves its own page. That said, the "article" as it now stands is woefully low on information and seems to be more a thought that hits someone one day than an academic encyclopedia article. Nevertheless I'm strongly in favor of keeping the page so that six months hence there will be a fine article on the subject here. - mnuez <small>Edit by 208.54.14.65</small></li>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike>. There are many important things to say about anti-Semitism in Poland. It is also true that anti-Semitic statements in public and in private are still more common in modern Poland than they are in most other European countries. However, <i>this</i> article is beyond repair. Apart from the fact that much of the information is inaccurate or simply incorrect (such as the claims about the presence of anti-Semitic cartoons in the mainstream press, attacks against synagogues - which are paradoxically rarer in Poland than in other countries where verbal anti-Semitism is tolerated less, the "deportation" of Jews in 1968). Other portions are deliberately vague to create a false impression in the reader (such <i>"anti-Semitism in Poland as has a long history", "Persecution of Jews took place both before, during and after the Second World War", "During the war many Poles actively took part in the Holocaust"</i>). It is fairly obvious that this article was created in response to the ongoing VFD against <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">Anti-Polonism</a>, and thus constitutes a clear violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Let there be no mistake, the history of anti-Semitism in Poland certainly warrants a proper article. I am actually surprised that this prominent topic has not been covered yet. However, if one extracts the useful stuff from this drivel of simplifications and accusations, much too little will be left to justify an article. If no one comes up with any text that does more justice to this complex matter within the usual deadline, it's better to delete the article altogether for the time being. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 10:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Another update: When changing my vote from strong delete to conditional keep I was not aware that Piotrus's text was not original but duplicated material from other articles. I appreciate Piotrus's effort at improving this article, but I think there is a case for a seperate article on anti-Semitism in Poland only if redundancy with articles such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Jews_in_Poland_a097.html" title="History of Jews in Poland">History of Jews in Poland</a> is kept to a minimum. In modern Poland, anti-Semitism exists even in the absence of any major Jewish population group - it focuses on "imaginary" Jews in Poland and alleged anti-Polish lobbying by Jews outside Poland. Thus, it is possible and to some extent even necessary to deal with this sociological phenomenon outside the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Jews_in_Poland_a097.html" title="History of Jews in Poland">History of Jews in Poland</a>. However, as long as the article remains a) strongly POV or b) strongly redundant with other articles, I change my vote back to <b>delete</b>. Sorry for adding to the confusion. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 20:03, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I could certainly do that. However, I won't do so for two reasons: Any reasonable editing is likely to be immediately reverted by POV pushers from either side who are attracted to such articles like moths to a light bulb... Apart from that, as I said above, the non-POV substance of the article would hardly even reach the stub threshold: <i>"Anti-Semitism in Poland exists. After the end of World War II [it was] [...] used at certain moments by communist party or individual politicians in order to achieve their [...] political goals."</i> I think we all agree that this would not really be worth keeping. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:08, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

This subject is valid, but need not be discussed separately from Jewish Polish history. If that article gets too big, the solution is to break it up by dates, not by extracting one aspect as though it were somehow independent from the rest of Jewish history in the various incarnations of Poland.

<li>Treat my vote as <b>Delete</b> unless material is removed from main Anti-Semitism article, then <b>Keep</b>. The article was blatantly POVed, but I fixed it by replacing it by (much more extensive and sourced) text from relevant sections on Anti-Semitism page. Note that this means I deleted all the old content - as many said, it was beyong salvage. For long time there have been discussions at Talk:Anti-Semitism to create such a subarticle(s) and move national anti-semitic material there - this is a good start. I see it as a subarticle to Anti-Semitism. It should be part of the series of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Germany_45a0.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Germany">Anti-Semitism in Germany</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_France_48eb.html" title="Anti-Semitism in France">Anti-Semitism in France</a>, Anti-Semitism in Italy, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_United_States_7322.html" title="Anti-Semitism in United States">Anti-Semitism in United States</a>, etc - but it should not exists separately.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The VfD tag says explicitly that "<i>You are welcome to edit this article</i>." The major rewrite that Piotrus executed solves problems raised by <b>nine</b> delete votes (so far) (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Semitism_in_Poland&amp;diff=18661473&amp;oldid=18661434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Semitism_in_Poland&amp;diff=18661473&amp;oldid=18661434" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Wouldn't it be hypocritical to vote delete on account of severe POV, yet revert the article when the POV is fixed? On numerous occasions, VfDs were the cause of <i>major</i> improvement to articles during the VfD. Many times, those improvements caused the articles to be salvaged, having caused many to change their votes.

<li>Again, why do you want to create a <b>redundant</b> article thus creating a <b>precedence</b> for A-S + specific country? Look at the bigger picture and compare how A-S and the Holocaust-era past issues are being handled in specific country articles e.g. <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_Antonescu_4145.html" title="Ion Antonescu">Romania</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Austria_ab36.html" title="History of Austria">Austria</a>, etc. I would think that these countries, as major collaborators during <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html#Collaborators" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, would deserve more of your and similarly-minded editors' attention. --<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 18:36, 12 July 2005 (UTC)--<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 18:36, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't have much of a problem with creating such a precedent. This would allow sections on A-S by country (which would otherwise <b>needlessly elongate</b> the main <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> article) to have their own articles. I didn't start this article, but, now that it's here, why not use it as a precedent for streamlining the current main A-S article? As Piotr wrote, "<i>It should be part of the series of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Germany_45a0.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Germany">Anti-Semitism in Germany</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_France_48eb.html" title="Anti-Semitism in France">Anti-Semitism in France</a>, Anti-Semitism in Italy, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_United_States_7322.html" title="Anti-Semitism in United States">Anti-Semitism in United States</a>, etc</i>." And, by the way, I haven't cast a vote yet; I'm currently undecided about whether this is the time to move info from the main A-S article to individual articles. My comment wasn't a call to keep the article, per-se. It was a call to retain the integrity of the VfD, which I believe you have been compromising. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 22:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a very important subject. However, both sides of the edit war clearly don't have a clue about anti-Semitism in 20th/21st century Poland. There are many disturbing things in longer version's description of pre-20th century events. It uses mostly secondary sources and an almost exclusively focuses on anti-Semitic events to the exclusion of background information. It doesn't look like an article written in good faith. Where's the information about Jewish position in the social structure of the First Republic, about the situations of other faiths in it, about Jewish involvement in socialist and communist movement, the conflict between the socialists/communists and Polish nationalists which fed early 20th-century anti-Semitism, about anti-Jewish pogroms in czarist Russia which also spread to occupied Poland, about situation of other minorities in the Second Republic, cooperation of Jews in occupied Poland with the Soviet government, about involvement of many usually "anti-Semitic" nationalists in anti-Holocaust activities, and about usage of word "Żyd" to mean "member of the leftist/liberal conspiracy" by the modern nationalists (that's why asking people questions on anti-Semitism in Poland is futile - the nationalists believe they're answering different question than one the inquirer believes he's asking)&#160;? It's a horrible article. I, for one, don't think it's possible to write a good article on the subject alone, while leaving the background information elsewhere. Therefore I'm strongly for <b>deleting</b> the article and redirecting to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 08:44, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, while <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> provides a good summary of anti-Semitism in Poland, it doesn't really get into background and underlying dynamics, which you have said are important. It also doesn't get into the controversies regarding the extent of and reasons for anti-Semitism. I think that, theoretically (at least), this article would be necessary for a more thorough analysis of this topic. However, as Piotr mentioned, someone should be willing to work on this article. I don't really foresee that for the near future, but there will certainly be a time when this article will be needed. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 16:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually it’s not a randomly compiled list. It’s a list of all incidents related to anti-Semitism that took place in Poland in indicated time. The poll you linked to is among the remaining 19. I agree that numbers never tell everything, but I’m also not sure what questions the poll answers. I looked through the <a href="http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/european_attitudes_may_2005.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/european_attitudes_may_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a> study of this poll, and I really have more questions than answers.

<li>Let's try to stay civil, Ttyre. The frequency of anti-Semitic incidents is not the only standard by which to measure the problem. Statistics are rarely a reliable basis for comparisons, too many variables interfere, such as what is defined and gets reported as an "anti-Semitic incident"; also not only the overall size of the population is a factor, but also the number of Jewish citizens, Jewish institutions etc. Also, the past is of equal importance as the present. There can be no serious doubt that Poland, up to WW II a multi-ethnic country with a huge portion of Jews with a distinct ethnic identity, was also more burdened with ethnic conflict, including but not limited to Polish-Jewish conflict, than ethnically homogenous countries in the west. The semi-truth of the <i>żydokomuna</i> is very much a Polish issue, the events of 1968 are quite unparalleled, and until today conspiracy theories involving real or imaginary Jews thrive better in Poland than in many other countries - most recently in response to the Jedwabne affair. Of course, most accusations of past and present anti-Semitism in Poland stubbornly ignore its specific context, are unbearably complacent and often attempts of absolving oneself of one's "own" anti-Semitism. The original version of the article we are or should be discussing here is a textbook example of this. On the other hand, though, nervously attacking anyone who merely mentions anti-Semitism in Poland with hip-fired accusations of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Polonism_d987.html" title="Anti-Polonism">anti-Polonism</a> isn't at all better - in fact, the concept of anti-Polonism suffers the very same defects as the concept of anti-Semitism. Plus, like it or not, few people outside Poland care to take it seriously, so complaints about anti-Polonism can backfire badly. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 23:57, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (but make a subpage)</b> As one of the people who has been laboring very hard on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> (and I strongly suggest that people voting here spend a few minutes reading the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_2a2a.html" title="Talk:History of the Jews in Poland">talk page</a>), I have been putting a lot of thought into this vote. On one hand, something that came out of writing the article is that it is clear that Poland is often unfairly blamed for being much more anti-semitic than it was for much of its history, especially before the 19th century. On the other hand, it is also clear that there is a historical thread of severe anti-semitism from the 1920s-1930s through at least the 1970s in Poland (and, as recent surveys indicate, probably until today), and that discussion of this topic is often difficult. I think that the current <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> page does a good job dealing with many of these issues, but that, as both a history article and a long one at that, it does not delve into the subject in much depth outside of the chronology of events, which does a disservice to both the Polish history of tolerance and the persecutions of Polish Jews when they did happen. Thus, I would suggest that we turn this page into a subpage of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a> dealing specifically with the issue of anti-semitism in Polish history. I would hope that we could develop an article here that would neither bash Poland nor deny anti-semitic threads in recent Polish history. That may be too much to hope for, but deleting the article seems to beg the question, no matter what perspective you may have on the topic. At least this article creates a good place to discuss both the myths and the facts, rather than denying that this issue is not one of curiosity and importance to many people. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:32, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article's special nature, deals with an atypical problem. Jews were afforded comforts by the rulers of Poland, but most of the Christian citizens did not enjoy this relationship between them. When Jews were going around the world to proclaim their own pain in reference to the Holocaust, Poles felt left out and anti-Semitism rose by clear margins. Whilst Christian Poles were treated somewhat different from the Jews by the Nazis, the rest of the world did not know the background to German-Polish violence. I have a feeling that the naysayers of this vote are tied to the page here: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-Polonism_cfd1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Polonism">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-Polonism</a> Is it true, that none of you care about the Poles but are frothing at the mouth to feel pity for the Jews?
