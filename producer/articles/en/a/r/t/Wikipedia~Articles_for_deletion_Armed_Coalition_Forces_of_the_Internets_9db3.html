<li>Well, I guess that's up to the powers that be, I won't argue back or forth. If it's deleted however, I suppose there should also be a deletion for the redirect from [ACFI]. Notice, however, that when this is written, it is in fact listed on <a href="http://redirect.alexa.com/redirect?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.implodeladonia.net%2F&amp;s=alxsrch&amp;pos=1&amp;q=%22Armed%20Coalition%20Forces%20of%20the%20Internets%22" class="external text" title="http://redirect.alexa.com/redirect?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.implodeladonia.net%2F&amp;s=alxsrch&amp;pos=1&amp;q=%22Armed%20Coalition%20Forces%20of%20the%20Internets%22" rel="nofollow">alexa</a> from what I can see.&#160;:)</li>
<li>My bad, I meant that alexa held no data on the website, which would make it appear that it isn't at all notable. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 23:33, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well... in case, say, the alleged ACFI did step ashore in the area Ladonia in some way, and it at least made local headlines, would that make the article worthy of existence, by the principle that it might not be interesting to everyone in the world, but to at least a number of people (Ladonia is a popular subject among artists not only in Sweden, and happenings involving it would create interest - same definately goes for stuff involving the Pirate Bay)? Bare also in mind that the concept is quite new. //Thaum
<ul>
<li>Well, I'd say it'd be notable if it made some local newspapers, and you could cite them in the article, but everyone's opinion of what is or isn't notable varies. It actually sounds quite interesting to me, but as of now there are only 3 places that even mention it online, and none that I've heard of before. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 00:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The article does not comply with Wikipedia's high standards for quality. Additionally it is riddled with original research and/or is cited by unreliable sources. There is not enough useful or verified information to justify keeping this article. If someone is willing to do an extensive cleanup of the article, that would be great. Until then, it is best to delete the article as to avoid the spread of misinformation. --<a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpsilonsa_e022.html" title="User:Epsilonsa">Epsilonsa</a> 09:39, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>May I just pause you for a second here. Wikipedia's "High standard of quality" is about as solid as a dog turd in a washing machine. The Wiki is full of complete rubbish, implausible opinions based on speculation, and worst of all, utter lies generally being called direct facts by nitwits who know nothing. The Wiki has been ridiculed from lands a far for having articles pertaining to many many subjects that are just downright wrong, and even one of the top blokes originally part of the creation of the Wiki has admitted it has serious flaws as far as factual truth go. I decided to see if I could get away with writting rubbish, so I edited an article on here to prove a point back in May, with complete gibberish cooked up in one minute, and it has yet to be removed. In fact I expect some poor bastard probably uses the information on a daily basis to prove his or her own points, and little do they know it is made up by me. Just think, if I can do it, millions of others can. And have. So, before you go crapping out this rubbish about this article not being in keeping with the Wiki's high quality standards, might I suggest you take a look at every other page on the Wiki, because chances are 9 times out fo 10 if you knew what the hell you were going on about you'd realise this entire site is a complete farce. That is all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.47.168.197 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.47.168.197_effe.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.47.168.197">contribs</a>) 2006-07-27 10:33:04 (UTC)</small>

<li>I must actually give an opinion here, even if I orginitaed this article and all flaws in it should be mine (no contribs have been made to it as of yet): So Wiki is ridiculed for lack of accuracy and correctness and so on. No matter if this is true or not, the best way to counter such things, is to clean up the bad seeds and water the good ones, wouldn't you agree? If this is a completey non-sensical article, as some seem to believe, and if it does not reach up to the policies of Wiki, no matter what individuals think of these policies, this should be adhered to, and this everyone making a login on wiki agreed to comply to from the get-go. Better to improve a bad article, than to maintain it in a sad shape just to protest the site's policies if they are not to one's satisfaction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaum1el_a0da.html" title="User:Thaum1el">Thaum1el</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThaum1el_594d.html" title="User talk:Thaum1el">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thaum1el_8829.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thaum1el">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</li>
<li>I suppose you did not detect the irony of me giving a well tailored reason for deleting this ridiculously low quality article. I know I laughed when I wrote it. I either overestimated your sense of humor or overestimated the amount of humor others would find in my response. In either case, the argument is as valid as it is funny (not saying much, apparently), and your article has got to be deleted. Tough break, son. Maybe try not to berate the merits of your own article next time.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpsilonsa_e022.html" title="User:Epsilonsa">Epsilonsa</a> (<a href="../../../e/p/s/User_talk%7EEpsilonsa_935a.html" title="User talk:Epsilonsa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Epsilonsa_5f8a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Epsilonsa">contribs</a>).</small>¨
<ul>
<li>Think you got something wrong here. I created the article, and if people seriously want to take it away, please do. I will hardly be upset about the thing, as I have not been upset about someone giving a motivation for wanting the deletion, humorous or not. If it has to go it has to go. However, you must have confused me with the unsigned long argument upstairs. As you might notice I argued against the rant about the Wiki policies on deletion, claiming that if it doesn't meet the Wiki standards it must of course go.&#160;;)--<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaum1el_a0da.html" title="User:Thaum1el">Thaum1el</a> 19:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
