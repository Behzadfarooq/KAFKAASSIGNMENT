<p>To save people the trouble of reading through this, this is Kengineer and near the bottom of this long discourse I finally discovered (on my own, nobody else knew it) that Human Branching is Human Diversification and Human Diversification is the widely used term in scientific study. There is no entry for Human Diversification on wikipedia so anybody is welcome to do it. I agree wholy that the term human branching can be deleted because even if somebody uses it, it is self-descriptive. Human Diversification is the better term to use in conversation. --Kengineer 03:39, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't delete - do a research project to properly define the term. Allen - herein lies the problem. You are afraid of human genetic branching. You actually fear it because, yes indeed, for people to allow it would require discrimination. Why do you fear population diversity? It makes little sense to delete the term itself - the definition that you may not like is certainly up for discussion. It needs to become a research project - --Kengineer 04:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)Kengineer</p>

</ul>
<p>White supremacist? You have entered into the delusional land of lala... and the more people that pay attention to your post the more delusional this land becomes. Human Genetic and cultural Branching is natural. Don't be afraid of it, embrace it.--Kengineer 04:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the policy is to delete and then it can be reborn again with proper research references - then I to am for deletion because I certainly agree with the reference policy of wikipedia... I actually considered the term "Human Branching" to be such a fundamental phrase as to not need references. It seemed a void that needed to be filled. Human Genetic and Cultural branching pretty well defines it, but a bit more information is needed regarding the legal and social aspects of it.--Kengineer 04:54, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> this nonsensical article relating to humans. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_F._2c73.html" title="User:Richard F.">Richard F.</a> 05:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard, it is hardly nonsensical. It is actually quite logical which means you either need to read it again, or I can be your teacher - I say this because it really is simple logic and not nonsensical... You can disagree with it sure, but if you don't understand it, you need to read it again or speak with me so I can explain it to you.--Kengineer 05:08, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedias policy on deletion actually states that the person who nominates for deletion should first consider whether the term itself should remain, and help to enhance it. Essentially this term should exist and somebody will eventually put it back up with references. So this nomination for deletion really refers to the essay I wrote about it rather than the term itself - unless you can point to another term somewhere that sufficiently means human genetic and cultural branching or, human branching for short.--Kengineer 05:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I may as well just lay it out there so it's really clear. Racism is opposed everywhere as extremist and bad. Now we've swung the pendulum all the way over to the other extremist side - "we're all one, period, and we'll bring the guns of law out as needed to enforce this." I absolutely support the right of sovereign lands/countries to exist (although I'm sure enough $$$ could convince me otherwise). Because I understand implicitly how genetic branching happens, and how that is human population diversity, I also support the right of every country to discriminate as to who can become a citizen. Without that freedom, where's the human population diversity, and the freedom for that matter? Perhaps you desire such a homogenous, dare I say, boring world... but I do not. Do you think it's right to point a gun at me, or blacklist me from posting, or whatever else to pursue your extremist "all one" vision of the world? --Kengineer 05:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>People... please wake up. Please step out of delusion and into reality. I didn't create the term... frankly nature created the term along with certainly hundreds or thousands of humans before I ever uttered it. I did write this particular definition. The term itself can be kept and enhanced by soembody who thinks they can define it better. I can't help but think again; what exactly are you people afraid of? Are you really that afraid of natural human branching? You want to squash the term itself so "nobody gets the idea that it's OK for human genetics and culture to freely branch?" --Kengineer 06:02, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I have converted the definition of Human Branching to a stub of evolution and genetics. It now reads only - The term "Human Branching" connotes the genetic and cultural branching of the human species. The references I already provided show the use of this term as a simple convenient way to communicate the genetic branching aspect of the human species itself.--Kengineer 16:12, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello again, I've enhanced the definition further keeping accurate with references available and even making the main definition its most common use of when the human branch itself, branched from other genetic branches.--Kengineer 21:01, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello, Cladogenesis deals with the speciation of one species into two or more species due to a reproductive branching event. "Human Branching" does not require speciation to take place - it is simply the genetic variation that exists between any two populations that have had isolated reproduction from one another over some period of time. While Human Branching can become Cladogenesis, Human Branching need not be Cladogenesis.--Kengineer 01:19, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia Policy copied and pasted from the guide to deletion page: "investigate the possibility of rewriting the article yourself (or at least creating a stub on the topic and requesting expansion) instead of deleting it." And also this: "You and others are welcome to continue editing the article during the discussion period. Indeed, if you can address the points raised during the discussion by improving the article, you are encouraged to edit a nominated article (noting in the discussion that you have done so if your edits are significant ones)."--Kengineer 01:19, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Human Branching is the simple self-descriptive term that simply means what it says. It can be any amount of genetic distance, from one generation and up. Obviously one generation won't produce much variation at all - but any mutations that pop up in one population but not the other is variation... so even just one generation of isolated reproduction could begin the branching process (depending upon the size of the population and possibility of mutation - I don't know the frequency rates of mutation for human reproduction). The other factor of human genetic branching - partner choice - which selects for desired traits within the culture, takes longer than one generation to see certainly.--Kengineer 01:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A good synonym for "Human Branching" would be "Human Diversification," but that term is also not present in Wikipedia.--Kengineer 02:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, we are all idiots - the term "Human Diversification" is exactly human branching. There are resources which talk of microevolution of the human species itself and they refer to this as Human Diversification, not human branching. But Human Branching is still a descript term which has the same meaning. I'll definately create the Human Diversification page at some point, but I'll add this as a synonym to Human Branching right now... or Human Branching should redirect to Human diversification.--Kengineer 02:50, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
