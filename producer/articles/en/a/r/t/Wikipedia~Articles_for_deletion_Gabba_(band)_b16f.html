<dd><b>Comment</b>, yes... you are reading too much into it.

<dd>No offense intended, I was just being proactive in the full disclosure departement. As for the MySpace text: considering that any article dealing with them will quickly feature a memorable sentence such as "Stig Honda decided to fuse the disco pop of Abba and the punk rock of The Ramones", I guess that anyone is quite easily liable to get <a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/j/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu.html" title="Déjà vu">déjà vu</a> over them, even when the sentences are different. -- 62.147.37.122 18:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - About the note "<i>historical section needs to be rewritten as it is lifted from their MySpace page</i>": I'm the one who beefed that article and section, and I didn't cut-n-pasted nor "lifted" anything, it's my own writing summarizing what I read: I had even left a big hidden HTML comment explaining precisely that with my doubts about some points since they seem so prankish, so there's no copyvio there, there's only some additional research to be done to check if some if their bio data isn't playfully bogus. -- 62.147.112.67 00:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Assertions of notability are made, but none of them seem to be backed up. Can we get some links to press coverage, or at least something more specific than a list of media outlets? Having three albums is great, but two of them are not even available anymore and one is banned (for whatever reason), which does not indicate notability. The extent of the group's entry on allmusic.com is one album listing - no biography of any kind. IMO, the claim to notability is extremely weak here, especially given that this is only a tribute band. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 13:47, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>About the "banned album": According to the band, " <i>GABBA release their complex 3rd album, the Spanish language "Tijuana Dance". However, the album was banned and withdrawn from sale after just 1 week for being "Anti-Establishment", due to some confusion over Bee Bee's appalling Spanish translations which inadvertantly accused the Queen of England of being a Nazi Stormtrouper (in a stupor, no less)</i> [refers to the song "Estupendo Choque Trouper"]<i>. It is unclear if the album will ever be released again.</i> " <a href="http://www.gabba.co.uk/disco.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gabba.co.uk/disco.html" rel="nofollow">from Gabba's own discog</a> (of course, that's the sort of detail from their site that I find could be playfully bogus, hence my hidden comment in the stub about the need for independent research. Only two Spanish-speaking sites seem to discuss this album. But then, if Wikipedia wants to delete them, I don't imagine the UK media reporting about a tribute band's CD being censored.)</li>
<li>They claim to have coined "discopunk" for their style of pop-punk (quote "as the inventors of Discopunk" in <a href="http://www.gabba.co.uk/archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gabba.co.uk/archive.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). While there is currently no discopunk article, the word is much in use and has become an emerging subgenre name, apparently boosted by a 2002 album <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:yf4uakjk0m3p" class="external autonumber" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:yf4uakjk0m3p" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> of that name (43,000+ Google hits, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/going_out/clubbing/2003/04/02/discopunk.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/going_out/clubbing/2003/04/02/discopunk.shtml" rel="nofollow">a 2003 BBC article about its US version</a>, a quote from NME using this genre name about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adored_fdbb.html" title="The Adored">The Adored</a>, and there is <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/discopunk" class="external text" title="http://www.last.fm/tag/discopunk" rel="nofollow">a page for discopunk at Last.fm</a>, for instance). The point being, if they coined it and some roots of that style, that's a claim to fame and notability, albeit little.</li>
<li>Another point: it's not just yet another minor tribute band to Abba or the Ramones, but a merging of the two, there's not exactly a plethora of similar bands -- that's why they're featured as one of the examples in the much-coveted lead of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribute_band.html" title="Tribute band">tribute band</a>, are cited as "an extreme example of punk cover versions" in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">cover version</a>, and are often cited in magazine articles about the tribute bands phenomenon: they're a striking example (just like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini_Kiss_8858.html" title="Mini Kiss">Mini Kiss</a>), and they're a simple Hollywood pitch, "imagine Abba played by The Ramones" (just like <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptica.html" title="Apocalyptica">Apocalyptica</a>, "imagine Metallica played by four cellos").</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - When dealing with their apparently silly pages, one should keep in mind they're into British <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk subculture</a> antics. For instance, their producer being "Phil <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smegma.html" title="Smegma">Smegma</a> (né Sphincter)" looks like a hoax, but should be put in the context of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rotten_55d1.html" title="Johnny Rotten">Johnny Rotten</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_Vicious_3f07.html" title="Sid Vicious">Sid Vicious</a> from the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Pistols_b1a7.html" title="Sex Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> - 62.147.37.227 10:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Search tip</b> - Potentially useful to those who'd look this up: Google being very broken since their February 2006 "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Daddy_Google_dfcf.html" title="Big Daddy Google">Big Daddy</a>" update, replicating Google searches in <a href="http://www.altavista.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.altavista.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.altavista.com/</a> (same index as Yahoo) can yield additional results for non-mainstream topics like this. And since <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabba.html" title="Gabba">gabba</a> (dab page) has so many more common usages, adding markers such as "abba ramones", "leave-stockholm", "stig honda", or "discopunk", helps filtering out results. -- 62.147.37.227 10:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Their single "Gabba Gabba" is allegedly on sale on <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/" rel="nofollow">the iTunes UK store</a> (I can't check that, I don't have iTunes for browsing their catalog, or rather catalogue). That's the song they had contributed to an international tribute album to the late <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Ramone_a188.html" title="Joey Ramone">Joey Ramone</a> (a 2001 CD, cf. article).</li>
<li>They had been reviewed in <i>The Ramones UK Fan Club Newsletter</i> (Number 24, February 2000) - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010619080057/http://www.gabba.co.uk/temp/rukfc.jpg" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010619080057/http://www.gabba.co.uk/temp/rukfc.jpg" rel="nofollow">A thumbnail screenshot of it</a>, because the full image is broken at Archive.org</li>

<li><b>Meta-comment: jury duty</b> (In a calm, relaxed tone.)
<ul>
<li>I'd like to say I find it rather appalling that people who voted "Delete" never came back to the debate, to confront the evidence about the article they had sentenced to death. And this, despite their being informed twice on their talk page about the detailled list of notability evidence gathered, and despite being wiki-active since.</li>
<li>I understand that an AFD isn't a vote per se, and how its reviewing process can strengthen an article -- but this works better, and doesn't give such a sorry spectacle, when an actual debate takes place.</li>
<li>Yet it's currently possible to just mass-slap AFD's and Delete's without any further involvement, personal responsibility, accountability, or moral sense of duty.</li>
<li>The results can then give the appearance of pathological <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-hunt.html" title="Witch-hunt">witch-hunting</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_court.html" title="Kangaroo court">kangaroo court</a>, rather than debate. As if a bunch of jurors would just say "Burn the witch" early in a trial, then leave the court before defense is pleaded. "It'll git a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_trial.html" title="Fair trial">fair AFD</a>, and then y'all can delete it."</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, I think that someone who initiates or participates at some point in an AFD should have some sort of a "<a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury_duty.html" title="Jury duty">jury duty</a>" to come back at least once on the 4th or 5th day, especially when he voted "Delete". He could then review evidences, update his vote or explain why he maintains it -- or at the very least counter-sign his vote with a second ~~~~, so as to act of his presence before the sentence he's in part responsible of.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, someone should thus not engage in more AFD debates than he can, or intend to, actually handle.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it is any consolation, this is 99.99% certain to close on at least a no consensus which would default to keep. I don't know if you noticed, but I removed my deletion opinion several days ago pending investigation of the sources. After looking at the sources I'm not 100% convinced they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but they are very close to the line. It's close enough that I'm simply rendering no opinion either way. If there were <i>no</i> deletion opinions I would probably withdraw this AfD nomination. But as it stands I'm fairly certain this article will be kept, and with the improvements you've made to it over the past few days 62.147.37.122 I think the article makes a stronger case towards <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> now than the version that was there when I nominated it... and thanks for staying <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> throughout the debate.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, at this point I'd suggest that you please don't withdraw it, anyway: its being archived and referenced on the article's talk page should provide a valuable starting point for the many next AFD's I'm sure such article will go through again: I've merged all sources and references into the article, but we have here some additional angles of defense that can't be put into the article itself. And on an optimist note, it would also provide a useful starting point for mounting a request to undelete. -- 62.147.37.122 18:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do share this opinion, but as far as I know it's just your opinion and mine: I mean, I don't remember anything in the AFD documentation that suggest, recommend, or prescribe treating votes in this fashion, to the admin who'll have the <s>fatigue</s> task of closing this debate. -- 62.147.37.122 18:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so. It's not votes; it's a discussion, and if in a discussion someone makes a point which is then answered, and that first person remains silent, they have tacitly concurred. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:18, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly, and codifying this would take away the admins' discretion upon closure. I think <i>most</i> admins look at what has transpired and if evidence was provided at some point that makes a case towards guidelines or invalidates an argument, they take that into consideration. Regardless of the outcome, hopefully the admin will tag the talk page with a banner showing this already underwent AfD and what the outcome was.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:03, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
