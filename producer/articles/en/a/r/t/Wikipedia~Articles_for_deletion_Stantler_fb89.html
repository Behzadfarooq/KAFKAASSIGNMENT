<li><b>Delete</b> all except one page on Pokemon. This is an Encyclopedia. Hobbyists can go and make a web page of thier own with thier thousands of trading cardesque things, which are just a fad. Notability in this five year period, among kids, and wierd adults, does not indicate any unique contribution to mankind in any way. The generations of tomorrow do not need to know what 'Stantler' is.

<ul>
<li>Possibly, especially since this is just a rant that is more POV than helping the encyclopaedia. Wikipedia is not paper. There's also crystalballery in there. Pokémon is surviving very well in post-fad status, (a Pokémon theme park has recently opened in Japan. Would they have risked all that money on a fad?) So the generation of tomorrow may still find Pokémon articles interesting. And even if it did die away, it has still become a part of recent history which, once the article is expanded, will remain interesting. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 20:48, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Votes in a vote for deletion don't count if the user hasn't made at least 50 contributive edits to normal pages. Edits an IP made can't be attributed to you, since Wikipedia doesn't change attributes anymore (both due to work, and to abuse). <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 20:47, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please cite a source</b> for the "minimum page edit" statement. It is offensive to many (like me) who edited for a long time anonymously prior to creating a user page, and it is in direct conflict with the <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7Ebite_fe9c.html" title="WP:bite">WP:bite</a> guideline and innumerable <b>be bold</b> statements on policy pages.

There's no need for individual articles for all pokemon. We don't have individual articles for each type of yo-yo or frisbee ever made. -<a href="../../../a/f/c/User%7EAfC_d9ad.html" title="User:AfC">ÅfÇ++</a> 07:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But there tends to be more variety to Pokémon than yo-yos or frisbees. Besides, it has remained strongly popular in non-fad status. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 15:16, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because there is more variety does not mean that it ALL has to be covered in large length (ie individual pokemon pages). Has it really stayed popular enough that a page on each pokemon and his playing card stats are neccesary? I would say that a page explaining each series or new group of pokemon and listing the pokemon therein would be enough. There arent individual yo-yo pages because despite all the variation it has, only a yo-yo geek would care about it, and to an extent such pages would be Advertisement since they would highlight a particular type of yo-yo.
<ul>
<li>Yes, it has stayed popular enough. It is POV to say it hasn't. More people will care about Pokémon than the 'geeks'. Maybe there will be a kid who just plays the games and watches the animé. On Saturday's episode, a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimecho.html" title="Chimecho">Chimecho</a> will debue as a main character. Wanting to know more, they can look in the Chimecho article. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 10:15, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Highly speculative. You've mentioned several times that <i>more people</i> care about pokemon, I take that to mean, more people will begin to care about pokemon, which is contrary to what is/has happened. I won't even touch the laughable POV statement. -<a href="../../../a/f/c/User%7EAfC_d9ad.html" title="User:AfC">ÅfÇ++</a> 18:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a game guide, and Pokemon is a fad, not a major work of literature, so while information on the marketing and publicising of it is notable, the statistics on individual cards is trivial. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 08:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Good, since Wiki is not a game guide, we can get rid of the 3,427 articles related in one way or another to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a>.

<li>Chess deserves those articles - no one has disputed that - but we are not trying to make 3,427 articles. We have only made 393 individual Pokémon pages. The point of <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a>'s response was that Wikipedia is not paper. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 10:15, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> Geeks and kids and genuinely curious people (myself being all three categories) plus many others will want to look at this. Yes, Pokèmon was a fad. So was rollerskating. Do you still see rollerskates in stores? Yes. As long as it makes money, Pokèmon will exist. As long as Pokèmon exists, as long as anything exists, there will be a Wikipedia article for it as long as more than one person is interested in it (I've never seen a Stantler fan club but I'm sure there is one). By the way, Pokèmon is NOT just a trading card game. It's also a video game, a cartoon, and a whole bunch of other stuff. The only reason it hasn't been around very long is that it was created very recently. You said chess was better? Wait 600 years and then we'll talk.

<li><b>Change vote to "Merge"</b> - You were ill-served by mentioning <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. It undermines your entire argument (and my support). Sherlock Holmes references have appeared in everything from CSI episodes to <i>The Great Mouse Detective</i> and he was inducted into the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2002. WP:FICT is saying that characters need to take on a existence of their own <i>outside their original setting</i> , like Sherlock, Batman, Cruella De Vil, Winnie the Pooh to merit their own articles. Sorry, but outside the Pokemon universe (which <b>includes</b> the cards, comics, movies, cartoons, whatever), I cannot think of anywhere Stantler has popped up or is likely to. I don't personally agree with the premise on <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> because I think it conflicts with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, but it is listed as a policy... Ergo, vote change. Sorry-<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a> 15:12, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just as notable as most pokemon articles, but I guess that's really the debate. I personally find Pokemon articles more notable as most <a href="../../../r/a/i/Category%7ERail_stubs_0507.html" title="Category:Rail stubs">rail stubs</a>. How do we "draw the line" between notable and non-notable pokemon? For such a notable franchise with such defined content limits (only so many pokemon), including them all won't be hard in the least.-<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 03:25, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although we are an encyclopaedia, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a>, and we have no practical limit to information, as Wikimedia has said.

<dd>A lot more people will find the Stantler article interesting. And as part of the project, it <i>will</i> be expanded into a better article in the near future. Again, see <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>.

<p><b>Keep</b>. This article can be considered part of one of our WikiProjects. I believe there is a whole project devoted to pokemon. There are also many other types of pokemon animal articles. It would be unusual to delete this one and have all the others still on our database. I believe that you could have only deleted this article if there were no other articles about pokemon animals. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERentastrawberry_325e.html" title="User:Rentastrawberry">Rentastrawberry</a> 17:31, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
