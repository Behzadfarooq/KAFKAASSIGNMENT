The Labor party, once more consigned to the opposition benches in Parliament, pointed out that Australia was not bound in any way to help Malaysia, Australia being only committed to the defence of Malaya under the ANZAM agreement. They would have preferred a formal treaty between the two states as to what sort of commitment that Australia was to make to Malaysian defence. This was however defeated in parliament along party lines when it went to the vote. Although the confrontation consisted of counterinsurgency operations in North Borneo, the Government was worried about a direct attack by Indonesia against Australian territory, in particular New Guinea. When in may 1964 Sukarno called upon "21 million volunteers" to crush Malaysia, and his Government told Australia not to interfere in what was basically an Asian problem, warning that if Australia did become involved then the responsibility would be Australia's alone. After this was announced there followed a discussion on 21 April 1964 in Parliament, as to whether an attack by Indonesians on Australian troops in Borneo would activate the terms of the ANZUS agreement, leading to the involvement of America. After criticism from the opposition leader Arthur Calwell, who' said that, "America does not believe that its commitment does include the protection of Australia troops already in Malaya". The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies replied that while the letter of ANZUS does not cover Australia troops stationed abroad, the intent did. He suggested that, "The United States of America did not even withdraw its support for Malaysia. It has recognised Malaysia, and it wants Malaysia to be maintained... [but] That when it came to the immediate defence of Malaysia this was perhaps primarily a Commonwealth responsibility." Despite the brave words the government was worried. It feared the possibility of the confrontation escalating and that as its troops were already in contact with the Indonesians in North Borneo, that the United States would not come to its aid. With defence becoming more of important in the thinking of the Government, selective compulsory conscription was introduced before Parliament on 10 November 1964.26 This was to increase the Army to an effective strength of 37,000. The reason being given was a lack of sufficient volunteers, due to a period of full employment and economic expansion in the civil sector. This build up of the Army was required for, Menzies said, "our deteriorating strategic: situation. We expect a continuing requirement to make our forces available for cold war and counterinsurgency tasks. We must have forces ready as an immediate contribution should hostilities occur." The small Australia Army was over-extended by its commitments both in Malaya and Borneo and the result was that only two Battalions to defend Australia. The Army was also committed to providing "advisers" as part of an aid package to the Government of South Vietnam in its war against Communist insurgents and this was stretching its limited resources to the maximum. Obviously more manpower was required if a credible defence was to be mounted against the threat of Indonesian aggression and the only way that could be achieved was through conscription. Then it was announced that Australian combat troops in the form of one infantry Battalion, with supporting elements, would be committed to the war in South Vietnam, on 29 April 1965. The Government was criticised by the Opposition as well as by a strong vocal middle-class minority which could not be dismissed as Communist or pro- Communist in their views. This vocal minority was made up of numerous dignitaries, including Bishops of various denominations, who were extremely critical of the policies of the rapidly changing South Vietnamese Governments. They believed that the Australian Government should seek a negotiated settlement of the conflict, rather than sending more military aid. As a result of this decision Australian conscripts would, for the first time serve outside Australia or its territories and north of the Equator. This had not even occurred in World War II, and it particularly incensed the Opposition leader who held to the ALP's longstanding opposition to conscription for service not in the direct defence of Australia. This initial commitment of an Infantry Battalion quickly grew to become a Task Force (or Brigade) of three or four Battalions with supporting units of Armour, Engineers, Artillery and Logistic support, as well as RAAF units flying Canberra's and helicopters and also naval units. The tasks of these units quickly changed, from guarding and defensive ones to offensive operations against the Vietnamese Communists. At its height the Australian commitment to Vietnam reached 8,000 men in 1968-69. Australia's involvement in Vietnam was prompted by three main factors. Perhaps most important of these was a very poor perception by the Government of world affairs at that time. Throughout the late fifties and sixties Australian diplomatic circles were firmly convinced of a subversive "Communist Threat" outside Australia. This threat, initially directed by Moscow, and later by Beijing, dominated Australian diplomatic thought for approximately fifteen years. It had though, roots which went much further back than that. As Frank Cain mentions, 30 the members of the coalition government gained anti-Communist convictions well before World War II. He suggests that the "the road to Vietnam was not only paved with anti-radical and anti-communist rhetoric and actions but that the non-Labor forces came to be prisoners of such rhetoric." As a consequences of their repeated successes in federal elections, they were convinced of the appropriateness of these policies. In fact when they failed to "kick the Communist can" as they did in 1961, the coalition nearly lost office. As a consequence the anti- Communist policy of the government under Menzies became electorally self-rewarding and they sought to use it where ever possible. This does not deny that they were not totally convinced for the best of reasons but that they also managed to convince the electorate that Communism must be opposed where ever possible. As Cain suggests, when Menzies made his statement suggesting that "the takeover of South Vietnam would be a direct military threat to Australia,"32 the anti-Communist convictions developed over the previous five years were now convincing them to intervene and this action led Australia into the "quagmire of the Vietnamese civil war." Even after the departure of Menzies in 1965, the ideological crusade to which the Coalition was committed carried it to greater electoral victories. In the 1966 election Harold Holt's government was returned by an even greater majority by an electorate who believed in the necessity to remain in Vietnam. However as the middle-class became more convinced about the dangers of their sons being conscripted to fight overseas in Vietnam, they switched their vote to the Labour Party in response. It was ironic that the coalition by using anti-Communist rhetoric to maintain electoral support now lost office by not taking note of it in the election which led to their defeat in 1972. The coalition government's doubts about Indonesia's political alignment had been reinforced over the years by the acceptance of large quantities of military and civil aid by Jarkata from initially Moscow, and then later Beijing. While in retrospect it is obvious that Sukarno was playing the East off against the West in an effort to gain what he wanted, it raised fears in Canberra that Sukarno was increasingly coming under the control of the local Communist members of his government. This was further reinforced when Sukarno threatened to nationalise the three major oil companies operating in Indonesia (Shell, Caltex and Stanvac) which represented over $US500 million in investment.34 This fear of a Indonesia becoming a Communist country on Australia's doorstep further reinforced the already rigid anti-communist stance of the coalition's leaders. This perception of an aggressive Communist threat in Asia prompted Australian foreign Policy planners to support American policies in Asia almost completely blind to the realities of the situation facing them. The war in Vietnam was not perceived as a local rebellion or civil war, caused by discontent, or even as a war of "national liberation" from the last vestiges of colonial rule as it perhaps should have been. Instead, it was perceived by the then Minister for External Affairs, Paul Hasluck', as he related in his policy speech on 23 March 1965, as a conflict where, "the application of the methods of and doctrines of Communist Guerrilla warfare first evolved in China and then successfully in North Vietnam." In his judgement the South Vietnamese were not dealing simply with a situation of local unrest, but with a "large scale campaign of assassination and terrorism", the direction of which was coming from "outside". This "outside" direction was perceived most definitely as from Beijing. Gregory Clark suggests that this perception of Chinese aggression was carried to the point of "Sinophobia". He relates the story of how Hasluck visited Moscow in October 1964. He was seeking to enlist Soviet aid in preventing the success of this perceived Chinese aggression in Vietnam. Needless to say the Soviets turned the discussion to things of more interest and use to them. This fear of Communist aggression was not, only confined to the Ministry of External Affairs. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said in his policy speech on 29 April 1965 that, "the takeover of South Vietnam would be a direct military threat to Australia and all the countries of South and South-East Asia. It must be seen as a part of a thrust by Communist China between the Indian and Pacific Oceans." The fear of this Communist aggression was founded upon what was referred to as the "Domino Theory" by its exponents. Unless this aggressive action by China was stopped in Vietnam, ran the theory, then after Vietnam had fallen, the surrounding countries would follow, just like a row of Dominoes. These countries, which tended to be neutral in their outlook, favouring neither east nor west, might become embroiled in another war like Vietnam, or they might defect to the Communist line. It was feared that this "domino" action would eventually lead to Australia's shores and then the policy of forward defence would mean Darwin instead of Vietnam. While it was in confrontation with Indonesia the government had the added fear that, as Renouf suggests, "Indonesian success with confrontation could lead to a reverse Domino Theory - from south to north - with Singapore, a strategically placed island, being an early victim," and with Australia being perhaps the next target. Perhaps more significant than this as to why Australia became involved in the Vietnam War, was the Government's policy of relying on "great and powerful friends" for Australia's defence. The Government was afraid that if the problems with Indonesia came to armed conflict then Australia would be abandoned by America and Britain. The response of its two major allies, Great Britain and the United States, to the problems of West New Guinea and to a lesser extent Borneo, had convinced the government that they did not share Australia's deep concern about Indonesia. The United States was unwilling to support Australia's stand with anything more substantial than words. Both Britain and the United States had seen it against their interests to provoke Indonesia, who commanded considerable power amongst other third world countries and because of the large amounts of investment both countries had tied up there. They feared the danger of Sukarno nationalising their interests without compensation. In addition when Australia had asked the United States for an unequivocal commitment under the ANZUS treaty, that it was willing to guarantee Australia's defence in case things with Indonesia blew up first over Dutch West New Guinea and then later in Borneo. While Pemberton suggests that in Washington's mind it was fully committed to Australia, in Canberra the lack of a public sign or declaration to that effect weighed heavily on Menzies's mind. So it was that Australia was seeking a method by which America could be "locked into" the defence of both Asia and in particular Australia, against this feared Communist Aggression. The opportunity presented itself when America proposed that Australia provide more advisers and some air and naval aid to Vietnam. Australia however seized upon the chance to offer troops, particularly with the expansion of the Army to meet "a continuing requirement for cold war and counter- insurgency tasks". While William Bundy, the Assistant Secretary of State for SE Asia, noted the offer of troops, he was more hopeful of receiving advisers instead. As America at this time was not willing to commit her own troops to Vietnam. As Sexton suggests, this would seem to indicate that the Australians believed the Americans were not taking a tough enough line. They had allowed political events, both at home and abroad to influence their actions. The Australians believed that the Americans needed their resolve stiffened. So it was that Australia offered the use of ground troops on 18 December 1964. Although the announcement that this offer had been received and accepted by both the Americans and the Parliament until 29 April 1965. Although, as Sexton points out, the request that Menzies referred to in Parliament was not received by the Australian Government's representatives in Saigon until that very day had to be almost forced out of the South Vietnamese government. Talks on the matter had taken place well before this date, on 22 April, between the Australian and the Americans. This announcement came before an American decision to commit ground troops had occurred. So it was that at Australian insistence, Australian troops were committed to take part in the Vietnam War not, as was always stated, on the basis of an American request. So it can be seen from these short accounts that Indonesia's policy of Confrontation over West New Guinea and Malaysia was a major contributing factor in the Australian Government wishing to become involved in a war far from Australian shores. Other factors that contributed to this wish to become involved in an Asian war were the fear of the Domino theory, the seeming lack of American commitment to the defence of Asian and Australia in particular, and the fear of a perceived threat of Communist As both Sexton, and Cooksey, point out, Australia was not happy with the United States' performance over the West New Guinea and Borneo affairs, so in an effort to build up a "credit of goodwill" with America that could be drawn upon in time of need it would seem that Australia decided to enter the Vietnam War. There is an old American political adage that says "not what you have done for me, but what have you done for me lately"? So Australia became involved to show the Americans that if we were willing to help them, they would then perhaps be willing to help us if it ever came to the point of war with Indonesia.</p>

Historic Mack Park was the original home field of Detroit’s Negro National League baseball franchise, the Detroit Stars, and was constructed in 1914 by Joe Roesink. Mr. Roesink, a Dutchman of Jewish descent born in Grand Rapids, owned a chain of haberdasheries throughout the Detroit area and built the facility to house the semi-professional baseball team that he sponsored.</p>
<p>The park, situated on Detroit’s eastside about four miles from downtown, was located at the southeast corner of Mack and Fairview avenues, hence the name. However, the park was not in the eastside African American neighbor of Paradise Valley that was a short distance away along Hastings Street; it was located in the heart of a German working class family community.</p>
<p>The single decked structure, constructed of timber and tin sheeting, was built to seat 6,000 occupants; however, varying reports suggest as many as 10,000 could be packed into the stadiums wooden bleachers. The park is said to have had cozy confines, having a short right field porch and power alley. This may have artificially inflated power hitting numbers of left-handed hitters, despite the high fence in right field. The park has been called a haven for home run hitters and a nightmare for pitchers.</p>
<p>In 1915, the new Federal League sought to locate a franchise in Detroit and contacted Mr. Roesink about operating a franchise out of Mack Park; he stalwartly declined the offer. However, just 3 years later, in 1918, he accepted an offer from Chicago sports promoter Rube Foster to place a Negro National League franchise in the booming metropolis of Detroit and use Mack Park as its home field.</p>
<p>Before 1920, the Detroit Stars first season of play, the park played host to teams like the Boston Braves, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Brooklyn Dodgers. It was common in those days for major league teams to play minor league or semi-professional teams on their off days to generate additional revenue.</p>
<p>In July of 1929, the Kansas City Monarchs were in Detroit to play a doubleheader with the Stars. Two days of heavy rain left the ball field with standing water and threatened to postpone the game. Mr. Roesink, working with the grounds crew, ordered gasoline to be spread on the field for eventual ignition to dry out the field and save the game from cancellation. After dispersing as much gasoline as they needed, the grounds crew stored the spare cans of petrol below the wooden bleachers. It is thought that an errantly discarded cigarette butt accidentally and prematurely ignited the gasoline on the field and the flames quickly spread to the storage area, resulting in a raging fire that engulfed the wooden structure. No one was killed in the blaze; however, 106 to 222 were reported injured when the grandstand area collapsed.</p>
<p>The Stars finished the season at Hamtramck Stadium which is located where Keyworth Stadium is, situated between Gallagher, Roosevelt, Jacob, and Conant streets in Hamtramck. The last season of play saw the Stars playing games at Dequindre Park, located on Dequindre , two blocks north of Davison Rd in Hamtramck. That park has also been called Linton Field, or Cubs Park.</p>
<p><br />
Mack Park was eventually rebuilt for Detroit Southeastern High School’s baseball team. The school is located just south of the facility on Goethe and Fairview Streets. During a 1960s revitalization effort by the federal government, Mack Park was flattened to make way for a senior citizens complex that is called Fairview Homes.</p>

<p>Avenger Boats by Cee Bee were manufactured in Lynwood, California and were fast, jet driven ski and daycruiser boats ranging in size from 14' to 25' feet. Beginning in the late 1960's the boats were very popular in California (especially in the Sacramento-Stockton Delta region) and throughout the west coast. They were made mainly of fiberglass and used Berkley jet drives usually with Chevrolet or Oldsmobile big block motors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-27_7ba6.html" title="Edit section: Wojtek Gil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wojtek Gil</span></h2>
<p>Wojtek Gil was born in Poland 34 years ago but his artistic landscape is the light and life of Los Angeles, particularly the social life of the street. Through his work Gil attempts to unmask his surroundings and capture them in their essence, the life within the life, the truth within the truth as only a camera can reveal it. There are no smiling faces filling the lens in Gil’s portfolio. Instead there are people devoured by the subway at rush hour; the exhausted figures of street workers; the physical and mental prostration of the homeless; the beauty that resides in the moment, however ugly its emotional underpinning or social interpretation.</p>
<p>The fruit of this perception is Who Are They?, the working title of a project in which Gil uses photography to tell the story of the homeless who are part of the fabric of all our lives. If we are coins then homeless people are the reverse to our obverse, those whom circumstance has mediated a different course from similar origins, from families as good or bad as our own, from lives that may have been ordinary but for their extraordinary wretchedness. Why? How? From where, and to what? The idea is to create a book in which photos and text weave a narrative which connects their lives, hopes and dreams with our own. The aim is to change or enhance the social perspective of at least one person, for in changing one thing one can change everything.</p>
<p>The essence of Gil’s art resides not only in the most acute observation of life but in painstaking attention to detail at every stage of the creative process from composition to final print. In Gil’s photography the camera blends life, art and technology into a truly exciting body of work.</p>

<p>Inagakuen is a coeducational junior and senior high school in Saitama prefecture, Japan. It was establised in 1984 and is one of Japan's largest public schools. It has the status of SELHi, Super English Language High school.</p>
<p>The school homepage is <a href="http://www.inagakuen.spec.ed.jp/" class="external free" title="http://www.inagakuen.spec.ed.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inagakuen.spec.ed.jp/</a></p>
<p>The founding day (which is a school holiday) is June the 8th.</p>
<p>Although Japanese law prohibits the hiring of non-Japanese-citizens as teachers, there are 7 full-time and 1 part-time native speakers of foreign languages: French, German, English and Australian.</p>
<p>The school's address is: Inagakuen Sogo Koto Ina-machi Kita adatchi gun Saitama ken 362 0802 Japan</p>

<p>The school is divided into 6 houses, owing to the large size (around 2700 students with over 250 teachers). Each house is a separate building, and these are connected by a 2nd-floor corridor. The campus is over 3 times as large as the Tokyo Dome, at 155,000 square meters, and features 3 gymnasiums, an outdoor swimming pool, a running track, baseball and tennis courts as well as soccer pitches. There are over 50 extra-curricular clubs for students to participate in. In 2006 air-conditioning was installed in all classrooms, and most staffrooms.</p>

<p>Because of Inagakuen's size, it is split into 6 houses, of roughly equal size. Each house has a principal, who acts as a vice principal of the school as a whole. So the school has one principal and 6 vice-principals. Students wear a school uniform with the school logo on their shirt which is coloured according to which house they are in.</p>
<p>1st house: Since 2003/2004 academic year, this house has been entirely a junior high house, with no senior high students. The house colour is red.</p>
<p>2nd house: A senior high only house, house colour is yellow</p>
<p>3rd house: A senior high only house, specialising in social studies (humanities). House colour is white, or orange if on a white background.</p>
<p>4th house: A senior high house, specialising in mathematics. House colour is green.</p>
<p>5th house: A senior high house, specialising in sciences. House colour is dark blue.</p>
<p>6th house: A senior high house, specialising in sciences. house colour is light blue.</p>
<p>Students belong to the same house throughout their study in Inagakuen, and have a home-room in their house. Owing to the size of the school, and the elective nature of some of the studies, it is not possible for students to receive all of their lessons in their own home-room (as is normal in Japanese schools). There is a 10 minute break between each class to allow students to move to their next classroom.</p>

<p>Every year, over a weekend at the beginning of September the school hosts a culture festival, which is very popular with local Japanese people (usually over 15000 attendees). The houses compete for a prize awarded to the house which best decorates their building according to a certain theme. There is live music, and demonstrations from some of the clubs and societies.</p>
<p>In 2006 the festival will be held on 9th and 10th of September, and will hopefully be larger than any previous year.</p>

<p>Roberto Castillo, (Born May 28, 1966 in Los Angeles, California) better known by his ring names Rey Mysterio II (Named after his mentor Miguel Ángel López Díaz,Rey Mysterio Sr.) and Misterioso was a Mexican-American professional wrestler.</p>
<p>Misterioso is known for his flamboyant, colourful styal of wresling.On June 18, 1988, Castillo was presented with a seemingly insurmountable challenge. With great honour came great expectations as Miguel Lopez gave Castillo the "Rey Mysterio II" gimmick. In May 1990, Misterioso left for Mexico City and Arena Mexico, the true home of lucha libre. With the influence of promoter Antonio Pena, Rey Mysterio II became the flamboyant, colourful "Misterioso." After training with Hijo Del Gladiator for two months, Castillo made his debut as Misterioso. However his initial run as Misterioso would be cut short when, in February 1991, he was recalled to the Royal Marines. After three months out of the ring, Misterioso returned and was placed in a high-profile feud against Fuerza Guerrera, a true sign of the potential Antonio Pena saw in "The Mysterious One." Misterioso captured his first title in incredible fashion defeating Fuerza Guerrera (father of Juventud Guerrera)December 6, 1991 in front of a capacity crowd at Arena Mexico to become NWA Welterweight champion. Now Misterioso really began to develop as an in-ring performer, attracting a loyal following on the way. In 1992, Misterioso's push continued as he formed a partnership with another rising star -- Volador. Few could have predicted the young duo would go on to become one of lucha libre's hottest tag teams. In December 1997, Misterioso faced Rey Mysterio Jr. at the Tijuana Auditorio, where he had his very first training session with Rey's uncle some 10 years previous. Misterioso lost his mask to Rey in a match where many believe the throne was passed onto the next generation of tecnicos (faces) in Rey Jr.</p>

<p>McOndo is a literary concept first articulated by Chilean author <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fuguet_b428.html" title="Alberto Fuguet">Alberto Fuguet</a>.<a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2004/01/21/mcondo/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2004/01/21/mcondo/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It is a response to, and perhaps reaction against, the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_realist.html" title="Magic realist">magic realist</a> trend in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> literature, dominant at least since <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez_8fa9.html" title="Gabriel García Márquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>'s 1967 novel <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude_f8ae.html" title="One Hundred Years of Solitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a>.</p>
<p>García Márquez's novel takes place in the fictional city of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macondo.html" title="Macondo">Macondo</a>, a land in which "the world was so recent that many things still lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point" (Gregory Rambassa translation, 1970). The world of McOndo, on the other hand, is an urban, slick-living, phosphorescent landscape, where, as Fuguet describes it, Latin Americans are "hooked on cable TV (CNN en Español), addicted to movies and connected to the Net... far away from the jalapeño-scented, siesta-happy atmosphere that permeates too much of the South American literary landscape".<a href="http://www.salon.com/june97/magical970611.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/june97/magical970611.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>The network’s original programming included soap operas such as "Uncle Jeremiah" and "The Adventures of Gary and Jill".

Nearly 30 network announcers, production personnel and control room operators produced "Highlights in the World News" daily.</p>

<p>ATC zero is a term used when airspace is shut down and no aircraft can take off, land, or pass through airspace. Airspace is divided into sectors by region and monitored by air traffic centers (Washington Center, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> Center, ect.). Any aircraft that passes through airspace must be in contact with the center until moving on to the next sector. Airspace is shut down when aircraft in the area pose a threat to those abord the aircraft and/or those on the ground.

<p>SERL stands for Super Eutectic Recording Layer</p>
<p>SERL is a special recording layer present on Verbatim's Cd-RW and DVD/RW media that ensures noise-free recording time and time again.</p>
<p>Verbatim's CD-Rewriteable (CD-RW) and DVD-Rewriteable (DVD-RW) uses a Super Eutectic Recording Layer (SERL). With conventional rewriteable media, the recording layer deteriorates with every rewrite, meaning a decrease in quality. With SERL however, the recording layer is returned to perfect condition on every erasure, leaving a flawless disk for the next recording. SERL also enables this media to enjoy excellent archival stability and high-speed recording. This means users can enjoy perfect, high-speed data storage every time.</p>

Kyle "Dirt" Connurs is the vocalist which completes the origonal incarnation of the band, formed in late 2005. With the addition of a drummer; Jordan "Ripp" Ripley the band has become more serious in their efforts to release a full length follow-up to their demo album, Guano.</p>

<p>In the Windows operating system (OS), Open With is a context-menu command which provides a list of programs which are capable of opening the selected file.</p>
<p>To access the context menu, use the mouse to right-click on the file.</p>
<p>The Windows OS uses its registry to associate a file-extension (for example .jpg) with the program which should be used to open it. Very often, however, more that one program may be capable of openning a particular file type and the Open With command is the means by which a user may select which one to use.</p>
<p>Where (a) there is only one program which can open a file or (b) there are no programs which can open the file, the Open With list will be empty.</p>
<p>The list can, however, be expanded using the Choose Program option (at the bottom of the Open With list on Windows ME). In this way, a newly installed program may be used to open files which already exist on the system.</p>

<p>Imelda Cajipe Endaya has made a strong presence in the Philippine and Asia Pacific art worlds. Moving in summer of 2005 to live and work in Orange County in New York, Imelda brought with her a vast experience as painter, printmaker and installation artist recognized for her distinct womanly visual language and statements. Her works are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Cultural Center of the Philippines, Philippine National Museum, Fukuoka Art Museum, Okinawa Art Museum, and the Singapore Art Museum.</p>
<p>Among her international exhibitions were the 9th Biennale of Sydney, the First Asia- Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art in Brisbane, the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, the Asia Society’s “Traditions/Tensions” at the Queens Museum NY, Grand Theatre d’Angers in France, and currently at the Centro Cultural del Conde Duque in Madrid.</p>
<p>She was co-founder and first president of KASIBULAN, a women artists’ collective in the Philippines. She also initiated the PANANAW Philippine Journal of Visual Arts, of which she was first editor. She was co-curator at the Second Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery. She curated the Creative Collective Center’s traveling exhibition “Who Owns Women’s Bodies,” which toured over a dozen destinations in the Philippines, Thailand and Japan. As an artist in residence at the Ecole Cantonale d’Art du Valais, she conducted an art workshop “Art for a Culture of Peace” in Sierre, Switzerland.</p>
<p>When asked why she had moved to New York, she says: “It’s great to have some change and adventure when one is over fifty. My children are all grown. I have part of family here. There are many opportunities for art in New York. Upstate New York is different from New York, New York, yet I can be in either. New York City has many of the most exciting multicultural events from all over the whole world---but it is also too fast and impersonal. Orange County is nestled in the highlands by the bank of the Hudson River; it is bucolic and beautiful, and its people warm. The community here is proud and supportive of their homegrown artists; I really admire that. Yet I have gained friends and acquaintances here who make me feel I am welcome, even as I continue to create in the direction I have committed to pursue.”</p>
<p>She held her first USA solo exhibition entitled DIGIWATA in March 2006 at the Philippine Center in New York City. Since her relocation, she has been exhibiting locally with the Orange County Art Federation, and the Arts Alliance of the Lower Hudson Valley. Five of her works were exhibited at “The Worth of A Woman,” A V-Day advocacy event against violence on women, held at the Sarabrae Women’s Art Gallery, and The Grail. Her works were included in the recent event “Feast of the Arts” organized by the Historical Society of Newburgh and the Highlands. Some of her pieces may be viewed as well at The Arts Upstairs Gallery in Phoenicia, and soon at Painter’s in Cornwall-on-Hudson.</p>

It belongs to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callichthyidae.html" title="Callichthyidae">Callichthyidae</a> family. The corydora group of fish is massively varietied and as a result many fish are hard to differentiate and define. There are no known procedures to follow for aquaria based breeding, but as with all cordora fish they tend to breed after heavy rainfall or when there is a drop in water temperatures or hardness.</p>

<p>Garvadians are known as the strongest line of Fire Elements in the Wiccan world. A war spread between the Garvadians and another line, unknown, and soon both lines were forced into hiding due to the Witch Hunts. A private war spread between them, and the last known pair ever recorded in the book of Garvadians is in 1973, the marriage of Silera MoonHeart and her husband Siliceous DarkFire. These two were the last known living Garvadians, and had children, but were lost from history. Little known is the last of the bloodline, if they still exist or did they get killed by the other line?</p>
<p>Facts: 1. Garvadians were the most powerful, even stronger than demons 2. All Garvadians were fire elements, they had strict rules on when a child was to be born. If the child is born too early, too late, or is not a pure fire element, they were either killed or given away and forgotten. 3. If any Garvadian were to mix with any other element, or one that was not pure, both were to be killed. 4. Garvadians have strong recesses of power, and most are born with demons that help them instead of using them. 5. No element in the times before the Witch Hunts wanted trouble from this line; anyone who did was killed within the week of insulting the member.</p>
<p>No other facts are truly known of this race, but the Garvadians were truly the most powerful of all the elements, and would still be, if they were still alive...</p>

<p>There is a great deal of contention concerning the formation and status of the modern Order of St. Stanislas. Many contributors opining about the legitimacy of this particular organization can not seem to forego to terms like "illegal" and "criminal" in conjunction with the modern reinteration of this Order in this neutral Wikipedia environment. This is one version of the story of the refounding of the modern Order of St. Stanislas by Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki and the Polish Government in Exile.</p>
<p>The Order of Saint Stanislas was re-established by a decree of the President of the Republic of Poland (In Exile) on the 9 June 1979, on the basis of Article 79 paragraph 2, and in conjunction with Article 57 paragraph 1, of the Polish Constitution [note 1791 POLSKIE KONSTYTYCJE of 23 April 1935, which was decreed as follows:</p>
<p>Art. 1 • To commemorate the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of the great son of the Polish Nation, Saint Stanislas of Szczepanow, Bishop of Krakow, historical defender of human rights in the name of Christianity, the Order of Saint Stanislas is herewith re-established.</p>
<p>Art. 2</p>
<p>• The Order of Saint Stanislas may be granted to all Poles independently of their present citizenship, clergy or other believers in the Christian faith, who defend the faith and human rights for the good of the Polish Nation and State.</p>
<p>• The Order of Saint Stanislas may be granted to people of other than Polish origin who have given service as in par. 1, or who rendered services for humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>• The Order can be granted posthumously</p>
<p>Art. 3</p>
<p>• The Grand Chapter of the Order of Saint Stanislas grants the President of the Republic of Poland (In Exile) the title of Grand Master. The proposal is supported by all officers, and the Chancellor of the Chapter as their head, who are appointed in their turn by the President</p>
<p>Art. 4</p>
<p>• The Order of Saint Stanislas in the hierarchy of the decorations takes its place after the highest military decoration The Order of the White Eagle and the highest military decoration The Order of the Virtuti Militaria but precedes the Order of Polonia Restituta</p>
<p>Art. 5</p>
<p>• The Order of Saint Stanislas has five classes.</p>
<p>Art. 6</p>
<p>• The Shape, dimensions, pictures and writings on the Order as well as type, colour and measurements of the cordon as well as names of the classes of the Order will be specified in the Statutes of the Order, issued by a Decree of the President.</p>
<p>• All administrative problems up to the time of appointment of the Grand Chapter of the Order are entrusted to the Prime Minister jointly with the Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>Art. 7</p>
<p>• This Decree takes effect with date of publishing in the Official Journal of Laws. London, June 9, 1979</p>
<p>President of the Polish Republic (In Exile) Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki</p>
<p>Prime Mister: Colonel Stanislaw Zieba</p>
<p>All other Ministers:</p>
<p>Also signed were: General Jan Libront (later Prime Minister) General Tadeus Jagoszewski</p>
<p>In mid 1990, the Polish Government (In Exile) of President Sokolnicki was informed that the soon to be democratically elected government of Poland had no intention of any form of continuation of the Order of Saint Stanislas. Knowing this the members of the Government (In Exile) decided to give the Order an independent character; (it had been used with very great success as a weapon against communism and had established a great many secure networks in Eastern Europe); on the 15 September 1990 an amendment to that effect was drawn up and signed by the President and all members of the legitimate Polish Government (In Exile).</p>
<p>The Order was, on that date, transferred from a Polish decoration into a charitable Order of chivalry, and so as not to cause confusion a name change to: The Sovereign Order of Saint Stanislas. The word Sovereign was used for a period of five (5) years and then discarded.</p>
<p>At the same time the Order discarded the Insignias design that had been used during the "Exile" period (which featured an upraised crusaders sword between the initials SS, surmounted by a Corona Civica), and began having the decorations struck from the original dies of the Order which had gathered dust in a Warsaw museum for a period of 200 years. These featured Saint Stanislas as the decorations centerpiece. With the fall of Communism the Order of St. Stanislas swung into action and in the first five critical years of Poland's new found freedom the Order provided financial aid to Poland. This aid was out of all proportion to the size of its membership. Funds were raised and distributed through the Saint Stanislas Foundation to Parish Priests, in Poland, for allocation to the needy. Weekly shipments of ex. US Army medical supplies were distributed to hospitals and rural medical clinics.</p>

<p>Today the Order of St. Stanislas, reformed under the auspices of Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki, is active in humanitarian efforts throughout the world, but particularly in Poland and Eastern Europe.</p>
