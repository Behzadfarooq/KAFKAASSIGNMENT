<dd><b>Comment</b>: I nominated this article because that's all he is: a former mayor of a mid-sized city. There's nothing notable about him otherwise (attracting an unaffiliated low minor baseball team?). This nom isn't about the worthiness of the City of Lancaster or the verifiability(?) of his former position. He's just a guy who was a mayor once. I don't him being anywhere close to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 18:00, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You really think it's possible to be the mayor of a mid-sized city for six years and not do anything? Come on. The article itself spells out several accomplishments, and it's easy to find more. He was a WWII pilot who survived for 4 months behind enemy lines after being shot down over Germany, and was finally captured and held in a POW camp before escaping in 1945. He also wasn't elected out as mayor: he resigned so he could serve as Pennsylvania’s adjutant general. He easily passes WP:BIO. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:18, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>You really think it's possible to be the mayor of a mid-sized city for six years and not do anything</i>: Yes I do. Quick what's the mayor of Toledo done in his term? Who knows and who cares outside of Toledo. My point is being a mayor shouldn't be an automatic notability qualification. With that said: the sum of all the tidbits you unearthed makes a rather interesting fellow. Too bad the article in its current state doesn't reflect that. I change my vote to <b>needs work</b>. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 20:46, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you think the mayor of a city of 650,000 people just sits around in a sash that says "MAYOR" on it and gives oversized novelty souvenir keys to visiting superheroes, you're wrong. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carty_Finkbeiner_1b10.html" title="Carty Finkbeiner">current mayor of Toledo</a> has an article which lists quite a few accomplishments and controversies, including overseeing Toledo's larlgest building boom in history. He's so popular with voters that, since by law he can't serve 3 consecutive terms, he sat out for a term and got re-elected for a third term afterwards. Just think: as mayor of a city of 650,000 people, how many people know his name? How many times has he been mentioned in the newspaper? How many times has he been on the front page? How big a section will he get in local history books? How many people work for the city, and thus directly or indirectly work for him? How many billions of dollars of public funds does he manage? How many streets, bridges, and buildings are named after him? How many people, every day of their lives, are effected one way or another by the decisions he makes in office? And after all that, think again whether he's worth a kilobyte or two of article space on Wikipedia. The answer, I would think, should be obvious. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> endorses "Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage". I haven't checked, but I would imagine a mayor would have significant press coverage at least during his term in office. He's also a member of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs’ Hall of Fame. He was also a Major General, which to me, is significant in and of itself. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not arguing this particular article anymore. I've been convinced. There's more to him than this article states. As far as "major local political figures": I guess I don't interpret that the same as you. To me that means a political figure of a major municipality OR a local politician that through some news event (positive or negative) has transcended their local sphere of influence. I don't feel the need to write up articles about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ttb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22juanita+crabb%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ttb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22juanita+crabb%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Juanita Crabb</a> or other <a href="http://www.newschannel34.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=D24773A2-53D8-428F-A9A0-679398A15949" class="external text" title="http://www.newschannel34.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=D24773A2-53D8-428F-A9A0-679398A15949" rel="nofollow">former mayors</a> of my hometown. Starblind what city are we talking about? Nether Lancaster or Toledo is anywhere near 650k. If you feel like continuing this dicussion, lets please find a different forum. I'm sure the AFD watchers are getting tired of this.

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo%2C_Ohio_6371.html" title="Toledo, Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a> article cites a metro area population of 659,188. I'm glad you've been convinced of Scott's notability. Oh, and one last thing: the "major local political figures" part of WP:BIO doesn't apply here: it's from the section on living persons, while Scott has been dead since January 2005. With that said, I'll let this rest, but if anyone wants to discuss further my talk page is always open. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:53, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
