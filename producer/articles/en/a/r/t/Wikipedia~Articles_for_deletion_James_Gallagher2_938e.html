<p>This page was created as part of a thorough cycle of pages providing information to citizens regarding elected officials in the state of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> as part of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_New_Jersey_9110.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject New Jersey">Wikipedia:WikiProject New Jersey</a>. As part of expanding articles about New Jersey's 21 Counties, information regarding Freeholders has been added, including pages for individual members of the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_8cf8.html" title="Board of Chosen Freeholders">Board of Chosen Freeholders</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Executive_577e.html" title="County Executive">County Executive</a>. Pages have been created for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County%2C_New_Jersey_6a2d.html" title="Bergen County, New Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a> Freeholders and have been created for five of seven of those in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passaic_County%2C_New_Jersey_b280.html" title="Passaic County, New Jersey">Passaic County, New Jersey</a>. Pages for each municipality in each County will have information added regarding their local officials, including Freeholders (see <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringwood%2C_New_Jersey_1104.html" title="Ringwood, New Jersey">Ringwood, New Jersey</a> for an example). Pages have also been created for every one of the 40 members of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Senate_cf55.html" title="New Jersey Senate">New Jersey Senate</a> and are well underway for the 80 members of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_General_Assembly_df12.html" title="New Jersey General Assembly">New Jersey General Assembly</a>. Freeholders are elected officials who serve in districts far larger than the 120 members of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Legislature_04e0.html" title="New Jersey Legislature">New Jersey Legislature</a>. This is <b>NOT</b> being done on a "completely random" basis and while it may be irrelevant to many, is of importance to every resident of New Jersey. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, important to citizens of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and a project with plenty of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Wikipedia%7EDepth_4804.html" title="Wikipedia:Depth">Depth</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:45, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>lol, how did I know - *know* - Kappa would vote to keep this&#160;;)&#160;? The Troll will be next. Anyway, to me this reads like a personal CV, complete with redolent hyperbole (<i>vast</i> public service, <i>proud</i> parent - as opposed to all those ashamed ones out there); I say <b>Delete</b> since this is a classic, straight up, textbook example of a vanity page and I highly doubt that such officials are important to <i>every resident of New Jersey</i> considering that barely a fifth of them bother to show up and vote in these elections (probably less). The remarks above from <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> are chilling insofar as it looks like waves of self-authored New-Jersey-Minor-Public-Officialdomcruft is coming down the pipeline. Draw the line here! <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 16:01, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You *knew* I would vote keep because I vote keep on everything I consider the users would hope to be able to look up, which is what they are paying for. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:12, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>One of the reasons that "barely a fifth of them bother to show up and vote" for these "New-Jersey-Minor-Public-Officialdomcruft" is that residents don't know who they are. Every two-bit musician with a demo disk, every professional wrestler and bit-character on a TV show has a page. The bar ought to be set far higher in justifying deletion of a page for officials elected at this level. 31,940 registered voters in Passaic County -- more than any of the five other candidates -- voted in favor of Mr. Gallagher in the 2003 election. So far, one aggrieved Wikipedian has voted against. I'd say the people have spoken. Empower citizens instead of trying to keep them uninformed and then maybe they will show up at the next election. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per contributor. Gallagher is Deputy Director, the second highest ranking elected official in a county of nearly 500,000 residents and served in the recent past as Director, the highest ranking official. This is not an isolated random page, but part of a coordinated and thorough effort to provide relevant information to New Jersey residents regarding their elected officials, with details already added to approximately 70 of the 566 pages of New Jersey's municipalities. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:17, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> You win or get appointed to muncipal position or higher, that's enough for me for at least a mention in a more general article. Just make this one sound a little less like a resume.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is an encyclopedia, not a who's who book. You should have to do something truly significant to be included. Wikipedia can cover less notable figures than other encyclopedias, but there's a limit.
