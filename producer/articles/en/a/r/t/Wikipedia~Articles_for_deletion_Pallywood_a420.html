<dd>Thanks to everyone who's contributed to this discussion. I thought I'd respond to some of the points that have been raised.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It appears that the term "Pallywood" comes from a short amateur film by a Richard Landes. It's self-produced and distributed from <a href="http://www.seconddraft.org/movies.php" class="external text" title="http://www.seconddraft.org/movies.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on a website by an anonymous person or organisation (see <a href="http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php" class="external free" title="http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php</a> ). The website is patently not a reliable source. The film doesn't meet any of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28films%29_a836.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (films)">Wikipedia:Notability (films)</a> - I've not found any reviews of it from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, though it's mentioned in a university newspaper at <a href="http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2005/09/23/News/Boston.U.Professor.Claims.Media.staged.Footage.Of.Middle.East.Conflict-1560107.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2005/09/23/News/Boston.U.Professor.Claims.Media.staged.Footage.Of.Middle.East.Conflict-1560107.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>The term itself is a neologism. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> applies: "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term."
<ul>
<li>Jjay cites some sources at <a href="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?as_q=pallywood&amp;num=30&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ldate=&amp;as_hdate=&amp;lr=&amp;as_src=&amp;as_price=p0&amp;as_scoring=" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?as_q=pallywood&amp;num=30&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ldate=&amp;as_hdate=&amp;lr=&amp;as_src=&amp;as_price=p0&amp;as_scoring=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Of the 26 items listed, many appear to be blogs; some are press releases; some aren't even in English; and the only one which actually defines the term (as opposed to merely using it) seems to be a <i>Toronto Star</i> article of Aug. 31, 2006 which says: "Right-wing bloggers have dubbed that [alleged media manipulation] "Pallywood.""</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Chrislk02 has pointed out, the vast majority of the article's content is someone's OR. If the OR, non-RS and non-notable content is removed from the article, there is literally nothing left to keep.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b>, in fact, i think <b>Hezbollywood</b> should not have been deleted either but obviously some people don't appreciate it when they get caught lying. evidence for widespread use can be easily found if one was to not act naive and blind at the same time... also there is barely any relation to the world wide scandal from the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_jenin.html" title="Battle of jenin">battle of jenin</a> controversy and the footage from the second intifada and the 2006 israel-hizbullah conflict.

<p>It appears that only a few of the references have anything to do with pallywood, and from what I can find it is mostly related to an article or something created by a professor Richard Landes. Overall, it mostly appears to be originial research and ,my nomination is delete. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 01:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, except for one case (about Richard Landes) all of your examples actually disprove the case you are trying to make. These are all about largely dissimilar media events that are alleged to be hoaxes and fabrications. The irony is breathtaking - you engage in fabrication to prove that there is no fabrication, and then label the view opposite of yours as "original research." --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What I am saying is that the numerous articles that have no mention of pallywood constitue originial research. Sure, they may be involved with what the article is talking about, but the connection is made by the wikipedia editor, not the author of the article. This is orignial research on the part of the editor who makes the leap. If the articles contained something explaning pallywood and its connection, then it would not be. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In retrospect, upon google search, i think that fauxtography and pallywood (200,000 hits) should stay while hizbollywood should have gone (only 500 finds on google) - the reasoning to remove because people title the subject matter "pallywood" and don't repeat that word inside the article is quite silly in my own opinion - here's a sample article: <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/6685" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsbusters.org/node/6685" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>I am slighly confused as to what you mean when you say, "the reasoning to remove because people title the subject matter "pallywood" and don't repeat that word inside the article is quite silly in my own opinion". There are many articles on a topic that may or may not relate to pallywood. That is not for you or I to decide in the context of the article. A majority of articles used as sources may describe something similar to pallywood etc etc. The fact is, they DO NOT MENTION IT, and it is therefore orignial research to make the conecntion yourself. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 15:39, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact is, that most people reffering to admitted fake photography and alleged fake photography by palestinians is using the term in some way or another as a descrpitive term to "the pallywood movie industry". either in the tag words of his article or in the actual text body. your "rant" about original research is on it's own some type of manipulation and feels like you cannot admit that the term is indeed prominent enough to get it's own atricle... please explain to me for example why you feel that the movie "jenin jenin" does not fall under the term <b>"admitted stagings"</b>... i'm pointing this out because your representation on the subject matter as if this article must have the word "pallywood" inside it is POV at best and Attempted Vandalism at worst.

<dd>yOU CLAIM, "that most people reffering to admitted fake photography and alleged fake photography by palestinians is using the term in some way or another as a descrpitive term to "the pallywood movie industry"". If this were true, the sources above would mention it. However you dice it, making the conncetion yourself is orignial research. Sure, it may be black and white in your eyes but, then again if we all wrote what we thought was black and white wikipedia would be filled with innacurate POV articles. I am not disputing that the content is not valid or the concept is not real, I however am challening the name that has been created and this article. There are actually arguments here that the content is already included in other articles and this is just a neoligism. I agree with this because none of the news stories above mention the term and the leap is made that each of these stories or incidents is related to pallywood when the only connection was made by a wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 16:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>source above is an article about admitted staging about jenin (see: <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenin_massacre.html" title="Jenin massacre">jenin massacre</a>), the term is therefore not needed in the article where muhamad bakri admits his complicity in fraud since his is a single production within' the industry. i guess we shall remain without an agreement but i tend to think it's either because you don't know the subject matter or for other less noble reasons.

The simple fact is, the connection between the term pallywood and most of the references above (considering the term is not in the article) is originial research, plain and simple. I am not arguing the validity of the content, it may be true, I am arguing that the term pallywood is neologism that does not warrant inclusion in wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Resetting indent) The term "Pallywood" refers to allegations that news events are staged for the benefit of the Palestinian side in the conflict, and then reported as "real" news. All the references illustrate this, whether or not they invoke the term "Pallywood." There is no question "Pallywood" refers to this phenomenon, and no question that the references discuss it. The connection is self-evident, so the OR accusation is unjustified. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I agree with Chris' reasoning for the article being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> but regardless, I don't think that a lack of good references is a good reason to delete an article. How about you give the editors some time to produce good references that satisfy all parties and then re-nominate it? From my experience, the term is notable (and google supports that). <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 19:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I respect everybodys opinions, and the term may be somewhat notable. Should there be sources that are added that make the conenction in the source, I would not adverse to changing my <b>Oppose</b> nom to a <b>Support</b>. However, I still stand by the fact that making the leap that the articles are related to the phenomenon without an assertion of such in the article is orignial research. I can describe a boy to you. You may see a tall, muscular figure that appears to be a boy and you automatically assume it is the boy. If the person comes to you and says they are a boy, that is a different story. However, until such an assertion is made, it is realy just a guess or you making the connection in your head, which is what orignial research is. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case, anyone on wikipedia who hasn't been quoted as saying he is a boy (or the fact that he is a boy hasn't been said about him) cannot be described as a boy in every article. I do not see that as the case on wikipedia, although I'm more than happy to be enlightened. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 19:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess the boy example is a much more simplified version for the sake of demonstrating what I mean. I have attempted to explain why it is originial research but nobody seems to understand that, unless the article claims that it is related to pallywood, you, the writer, make the connection. Will you not agree with that? That 7 out of the 9 articles listed above make no mention of the term pallywood? They may describe a phenomenon similar or exactly the same as pallywood however, you are making that connection. That is why it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, if any of those articles stated something like, "this incident, related to the pallywoodmovement was blah blah and blah", I would have no problem at all. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So out sounds like you have no quarrel with an article about the (alleged) phenomenon, but only with whether the term Pallywood is the right short-hand term for the phenomenon? In that case, you should vote to rename it, possibly with a redirect, no? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 21:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
